the roman empire gets divided vertically rather than horizontally how does history change
  the green colored part got rekt maybe the minor asia red colored part too
  this makes no fucking sense
the northern half collapses within 50 years because it has very little wealth and faces almost all of the various barbarians literally only the persians threaten the southern half more
  your mom fucks slightly less black men
which one would be the real rome then
imagine the headaches the guy in charge of the frontier stretching all the way across europe would get
a vertical divide of the roman empire  what type of measles vaccination extra chromosome extracellular brain fluid lack of oxygen to the womb induced autistic spectromatic mentally ill retardation is this
  this is a horizontal division you moron
  hard to say ask an american i heard it went swell for them
  what year does this happen in regardless everybody in red starves to death or is killed when the urban population riots without egypt/africa to fuel the grain dole
  this op is a retard
be shitler  claim to fight international jewry  capture 3 three rotschilds   do absolutely nothing to them
  we already have a thread for this  
when did hating germans become a meme on /his/
loving the germans is the meme  hating them is knowing history
  about 5 minutes after the stormfags and wehraboos invaded
moralistic workdrones who trade their human faculties their individualism for vague notions of productivity  whats not to hate   reminder that the germs greatest critics are themselves german
 is the given excuse but in reality its just /int/ shitposting without grzegorz and/or pierre having a flag attached to their posts
  its a combination of leftypol raids and polish butthurt
start shit since antiquity  they dindunuffinen sie sind gut boyz
fuck these disgusting krauts who suck ahmed and jewish pig cocks
  its not a meme the day of the rope is coming for germans they should be butchered for food and stuffed with kraut and pork and eaten on an open fire have a big bbq serving german flesh
  this the only germs i love are germs that hate germany
ever since we all started dating jewish girls
  its mostly just /int/posters using /his/ as a proxy this is why the never respond when you point how terribly wrong they are about something lol
  unironically when 4channel was born
  shitting on wehraboos isnt hating on germans or limited to leftypol
  fpbp
  when i saw this
  when /pol/ inserted themselves here and began spreading pangermanic propaganda everywhere   defending every german war crime while celebrating german militarism and expansionism like typical wehraboo   lying over historical facts like wehraboo and holocaust deniers   obsessing over muh borders of grossgermania and muh germanic a e s t h e t i c s   being ridiculous germanophiles to the point of celebrating everything german especially germanic ubermensch semen in their mouth   pushing german superiority on every anon on this board and daming every other people like slavs and jews to death just to praise hitler and larp as neetsoc hero   and finally but no least crying over their historical idol failing over every abhorrent ambition they tried to achieve while being crushed miserably and blaming whole world for this    basically day 1
  when nongermans started blaming merkel and germany for the migrant crisis basically misplaced bigotry
  /pol/ shits on germans all the time
  i had no idea merkel is a dictator for life
  /pol/ shits on germans post1945  /pol/ would beg any pre1945 german ubermench to fuck their mothers and sisters and let them clean afterwards just to wear some epic style uniforms and larp like natsoc hero
aryans hate the jews because they deem them more powerful    slavic eurotrash countries apply this logic to germany    end of story
well their whole history is basically wars genocides looney racist theories and medical experiments on humans there is nothing likeable there
  frogs are all cryptokikes sorry m8
  it never was a meme hns
  iranians dont hate jews
  germans and yids are the same when slavic national uprisings happened they also attacked the ashkenazim jews because they realized they belong to grman culture
  dude dont work towards anything lmao  you laugh cuz ur different i laugh cuz ur all the same tips fedora    hi leftypol
  slavs are aryan germans are judeogermanic trash
  germans  aryan  lmao
  most obnoxious base supporters   reading history the one constant truth is germans are savages from caesar to ww2  most horrific crimes against humanity happened under germans   germans constantly deny their guilt and pretend everyone was the same  this board has a lot of people from areas where their nations fought against germans so the old propaganda is still strong   recent migration crisis flamed the sleeping hatred of germans
  the only correct answer so far
even germans really hate germans these days     were like this simpsons scots meme
in october 2001 two israeli men were detained in the mexico city congress building carrying weapons and explosives presumably trying to blow up the building     thoughts        
someone supposedly tried to blow up a political building  how is this weird or is it cause theyre jews
  one was an israeli national in mexico illegally     exactly one month after 9/11    absolutely zero news coverage of the event in the united states    weird
  the usa that has bigger concerns after the largest terrorist attack in its history  is shockingly not interested in some random jew trying to blow up a building in mexico  damn what a fucking shocker its almost like by writing about 9/11 muslims and what dubya thinks will get you more sales than attempted bombing at mexico
  you are really dumb
  very compelling argument
2001 was 25 years ago  read the sticky then delete your thread it is in clear violation
  there is nothing to argue your post is evidence of your stupidity
  yyoure wrong cause what you wrote a dumdum  riveting indeed master debater
  there was another involving sears tower and a bridge near a naval base in washington and another involving a nuclear reactor either in florida or the middleeast i actually cannot find the links to those stories anymore idk if its my own laziness or if rense and others had the pages pulled from google
  the others werent carrying explosives
  l a b o m b a    
  your anger has ratted you out no neutral person would be this upset this esrly on in the thread
  i would need to actually see links to the original news reports and the sears tower incident was more scoping out security weakpoints nuclear reactor was like box cutters and equipment for breaching into sensitive areas bainbridge island or whatever was just suspicious truck with israeli national if you want to disabuse me of my confusion just link me to the articles anon otherwise i cant really discuss it much further
  oy vey ive been caught
  i cant find them either but its from what i remember
  are you saying that americans are too stupid to see the relevance of this case and thats why it wasnt covered  or are you being that stupid to actually think it was actually irrelevant
  the articles all seem to have been removed or the links are broken theres actually a lot more incidents than that but in all of them they just find video footage of sensitive sites or trucks that set off alarms with bomb sniffing dogs its extremely suspicious
  theres nothing to see goyim delete your thread
  all the news thats fit to print this is most certainly fit to print
bump
great care must be taken to civilise the ancient families by having the sons of the chief of them bred up in england even at the charge of the crown when they have not wherewithal out of their own estate to do it by which means they will have greater dependence on the crown and by degrees be weaned from their natural hatred against the english be more civilised and learn to improve their estates by making plantations and improving their land as the english and scots have done wheresoever they have settled this with the charge the crown should be at in setting up schools to teach the children of the old natives english would by degrees wear out the irish language which would be for the advantage of the body of the inhabitants whether new or old and would contribute much to lessen the animosities that are amongst them    it is not safe to let any of the natives of ireland be governors of these above named places nor to have any troops in them but english scots or strangers not to tempt temper and easily led by their chiefs and clergy and bear with great impatience the english yoke and one cannot beat it into their heads that several of the os and macks who were forfeited for rebelling in king james is time and before ought to be kept out of their estates and will always be ready to rise in arms against the english and endeavour to bring in strangers to support them and to please the nobility and gentry and chief of clans it will be necessary to have several regiments of the natives but let them serve in england scotland and elsewhere no native to be lord lieutenant nor no englishmen that has an estate in that kingdom or great relations there to be changed every three years to buy no land there        why do people believe that james ii or the stuarts were proirish
  because the english think all papists are in conspiracy
  jews
  because restoring the stuarts would have been politically advantageous to ireland after the dutch fuck came in the irish had james ii by the balls during the williamite years after he got kicked from britain they forced him to restore lands to the natives and to promise the right of selfdetermination to the irish parliament that all fell apart when the war was lost however  ireland wasnt in a good place under the stuarts but it was a hell of a lot better than the protestant monarchs to come    because he deserted his irish supporters james ii became known in ireland as séamus an chaca or james the shit
  long live bonnie prince charlie
  how is any of that antiirish
  hardly any puritans in england now they mostly upped and left for the americas plenty of scottish and ulster scots presbyterians stuck around and they wont shut the fuck up about popish plots
  the irony when scots support the definition of a tory
  raising sons of irish nobles in england to anglicise them  destroying the irish language  forbidding the irish to guard or govern major irish towns and cities  no irish native is allowed to be lord lieutenant of ireland
  that assumes he would have kept his promises especially as this was written in 1690 while he was in ireland
  yes this was after successive attempts to marry into irish nobility and bring irish nobility into the political fold they had tried for centuries like they tried with the scots to bring them in as far back as the anglosaxon centuries the viking kingdoms and finally the normans    they tried to give the irish a seat at the table with the potential the likely potential that a descendent of the irish high king would one day sit the throne of england but the irish were developmentally retarded and stubborn having had little contact or exposure to the outside world bar britain itself for 8000 years    so they kept chimping out and tarding out until everyone had had enough and realized what they were dealing with a large tribe of backwards paleskins more primitve and dated than the celts of yore
  they wont shut the fuck up about popish plots  this is something i can never understand every protestant country in the world was at one point catholic it makes even less sense for anglicans since they have a head of church too
  the most ridiculous claim i ever heard was during the scottish indyref when ulstermen called the breakup of the union as a popish plot as if scotland leaving the uk would somehow put it under the influence of the papacy again scotland is more protestant than the uk on the whole so itd be the last country to fall under the influence of the pope    the secondmost ridiculous claim from the same people would be regarding northern ireland reunifying with the roi makes more sense given the roi is majority catholic but theyre catholic in the same way most euros are christian they dont actually do religion are you telling me a country which voted to legalise gay marriage and abortion is under the influence of the pope well francis perhaps
  this post started normal until you made your bait too obvious allow me to try anyways for the benefit of anyone unfamiliar with irish history who might take your shitpost seriously    yes  do you really not see why essentially banning people from their own language religion and right to govern to their homes would be considered antiirish its like claiming that kulturkampf wasnt antipolish    this was after successive attempts to marry into irish nobility and bring irish nobility into the political fold  except for the fact that they were doing the exact opposite for centuries henry ii fired the first lord lieutenant of ireland because he had married a daughter of the high king the statutes of kilkenny later forbid any marriage between norman/english settlers with the native irish    like they tried with the scots  they didnt try shit the scottish king inherited the throne of england and scotland itself only fell in after they bankrupted themselves trying to steal land from spain    that a descendent of the irish high king would one day sit the throne of england  which happened every single english monarch since the stuarts has had irish blood in them the stuarts were descended from the ulster nobility that had conquered pictland being 1/128 irish didnt make a damn bit of difference to anyone    having had little contact or exposure to the outside world bar britain itself  which is an outright lie irish monks founded monasteries all over europe and were very active in converting the continent even before christianity the irish were involved in worldly affairs serving as mercenaries in the roman army and having at least one reported raid over the alps    that last paragraph  and this is where you outed yourself ulsteranon you really cant keep a lid on your emotional state for more than a paragraph
  serving as mercenaries in the roman army and having at least one reported raid over the alps  we wuz romans
  and the irish were violently hostile and had actively attempted to genocide protestants not long before if they were given an ounce of power they would immediately set about using it to destabilize the country    imagine if reading through someones resume they had good credentials but at the bottom under hobbies and interests it said as soon as it is within my power i will fucking kill you would you hire them
  every protestant country in the world was at one point catholic  not america
  and this is where you outed yourself ulsteranon  nah my ancestors left ulster and went to appalachia
  trying to culturally unify the two countries is oppression
what if you could only save one
saving roasties  they all deserved what they got
  who is 4
  sic semper roastus
  yeah im gonna need a quick rundown on all of them
  based on the ones i know the first as it was such a horrific abhorent torture

  who is furthest on the right
    going from left to right  1 junko furuta  killed by yakuza raped and tortured for a month or so before put into a barrel of cement  2 tatiana nikolaevna of russia  second daughter of czar nicholas the second of russia murdered by bolsheviks  3 anne frank  you know who she is  4 sylvia likens   16 year old girl from indiana that was abused and murdered by her step mother  5 kitty genovese  28 year old italian american girl that was murdered in new york while dozens of people watched killing was highly publicized and lead to the creation of the concept of the bystander effect in psychology
  based death to all enemies of the toiling masses
  thanks
  im guessing that you either picked anne frank or kitty genovese
  marry tatiana  fuck sylvia  murder the jew
  fuck marry gas kill kill while everyone watches
  28 year old italian american girl that was murdered in new york while dozens of people watched    thats bullshit though    genovese ran toward the front of the building and moseley ran after her overtook her and stabbed her twice in the back genovese screamed oh my god he stabbed me help me several neighbors heard her cry but only a few of them recognized the sound as a cry for help when robert mozer one of the neighbors shouted at the attacker let that girl alone23 moseley ran away and genovese slowly made her way toward the rear entrance of the building24 seriously injured and out of view of any witnesses23    out of view of the street and of those who may have heard or seen any sign of the initial attack moseley stabbed genovese several more times before raping her stealing 49 from her and running away again23 the attacks spanned approximately half an hour and knife wounds in genoveses hands suggested that she attempted to defend herself from him a neighbor sophia farrar found her shortly after and held her in her arms25    records of the earliest calls to police are unclear and were not given a high priority one witness said his father called the police after the initial attack and reported that a woman was beat up but got up and was staggering around26
  a 2004 article in the new york times by jim rasenberger published on the 40th anniversary of genoveses murder raised numerous questions about claims in the original times article a 2007 study found many of the purported facts about the murder to be unfounded6970 stating there was no evidence for the presence of 38 witnesses or that witnesses observed the murder or that witnesses remained inactive8    fun fact the murderer only died two years ago

  junko  what happened to her made me sick
  holy shit just read katies page this guy was a fucking crazy psychopath      id say junko because she honestly had it the worse
  none because what happened was gods will
  this   second would be sylvia the online pictures of her corpse with im a prostitute and proud of it written on her belly is absolutely depressing  disgusting kind of evil not even cool kind of evil
  was probably all fueled by a meth binge the worse part is the lack of consequence the perpetrators suffered
obviously tatiana
  sylvia or kitty
  junko or sylvia
  28 year old  girl
kittys the cutest but shes a lesbian so she wouldnt have sex with me    concrete girl is kinda ugly desu    so are notanastasia and literally who    gonna have to go with anne
junko 100
    good choice
one of the assailants of junko was recently arrested again
  2ch says theyre never gonna release him anymore because of his previous charges and most likely be sentenced to death
  why is it my job to save anyone save yourselves
  junko wasnt a roastie at least not until she was almost dead

  this post put a smile on my face thank you for making my day
  i wouldnt    this
  based nipanons
  junko furuta  simply because she suffered the fucking most unlike other thots who were gunshot or died of typhus

  one to the right looks like merula snyde

  junko turns him down because he isnt an 8 foot tall mega chad  dies for being a chad slut
  imagine being the yakuza and your sons being continiously btfo by 2chan anons
  turning down an incel is roastie behavior 101
        be cannibal murderer  get slap on the wrist and become minor celebrity who makes a living on their crime because you didnt kill any japanese people so they think its endearing  why is japanese culture so fucked up
  incel quote  you deserve what you are
  i thought the murderers were yakuza and other bad bois gangsters are hardly incels anon
    say that to my face motherfucker not online see what happens
  kinda wish a punisher like figure to hunt them down
  who
    this
    good choice
    whichever one i can save the most easily breaking into a concentration camp and fighting through the ss guards or fighting through a gang of yakuza is way too hard for just me so i guess anne and junko are out of the question
  so then its a question of sylvia or kitty
  white knighting for a dead girl anonymously  thats actually super cringe

  your average beta shutin incel etc arent actually physically repulsive they just have way too much shit in their head to ever be ok with the idea that people want to have sex with them  i wouldnt quite say women are all roasties who only fuck chad but this is also deluded    the kind of guy fucking  is part of the same ingroup though poor and from some ghetto or trailer park he socialized daily all his life he can approach her and know just what to say with the right body language it will all be instant smiles she will feel comfortable and think he is fun he is her idea of a potential boyfriend    now compare this with someone socially alienated for years his friends will be like him or friends that just barely tolerate him he might be invited to drinks after work but not a proper party he wont be fun because he doesnt have the same tastes he will be a creepy outsider wherever he goes even if he puts on a good act people will subtley notice the differences likewise he wont have much in common with her it would be a miracle if they clicked and still hed be competing with guys better than him    on top of this feminists want to dump more restrictions on substandard men that only deepen their exclusion about half of people didnt meet their partner at a place you expect to hook up yet they are told just talking to a woman in any other place is harassment the message is clear you just want to get rid of them because they are a little socially awkward and these are all just excuses you separate men into normal and creeps and accuse the latter of being potential sexual predators when they have the gall to act like a normal guy hitting on a chick the shit in their head didnt come out of nowhere

reminder that theodora literally tried to make a monophysite a pope even though justinian was adamantly opposed to monophysites
  theoroda didnt give a shit about protecting christianity her people or anything she decided it was better to die rich and powerful than it was to live on the run as a vanquished commoner    so she forced her husbands hand to action

why is male circumcision praised as hygienic  attractive but female circumcision is scorned as barbaric
  the jews
  this basically       however when your girl gives birth you can ask them to give her a couple more stitches to tighten her up some
  why is male circumcision praised as attractive  aesthetics are arbitrary and subjective personally i think its more attractive
  because nobody cares about what happens to males
theyre two very different things
    one is practiced by jews and the other by muslims
  and one typically refers to the removal or mutilation of the clit which serves a very different function than the foreskin
  muslims do both
  they both make sex more pleasurable
  oy vey goy you cant say that  shut it down
  women proof   mutilated penis is aesthetically better than nonmutilated ones therefore im going to torture my son just like his father and his grandfather before him in order to satisfy my big ego since i never ever have to suffer from such treatments so i really dont care what will happen to him
  i am good other is bad  on a different note religions that support circumcision are a crime against humanity   t circumcised jew
  what
  because muh religion pretty much    the hygienic properties are pretty meh too since they are avoided with a bar of soap  why it would be considered attractive is nuts    in short both practices are rooted in religious belief and are pretty stupid  the bigger reason why female genital mutilation is considered worse since it is rooted in gender inequality though both procedures basically destroy a part of sexual organs nerve endings
  because the clitoris is the female glans and is the source of the most common female orgasm the foreskin has about the same sensitivity as your elbow and is a pathway for disease which has been proven to significantly diminish when excised from the penis if you cut off a womans clit its hard for her to orgasm if you cut off a foreskin he can still cum jerk off and now is less likely to give someone a uti or hiv the fact that not a single person here can cite a peer reviewed study showing theyre remotely similar is all the evidence you need to see that white supremacists are emotional children who shouldnt be trusted outside of calling niggers dumb and pointing out democracy does not work
female circumcision controls female libido to responsible levels and its just cleaner
  female circumcision / clitorectomy
  it usually does fren
nobody sees circumcision as attractive outside of america
  nope
  only in murrica
  the foreskin has about the same sensitivity as your elbow  ive never seen someone orgasm or get aroused from rubbing their elbow
  it empirically demonstrably does usually involve partial or total removal of the clitoris
  if you cut off a foreskin he can still cum jerk off and now is less likely to give someone a uti or hiv
  different anon but hes right in southeast asia they dont usually remove the clitoris
no 5748193  guaranteed replies
  hes probably american or has read one of the several propagandistic studies about the subject
  youre irredeemably stupid and guillible and i have no sympathy for whatever kikes do to you and your race knowing that you were the footsoldiers of germanigger ignorant chimping 80 years ago    in africa it absolutely does involve removal of the clitty its done explicitly to reduce female pleasure which nicking the hood or labia is hardly going to achieve
  toa toa man
  why is male circumcision praised as hygienic  attractive  in a very small and specific part of the world mind you its considered barbaric in pretty much all of the west outside of the us
  even in major parts of the rest of the world it is consider to be barbaric
why is male circumcision praised as hygienic  attractive  this is what amerimutts actually believe
  inside the us it is
  youre irredeemably stupid and guillible and i have no sympathy for whatever kikes do to you and your race knowing that you were the footsoldiers of germanigger ignorant chimping 80 years ago  how are nazis relevant here does criticizing circumcision make you antisemitic or a nazi
  the foreskin has about the same sensitivity as your elbow  stopped reading there
  all of the west outside of the us  porn has normalized circumcision most girls you ask prefer circumcised dicks   t portugoose
  jewish lies
women are wonderful effect
    you could put a little more effort in schlomo
  social norms are arbitrary
  the foreskin has about the same sensitivity as your elbow
mutilate girls  fucking monsterous  mutilate boys  meh suck it up are you a man or what
both are shit and should be banned but female circumsion usually involves cutting off more of the relevant stuff than male circumsion and theres no case where doing it has any benefit at all i still think that its retarded and barbaric to circumcise every male baby by default like jews or americans do but at least male circumsion can be used as a practical medical operation to ease up too tight foreskin
  should be banned if there isnt a proper medical case for male circumsion
  thats only in the us as a coping mechanism it started out to punish and prevent masturbation and to reduce sexual pleasure  most european countries advise heavily against it
  quit spreading one sided bull that kellogg meme is not the be all and end all
  whats the reason then you got mutilated at birth
friendly reminder that normal penises give women more intense orgasms and theyre more likely to pairbond as well
  not that anon and i have no idea why it was done to me or him or anyone else but that about punishing / preventing masturbation and reducing pleasure is bollocks dont even need lube
a remedy which is almost always successful in small boys is circumcision especially when there is any degree of phimosis the operation should be performed by a surgeon without administering an anesthetic as the brief pain attending the operation will have a salutary effect upon the mind especially if it be connected with the idea of punishment as it may well be in some cases the soreness which continues for several weeks interrupts the practice and if it had not previously become too firmly fixed it may be forgotten and not resumed50
  that doesnt explain why it was being done thousand of years before that and all over the world
  pairbond what kinda gay shit is that nobody wants to see an uncut dick i admire what you guys are trying to do but you cant just skip ahead to social acceptability exciting times we life in
  do yanks really think is socially acceptable to have a cut penis as if uncut is savage or what 
  probably a woman
  it does why its done in the us
prime real estate location between china indonesia and japan  literally nothing historically significant happens here until spanish colonization  what the fuck happened here as in why did nothing happen   tselfhating flip american
  literally nothing historically significant happens here until spanish colonization    read a little bit please
  prove him wrong you cant
  its kinda just out of the way i mean i know it looks like it is inbetween the three you listed but it isnt really the main islands of indonesia are the western ones so theyd just sail straight north to china maybe stopping in indochina along the way same for china going the other way and japan wasnt really that relevant until somewhat recently there was just no real reason to go out there no kingdoms and micro/polynesia is all thats east of it until you hawaii or north america its like an east asian ireland adjacent or pretty close to where most of the action was going on and somehow missed out on nearly all of it
  prime real estate location between china indonesia and japan    nopejpg the philippines was actually out of the way for much of history until spain came there was no point in going there since ships from china are speeding to india while ships from india sped to china hence the malay states in the straits were the richest in sea    the only reason to head to the philippines for the people of east asia or india really was to either look for very very specific objects ie birds nest sea turtle shells spread islam if youre muslim or hide from the goddamned law if you were a smuggler/pirate    coincidentally its why most precolonial philippine groups were piratical assholes who practiced piracy in their spare time with raids reaching as far as vietnam to the east and as far south as borneo
  for further emphasis
  islam was getting introduced to the northern philippines luzon island by the brunei sultanate just before the spanish invaded the bruneians set up a muslim puppet state kingdom of maynila which was spreading islam among the hindu buddhist tagalog people then spain came destroyed it and destroyed islam among luzon
  taiwan was in a prime real estate location between china sea ryukyus korea and japan  literally nothing historically significant happened in taiwan until chinese and japanese pirates started using the island as a base in the 16th century the same century when the spanish colonized the philippines this is over 1700 years after the chinese colonized hainan island and 2000 years of contact between china korea japan and southeast asia they all ignored taiwan until 500 years ago and didnt even mention its existence there were some expeditions from china to an unknown eastern island in sun wu sui dynasty and yuan dynasty but it is unknown if it referred to taiwan or the ryukyu islands the philippines was not alone in being prime real estate that was ignored for millennia
  philippines is between china and the rich spice islands in the moluccas it would have been easier for china to trade with the spice islands through the philippines and not through java malaya and champa
  first constitutional republic in asia it was a bunch of freemasons
  republic of ezo in 1869 and republic of formosa in 1895 were the first constitutional republics in asiabefore the philippines
  lanfang ezo and formosa didnt have a constitution lanfang was an elder merchant council republic ezo was a samurai council republic formosa was a direct democracy malolos only had a written constitution because of freemason autism  all of them are based btw fuck monarcucks    inb4  collapse
oh shit there were some in india too    600bc buddhist citystates
    the first philippine republic was pretty weird desu they had plans to have titles of nobility but have no monarch    this is largely because the founders were nobility the principalia colonial elite to be exact
  the republic of china on the mainland from 19121949 and now on taiwan kept chinese titles of nobility and still paid the nobles stipends like the confucius duke there are republics with no monarch but have nobles
  no real pre colonial history  youre going to have to try harder than that to show your autism anon
    okay i get that but why the fuck did nobody go there its a shitload of land with plenty of resources did not a single civilization want to settle there why is it the fucking greeks colonized everywhere centuries prior but fucking chinese and indonesian kingdoms didnt
  big wind
any recommended histories for colonial or pre colonial philipines asking for a friend
  what part of until spanish colonization did you not get
  my bad  shit reading comprehension
  hes right though cool pirate ships aint gonna cut it
  what is the laguna copper plate  what is the boxer codex  what is the kingdom of tondo  what are earlt greek records of the philippines  what are the chinese and japanese records of luzon and visayas and the kingdoms that dotted those islands as well as the good they traded with    
      came here to say this it really isnt on route to anything 
  ayuckshully if youre heading to malacca you have to pass by the philippines this is especially true since most peoples ships are small flat bottomed coastal boats like the civilian junk which means you need to be close to shore or in calm waters to be able to operate

  serbia who backed the terrorist which killed the austrian crown prince who was going to reform the empire so bosnian serbs would have no reason to want a bosnian state and the panserb meme can end    so  who down right started the war serbia  who was in the right to fight in the war austria  who escalated shit and got all the major powers involved russia  who wanted a causebelli for war and rejected neutrality france  who was a dumb ass for supporting the right side in the war germany  who was a massive cunt and doing my balance of power because they were afraid of a single continental power uk  who did nothing but gained everything us  who were opportunistic assholes italy and japan
  russian panslavic nobles
  serbia who backed the terrorist which killed the austrian crown prince  there are zero proofs that the serbian gibmint was involved    who down right started the war serbia  wrong austria did when they declared war on serbia after serbia agreed to their ultimatum
  1 austrians  2 germans/russians  3 germans/russians  4 france/serbia  5 france/serbia  pretty much everyone else was dragged into the war to various degrees the austrians didnt even really like franz ferdinand but it was a good pretext to attack serbia like they had always wanted germany just backed austria needlessly and was just way too arrogant and russia was going to war basically to vent internal pressure and for reasons of prestigedumb france and serbia were basically just very reckless no real reason to do what they did
ww1 was whites against blacks the german bvlls were black not white them and the ottomans were defending the kara boga from the whte devils italian keks betrayed the black revolution and were banished into the whte civilization for the rest of eternity true germans are black modern germans are frnch and russin rape babies the reconquest of rightful colored clay has begun soon germany will be a province of the colored galactic empire
  germany without a doubt willhelm wanted a war he wasnt a war hawk he cherished war and worked at creating one it was through his civilian advisors that war was delayed that long when his court was finally overstaffed with war hawks and yes men bismarck knew that germany wouldnt last 20 years after his death because of wilhelm and he was right     you can ignore this uneducated moron who is most likely baiting
  a mentally ill bosnian individual kills some austria dude  austria starts a war with serbia as a result  germany escalates it by attacking russia france and belgium  naziboo conclusion serbia russia france and britain are to be blamed
  lol at the context this image omits
  if i had to pin it on a nation the austrians  but at the core of it the war was a result of the lack of a reaction from the continents aristocracy to the rising ethnic nationalist sentiment that had been seeded throughout europe in the wake of napoleon  as a result germany russia and austriahungary all lost their monarchies deservedly so  the british empire joined the war in a fundamentally different manner  not to quash an uprising or simply war with other massive states to tilt the balance of power but in defence of the sovereignty of a small independent nation  in retrospect germanys occupation of belgium seems like a piss poor excuse for joining the war but its one which got to the heart of the english psyche almost as if they intuited the underlying social precedent for the war although their subsequent mishandling of overseas territories proved this was more luck than anything else as a consequence the uk managed to tactfully diffuse republican sentiment and retain its monarchy
  france and serbia were basically just very reckless no real reason to do what they did    what did they do besides being attacked by austria/germany
  they committed the greatest sin ever according to krauts and stormniggers they refused to bend over and let germans do as they wish in serbias case they refused to hand over their sovereignty they agreed that they will accept whatever the european concert will dictate instead of just handing ah their sovereignty in frances case they refused to hand over their land to germany for no reason france tried to weasel out of the german demands by withdrawing miles away from german borders instead of giving french forts and standing down
  the jews

  france backed russia to the hilt over a nothing issue namely russias pride thats it thats what they were going to war over not trying to okay what the austrians or the germans did but i have a hard time sympathizing with the russians on any level in regards to wwi serbia was basically stupidly expansionist in the years leading to wwi they might not have had a hand in the assassination but it was very easy for them to be portrayed that way shouldnt have let some of their officers run amok
  capitalists
  wwi was a disaster for capitalists it caused the great depression
  it was about 80 russia 10 serbia with the other countries bearing minor responsibility
  mentally ill    he was working for serbian counterintelligence you absolute moron there wasnt just one person there were multiple assassins and they were coordinated by the black hand which had not only performed assassinations before but was run by dragutin dmitriejevic chief of serbia military intelligence austriahungary had every reason to consider the assassination especially as the details emerged as an act of aggression which is was     germany escalated    russia mobilized first on july 25th before germany
  lol what profits shot up during ww1 but even more importantly europe was redivided among the imperialists and the british and french bourgeoisie eliminated competition from germany through the cruel and vindictive versailles treaty also the great depression wasnt a disaster for large capitalists only small to medium businesses and the middle class large capitalists may have lost some money none of them suffered like the working classes
the astrians of course their mouth was foaming for war judging from the impossible ultimatum i wouldnt be surprised if the archduke assassination was a false flag
  russia had specific imperialist aims it wasnt about pride it was mostly about extending russian imperial control to the balkans and especially to constantinople
  its ironic you say that because all evidence shows it was performed by serbia counterintelligence the ultimatum was fairly mild when you consider the hit was ordered by the chief of serbian military intelligence
  russians mobilized first  maybe because they need a lot of time to prepare and serbia was in their sphere which ah was going to annex   but ah wasnt going to annex serbia  did ah bother to tell russia or germany of this no they didnt
  serbia  financed terrorists that murdered the austrian heir  france  was very clearly going to attack germany
  serbia was in their sphere    no it wasnt serbia was definitely not in their sphere of influence because they didnt even bother to get involved in the earlier two balkan wars russia had even sat out the 1909 annexation of bosnia because they were far more concerned with constantinople and the straits and were willing to trade bosnia for carving up the ottomans russia had no formal alliance with serbia whatsoever and mobilization is an aggressive act    ah was going to annex    it wouldnt matter serbia wasnt in the russian sphere russia had sat out most balkan intrigues for over a decade intervention was solely an act of russian aggression and an attempt at imperial expansion of a far wider scale than ah at least ah had the excuse that serbian counterintelligence murdered the heir to the throne russia had no such excuse
  in frances case they refused to hand over their land to germany for no reason  for no reason  dont pretend youre this dense

why did the fenians betray their british brethren is it something in their blood to be filthy backstabbers
  the british made it quite clear they were not brethren to the irish
youve got that assbackwards op the fenians were perfectly loyal at the time of the irish revolution in fact it was the ulster protestants who betrayed the britishit is in their blood  you see the irish volunteersthe group who fought in the rising and later became the irain fact were only created in response to the creation of the ulster volunteers the ulster volunteers were created to violently and absolutely resist implementation of the democratically approved home rule bill  you see anon the ulster protestants feared that home rule would lead to them no longer being in their comfortable position of power despite being a massive minority on the island when the bill was passed the ulstermen essentially threatened open rebellion and even civil war over it     the entire irish revolution the irish war of independence the partition of ireland and the troubles are all absolutely the fault of ulster protestants and their treacheryarguably even moreso than the british  the british tried to finally be rid of the filthy ulsterman several times after northern ireland was created but alas this disease simply refuses to die
  to add further clarification to this the overwhemlingly dominant party of irish politics was the ippirish parliamentary party they pushed for home rule and an irish parliament but not for separatism while they had some ties to the initial movement to undo the act of union they at no point advocated an actual severance from britain  the treachery and the incompetence of the common ulsterman is a well documented historical fact   it was the sheer unyielding autism of these people that allowed the ipp to be done in by the more extremist sinn fein a repercussion which haunts the ulster protestants to this day despite centuries of poor treatment by the britishboth as a result of malice and outright incompetence in rulethe irish were relatively happy for much of history to remain aligned with british interests   it was the ulster protestants who formed the irish republican brotherhood and it was the ulster protestants who in a swings and roundabouts move fucked everything so hard that ireland severed itself from britain  cheers to that billy
the real question is what did billy do with his newfound statehood once northern ireland became a separate entity to the free state billy found himself still within the uk and with a large irish population deliberately done to make sure the ulstermen didnt get insecure and a very powerful shipyard  what did billy do  well first of all he made sure all those damn dirty fenians ended up horrendously lesser to the based ulster protestants cutting them out of the loop culturally economically and politically then the redpilled ulsterman started trying to carve out an identity for himselfto little avail disaster struck when belfast was bombed during ww2 however thankfully the bluepilled fenians came to the rescue britain tried to sell ni to the republic during ww2 but thankfully nobody told billy    after ww2 billy saw that the government of ni were starting to reform things to give the fenians rights billy watched the civil rights marches and his blood started to boil so billy did what billy does besthe fucked it all up billy started to shoot and bomb people and blame the irawho had been up to fat fuck all since their hilarious failure of a border campaignso that people would hate fenians he helped put more extreme unionists into power who really started hammering the dumb fenians  this lead to the troubles billy didnt do much during the troubles he let the british do the hard work however after the troubles his bravery was well rewarded  now billy lives in a deteriorating shithole where irish nationalism is enshrined and protected where ira men are quite literally in government and irish culture and identity is exploding heh all across ni more and more fenians are popping up and soon catholics will be a majority whatever will billy do  most likely hell do what billy does besthell fuck it all up
  going to war with your government because they were thinking about just maybe limiting some of your already plentiful rights  are the ulster protestants secretly american
  other way around
        stop spreading lies you taigs
  go back to egypt
  go back to iberia
    one later attempt by billy to establish some semblence of national identity other than being the unruly and unprosperous and generally incompetent northern counterpart of the common fenian was to come up with a theory that the native ulster people have always been inherently different to the rest of ireland  one of the better known examples is the use of cú chalainnan irish figure from irish mythologyas an example of ulsterdwellers defending their lands from southern invaders  this is peculiar as cú chalainn is depicted in every other instance as irish and is also used as a representation of the easter rising  the curious case of billys thought that ulster is less irish than the rest of ireland is in fact so rooted in falsehood that he forgets that ulster was in fact the most gaelic irish part of ireland in history it was in fact one of the last places in ireland to fall to england  the ulster plantations were some of the last major attempts to colonise ireland by england and it was the defeat of gaelic ulster lords by england that allowed ulster to be colonised  some believe this is the homecoming of the ancient cruthin people  the cruthinbilly stateswere the native inhabitants of ulster who were driven out by the evil gaels the claim is that due to the fact that cruthin translates to the name for celts from britain the reality is that this name was in fact used for them and not by them  someincluding billymight claim the ulster people had links to the inhabitants of scotland however there exists quite literally no evidence whatsoever to suggest any actual link between the picts and the cruthin    billys somewhat lacking grasp not only on his own historybut history as a wholeonly reaffirms the protestant unionist image as a somewhat lesser being the laughable exam results of the ulster protestant youth doesnt help either
  a now infuriated billy may continue to make the claim that even if there are no actual links between these cruthin people and the early inhabitants of scotlanddebunking the homecoming theory of the ulster plantationthat perhaps the cruthin were still a native people driven out by the evil gaelic irish  this however is also entirely untrue the cruthin were not different in quite literally any way to the rest of the irish population they used the same laws names language and governmental structure as the gaels and are arguably different only in name    one notable exception of ulster could be the dál riataa historical oddity of a kingdom spanning parts of western scotland and northern ireland this kingdomregardless of who they werewas also absolutely and entirely gaelic in almost every way    the now devastated billy will simply state that these are fenian lies and untruths and will likely run to his local lodge for reassurance that he is anything more than the afterbirth of a botched partition his undying loyalty to britain is undone through his ancestors treachery in the 20th century and his blistering hatred for the irish is undone by the fact he is currently squatting in land which always was and always will be mickd
        why is he named billy
  an excellent question you see a popular figure to billy is his hero king billy who is in fact king william iii of england king william was a dutch king who was invited to invade england and stage a coup against the catholic james ii  billy sees him as a hero who helped get rid of the pesky irish and lay the foundation for northern ireland to exist by defeating the irish armies loyal to king james ii   simply put this is also not the case king william in fact pardoned most of the irish soldiers in return for their loyalty to him and those who refused these offers were not punished but given the option to exilewhich many of them did starting the famous wild geese period of irish mercanaries in continental europe billy likes to sing about king william as he believes that his campaigns in ireland demonstrate an inherent superiority of protestant ulstermen over the irish due to the creation of the protestant ascendantthe new ruling class of ireland  unfortunately this victory lasted less than a century before it began to be unravelled by irish politicians and shortly afterward irish republicanism was borncreated by the protestant ascendant that king william helped create
  tfw kist in scots refers to the kind of chest you keep stuff in a box  tfw someone at the ulster scots agency probably just looked up the word in a scots dictionary and didnt check what it actually meant
  they do that sort of thing all the time    theres an ulster scots sign at the guild hall in derry where the main hall is labelled muckle haw which in scots means many blackberry bushes
  thats because ulsterscots is a larp language not a real one
  the ulster scots language is very interestingin the sense that it isnt a language at all  the rising support for an irish language act similar to that of scotland and wales and their equivilants in northern ireland has lead billy to demand that there be an ulster scots language act tooits only fair right  only theres one issue ulster scots isnt a language and considered by everyone except for those in ulsterscots societies to be a dialect or group of dialects as opposed to a language  the language arguably came to be in the late 17th century and had a breif revival in the late 20th century however during this period the language was quite literally heavily altered by activists to make it more different to english    comparatively the irish language is the oldest language in europe to be written in the vernacularaka ireland was the first place in western europe to start creating documents and records in their own language as opposed to latin

  and  have to fight a brutal battle with the chinese losing many friends along the way  japan was invading korea and china china wasnt invading japan invading japanese soldiers got killed while trying to violate another countrys sovereignty and kill its inhabitants japan beheaded war prisoners even in the meiji era and did not sign any conventions against it so japanese soldiers captured in china would be treated the same way france beheaded war prisoners into the algerian war in the 50s because there was no convention against beheading hostile pows only against killing civilians
  dresden
  do you honestly expect the autist to stop
  very tiny brained post  the japanese and french beheaded people which means the japanese shouldnt get upset to see their friends beheaded faces mutilated and corpses hung on display  this is what youre saying and its stupid      are you seriously implying the average drafted japanese private was the one responsible for the invasions of china and korea and not the japanese government  you are saying it is the japanese peoples fault they are drafted and sent to a foreign land where savages commit inhuman acts against the friends they trained with  fuck off

  port arthur happened essentially in one day the japanese came from battle saw their mutilated allies and started revenge killing on the spot    the burning of the summer palace happened over the course of a month british negotiators were captured tortured and killed in september and the summer palace was burnt midoctober    the only thing these two instances have in common are the chinese being savages your argument is shit
  fuck yankees and semper fuck tyranus
  the only thing these two instances have in common are the chinese being savages your argument is shit  manchus were a major part of the qing army at beijing and the first sinojapanese war why do they suddenly become chinese when it comes to this after japan claimed manchus were not chinese suddenly its chinese savagery
holocaust was entirely justified     the jews are on the verge of exterminating the aryan race because of hitlers failure     the only way to stop the jew menace permanently is to slaughter them all    every man woman and child    inb4 edgy
  the manchu qing emperor was the one who ordered the execution of the british and indians woah i thought you claimed manchus werent chinese
  i never claimed manchus werent chinese and youre arguing with me  now youre just grasping for straws      when did i ever claim that lol
  the jews are on the verge of exterminating the aryan race  no evidence for that   inb4  muh judeobolshevism
  greeted with the severed heads of your dead friends mounted on pikes mutilated with their lips and noses sliced off    disgusting i would say that the japanese retaliation was justified considering the savagery of the chinese
hadrians jewish genocide
  i think that massacres cant be justified unless you view it through a longterm lens wherein said massacre is done to prevent further violence  however the massacre during and the genocide following the cod wars were completely justified
once an enemy soldier invades someone elses soil unprovoked with the intent to kill they forfeit all right to life japanese penal code had beheading until 1945 and beheading japanese soldiers invading was fully justified japan committed war crimes in korea and killed pows there so there was nothing wrong with killing japanese pows
  yes invading soldiers are military men and absolutely legitimate targets in war for killing and bounty civilians and local soldiers have the right to kill and do anything to the invaders
  western media paints you as savage in spite of the wounded knee massacre happening just recently    and japan invaded and occupied native ainu land in hokkaido and tried to drive them to extinction            it the ainu were as savage to the japanese colonists they would have survived with their culture and blood intact unfortunately they were too nice there is no such thing as being polite to invaders
  how about you free tibet and east turkestan before pointing any fingers wang
  no such thing
  everyone who criticises japan is a chink  fuck off weaboo and kys immediately
  gallipoli ww1 anzac under great britain generals
  justified massacres   the holocaust
  tibet is 90 tibetan  the tarim basin in southern xinjiang is 90 uyghur uyghurs only come from there they arent native to dzungaria in northern xinjiang westerners only referred to the tarim basin as eastern turkestan in the 19th century never including dzungaria as a part of eastern turkestan  dzungaria in northern xinjiang is majority han and kazakh because manchus slaughtered the native dzungar oirats and sent han farmers and kazakhs to replace them native oirats still live there today though 25000 dzungar ööled oirats and 106000 torghut oirats live in dzungaria right now together 131000 oirats still live in dzungaria this is after two centuries uyghurs and tibet were first invaded and occupied by the dzungars the dzungars invaded the uyghurs in 1680 and tibet in the 1710s the uyghurs and tibetans asked the qing to attack the dzungars and free them from dzungar rule since the dzungars were fucking their women     hokkaido meanwhile is over 99 ethnic japanese ainu are barely 001 of hokkaidos population only 25000 ainu live in japan today all this happened since the 19th century japan invaded hokkaido unilaterally an entire small island got packed with japanese in a few years while the tarim basin and tibet each of which are over 10 times the size of hokkaido are filled with 90 uyghurs and tibetans
why are they so warmongering and genocidal is it genes or culture
  why do you feel the need to make threads like this over and over and over again is it genes or culture

  all the shit you said is true but that doesnt mean it was the best option or the world is better off for it all uve stated is correlation    and from a personal perspective theyve let me down too ive got nothing to say for it    its a state that will arrest you for smoking a flower or collecting rainwater yet you want to say such is x in the same breathe    not even touching the involuntary surveilance state and the failure that was    yeah nah

  everyone is racist han chinese are racist japanese imperials were racist nazi germany was racist european colonial empires were racist arabians traded slaves    america fought a war against itself to free slaves america does everything it can to erase racism with the civil rights movement i cant say the same for most other countries

  le mcdonalds in hanoi meme  would have happened 50 years earlier if america just dont intervene at all the long war cause the orthodox hardliner communists who were a minority within minority of the initial revolution leadership to purge the opposition thanks to chinese influence
  i believe it is by gods grace that this great nation exists and is willing to sacrifice so much for the liberty and justice of all youre welcome south korea as long as you are a liberty loving people we will always stand by you and stand for you if need be thank you for your friendship and god bless you and your people    
  fuck americans praise every national tragedy that has ever befallen them
  there is now a mcdonalds in hanoi  yes thats what all those young mutts died in jungle squalor for if i were one of them looking up from hell id be so happy
why is this the biggest wewuzkangz country in europe
  huge polish inferiority complex that must be compensated with fantasies and wewuzzing
because its sovereignty was taken from them a lot
thats not germany
  macedonia albania ukraine and scotland are strong competitors
  at least shit like your pic related is kinda funny
    powerful
  what do they we wuz about you didnt give any examples
  pole here  probably about we wuz cultural center of europe  but in reality our culture was very specific and weird
  i buy it
  some butthurt german russian ukrainian or mutt made it so its not really anything true beyond shitposting  or maybe its self hating pole who did it alot of them on 4chan
  aerodynamic faces
    what illiterates consider polish wewuzzery is actual polish history and people that claim its wewuzzing are the ones with inferiority complex
  poland is the ireland of central europe
  we wuz sarmatians we wuz goths we wuz vandals etc
  clearly not it has much richer history than majority of countries in europe
  lmao
  but thats true though poland was formed in 900s and even when it was temporarly wiped off the map poles still played important roles in other countries but i guess you cant reason with someone so asshurt
  all those tribes actually lived on the terrains of the plc its less retarded for them to claim that then for a german to claim being aryan
      
  then for a german to claim being aryan  which was only believed by some fringe nutjobs and even the nsdap dropped it in 1935 and replaced it with german/ germanic
  doesnt mean that they were polish/slavic or part of polish history
  probably yes its between them and macedonia
  what you actually think the slavs just went in afterwards and replaced every single person living there beforehand leaving no genetic legacy
  genetic legacy is irrelevant
  not an argument if you cant refute   then you are simply a baiting retard or an actual imbecile without proper education
  they didnt
  that albanian who tells you sitting in the gym locker room that the flag of albania is a two headed eagle because alexander the gread was a madeconian albanian
  based and red pilled
  didnt what didnt replace aryans with germans/ germanics because they absolutely did that in the 1935 nuremberg race laws
  they larped as aryans in almost all of their speeches
  at least the irish have the excuse of having a retarded system of succession that prevented them from uniting poles dont even have that      it has much richer history than majority of countries in europe  poles actually believe this
  what dont you understand you moron poland has history on par with spain united kingdom and germany rest is pretty much irrelevant as the countries with richer history are greece italy and france
  poland was literally created from a unification of different tribes all of them had their own culture and traditions their local traditions didnt evaporate the moment they swore fealty to a king an that happened what in 10th century they are certainly closer to their origins than germans are to the germanic barbarians that destroyed rome
didnt nietzsche believe he was descended from sarmatian poles
  yeah but he was also a complete nutter
  for shitting on autistic prussians
  or maybe its self hating pole who did it alot of them on 4chan  evidently not enough
  autism
  i came here to post literally this  i am pole btw    we wuz hussars we saved europe etc etc
  poland literally did nothing but sit in central/eastern europe for a few centuries before being btfo and raped their golden age consists of losing to ukrainian peasants and being a mediocre regional power spain and the united kingdom conquered most of the world and shaped it in their image and germany totally fucked europe twice now theyre just another generic depressing grey postcommie nation with no dignity and a population of aspiring economic migrants and mail order brides they cope for their inferiority complex with online haploautism and wewuzzing
  every balkan country is much worse
      cope
daily reminder
  giga cope
  im from slovakia i wonder why this is the case are our women together with their polish and latvian counterparts so much better off than males that they just dont sudoku why such a striking difference between rather similar countries like hungary its all pretty weird
    how does it chage the fact that poland has rich history
  i doubt that being worse or better off has as much to do with suicide as you think it has more to do with pathos and crucially the deadliness of the methods used
  just look at all their buttblasted replies the answer is insane inferiority complex   they are a nation of pathetic losers and for a country of such size and age they really didnt achieve much they have to compensate somehow so they lie and larp
  ayo we wuz popesz n sziet  
  we wuz scythians
  it may sound strange but in eastern europe ie poland women have a very high place in the society  i sometimes feel like woman is put on a pedestal and treated in a special way even in the conservative part of the society apart from sexism which is also present
  dont forget about the other faggot and his   poland is a winkelried of nations
yes we were the aryans  yes we were scythians   yes we were sarmatians  yes we were wends  yes we were the vandals    tf is that germ
  giving good explanation for spain and uk  out of the ass explanation for germany  who could be behind this post
all these polish answers  are you people trying to prove op right
  germ   its from kordian
  we wuzzing isnt being proud of your ancestors its larping as someone completely unrelated to you muttmutt
  we were scythians  hahahahahahahaha
  yes exactly just like for example  does
  still dont know what the fuck that is why dont you go back to /lit/ with your gay pretentious words that no one ever heard of     samaritans come directly from the scythians    its me go ahead and prove how any of those are wrong
  nice anglo source

itt people come into sudden realization that poles have 1000 years of history
  still dont know what the fuck that is  so youre not pole
  neither are you for shitting on your own country
  so the best source
  nah biased inbred trash just like anglos
  thousands of years ago a few scythians raped some slavs before they migrated away   thousands of years later a slav starts larping as a scythian  scythians have red hair  the vast majority of poles dont  you wuz not scythians
  yeah pathetic 1000 years of history
  educating fellow countrymen to stop larping isnt shitting on poland retard
      one of the best military records in history
  but its completely fine when everyone else is doing it amirite
  i come from the region but im not him    k
  t assblasted scot
  everyonewho larps is mocked
  no replies   where did all these ass blasted historylets go all of a sudden rly makes me think
  oh look its the mick fuck from yesterday that thinks udmurts scythians and egyptians were irish because of redhair and r1b look at that low iq moron and laugh
  furry
  wwhy did people stop responding to my loweffort shitposting  give me attention waaaaaaaaaaaaah  this is you
    both egyptians and albanians are muslims now coincidence
  albanians are ancient irish udmurt scythian egyptians
  furryism is the implicit last stand of white identity
  speaking of butthurt yea attempting to discuss the topic at hand is shitposting ok retard if i say im 100 serious will you finally btfo me with facts and logic
  gets repeatedly wiped of the map  one of the best military records in history  in your delusional mind maybe grzegorz
  this is literally what germany is famous for not that i have a problem with western europe being destroyed
  history doesnt start in 1790s you amerishart
  gets partitioned and only the turks care because they fear russia  oh no no no no no
  we wuz moderately relevant 400 years ago  who actually gives a fuck
  sure but it doesnt end in 1790 either
  of course it didnt and it didnt for poland and poles either
  almost none of the top 100 are in europe so whats the point
  but the irish did unite the normans just came in and split them back up shortly after
  this isnt adjusted to the amount of universities in a country
  and it didnt for poland  youre right poland actually managed to last til 1795
  hasnt ungary the biggest we wuz kangz complex
  perfect analogy
whats up with all the polish butthurt they do have history but their countrys history and contribution to humanity is almost non existant compared to the big 3
  big 3  so  china  ottomans  usa  right
  its the only thing that matters
  so was ireland your point is
  ahhahahahahah lamo get a grip sewer
  this
list of european countries more relevant historically than poland from a white persons perspective  england  scotland  ireland  france  burgundy  castille  aragon  portugal  spain  the papacy  italy  venice  genoa  switzerland  bavaria  germany  prussia  austria  hungary  netherlands  belgium  denmark  norway  sweden  finland  russia  greece  athene  macedonia  bulgaria  romania  hungary  bohemia
the butthurt that poland causes is just too funny how can one nation trigger so many autists
  rightfully mocking a country for its unreasonable selfimportance isnt triggering
  we wuz goths we wuz vandals etc  no one in poland says that the fuck are you on about
  norway  they invented pretty much nothing what are you on about
  they invented and influenced the world plenty how do you think you get your perfect cheese slices norweigian brilliance
  yeah sure ive seen enough of these threads to know that its not poles that make them and that the things discussed in them are mostly pure fiction and butthurt most typically they are made by some butthurt brit at that
  link some of those threads where polacks shilled themselves im sure there are plenty if /his/ cries about them so frequently
  not him but heres how threads like this get made on /his/ and /int/   be anon that gets btfo by based poland memes on /pol/  want to vent frustration on subhuman poles  goes on /his/ or /int/ to spill his butthurt   proceeds to make poland is we wuzing again guys  there bonus points for being a brit or german
fuck poolacks they whine and play victim and the have an audacity to call ukraine a noncountry hypocrites
  /pol/ loves /pol/and you silly goose its like their favorite country
  neonazis like poland  i somehow doubt it
  no only amerimutts
  noncountry detected
    inb4 ebil russian propaganda  now fuck off
  even a plurality of the boards usebase being actual neonazis  stop falling for the bait retard    this may be so places like poland russia and hungary probably seem better to americans than people who actually live near there
  i never said anything about /pol/ and its preferences i said that people that go there get butthurt over threads that speak favorably about poland
    its not just poland you dumb poolack any country that gets its dick sucked on 4chan gets shit on just as much eventually because its fucking annoying  same thing happened with russia before and japan before that    next will probably be hungary
  ie this thread was made by a butthurt person
  irish people are allowed indoors
  afterwards we had gay anal sex with no condoms  did not expect the story to go there
  b a s e d also true
  80 of your list isnt white when compared to poles
why dont jannies delete these thinlyveiled /int/ shitpost threads
  but we were kings
  almost nobody outside of 4chan believes that though
fucking krauts am i right guys
ahem    i just came to say    fuck germs  fuck moskals  fuck hohols  fuck shithuanians  fuck pepiks  fuck muslims      thank you for your attention
  oh and i almost forgot about the ones who always triggered violence from mentioned retards    fuck kikes
  how can one man be so based
    based
historically genetically culturally
  historically   italy has a large amount of localism because it wasnt unified until fairly recently    genetically  there an isolated part of europe so genetically speaking they resemble europeans more so 10000 years ago than they do modern europeans and i know they have more anatolian farmer dna then actual people from turkey    culturally  i dont know too much about their culture but ive heard their language before its probably one of my favorite dialects of italian and their diet is notoriously healthy
  they say that otzi the ice man found in the alps was genetically most similar to sardinian     agrees with 
  there an isolated part of europe so genetically speaking they resemble europeans more so 10000 years ago than they do modern europeans    as if europeans of 10000 years ago were one ethnic group what sort of retarded reasoning is that
  as if europeans of 10000 years ago were one ethnic group what sort of retarded reasoning is that    this is a straw man europeans are the result of multiple migrations out of africa one of these migrations is the anatolian farmers and when they went to sardinia they were isolated from the other migration patterns like neolithic hunters and such the term ethnicity is pretty new so people 10000 years ago didnt have a ethnicity they probably thought of some people is more similar to them but not much else beyond that    i actually want to visit sardinia for the food
  that one migration resulted into many ethnic groups just because it was one group at one point in time doesnt mean that it will remain such forever sardinians arent any more special than any of the other branches of that one migration group
  europeans 7000 years ago were relatively similar but different than today there were still some pockets of pure hunter gatherers but anatolian farmer ancestry dominated in europe in the middle neolithic we observe resurgence of hgs ancestry and in the early bronze age a massive invasion from the steppe that basically created modern europeans   sardinians are basically a neolithic population and people from ogliastra practically lack steppe ancestry they are completely unique as no other group of people clusters with those european neolithic farmers
  sardinians arent any more special than any of the other branches of that one migration group    1 wrong because ancestry sites like 23 and me and ancestrycom from sardinia because i was genetically unique they are and most europeans with the rare exception of fins and sardines and maybe bask are the results of three migration patterns not just one    2 how do i view the term ethnicity meaning race  culture equals ethnicity admittedly yes thats a very simplified term especially when you compare it to how the greeks especially since the greeks invented the word ethnicity    3 whether or not sardinia genetically changes i dont know and this is not the politics board
historically they were a few months by boat from the italian coast one would think the rest of the difference follow from that
  also basques are a population most closely related to sardinians but they have more steppe ancestry than them     another interesting fact people in sardinia live longer than any other europeans especially the region of ogliastra have many centenarians
  yes    genetically theyre very interesting they really havent had any major influx of people sjnce the island was settled in the mesolithic    historically italy was a very shaky concept and really only came about in the mid 1800s     culturally they speak their own dialect and like most italians prioritised their regional identity over the national identity
  neolithic sardinians have elevated neolithic ancestry
  genetically theyre different from the mainland but its not like the mainland is genetically homogenous either    historically sardinia had a lot of monuments from the neolithic and bronze age unlike mainland italy and the giudicati kingdoms during the middle ages which retained more byzantine heritage than most of mainland italy so they were not feudalized until the aragonese conquest which was only finished in 1420 with the fall of the giudicato of arborea though there were also some other battlese against the aragonese with the marquesate of oristano which was defeated in 1480
genetics
  sardinia wasnt discovered by europeans until the advent of renaissance technology i very much doubt the island was settled at the time
  its funny that every time a sardinian girl is posted people choose the mainland admixed and not the native ones
  not the guy who posted that picture but dorgali certainly isnt the most mainland admixed place in sardinia
  im taking about people and you answer me about places alright buddy
  how do you know that girl from dorgali has a lot of mainland admixture
how do we secure the existence of the sardinian people
  sardinian isnt a dialect of italian though
  hohohohoho someone pls post screen cap so i can see my post bashing the guy again
  he buys in the whole le sardinian were blacks maymay ignore shitposters like him    purebred sardinian living in sardinia here ill answer everything    historically  preroman history is long and complicated it developed a civilization way earlier than the mainland thought to be part of the sea people and had huge influence on the mediterranean  sardinia was conquered only on the coasts during roman times  the center remained barbarian until byzantine times  there was no feudalism in sardinia until aragonese conquests they had a system based on judges based on the byzantine administration system but with people self governing  sardinia was annexed to italy only late and was basically an africatier colony  it damaged sardinia a lot with the average taxes on 90 of the population higher than the amount needed for the population to eat and not die many people resorted to banditism in the mountains the savoia military also never helped sardinia when it was invaded by napoleon and islanders had to defend themselves  the savoiards didnt even live in sardinia they just send emissaries to collect money    genetically  the land in europe with less admixture from the outside  genetically resembling ötzi more than any other people    culturally  the language is the most closely related to latin pic related islanders didnt speak italian until after decades from the savoy conquest its a latin dialect not an italian dialect  the rest of culturally is complicated id need more specific questions
  culturally  yes unique sardinian cultural traditions include fucking sheeps and eating rotten cheese with maggots in it  truly a special people
  by how she looks retard
  daily reminder that there never was a single case of zoophilia in sardinia while there are thousands in mainland italy  itliots are truly a disgusting bunch no wonder youre laughing stock of the world
  and their diet is notoriously healthy  i think youre referring to the fact that sardinians live a long time it is not believed this is related to diet but rather to social aspects of their life sardinians and italians in general is an extremely social culture which is believed to prolong life in its twilight years
  but people all have their own look retard
  no there are clear indicators of ancestry
  based
  lots of romanic cathedrals
  such as
  eye color hair color skin color
  the eye color is light and although not very common is still present in a minority of sardinians 14 the skin color is pink or light brown like most people living in southern europe
  the savoy took refuge in sardinia for some time when they had to flee from piedmont because of the french when the french sieged cagliari and attacked the north of the island with a fleet it was the sardinian generals who fought them off while the savoy were barricated in cagliari
  historically and culturally besides some big common denominators all of the italian regions are widely different between eachother
  sardinia was considered to be italy since the middle ages here is a 13th century document mentioning marianus ii the sardinian ruler of the giudicato of arborea      giovanni villanici recounts the details of the stay of mariano ii in pisa saying that he is one of the greatest and most powerful citizens of italy he brought with him a great court and a large number of knights in pisa who rattled with him along those streets
  none of the regional languages of italy are dialects they are all languages that evolved simultaneously and mostly independently from standard italian sardinian is just the most ancient and less contaminated from the bunch
  more like all the med languages are just variations of the latin equivalent to ebonics larping as seperate languages
  more like all languages are just variations of the east african protohuman language equivalent to ebonics larping as separate languages
  pisa isnt in sardinia retard
  yeah he visited pisa read the post retard
  go fuck yourself italian exporter of mafia and crime worldwide
  italian scammer as always rotten cheese is also typical of almost all italian regions  outside of sardinia similar milk cheeses are also produced in the french island of corsica as a local variation of the sardinian cheese known as casgiu merzu as well as in a number of italian regions141516    bross cha marcia in piedmont  cacie punt formaggio punto in molise  casu puntu in salento apulia  casu du quagghiu in calabria  gorgonzola coi grilli in liguria  frmag punt in apulia  furmai nis formaggio nisso in emiliaromagna  marcetto or cace fraceche in abruzzo  salterello in friulivenezia giulia
  sardinians as a race are prone to a very non latin almost celtic wistfulness and melancholy    sardinians themselves are not a talkative race unless you get them going on politics or some other subject dear to their hearts    nor are they theatrical or gregarious like other italians but they look you frankly in the eye and   treat you as a human being first before they judge you as anything else    you will probably never meet an obsequious sardinian      they are intelligent extremely generous and hospitable both on a personal level and comunally they are the most profuse blood donors in italy    as a race they are prone to a very nonlatin almost celtic wistfulness and melancholy and in the past  they have populated their island with all kind of fairies and giants dragons and spooks who come outh after dark these may have been relegated to folklore but even today the sardinians take more than the national share of antidepressants
  why is daisy ridley dressed in sardinian garb and why is she so plump
  look like basques to me desu
      sardinians are generally a quiet and reserved people especially those of the interior far from the archetype of the outgoing mediterranean  sardinians display none of the exuberance usually associated with mainland italians nor their malleability or lightness of heart    sardinian people are fiercely independent     and while it is unwise to generalise sardinian people are known as being much more reserved those on sicilywhere it seems everyone has a relative in america    sardinian people are known for their proud and mistrustful nature but also for their hospitality guests are sacred treated with great warmth and respect    casual contacts often possible with italians in other regions is more than an expection than the general rule in sardinia but once the initial diffidence is surmuonted most people find the sardinians to be disarmingly friendly and generous      in the interior specially in the smalls towns of nuoro province attitudes to outsiders can be still prickly exchanges can at first be cordial but icy but once the ice is broken you may find yourself being wined and dined way past your capacity
  anyone used to negotiating italian mainland italys roads will find sardinia a doddle and pedestrians accustomed to being treated as human skittles will be pleasantly surprised to find the drivers actually stop at pedestrian crossings and respect red lights local pedestrians also respect signals and especially in cagliari and sassari where traffic is heavy and constant it is sensible to do likewise    driving in sardinia is not the competetive sport that it can be in rome naples and sicily    the sardinians are no slouches at the dinner table seafood and many popular pasta dishes abound for the coastal crawlers but the true essence of the islands cuisine lies in its hearty roast meats suckling pig kid and lamb    the sardinians are a sturdy race but at the same time alert lively and brave even to rashness  firm friends but implacable enemies quick of understanding of vivacious imagination and passionately fond of poetry zealous in maintaining their rights and liberty
  the sardinians can be reserved a lot   foreign women are less likely to encounter the cloying and ceaseless male attention that can occur elsewhere in italy and the phenomenon of the fasttalking con artist is also rarer on the island    sardinians are almost universally polite to women and it is unlikely that you will suffer the sort of harassment that you might in parts of mainland italy    traditionally sardinians are typified by a quiet dignity and seriousness    if the sardinians are noted for their quiet strength independence fierce loyalty bravery deephearted friendliness and at times dour mien
  they are some of the healthiest and the longest living people in the wold together japanese people
  also lots of gothic and baroque cathedrals
  they killed millions
is killing myself ethical and what do religions say about this what is the view of philosophical schools like nihilism and many others on suicide
they all say you should do it /
  nihilism aint shit come back when you turn 14 the answer is no btw im assuming you have loved ones
  suicide is only ethical if your situation permits it    99 of people arent in these situations and the rest are in grey area situations/are objectively horrible people basically you should only kill yourself if youre a total jerk without any dependents and dont want to redeem yourself but if youre in this situation you wouldnt do it anyways theres always some path out of all low points
  99 of people considering suicide important part left out oops
what is the view of philosophical schools like nihilism  i wrote something the other day about nihilism and the individual when the individual seizes to exist so does reality since everything is perceived and interpreted by said individual    so in other words no being alive is everything
does faith in nietzsche alone save or do our works contribute

  they mocked him for his scruffy appearance but he didnt give a shit
disgraced the office of emperor undoing the decades of gravitas people like diocletian had tried to associate with it  obsessed with being popular to the point of neglecting the affairs of state like nero he preferred to be writing plays or composing songs rather than governing  crippled the centralised power base of italy allowing provinces to basically break away unpunished  just straight up burned and looted fellow roman cities when he needed more gibsmedats for his embarrassing military campaigns  forced his troops to starve when they wanted to return home after his persian campaign was obviously doomed to failure  can who likes julian please explain to me why it feels like if it wasnt for his antichristian religious stance he would be considered a caligula or caracalla tier disaster
  cool last words  case closed
  stfu he restored rights to our based jewish brethren hes based    he even had aspirations of rebuilding the temple damn shame he died before he could
  he restored religious equality
  he is sol invictus come in the flesh
  t varg
  i dont understand why christcucks think they are clever when they mention that julian was not le based pagan because he attempted to rebuild their temple if the kikes had their holy place restored they would forever fuck back to their own place and be confined there rather than spreading their abrahimic faith in their host regions
were his actions justified i personally believe so his morals were correct and by doing what he did he put attention onto his writings
  morals
killing a bunch of literal whos for attention like an incel shooting up a school  his philosophy is basically just bawww modern life is too stressful and a meme understanding of how things actually were in the past
  killing people outside of war is unjustifiable
was prohibition really as bad as the memes say it was or was it a justifiable response to rampant drunkenness    pic related historical drunks who couldnt handle the freedom to drink

usa joining the central powers  was it even possible how could it have happened
  was it even possible  no
  ancient  l  i  e  n  s
  us joined the entente because it had invested significantly in france and the uk over the last few decades and was worried about getting a return if the us had somehow managed to invest more strongly in the german empire and austriahungary it might have joined the central powers
  send zimmerman telegram directly to the us instead  burgers take it as a sign germany wants to help them expand south into a new mexico  profit
  napoleon iii succeeds in planting maximillian in mexico creates a french vassal state just south of our border and uses it to gain leverage over our trading routes and partners making it difficult to enforce the monroe doctrine uk and france for some reason try locking us out of their markets abroad the central powers see this as an opportunity to cozy up with us against the new strengthened ukfrance alliance    not saying its realistic but
wasnt a large bit of the us population germanic at that time
  70 percent of the migrant population

ill just leave this here
the greeks who caused bactria to revolt grew so powerful on account of the fertility of the country that they became masters not only of ariana but also of india as apollodorus of artemita says and more tribes were subdued by them than by alexander    imagine a hellenistic zoroastrian iran strong enough to withstand the arabic tribes and prevent islam from spreading past the zagros mountains
  i had no idea of bactria until video related popped up on youtube    its a cool vid
  nah they were aesthetic as fuck more more intresting then the rest of europe around that time
  tfw it was literally called pagania
  i imagined it and it made me puke
obotrites
  burgundy  aesthetic
  please dont
  this is truly underrated he could had marched straight into constantinople if not for the british
  desu he should have just gone for it anyways the british were never going to come around because there was nothing he could give them that they couldnt get even more cheaply from the ottomans

  france tried to support him but all other great power uk russia and austria send him an ultimatum out of fear that their previous deals and concessions would be nulidificaded and that was not going to happen had him marched into constantinople an international coalition would had declared war on him immediately
  more like german speaking semites its unlikely the few vandals who rolled up and conquered it could have ethnically replaced all the millions of the areas phoenecian and garamantian inhabitants

slow down there denmark
  imagine them taking frisia and pomerania as well damn those would be some aesthetic borders
  all of britannia would have been nice aswell
  genocided into oblivion  turks must pay
  they tried but everyone around them kept attacking them even going to bactria was a mistake but then alexanders campaign wasnt about strategic goals and acquisitions it was one flamboyant homosexuals man ego trip across the world

  which would leave a whole 5 natives with no european dna
  pomerania in general desu
  this is a true ugh what could have been moment
  try to search up things on pomerania   first result is almost always about the dogs   pretty annoying
it still interests me that vermont was independent for 10 years
  how independent was vermont and was there any genuine hostility to nonvermont people how much trade did they do with their neighbours
  gross lumping in brythons and gaels with germanic anglos is icky
  from the little ive read they were very isolated i doubt few people if any immigrated to vermont so im not sure whether or not they would be hostile to nonnatives the nation itself probably didnt even have 50000 people i dont think the us really wanted to interfere because they werent very stable immediately after the revolution i dont think much foreign trade occurred either it seemed like an agrarian society however they did have their own currency pic related eventually vermont voluntarily joined the us because the people of vermont decided that it would be more advantageous to become part of the us than to become part of british north america
  op said forgotten the crown of the aragon was very important for two hundred years and was the maritime power of the mediterranean for a while  the so called catalan flag nowadays appears in hundreds of places around the sea

remember that time the netherlands were a vassal of france it was called the batavian republic and it was formed after a coup detat supported by napoleon it even blatantly copied the french liberte egalite fraternite into dutch    it didnt last long because the dutch were too unruly so napoleon reformed the republic into a kingdom and made his brother louis bonaparte the king however louis didnt like being his brothers lapdog so he learned dutch and decided to rule as an autonomous king  allegedly his dutch was initially so poor that he told the people he was the konijn van olland rabbit of olland rather than koning van holland king of holland   of course nappy wasnt too thrilled by this he exiled his brother and annexed the kingdom
  pomerania  dalmatia  what is it with forgotten slavic nations becoming associated solely with dogs and nothing else
  named after area of origin just a guess
  dalmatia  slavic nation  dalmatia was romancespeaking until (((they))) invaded it and by (((they))) i mean slavs not jews
some people say its the true home of varg vikernes
  thats just an older incarnation of myanmar under a specific dynasty same burmese people not a forgotten nation
bump
  they were cucked by the kvshan bvll
  based slavic bvlls replacing effeminate wop nonpeople
  vermont didnt really want to be independent its just that new york and new hampshire couldnt agree on who owned the territory so they just governed themselves in the interim

this shit dont even make sense
  pakis in london arent white

any original idea for a /his/ gift to someone who likes exploring history general or with a focus on science and technology
  greatest meme ever sold
  original    he could just watch the history channel circa 2004 if he hasnt seen enough hitler and ww2 already
what did he mean by this
dude thats a white haplogroup
i dont get it    is gilgamesh a sumerian myth or an akkadian myth     i see people say its sumerian so it should be dated from the 3rd millenium bce    but i have also seen some say that it is akkadian and that it dates back to assyrian king asshurbanipal of the 7th century bce    so which is it 
bump
its nordic
  nords
  its actually an african story
come to /his/ because i enjoy learning history  instead i get board thats a combination of /pol/ and /int/  why do /pol/tards have to ruin everything why cant they stay in their containment board where they belong
  pretend that /his/ is infested by /pol/ when 90 of posts are talking about how much /pol/ sucks    why do people do this
  it is go into just about any thread and youll see them the sticky is almost ver batim the same as the /pol/ sticky
  half the time its completely invented /pol/ is a burning pile of shit populated by delusional americans there is almost no overlap between the poster base
  not true i am proof
    yeah but complaining about /pol/ is also a bannable offense suck it up bucko
  waah everybody here thinks niggers and kikes suck  clearly this isnt because they do
come to /his/ because i enjoy learning history  instead i get board thats a combination of /pol/ /leftypol/ and /int/  ftfy    commie shills are just as obnoxious
starscream did nothing wrong
  t /pol/
  because starscream was disloyal
  wherever i am i must subvert my host faction
  this is the only board where anarchists and communists consistently shill their stupid ideologies
  not a communist  you must be nazi
  just because every time theres a plot to undermine the decipicons from within its starscream doesnt mean that all seekers are the problem like /pol/bots claim
  because they care about feeling like esoteric conspiracy theorists and reinforcing tribal identities over actual history or good faith discussion
  i came from /pol/ too my dude havent looked back in months that thing is beyond saving
  based charlie putting both in the dumpster where they rightfully belong

philosophers dont make mone
  i think at this point we can safely admit that modern sargon of akkad accomplished more than his ancient counterpart
  sargon of akkad  mmmkay you need to go back to /pol/ now sweetie
  the modern one is a soyboy cuck the ancient was royalty and pretty cool the modern one loves the look of the ancient one too
philosophers dont make mone
  philosopher
  why is it he alt right so obsessed with him
  implying louis ck is a philosopher
  that is nassim nicholas taleb not luis ck
  loses debate to a tankie with a giant red mohawk
  comedians are todays modern day philosophers and speak more to the layman carlin was a genius ahead of his time and was able to put his ideas into words the average person could relate to
  which altright you talking about /pol/ calls him a mulatto numale pseud idiot
it pisses me off that sargon earns 6 figures for sitting on his ass and screaming about things he barely understands    a sidenote millions of youths these days will not grow up on the works of actual philosophers but the half assed works of folks like sargon
  he doesnt have works as far as i know he has never written a book
  sargon isnt the only or even the worst example the zoomer generation as a whole seems to be getting the bulk of their information from youtube videos or podcasts  think of the video essay genre
  unironically the most based thing i have ever read on this site george carlin is a amazing man
  most philosophers these days are just sales people who larp as great educators
    one more sign that capitalism is retarded
  thats nothing jbp was raking in like 50k a month on patreon alone before he realized people might think hes had enough and decided to hide it
this guy is literally doing harm and getting rewarded for it wtf kind of retarded shit system do we have i know some lolbertarian faggot is going to say but he entertains people yeah but so what some people get entertained by snuff should one therefore produce snuff to cater to this market objectively the world would be a better place if this retard and his audience did not exist
  sargons not a philosopher hes a tranny chasing furry fucking coke head who gets his shit pushed in on every debate he shows up for then throws tantrums on his channel and gets his friends to dox people he hates     sargons a retard low tier youtuber whose 15 minutes died years ago

are there any japanese translated books that go indepth about the pacific war i kinda want to read from their perspective and how they viewed the whole debacle especially after midway
  read this amazing story of a oh were absolutely fucked moment by the japanese during wwii    after the americans had won back a few islands the japanese commanders still had faith they could hold them back for a long enough time in order to complete their other objectives but at one point the japanese discovered that the americans had entire ships dedicated to one luxury item ice cream literally just a fucking boat to produce and serve icecream to the soldiers and it wasnt small this blew their fucking minds that the americans had such a surplus of valuable steel that they could use it building essentially a luxuryboat    if anyone has a source i would love to read more into it i only remember this story from binging wwii docs
  americans had entire ships dedicated to one luxury item ice cream
  it boosted morale
  it boosted morale
you literally posted this exact same thread before jesus its like the tank threads all over again
            ice cream was a huge part of american culture back then
  genocide can be rectified if the male penis has been tickled

  i mean its a manga but shigeru mizukis showa is semiautobiographical the rest is a history lesson and the 2nd volume is about his ww2 experiences
  everybody always posts this page without the actual ending of the manga  spoilerit goes poorly for the japanese and the boatgirls are all just deluded/spoiler
  what makes you think hes mocking americans  seems to me like hes just noting how silly america can be while also loving it fully
someone post the yukari pic with the tiger model i cant find it
  also i should note that its only history sections that are drawn realistically when its about shigerus own life he uses his trademark style
  must be disappointing to the japs that their precious yamato only fought taffy 3 and no one else in the pacific war and lost
  yamatos battle record is basically a national embarrassment waste of resources doesnt begin to describe it due to how much oil it took to deploy the damn thing it spent most of the war anchored in tokyo harbor as a floating piece of propaganda
    how does this shit manga end anyways are the shipgirls raped by american carriers
  unfortunately no pretty sure it ends with the results of midway
  coral sea  japanese lose shoho shokaku is still badly damaged and zuikaku still loses a large  of its air group us loses lexington and yorktown japanese still call off the invasion    midway  nimitz still commits tf16 he likely would have done so hornets dive bombers miss the battle as they did otl and mccluskeys dive bomber squadrons attack as they did otl just about everybody diving on kaga only this time dick best misses the akagi and thus she survives the attack kaga still gets creamed but the other three carriers clobber tf16 hornet is sunk outright enterprise is crippled but gets plugged by i168 on the way home during ongoing fighting around midway midways bombers now including vb8 from the hornet because they do not have a ship to go back to damage akagi but claim her as sunk in reality she makes it home japanese try to invade midway but fail in a bloodbath see shattered sword     us tries to invade guadalcanal with wasp and saratoga backing up the invasion thinking japan can only respond with three fleet carriers shokaku possibly sunk at coral sea or four tops again depending on the shokaku japan in fact responds with five carriers akagi has been repaired us loses both carriers the japanese lose soryu and ryujo    now japan has four fleet carriers and several light carriers and the us has nothing due to this america is forced into a ceasefire with japan getting everything it wanted when they negotiate
  doesnt seem solely teno haika banzaitier though
  i think you might be mistaking this for another series admirals decision is fairly faithful to history most of the historically inaccurate casualty lists are just false reports that the ijn filed at some point usually due to bad intelligence the leyte gulf chapter just came out on sadpanda japan aint winning the war in this series let me tell you
  was it by tatsubokuya
  
  this mangaka did a gup series and theres a scene where yukari finally gets friends who also like tanks and they rape her    it was pretty funny
    i think the gravity of the hell they unleashed and their machsimo militarism started to crumble at least in a portion of the population after the firebombings started
  my grandfather served in new guinea and it used to baffle him how americans insisted on bringing ice cream trucks along while everyone had malaria and dysentry
  its a bait and switch like all tk doujins
  to me it seems like tk while an edgy faggot is trying to portray kancolle from the nip perspective and so everything seems like japan is btfoing america without even a challenge and how superior it is to everything hence why in the later releases you see the japs getting btfo  could be wrong though
  it seems more like hes attempting to show the disconnect between the people who planned and conducted the war and the population that was fed bullshit for 4 years about how great japan was doing
  i guess that would make sense and would explain why here he claims japan only lost 1 carrier when they actually lost 4 in midway with the previous panel showing a jap saying japan lost the war to show a sort of disconnect
  he uses ijn official reports for an edgy kancolle doujin with hairy lesbians its pretty well sourced
  huh that makes it even more intriguing then though the hentai panels do seem a bit off
  does anyone have the perspectives of the vietcong or afghanistan soldiers when they realised they won a david vs goliath situation
  ive only read one vietnamese book about the war the sorrow of war but its more about how war sucks all his friends are dead and why he has become an alcoholic to cope with it mirrors the american experience quite well its an interesting story too      theres a pretty good novel called fires on the plain that shows just how badly they were running out of supplies if you prefer nonfiction the author also wrote an account of his experiences as a pow
  though the hentai panels do seem a bit off  he only put them there so people can buy them he told them if they were interested in a kantai collection historical doujin someone asks if theres going to be yuri in it when he said no people said no they werentt going to buy it which he relented
  you mean taliban right
  shame
  makes sense
  america  ice cream boats
  it was so they would take prisoners rather than wasting every jap they came across i
  jap drawing white guy with squinty eyes  will never not be hilarious
  are the shipgirls raped by american carriers  i fucking wish but it doesnt
  tbf id be pretty happy to have ice cream in the pacific
  yeah he only lies about japanese mistreatment of prisoners 
  theres also onward towards our noble deaths by him which the majority of which is taken from his own experiences
during the war with america japan would exterminate the nisei americans who were unfortunate enough to have stuck in japan visited their relatives when war was declared  the japanese would later complain and compare the japanese interment camps to the holocaust   help me understand /his/
  japan would exterminate the nisei americans who were unfortunate enough to have stuck in japan visited their relatives when war was declared  source
  i think hes referring to the battle of okinawa there was a large presence of nisei americans that terrified the commanders of the thirtysecond army since they could act as a fifth column and support the americans in the invasion of okinawa so they found a final solution to that problem
  dunno but you should definitely see letters from iwo jima if you havent already  its at least a 9/10
    the one boat the americans capture doesnt even get raped
  hes just jealous
  nah at okinawa the spread lies to all civvies about how americans would treat them and encouraged them all to commit suicide
  good to see tk finally exercising some self control
    its based on a real event
  nah bro i remember there were hundreds or thousands of nisei americans stuck in japan during the pacific war they were forced to make propaganda forced to enlist against their will or were killed when they proclaim their loyalty to america japanese families who had relatives serving in the american armed forces were at best shun by the community or dealt with by the government for their relatives treason
    why are you posting this again without context  
  stay mad
  the whole point is that the ijns official estimate of usn losses is wildly wrong how do people fail to pick up on this
its also about the incredibly toxic service culture of the ijn

  not sure finding literal gas chambers as well as historical photographs of them are evidence enough
why did nazis use inefficient pesticide instead of chemical weapons explicitly designed to kill humans even in open air conditions they had tons of that stuff in storage
  you have no idea how chemical warfare works lol
  zyklon b was not inefficient at all it was relatively cheap and only a small amount was required to kill humans in matter of minutes as opposed to its use as a delousing agent which requires much higher concentrations because lice are hardcore

either augustus or caesar depending on who you ask   dont memorise random dates  especially not random dates about wars i dont care about   portugal spain britain if you count the falklands  sun yatsen  garibaldi i think  no idea  frederick the great   japan ofc  either ghana or postoccupation ethiopia
  wait fuck i forgot guyana rip
  britain if you count the falklands    yeah counting the falklands while not counting french guyana and suriname is so clever
  see    i forgot about dont know why you think i thought i was being clever
i believe bukharin led the right faction its kind of incorrect to say stalin led a center faction because he more along with his followers vacillated between the two to get rid of both of them
  what was the first african country to gain independence from its european colonizers after ww2  either ethiopia or libya depending on how you want to look at it
  im not sure whether it was caesar or augustus but id go with augustus as the first real emperor  1848 i think so because i somehow connect that to the german revolution of 1848  dont know i think somewhere in the early 60s  portugal and spain  sun yatsen or so i dont know how to spell it  dont know  dont know  frederick/friedrich ii the great  japan  libya
  portugal and spain  at least those are the classic ones and they were the first to do it great britain seized the falklands france french guiana and the netherlands suriname i know that but i initially thought that only spain and portugal are needed

what are major historical events that have been buried by the elite
    forgot this     during the kamehameha dynasty the population in hawaii was ravaged by epidemics following the arrival of outsiders the military shrank with the population so by the end of the dynasty there was no hawaiian navy and only an army consisting of several hundred troops after a french invasion that sacked honolulu in 1849 kamehameha iii sought treaties with the united states and britain to become a protectorate state     during the outbreak of the crimean war in europe kamehameha iii declared hawaii a neutral state2 hawaiian heads of military realized that the hawaiian armed forces had been allowed to become dilapidated and would not suffice to repel and defeat an invasion force such in the instance of the french they set up several trades with the british for 3 recently retired british cruisers     they put into motion the use of pearl harbor and honolulu harbor shipyards to rebuild the fleet they once held after the completion of several cruisers naval commanders drafted a design for a new capital ship of dreadnought class the design called for the dreadnoughts to be 30 feet longer than any american military ship built at that time the design also had the dreadnoughts toting a total of 8 main guns compared to the 4 of american capital ships the first dreadnought was completed and christened the alakai in honolulu harbor 28 more dreadnoughts would be built for the hawaiian navy by the time the fleet was completed it consisted of 29 dreadnoughts 9 cruisers 3 british cruisers and 11 ships from the wooden era     the hawaiian army also received a major overhaul several gatling guns were purchased a cavalry was established and the infantry was modernized all major ports in hawaii received a pair of guns to defend the port honolulu fort was also rearmed3 after hawaii became a protectorate of the united states strong pressure was put on kamehameha iv to make trade exclusively to the united states even annexing the islands
    the hawaiian army also received a major overhaul several gatling guns were purchased a cavalry was established and the infantry was modernized all major ports in hawaii received a pair of guns to defend the port honolulu fort was also rearmed3 after hawaii became a protectorate of the united states strong pressure was put on kamehameha iv to make trade exclusively to the united states even annexing the islands to counterbalance this situation kamehameha iv and kamehameha v pushed for alliances with other foreign powers especially great britain hawaii claimed uninhabited islands in the pacific including the northwestern hawaiian islands many of which came into conflict with american claims    why do we never hear about this why do we never hear about the counterrevolution of 1895 in which hawaiians rose up against the plantation regime can we trust the numbers given us by the plantation regime which claim a lack of casualties we are constantly fed lies about the weakness of hawaii and our inability to defend ourselves if this was truly the case why were we not conquered before king kamehameha united our islands    iolani palace had electricity before the white house and hawaiians had the highest literacy rate in the world and in our own language no less what did our little island kingdom accomplish before we were betrayed our people disarmed of weapons language and political power did hawaii have a fleet of dreadnoughts to defend our sovereignty what could have happened to those dreadnoughts and our advanced society    what happened to the 29 dreadnoughts possibly built by king kamehameha iii while researching i came across this website which lists historical warships around the world amazingly decades after the overthrow of the hawaiian kingdom the us built an identical 29 dreadnought warships
    it is possible with disease wreaking havoc among the kanaka maoli any hawaiian dreadnoughts were seized after the overthrow by the us navy in a secret operation with upgrades and retrofits they would go on to serve the us navy in escorting duties and training during world war i and onward    after world war ii the capitalist us and communist russia would also take technology belonging to the defeated germans to advance rocketry missile technology and other military sciences of course because germany was so big the allies were never able to ban the german language and erase significant portions of german history    why was the language of kanaka maoli banned after the overthrow why were the people disarmed of weapons knowledge and cultural integrity what secrets were buried what technologies were stolen by the imperialists who could not tolerate an advanced and powerful nonwhite society in the pacific sadly many of our records have been lost and eliminated so we can only analyze history to recreate our achievements at the time of the kamehameha dynasty
whats the timeline of this batshit insanity the hawaiians started building dreadnoughts in the 1860s how the fuck does that work
which book/movie/story most accurately predicted our current modern times
  its quite clearly a brave new world although governments have used orwell as a blueprint for dealing with radical segments
these are now the countries of europe and some of the near east  what happens
  jpg
  danube  i am the fucking strong
  greater poland and silesia have had enough of eastern bullshit and formed their own better poland  fucking finally as things should be
  all those micronations  no
  austria hungry strongt    tbh this idea works best for the division of america
  ebin grossimperialismus is a good thing  kys
  one fjord in norway split between 70 different countries is a good thing  kys
  implying its not  kys
  he doesnt want anarchocapitalist neopagan micronations to be a thing  kys
  all those riverbased civilizations  seems like anprim to me
  the danube ends
  are those all rivers  fuck i didnt know europe was that fertile
  thats the entire drainage basin so it shows all the tiny rivers too anywhere that isnt a desert will look like that
  anarchocapitalist neopagan micronations  so basically north america before colonization how very stronk and resistant to conquering
  the danube becomes the primary great power of europe for a good while as things should be   the rhein elbe and volga become other powers of note  a clusterfuck of autistic tribal conflicts sweeps over the entire atlantic coast area borders probably stabilize to modern borders after a long time  the volga probably gets rekt by its neighbors because honestly who likes moscow  overall the borders probably end up looking similar to the modern day because so many modern borders are defined by important geographic divisions
  thats not what it was at all
  so what would this place be
  thats amsterdam also known as a big fucking swamp
ireland  basically the same then
  ok so maybe  anarchocommunist paleopagan micronations  is more accurate basically same thing
  thats not what they were at all
  what were they then
  i like the idea so much to be honest it makes perfect sense we are directly tied to watter resources after all
  there were many different types im certain and we cant just lump them into a modern definition of a political idea one doesnt like and likely doesnt understand if the thing itself has any sense at all   i dont know anything about what anarchocommunist nuts say and i dont know if they have anything sensible to say so i certainly wont put the primitive tribal indians in with them   beyond that their politics arent why they got conquered the fact that they were bronze age peoples spread about the continent with maybe 50 million of them total and that 90 of them died to disease quickly is why they were conquered   even then it would get conquered isnt an argument against microstates in the modern age and especially as time goes on conquering is something no groups or states do its much better in so many ways to simply trade   so what if a microstate is run by nutty communists or by religious fanatics or as a monarchy or anything else that people might get upset over you could just trade with its small neighbor and get the same goods and if you conquer it suddenly its small neighbors hate you and wont trade with you at all will you just conquer all of them too   i mean its just ridiculous to think thats a negative hell having a weak military is practically a positive for the actual citizens
  except lots of ethnic groups share the same drainage basins who gets the danube exactly
  rhône gang rhône gang rhône gang rhône gang
  the danubians 
  so does hungary finally get an excuse to civilize all you losers
  hungary  think ribers mate people from different countries from the current times would form a new super or mini country they should adopt a new language and they will surely make efforts to not contaminate the rivers they live in
  whose language or are we gonna play the retarded inventing languages game
  tfw im right between two ribers  they would adopt the most popular language in all the river
the reign of the rhine continues as it always has since the days of the franks
  yay hungary gets a quarter of europe
    you could just continue to speak hungarian in the hungarian parts and other languages elsewhere   these arent nationstates
that united kingdom is not too united
  more like the old west which literally managed to round up a posse just to square off against santa anna and only voluntarily joined the us de jure because they dangled sufficient gibsmedats in front of them
  anon hungarian is certainly not the most popular language in the blue region probably not even on third place if you count serbocroatian together the languages with the most number of native speakers in that area are german with about 20 million speakers and romanian with also about 20 million speakers  for german is a bit difficult to make an estimate since not all of bavaria is included in the danube basin
  meanwhile i live in rhine close to both danube and elbe might be pretty comfy
  meeting point of 3 major areas  comfy  you mean in the same way that northern france or the polish plains have been comfy
why are people from the balkans so tall    theyre not rich and they dont live way up in the north    apart from genes are there any other factors do mountains count
bump
height is exclusively genetics based environment and diet can play a part but it isnt enough    europeans today eat a modern diet of processed foods they live in the highest gravity zones yet theyre still the tallest on the planet and have been historically    its all genetics
  europeans is a huge blanket term for too many groups when we have nordics mediterraneans slavs etc    yet balkans are the tallest of the bunch
  
  yeah but im using them all as examples as to why height is primarily genetics based the average height of noneuro ethnicities is like 58 and under     and yeah dinarics from the balkans are the tallest more so than the dutch and scandis i believe      average turkroach is a 57 manlet and has had no affect on the height of dinaric bvlls
  are those guys related to the dinaric alps
  dunno probably theyre neighbours
it seems to be concentrated to the dinaric mountain populations so its probably adaption to the mountains
  just found this   
  explain how the mountains would have any affect on the development of height how come other mountain folk like tibetans or chechens arent tall    its genetics
  like scandis they have a variant of the i haplogroup dinaric i suppose are semiscandis
  you are right im probably wrong one way i could see mountains playing a role is maybe that the ancient balkan population were the tall ones so lowlanders mixed with new people while mountaineers stayed relatively pure   its genetics  obviously that was already implied by my comment
  even today tibet is not far from africa tier theyre probably even worse than than any east europe nation that and theyre religionfags so theyre not strong and rough like other mountainfolk thats why china never really feared them compared to northerners    as for chechens i bought they were quite tall already what is the average height for them
  taller than serbs
  no data on the mediterranean balkans  lol someone couldnt deal with being a manlet compared to yugie chads
balkan male here im only 510 my brother is 62 and all of my uncles and shiiiet are around that height it makes me wanna kms
bump
  fake
  the serb screeches as you point out their blood connection with turks
  self reported and measured on the same map  pointless
97 of balkanites are manlets  3 are tall  huuuurrr why their tall
    i dont think you quite understand the dietary argument its more about not living in a state of constant malnutrition than it is what were eating puberty is traditionally occurring earlier and earlier and our diets are one of the reasons why
  when your country is the highest average but youre still a 175 mutt
the union even the radical republicans pussied out hard and let the dxoid traitors get back into power just a decade after the war what should have been done was    1 liquidation of the dxoid political leadership  2 expropriation of all slaveowners who supported the rebellion and redistribution to their former slaves  3 answer any kkk arising not easy since forrest was hanged in 1865 in my book with brute force kill ten dxoids for every union man or freedman they kill place the education system of the southern states under permanent federal control until war guilt is embedded into their fucking genes like denazification destroy any sense of southern identity outside american identity maybe then there wouldnt be so many retarded leeaboos on this board
  i would normally agree with you but since you posted anime i have to back the dixies on this one sorry bud
  denying dixie secession was a betrayal of the values that founded the united states of america
  how
  because anyone should be allowed to tear the union to pieces on a whim without fear of the union fighting back yeehaw states rights
  felon nonvoting  trial for felony sedition of all whites in the south  florida reeducation camps with 90 mortality
  if we clamped down too hard on them wouldnt that breed resentment like the treaty of versaille there would probably be a second uprising in a few years then
  versailles wasnt harsh enough
  the dead dont resent
  just murder your own countrymen  wow what a genius plan
  jefferson knew that america would need to be torn to pieces on whim in order for tyranny to not get its foot in the door  look where we are now
  reminder
  its not murder its institutional neglect
  all this to make sure the underclass have a say in government  yikes
  because owning slaves isnt tyrannical at all
  thatd be a side effect yes
  most slaves were not brutalized
  lets make the government work worse because otherwise its racist  imagine thinking this
  it isnt  africans are bred for slavery like a grey hound is bred to run if anything putting blacks in free white society is tyranny as theyll always be outperformed by whites the statistics on black poverty and violence dont lie    that said slave abuse was tyranny what should have and would have eventually happened would be a slave rights movement similar to an animal rights movement  we needed to make it less easy to torment and abuse nigger slaves rather than remove nigger slaves dragging down both white and black society alike
radical republican policies played a pretty big role in why the kkk formed in the first place seems to me they just created their own enemies meanwhile more moderate republicans in tennessee were able to ease a lot of the tension and help slowly rebuild some unity in the state
  unity where the prewar tptb continue to hold power where the 14th and 15th amendments go unenforced and where southern schools teach about a lost cause is no unity at all what im suggesting is that there should ahve been a confederate equivalent to denazification
  we needed to make it less easy to torment and abuse nigger slaves rather than remove nigger slaves dragging down both white and black society alike  this but unironically slavery was a selfsolving problem with industrialization anyway
if it wasnt for those fucking dixiefags there would be no niggers in the usa and those shitty post war amendments wouldnt fucking exist  it was poor southern pieces of shit that put jackson in and got universal manhood suffrage passed too  fuck the south they were mostly loyalist shits and theyve been ruining america since the beginning is it any surprise all the zionist evangelical fundies are found along the south and midwest
  a confederate denazification wouldve been a massive waste of time resources and manpower that the government was more interested in using in western expansion and further industrial growth for very little actual benefit the first klan was dead by the grant administration anyway when even figures like forrest were starting to accept things as is not to mention the federal government needed southern unionists to promote union interests in the south and other than idiots like william brownlow who made a massive mess his own party had to clean up these new republicans just wanted to make peace with their former secessionist brothers and move on plus you had plenty of cooperative former confederates like lee and longstreet who was telling southerners to accept being reunited with the north
  we needed to make it less easy to torment and abuse nigger slaves rather than remove nigger slaves dragging down both white and black society alike  so what youre saying is all we need to do is to create jobs for blacks
  send them all back to africa
  no no  create forced jobs for blacks
  giving blacks freedom was a violation of the founding fathers desire more destructive then anything the civil war sought
  you only need to criminalize unemployment and give some worthwhile incentives for them soft persuasion always works better than coercion
  sadly americas greatest weakness is its eagerness to forgive  much like with germans post ww1 dixies twisted things to fit their narrative
where were the dwarves during the last battle of men and elves against sauron
  doing butt stuff prolly
  fighting some on each side although the house of durin stood firmly with the la
    probably selling weapons to both sides
  really there were dark dwarves sounds kinda metal
  sitting in their mountains eating rocks or something
  on their island where they were throughout the war   reminder that men joined in at the last moment and took all the credit
  under the dwainwithch king of angmar pact the dwarves entered into a treaty of non agression with sauron
  havent read the books since i was a kid but iirc its mentioned that saurons armies include a lot of different groups from the east including dwarfs and men that they dont really know anything about so are unsure why theyre fighting for him
    there werent many but there are canonical dwarf servants of melkor / sauron  
ruins any chance of the black population of the south to recover and form selfsustaining communities after the civil war  this leads to racial and social divides that still exist today from the migration of blacks north and their poverty    how did he do it
  ruins any chance of the black population of the south to recover and form selfsustaining communities after the civil war  was impossible anyway because there was no black upper or middle class their liberation added only the lowest class of workers to society and therefore it was inevitable that they should continue to work for whites even trying to establish an artificial upper class would have failed because so few were educated in even the most basic ways   this leads to racial and social divides that still exist today from the migration of blacks north and their poverty  the racial and status divided were already present the migrations north made sense for the same reason the migrations of scots germans and irish to the north made sense from the point of view of the immigrant the industrial north offered ever increasing work opportunities from the point of view of the business man an unlimited pool of labor meant the opportunity to pay much lower wages    johnson was neither a very good nor very bad president he proceeded mainly on lincolns plan but he had to deal with  a legislature trying to wrest power back from the executive at the close of a war  a party whose extremists had been empowered by the secession of the rival party
johnson wasnt great but he faithfully followed what lincoln wouldve done for the most part the radical republicans wouldve made things worse and johnson couldve got more done if they stopped blocking him every step of the way
can someone explain what exactly johnson did wrong
  johnson was bad about making absolutely retarded statements many of them really narcissistic like comparing himself to washington and jesus and accusing various political figures of trying to assassinate him he resisted the passing of the 14th amendment and other black rights but most northerners were fine with that as long as johnson could get the south to admit defeat and not allowed former confederates into political office the south wouldnt admit they were wrong in the war and voted for former confederates including the confederacys vice president on the other hand the radical republicans wanted equally retarded demands and fought johnson every step of the way which didnt let johnson get as much done as he could have he just really not the best man for the job after the bloodiest conflict in american history
  on the other hand the radical republicans wanted equally retarded demands  such as
  yes yes clearly the roots of the racial divide in america were created after slavery ended  its not like he was handed an impossible task even lincoln would have fucked up or anything
  nd accusing various political figures of trying to assassinate him  there was some fact to this certain obscure factions of the rad republicans had men on his stalked during the johnson impeachment   he resisted the passing of the 14th amendment and other black rights   because it was unconstitutional  the south wouldnt admit they were wrong in the war and voted for former confederates including the confederacys vice president  the southern politicians took an oath of allegiance to the us
  vengence
  i was hoping for something a little more specific
  freedman rights and giving them political power was arguably their biggest goal it wasnt retarded in being a bad thing some of the rights the radicals wanted to give them blacks didnt even have in the northern states so it wouldve required a lot of enforcing these laws all across the country and there was little to no public support for this in the north or south it was far too bold of an ambition for   a nation that just wanted to go back to normal they were also against allowing anyone who had anything to do with the confederacy to have the right to vote or run for office the issue is lincoln himself was heavily against this as well as more moderate republicans not to mention the radicals encouraging carpetbagging of the south is what started groups like the kkk in the first place
why did southerners actively try to prevent black people from organizing politically or economically i mean killing people for starting a business or trying to vote seems like it would be counter productive to overall development even labor activists got tortured and killed
  why do ethnic communities use violence in competing over limited resources  gee i dont know    this shit always happens because the groups that do it displace the groups that do not people instinctively form and cling to group identities because more often than not the other guys are already doing it generally the only way to stamp this shit out is to have a neutral third party come in and put everybody in their place
  the southern politicians took an oath    this wasnt exactly a good enough thing for radicals since those politicians went on to try to restore the south to as close to the prewar order as possible there were some legitimate gripes there plenty of union soldiers werent too happy about seeing confederate leadership going right back into political roles and trying to restore the old order completely      rich southerners werent too happy about blacks going from farm equipment to suddenly demanding equality poor southerners werent too happy that blacks were forming gangs and going around robbing southerners neither were going to accept the new role blacks had in a day
  confederate leadership going right back into political roles and trying to restore the old order completely  is this really what happened tho i mean what else could they have done elevate people who had been born and raised as slaves to a new estate hawthorne wrote a piece of semijournalism during the war in which he predicted that the benefits of abolition wouldnt be felt for generations because its impossible to make a slave into a citizen overnight     and then there were guys like beauregard forst lee davis who all made an honest effort to secure amends if i recall correctly
  he didnt ship all the niggers back to africa or at least send them over the border to mexico
  the south had a mix of southern unionists carpetbaggers and former slaves who took on a lot of the political roles first the issue was outside of states like tennessee they had practically zero popularity and the people demanded the former confederates back     really the best thing that couldve been done with slaves is kept the freedmans bureau funded and operational to slowly transition blacks like lincoln intended since it wouldve given blacks small farms job opportunities education and so on johnson stripped funding out of it and grant put the final nail in the coffin for the bureau though    as for those names i can say for a fact lee longstreet and beauregard did fully recommit to the union and told southerners to put away the past and move on davis mostly kept to himself after he got out of prison and was just trying to keep his family afloat though he wasnt happy about reconstruction efforts forrest was a kkk leader so he was rather hostile until much later in his life when he chilled out dramatically       this wasnt realistic under lincoln and it especially wasnt realistic under johnson
  forrest was a kkk leader so he was rather hostile until much later in his life when he chilled out dramatically  forest disbanded the kkk when it degenerated into a terror squad tho
  he disbanded it when its focus became lynching blacks forrest didnt really give a shit about blacks he cared about carpetbaggers
  blacks were forming gangs and going around robbing southerners  this never happened
  why do you think he gave a fuck about blacks his real crime was not shipping them all to africa or brazil anyway thats what lincoln wanted
  yes it did some took the attitude that freedom from slavery meant freedom from work so some just laid around and did nothing and others formed gangs to rob farms one of the original goals of the kkk was to keep said gangs in line
  yeah we all know theres no way blacks would ever be massacred under forrests watch
    the 1st wave kkk had no central leadership it was just random exconfederate soldiers with no management or organization whatsoever any random person could go around settling scores and claim to be a member theres a reason it fizzled out so quickly
  im sure you could cite many sources about this then
  amazing you mention lincoln and got both places wrong liberia was already a failure by his presidency his first idea was an island off of haiti and it failed so bad the us had to rescue the colonists the second idea was central america and the central american nations were heavily against it his third idea was convincing the british to let them move to honduras but died before this went anywhere considering he also was setting up programs to slow give blacks citizenship even lincoln was beginning to admit that colonization was a realistic solution      if youre referring to fort pillow forrest killed them for being unionist not because they were black forrest was exceptionally cruel to white southern unionists too he blatantly would overlook anything his men would do to them and would go out of his way to get them sent to andersonville      most of those random people werent legitimate members and it was a legitimate problem the klan leadership knew they wouldnt be able to solve funny enough thats also why when the larper who set up the second klan came around he could only get one member of the first klan to join the rest told him to fuck off
  yeah we all know theres no way blacks would ever be massacred under forrests watch    the massacre at fort pillow occurred april 12 1864 and has been the subject of congressional inquiry no doubt forrests men acted like a set of barbarians shooting down the helpless negro garrison after the fort was in their possession but i am told that forrest personally disclaims any active participation in the assault and that he stopped the firing as soon as he could i also take it for granted that forrest did not lead the assault in person and consequently that he was to the rear out of sight if not of hearing at the time and i was told by hundreds of our men who were at various times prisoners in forrests possession that he was usually very kind to them he had a desperate set of fellows under him and at that very time there is no doubt the feeling of the southern people was fearfully savage on this very point of our making soldiers out of their late slaves and forrest may have shared the feeling  general sherman
  yes it certainly did its well documented
  no there are sources showing up to his last week alive he was considering shipping the blacks off just about anywhere panama was just one of the options
  of course im sure you can give me a wealth of sources like he did too    
  of course im sure you can give me a wealth of sources like he did too  i can but it seems like a bad idea to dig them up since you have a tone of indignation and are clearly more interested in quarreling than in learning something new
  im not that anon and am interested in learning something new
  seconding 
  i can but it seems like a bad idea to dig them up since you have a tone of indignation  not at all  clearly more interested in quarreling than in learning something new  cite your source then
  imagine someone putting in the effort into making that pic all because they couldnt grasp the concept of civility
  this is what i hate about /his/ everyone loves to assert random bullshit and never cite a source     at least on /pol/ theres a culture of heres my proof
  lol you know blacks were forced out of jobs by whites pretty hard to get a job if white southern labour threatens to run mrjenkins out if town if he hired negros on top of the fucked up social climate of the time
    will post tomorrow if not in archive
  if you like /pol/ so much you should head on back there
  lol /pol/ say millions of things without citation and fucking manipulate things to fit their narrative all the time you are not fooling anyone go back to that shitty board and leave us alone
johnson  truman  lbj  ford    why are almost all vps who become presidents tend to be so shitty
  some took the attitude that freedom from slavery meant freedom from work  replace some with many took with take and meant with means and the sentence is correct
  was impossible anyway because there was no black upper or middle class their liberation added only the lowest class of workers to society and therefore it was inevitable that they should continue to work for whites even trying to establish an artificial upper class would have failed because so few were educated in even the most basic ways  ive never thought of this good insight
  fuck off you virgin weeb /pol/ack  this is an educated board so fuck off back to your containment board with the other inbred racist drumpfies     thanks
  johnson was bad about making absolutely retarded statements many of them really narcissistic like comparing himself to washington and jesus and accusing various political figures of trying to assassinate him  source
  i disagree on the truman part there have been rare occurrences like coolidge or arthur that did good
  the radical republicans wouldve made things worse and johnson couldve got more done if they stopped blocking him every step of the way  not a fan of this notion if the federal govt steps in to enforce the law and to protect the rights and liberties of all citizens as per the 1315th amendments makes things worse than so be it moderates are always a thorn in the side of progress especially with social issues the reaction to the radical republicans and their eventual failure is arguably why we still have race issues today in america ranging from political to economic to social
genocides 20 of the north korean population indiscriminately carpet bombs cities and napalms civilians drops more bombs on north korea than in the entire pacific war makes the destruction of dresden and the firebombing of tokyo look like a fucking joke leaves north korea in a worse state than japan after being nuked twice retires on a beach in california and lives out the rest of his days happily before dying peacefully never to be tried for war crimes     heh nothing personal kid hope you enjoy your dose of freedom
  only tankies see a problem with this
  based as hell
  holy fucking shit that is based
  ashes for the anglo
  this pic is pyongyang before and after    here is a panicked diplomatic cable sent to the united nations in 1951 by north koreas foreign minister    on january 3 at 1030 am an armade of 82 flying fortresses loosed their deathdealing load on the city of pyongyang     hundreds of tons of bombs and incendiary compound were simultaneously dropped throughout the city causing annihilating fires in order to prevent the extinction of these fires the transatlantic barbarians bombed the city with delayedaction highexplosive bombs which exploded at intervals throughout for a whole day making it impossible for the people to come out onto the streets the entire city has now been burning enveloped in flames for two days by the second day 7812 civilians houses had been burnt down the americans were well aware that there were no military objectives left in pyongyang     the number of inhabitants of pyongyang killed by bomb splinters burnt alive and suffocated by smoke is incalculable since no computation is possible some fifty thousand inhabitants remain in the city which before the war had a population of five hundred thousand    how the fuck can americans justify this
  they were communists
subsequently lemay while being fully aware of wallaces segregationist platform decided to throw his support to wallace and eventually became wallaces running mate    wallaces staff began to consider lemay to be politically tonedeaf and the former air force general did nothing to diminish the perception of extremism that some american voters had of the wallacelemay ticket    this dude was too crazy for george fucking wallace
  cus fuck you thats why
  probably shouldnt have invaded the south which was backed by the strongest air force in the world
  i never understood this executing civilians and pillaging and raping cities are war crimes but if you drop a bomb from a plane then suddenly its ok
  this is a real fucking quote this is who america puts in charge of strategic bomber command
  its ok because if the city has aa guns its a military installation
  his only mistake was not bombing california
  hes also responsible for the euphemism bombed back to the stoneage
  has one man ever been so right
  curtis stone age lemay  curtis nip the nip lemay  curtis slap the jap lemay  curtis bombs away lemay  curtis tokyo inferno lemay  curtis slant slammer lemay  curtis cook the gook lemay  curtis charred charlies lemay  curtis fire upon nippon lemay  curtis pyongyang pyromaniac lemay  curtis ten ton terror of tokyo lemay  curtis avenger of pearl harbor lemay  curtis takeshi into grilled sushi lemay  curtis going mental on the oriental lemay  curtis bomber flies for the slanted eyes lemay
  american exceptionalism is definitely a thing there was a strategy and the enemies seemed important enough to abandon ethics and fight like it was a world war its both chinas and the uns fault tho
reminder that according to american logic japan never commited any crimes
  reminder that according to american logic japan never commited any crimes  there crime was not being white desu
  the eternal mutt everyone
  injun spearchuckers rape and massacre other injun spearchuckers  white settlers stop this   somehow immoral   japs rape kill and bomb everyone in asia  japs attack us unprovoked  japs kill pows  japs get absolutely btfo and nuked twice  somehow immoral   krauts rape kill and bomb half of europe   krauts get bombed in return   somehow immoral
  he was a politician after the war
  he tried to make nuclear war with the soviet union after the war
  transatlantic barbarians
  start shit get hit
do it again bombs away lemay
  it was more he tried to make nuclear war with cuba after the war the soviet union wasnt in a position to do fuck all during the cmc and kennedy is a hack for not calling khrushchevs bluff
  seems like a guy who unironically did nothing wrong
    pure and pointless cruelty    if they considered it a war crime in ww2 theyd have to convict themselves
  chinks and japs bombs you  you bomb them  cruel
  exactly what ithought what an oddly apt term
  yeah man never forget the new york bombing of 51  its wrong no matter who does it
  whats your autistic post even trying to say
  war crimes  he didnt do anything wrong except not dropping more bombs on nk 
  its just anglogermanicjudaic psychopathy coupled to industrial war machine the germans did the same thing in warsaw
      should have surrendered there kimmy
  i am asking what bombing were americans supposedly retaliating against you retard  and in the next line im making a plain statement
  do not invade south korea leave south korea alone or get bombed this is your final warning  united states of america    north koreans proceed to attack south korea  get bombed  really makes me think
  the bombings of south korea
  le may thread  based and bombpilled
  south korea invaded north korea according to us senator vito marcantonio
  do not try to unite your country otherwise we will brutally murder your civilian population  wow americans were truly the good guys
  i thought nationalism was evil now
  ashes for the anglo      absolutely redpilled
  why gook lying bottom picture is manila
  then why not hold a referendum
  i read this in dan carlins voice
  i think its immoral because actual humans know better
  as nice as reunification sounds did it ever occur to you that maybe south koreans didnt want to live under communism this isnt vietnam kim ilsung wasnt as popular with all koreans as ho chiminh was to the vietnamese
probably one of the best things jfk ever did was tell him to go fuck himself during the cuban missile crisis
why wont practicing jewish and muslim individuals eat pig meat does that reason still make sense today
  i cant speak for muslims but the ot is pretty clear that the dietary restrictions for jews is to ensure that the jews dont share meals with their caananite neighbors and instead develop their own culinary culture based around their own eating habits that others are unlikely to share
  does that reason still make sense today  yes
  well whtats the reason
  do you suppose that the custom was invented to keep jews from sharing meals with their neighbors or did the ot create the justification for a practice that had already been going on
  impossible to really determine its not like there are other documents from the era and archeology isnt fine grained enough to answer that kind of question short of someone inventing a time machine to go back and look i doubt it will ever actually be answered
ive asked several muslims why cant they eat pork and their answers doesnt go beyond because some camel riding dude who lived 1500 years ago dont want us to
  cause its gay
this thread is weak i dont know shit but clean meat seems to usually be that not of a predator but of prey there are general scientific health reasons that this is better because you arent eating shit that eats shit it is also interesting that a lot of religion has rules about washing and not taking a dump close to where you live
  how can you not eat blood pudding and blood sausage    muslims are retarded fucks
  my muslim friend said its beacause pigs are disgusting and eat shit    one time he said the word pork and then ran to the washroom and rinsed his mouth 3 times lmao
  ive heard stories that the protojewish people were cannibals and since cooked pork smells and tastes like people its a grim reminder of what they used to be
  there is a theory that religious dietary restrictions may have originated out of necessity as a way of discouraging people from consuming foods that had a higher chance of contamination in a given region    if you assume that thats the reason for kosher/halal distinctions then no it makes no sense why youd practice it today if you live in a country that mandates that any meat sold in a store has to be edible and any idiot can google that youre not supposed to cook shellfish that are open and dead because theyll give you horrible food poisoning
  tell him that cows and rabbits also eat shit kek  theres no point debating them
  its not even a particularly good theory for back in the day one of the simplest things that archeologists use to determine ancient hebrew settlements from neighboring tribe settlements is looking for pig bones that carries the implications that the neighbors were in fact eating pork shellfish hunted meat etc and werent dying off in droves
lewin reported that  consumption of fresh warm camel feces has been recommended by bedouins as a remedy for bacterial dysentery its efficacy probably attributable to the antibiotic subtilisin from bacillus subtilis was anecdotally confirmed by german soldiers in africa during world war ii16  the absolute monarchic state of arabia
  implying  n its because pork storks and other crap is unclean says so
why are scandis so pathetically arrogant about nordics being the most important race they were barbarian animals during the most part of history not a lot better than afriacn niggies
light haired boys are literally born to be bacha bazi boy toys for hairy med bears
  even then light hair isnt exclusive to nordics
  because theyre the best looking people on earth it has nothing to do with intelligence or technology or anything like that its just a simple fact that scandis are beautiful attractive people and they are admired and envied by the rest of the world primarily for that reason
  implying actual scandis are patriotic and chauvinistic   implying actual scandis arent autistically masochistic cuckolds who hate themselves     nordicist posters are burgers
  i think asians are cuter
  this but they are the best looking people because of the social meme that is beauty its not some inherent property of nature
  i understand it they look the most unique and theyre naturally tall a lot of cultures across asia particularly islamic and east asian associate whiteness/lightness with purity so a race of light featured people are culturally appealing the argument that they are the master race falls flat when you look at history though scandinavians were some of the last people to adopt settled civilization their original religion is basically incoherent nonuniform abbo tier stories sweden itself was one of the most backwards areas on earth until the 20th century even into the late 19th century they were mixing bark with their porridge to get meals with larger volumes
  i dunno platinum blond hair bright blue eyes and sharp angular features are only found in northern europe so there is a rarity about their appearance that isnt a social construct
  they arent though  first of all even in europe med men are more popular and this ignores the fact that there are many who prefer east asian women  in lots of parts of the world people generally prefer people who look like them
  that might be true of the men but if you think nordic women arent intensely fetishized you are delusional
  they were too busy being the ruling class everywhere else  only scandinavians can have blonde hair  all other blondes are assimilated scandinavians this is a genetic fact literally only scandis can have blonde hair
  you do understand how subjective beauty is right how much it has changed over time and culture    google qajar harem to see 19th century persian beauty     even within europe pale skin and soft features arent seen as beautiful like it was just a couple centuries ago now women are trying to tan up and get toned which used to be seen as low class peasantry
  true but theyre not the only ones  also contrary to nordicism stereotypes of blondes include cognitive deficiency
  were not its usually larping americans that make those threads
  the nordicist autists who plague this board are not scandinavians   theyre literally in most cases unironic 63ers who in many cases dont even have either blonde hair or light eyes
  meds win when they are tall and big but 80 of the time meds are shorter and tiny so the nordics win
  blonde blue eyed women are the most fetishized with asians probably the second most and the dumb blonde stereotype is part of the appeal because lots of men are turned on by the whole ditzy bimbo thing
  implying actual scandis arent autistically masochistic cuckolds who hate themselves  wew lad i though those are memes is that really a nationwide thing
  just google sweden yes
  well sweden got the cucktrophy  we norwegians are all depressed and borderline suicidal though
  asians second most  nah mate literally all of europe comes before this in fact asians are considered ugly in europe it is only in america that ugly white men find them attractive
  not at all dont believe the trolls the nordics are mild mannered because they are so alpha that they dont have to ever act aggressive its like how guys who are 66 are super nice because they literally never have to prove themselves
  oh so thats why cuckoldry is almost exclusively a white person thing
  you mean an american thing
  its really bad almost makes you hate them even more    durr hurr look at me im retarded everybody  heres the you    this is demonstrably false knowing how many hapas are produced by dutch and swedish fathers
  i disagree the whole kpop phenomenon shows how asian girls are a hot commodity because they are exotic just like blonde blue eyed girls for most of the world i dont see anyone really with a fetish for brown haired brown eyed girls
  this is demonstrably false knowing how many hapas are produced by dutch and swedish fathers  literally none
  kpop is irrelevant dont think the average man would even know what that is
  nordicist are mostly americans who just cant stand the thought that the meds with their evil slightly tanned complexion done great things
  prove me wrong faggot
  grown men sure but young people who use social media will at least have seen it even if they dont actually listen to it
     just how come a mutt is more obsessed with races than representatives of those races werent they supposed to be the ones least involved in it
  muh ancient history  disregarding the time gap and context where people in africa and middle east existed for thousands of years before europe was inhabited its a trillion times more impressive using mathematics to create modern rockets/firearms/modern technology in general than it is too just create a number system
  most really arent  were just from countries that are ethnically homogeneous sweden not included which is what people see first and pay the most attention to   if anything the only thing we have that is worthy of bragging about is our good social mobility safety nets and government structure    the only people who actually act arrogant about being from scandinavia are acne ridden limpwristed incels who have nothing else to be proud of
  see  kpop is a sparky shitshow for teenagers once they grow up they gonna laugh at those sissy boys with artificial faces
  lol what  northern europe has been inhabited by homo sapiens for at least 30000 years
90 of the people that thinks this way is not from scandinavia
  you still need basic knowledge and highly functionate civilization to obtain that level of impressiveness    id say scandis are very good at making things better but not at directly inventing them
  theyre good at making things better and not inventing them    good stormfaggot logic right there lets leave the theories of science and engineering to intelligent people ok
  you dont understand what im saying im not saying kpop is good im saying its evidence that asian girls have global appeal you dont see latin american pop music on some random german teens facebook because latinas are less fetishized than asians even if they make better music
  europe has been inhabited for tens of thousands of years
i wont reveal the forum name on here but there is this forum where women go to complain about men one of the chief complaints is by nonwhite american women the come here europe and literally nobody gives them any attention and they go mad because imagine going from decently attractive to ugly in just 24 hours lol its mostly the asians that fare the worst reading through the forum is one of my biggest delights
  i was under the impression that the middle east and east africa were inhabitated by modern humans longer than europe or at least certain parts of europe which allowed them to make these mathematical advancements and the fact that nordic people are one of the newer races makes their vast modern scientific and mathematical achievements more impressive regardless of the fact that they were built upon the shoulders and ideas of ancient societies  and thats besides the point that too me its more impressive to use math to invent rocket travel than it is too just create a numerical system     yes id say europeans are better inventors/explorers than they are at building civilizations
  is it due to culture based on competition
  he hasnt seen happas
  no creating mathematics in the first place is the hardest part humans went from mathematics to rockets in a very short time span it took tens of thousands and possibly hundreds of thousands of years to get to mathematics
  also hes making very specific and eurocentric judgements on the significance of both the concept of invention and the invention itself  consider all the other aspects of the civilisation and what impact the invention had look at the quality of life the artistic achievements to get a better understanding of context  a rather extreme but illustrative example would be this consider a civilisation of sprawling palaces large urban areas widespread irrigation and a robust sewage system  now consider that most of its inventive effort is artistic or expanding its urbanisation and reducing poverty  now imagine a civilisation with a more individualistic attitude where urban areas are few and small public works are limited and many live in irreconcilable poverty  but most of its inventive effort is a product of the privileged few with an interest in better understanding the world and hence they have a good knowledge of sciences     can you really say that one civilisation is greater than the other
  nah in my experience all germanic are smug little shits who think they are the best ever   oh but anon how can that be they hate nationalism and ethnic pride  germanics literally take national pride in their own lack of national pride and cast judgement on all lesser races who have not instituted the same sort of antinationalist social democratic program they have and despite their hate of racism that only applies to nonwhites most of them are extra smug and chauvinistic toward eastern europeans speaking openly about how inferior we are like it is 1940
  but mathematics werent created through a long process of failure and elimination were they it seems they were created out of a necessity and happened pretty quickly much like rocket technology and other scientific advancements and the reason it took so long to come out was because middle east/africans were too busy with developing the basis of civilizations farming/basic societal norms rather than sciences and once they establish society then these inventions of basic maths were created
  that is true but it is not just germans who are like this it is the whole germanic people its like it is in the genes dutch and scandinavians are like this too    and of course they are also racist because that is the same exact sentiment they are just not open about it
  off the beaten path for invasion no one ever really invaded them and kicked the shit out of them also pretty cold so not that appealing
    no doubt and spanish and italian women
  you do understand how subjective beauty is right    t coping nigger

  their original religion is basically incoherent nonuniform abbo tier stories  how so norse mythology isnt much worse than any other european pagan mythology and nonuniformity is found in every religion that is based on word of mouth instead of put into writing
  thats not even what ive seen at all most of the nordicism doesnt come out of nordics it comes out of larpers from other countries obsessed with racial purity    vikings were pretty cool
  lmao get real youre short and frail its literally in caesars commentarii that theyre smaller than gauls and gauls are in turn smaller than nordics the average height in denmark is like 6 and unlike the masaii or dinka people thats usually a fairly husky dense 6 these are a people thatve been described as physical specimens since antiquity its in carolignian english and arab accounts
  yh sure bend over already sissy i need to stroke that girly blonde hair of yours
  all other blondes are assimilated scandinavians this is a genetic fact literally only scandis can have blonde hair
  he says trying hard to ignore his ancestors were raided by vikings with basically 0 resistance
  bro most of scandinavia wasnt inhabited until after humans arrived in the americas it was covered by a literal fucking ice sheet until 10000 bc pic related
  the blonde hair is so girly that i wanna fuck this brown kid too
how likely is it that the religious description of early islam is correct also is the fragment a reason to believe muhammad muhmd didnt die in 632        in january the people of2 ḥomṣ took the word for their lives and many villages were ravaged by the killing of the arabs of mūḥmd and many people were slain and taken prisoner from galilee as far as beth  on the twentysixth of may the saqīlāra went  from the vicinity of ḥomṣ and the romans chased them   on the tenth of august the romans fled from the vicinity of damascus and there were killed many people some ten thousand and at the turn of the year the romans came on the twentieth of august in the year nine hundred and fortyseven there gathered in gabitha a multitude of the romans and many people of the romans were killed some fifty thousand1

why did the maori get a treaty
  the maori genocided the original celtic aryan inhabitants of new zealand in the late 13th century
new zealandoids are genetically kinder
new zealand was the vietnam of the 19th century     but honestly they should have been exterminated
  evidence
unlike australian abbos the maori were polynesian who have developed actual civilization
  why did the maori get a treaty  because they fought hard for a treaty
  didnt they pick up musket warfare quickly
the main reason was that the british were eager to establish legitimacy over new zealand as to prevent other colonial powers such as the french from building settlements and signing their own treaties with the natives if they didnt sign the treaty of waitangi its possible that the west coast for example would have a french colony similar to how the canadians are stuck with quebec being french    the second reason was that the maoris are an unusually great race one wouldve expected that an isolated population like them would be abbo tier intelligent but their intense tribal warfare tempered their race in a certain way and made them highly adaptable they prospered in early new zealand history having in one area their own township and racecourse
  maori werent a bunch of wild animals
    yes they also had a long history of making earthwork fortifications and popping up out of holes to stab and shoot you they defeated punitive forces several times
      just to expand on that their earthwork fortifications were actually really fucking good closest thing to a german bunker on the western front the brits would ever see before then          although outnumbered the māori were able to withstand their enemy with techniques that included antiartillery bunkers and the use of carefully placed pā or fortified villages that allowed them to block their enemys advance and often inflict heavy losses yet quickly abandon their positions without significant loss
    that is pretty damn cool
  this mixed with the fact that the british government didnt really want to spend money on a prolonged war against them
  gb needed consolidation pronot with australiaindianew zealandbore all falling apart at once  the loss of america yeah plus they armed them kek
  pronto
    wow they really kicked english ass
  because anglos sold them guns before occupying it big slip up on their part
  they had guns and knew how to use them it basically comes down to them successfully resisting british conquest to some extent by the use of force the abbos of australia tried but they lost since theyre basically neanderthals who figured out finger painting and sniffing drugs
  loss of america   why would the usa becoming independent in 1780 matter in colonizing nz in 1840 the british empire didnt even lose out on much money after the usa left profitable trade resumed quickly and was only interrupted by the occasional democraticrepublican autism like jefferson and madison
did nazis really believe this what are some other things they believed
you already know about the conspiracy theory circulated in meme format among /pol/tards  pic related but did you know richard von coudenhovekalergi actually supported fascism not only that but he believed it ought to spread to all of europe    heres an excerpt from a 1933 interview with coudenhovekalergi conducted by none other than julius evola   the fascist constitution could have a value that is more than purely italian but could be more generally european insofar as it expresses a wise mixture of the authoritarian aristocratic principle with what can be healthy in the democratic principle it concedes room to justice and the enlightened command of superior personalities and at the same time gives a solid base to the principle of identity free adherence and cooperation by disciplining every power in the name of the higher idea of the nation the european soul as i conceive it is characterized by three fundamental components heroism personality and sociality since the fascist solution includes all three in a wise equilibrium so it presents itself as the most suitable one for assuming a character of european universality    really makes you think

1 peoples views change over time   2 its possible kalegri saw europes defeat in wwii as well as its subsequent subjection by americanization and saw the writing on the wall instead of looking at the glass half empty he instead saw it as halffull and thought maybe domination by international jewry and globalization wasnt such a bad thing   3 its also possible he developed a mongrel complex
wtf i love the eu now
  kalergi meme debunking  
since im the only person that ever read kalergi he never planned to destroy whites he described what he saw in metropoles ie travelers of all kind mixing and interacting his book is actually very good   a classic enlightenment style
  mate kalergi was a life long supporter of dollfuss turned against mussolini because of the iron pact and based pan europa off austria hungary kalergi was essentially a less extreme evola if you want to know more read orientamenti but basically evola rejected totalitarianism and embraced a vision of an integralist eu ruled by philosopher kings in an oligarchy based on the waffen ss and knightly orders
  rationalwiki    yikes
  debunking  we have jew organizations admitting to shilling for diversity while at the same time israelis treat goyim like complete shit in their country
  white genocide is a neonazi conspiracy theory  but i cant wait until yall white people get replaced and die the fuck out lmao
  germans are truely autism the nation a german knows no middle road  hate jews so bad you want to exterminate them  worship jews so much you want to suck their dicks
  israel doesnt give a shit about your goy cuntry as long as it keeps selling them arms jews like sanders and soros support literal antisemitic movements like euromaiden and the pkk israel wouldnt be caught dead endorsing
  ah yes soros the zionist jew behind blm that is meant to cause racial tension in america hates israel ahahahahahahaha    fucking jews will say any nonsense so you dont see their shit
    x isnt real but i wish it wasnt    surely you are familiar with this concept
  why does a private citizen supporting blm mean israel supports it if johnny depp joined the kkk would that mean all americans support it
  israel endorsed hungarys antisoros legislation sweetie
  but hes not wrong     maybe the word that youre looking for is capitalist someone who has no loyalites whatsoever
  is not bad but the guy should have directly linked to the sources used by rational and wiki
  its the eternal anglo
  who are you quoting
   pkk   antisemitic  what
  soros is not a zionist hes even critical of israel and doesnt identify with it as a jewish person

    if he knew too much he would have died in some accident
the diabolical comic book supervillain j v stalin intentionally starved and decimated the most industrialized region of the ussr the region which received the most state investment the region most critical in resisting an invasion from the west just out of pure comic book evil  unironically believing this

hello my friend is studying french and she is doing her head in trying to come up with a subject for her bachelor thesis im trying to help her find an interesting topic but so far i didnt come up with much so im hoping for your help    so from what i understood it should be something obviously related to france french culture language art history politics etc but it also has to be narrowed down sufficiently to really be about one subject she is especially interested in art    my suggestion was about areas that were french colonies in the past and how the culture there today is still influenced by that apparently thats not good enough because its not specific about which colony and which aspect of culture to analyse but i also dont know enough about history to judge whether there is one specific area that offers something interesting enough to fill a bachelor thesis her friend for example has already picked a topic which is the comparison of the infrastructure of paris to a major city in asia  another thing we suggested was a comparison of why french and italian art developed so differently during the renaissance but that was declined by the teacher because its not specific enough she couldnt see the hypothesis in it    just so you have some idea of the range of possible topics we are going insane here deadline is approaching and the teacher just shuts down every idea and does not give any advice or guidance do you guys happen to have any ideas
  it is not related to art and i dont know if it is related enough to the french culture but is she interested in studying how a creole is made that could be an interesting study
    im sorry but i know nothing about that do you have a specific example or hypothesis that you could throw at me french has to be involved though

  he uses a computer  i smell a smartnigger
  what did ted k think of him
  he gained a familiarity with much french literature one of his favorite authors being jeanjacques rousseau  why does rousseau inspire crazy fucks like robespierre and pol pot
  because hes antirationalism
  because rousseau espoused republican liberty a system by which the government draws its support from the people in republican liberty the peoples will is paramount to governance rather than checks and balances this may sound fine but it allowed those who gain power to construct the people and exclude threats to their regime from the people to robespierre the people were the parisian mob and the rest of france was excluded to pol pot it was devoted party members and everyone else was excluded pol pot and robespierre could easily persecute those who werent the people and justify their actions by saying it was what the people wanted
  what did more damage pol pot or francisco nguema
  like with brexit and the people who support it going for the will of the people

why do freemasons worship women
  thats a personification of the nation you fucking idiot
  its a symbol of their satanic values and beliefs
  pic disagrees with you
   it was considered by the new republican regime as a national symbol of portugal like the national coat of arms or the national flag  doesnt really matter what comte thought
i dont think they even let them join
  the only answer
    they dont women cant even join freemasonry to call the symbolism as women worshipping is a misunderstanding and probably a result of your own hatred for woman
  they have a female version of the masons called like the moon and stars or something  let me see  okay so my grandmother was a part of the order of the eastern star  
  that image    if only they knew what was coming can we turn this shit thread into one about the portuguese first republic it was a shitshow but an entertaining one
  cause theyre a bunch of virgins like me
  the first portuguese republic was an unstable period in the history of portugal in a period of 16 years 19101926 portugal had 8 presidents of the republic 1 provisional government 38 prime ministers and 1 constitutional junta    oh nononononononono
  8 presidents  what were they thinking
  dumbocracy is a hell of a drug
worshiping a woman does not equal worshiping women anon you are implying they worship the gender which isnt the case
  portugal has grade a tits
      look at the top of his head
    poortuguese literally didnt know how into republic the expectations were very high that it would make portugal become on par with the rest of western europe however lots of tiny factions all had their different viewpoint and would not concede on even the most minute details then wwi and the spanish flu kicked in and made it worse    it got so bad that one government decided to enter wwi after germans started invading portugals colonies in africa but the following year another government was in place and they reneged on their participation in the war in the meantime a contigent of portuguese soldiers had been sent to fight in france and were basically abandoned by the new government lmao
  tfw 100 years later monarchyfags still havent recovered  just recognise that theres zero chance the monarchy ever comes back and no its not the superior regime or anything ive seen this trend in monarchists to believe that if everyone was enlightened they would like the monarchy back which shows just how autistic they are  you also seem to think that the appreciation for the monarchy is the only way to be a portuguese nationalist just look at salazar again you can love some particular monarchs and their role in shaping the portuguese state and not be a monarchist

the republic was edo was also really cool it was the last remnants of the tokugawa shogunate who fled to hokkaido and established a american type democracy it only lasted a year and was invaded and annexed by imperial forces

during the francoprussian war the workers of paris rebelled to create the first workers commune the paris commune it didnt last very long 10 days but during that time a number of factories were given to the workers and peoples representatives were immediately recallable they also passed a bunch of other progressive stuff like new womens rights  the paris commune turned out to be a major influence of left european thought as it was the first successful workers revolution and in part led to the split of communists from anarchists who disagreed over the problems of the paris commune communists for example thought it should have had more emphasis on leading the revolution to protect it from being conquered by france while anarchists believe it failed in part because it in some ways maintained mechanisms of the old government
  how did it work differently than the other merchant republics in the area did they have like a democracy for all the peasants did they have an assembly of representatives did they have a president or directorate super interested anon
  thats becuase it is hercules if i remember correctly what they exactly said about that subject on another thread
  mass killings of communists and genocide of timorese and west papuans under suhartos barbarous regime
  sad they stopped existing  scythians were savages good riddance
  they had a sorta of concil of families that made of 46 people it was a sorta anarchosyndicalist commune
  do you know anywhere i can read further
  romanchinese trading expeditions  roman expedition to southern arabia  phoenician trading posts on the atlantic allegedly making a voyage to ireland and cameroon
  wikipedia or this video      
  rome also did some trading in subsaharan africa
  scythians were based
  wtf i want to bow down to posusanoidan now
                    
  the asians owe everything to westerners infact the world owe everything to westerners
  didnt phoenicians circumnavigate africa
  indo europeans and greeks werent westerners
  cant you just enjoy the statue without making it about some autistic us vs them shit go post in one of the twenty indoeuropean threads
  japanese god nio is an adaptation of heracles
if the scythians were r1b then who was phone
   who whas it
    obnoxious idiot ancient people didnt know their haplogroups
  what i dont follow what would it matter if they did knew them them or not they had them anyways
        sorry if that wasnt clear i wanted to imply if the scythians invaded india why did they left an r1a fingerprint instead of their supposed main haplo r1b something doesnt add up
were the gulags economically viable  is slavery viable in general in a modern economy can it be used for things other that lowskilled labour
should criminals be used as free slave labor  yes
  in america this is already the case  but i dont see how thats a good thing there it only benefits the private prisons and not the society
the only thing these prisoners would be able to do is menial labor which is becoming a scarcity in this day and age
  which is becoming a scarcity in this day and age  i want to phrase it as in that the jobs themselves are disappearing not that the labor needed for them is nowhere to be found
  no it isnt  it just happens in third world countries
  explain
  is slavery viable in general in a modern economy can it be used for things other that lowskilled labour  yes you retard
  american negro slavery  which was low skilled labour and not economically efficient even at the time
  gulag  prisoners are paid in cash and recieving awards for hard labor  medical care is strong enough to heal early stage of cancer  slavery
  shilling for a dead regime
  the state of his
gulag labour wasnt slavery they were paid a full wage and yes slavery is viable and still happens its just its immoral as fuck and the capitalists wont let you do it anyway
  even poststalin soviet union tried to fix the mess he caused  rich and spoiled communists still glorify it
  lets pay shmoli shekelstein private prisons inc more money  lets create a permanent underclass of  lets treat people like animals and act surprised when most of them become animals on the outside  if youre going to enslave people call it enslavement  if youre going to rehabilitate people call it rehabilitation  just be honest about what youre doing    food for thought by some metrics america is the first nation in the history of mankind to have more male rape victims than female 1 of the population in prison right now
          germ here my great grandfather spent 4 years in siberia i never met him but he wrote a small book about it and it really wasnt as bad as some people want you to believe nature was hell food was often spoiled and bad but they werent treated badly and lived in almost the same bad conditions as their wardens he even was friends with one of them     either way comparing the gulag system to the kz system is fucking retarded
  sounds like something a slave would say
  in a modern economy
  china and the usa both use unfree labour with revenues going to the state    there used to be slave soldiers slave priests slave scribes slave teachers etc from the middle ages onward this stopped happening except in islamic empires like the ottomans maybe isis would bring back those types of slavery dunno
  wdym is it viable can you use slavery to artifically lower prices of course can you do this with general support probably not except for enslaving eg criminals    however slavery slows the progress of technology by cheapening the value of labour you make it less economically important to minimize the amount of labour spent on things so you incentivize the waste of labour and deincentivize the development of laboursaving technology
    america has their own fucking gulagsonly difference is tthat theyre in private hands rather than stateowned forprofit prison is extremely profitable
  whats the book can i buy it online
  the gulag archipelago
  was the gulag economically viable    yes it made use of the useless
    its a work of fiction
  turks raped every whtoid boi they could get their mitts on
  which was low skilled labour and not economically efficient even at the time  i see you havent read the book whose cover i posted retard
  is slavery viable in general in a modern economy  do some research on forced labor in modernday american prisons
the gulags never once turned a net profit its purpose was keeping otherwise unemployable government agents from being thrown out into the street  think of it as penal keynesianism
  even poststalin soviet union tried to fix the mess he caused  more like reverse all his progress
  cotton gin says otherwise lol you can use slaves and innovation as well
  the capitalists wont let you do it anyway    not if you add a shiny veneer to it or rename it
  the cotton gin saves very little labour compared to all the innovations in agriculture in nonslave societies could you imagine slaveowners buying tractors for the slaves
  you realize that slave labor is still used around the world right including to make objects that you use every day
  oh no slave owners actually got slaves trained in trades and other fields    why when many slaves were freed prep abolition and post many skilled and semiskilled black slaves got forced out if the labour market by white labour groups and organisation due to bring competition and doing good work for cheaper place hires freeman said owner or foreman gets threats to his livelihood or life
  yes and were it not used and were the workers paid more there would be more pressure to create machinery to do their jobs its like how people claim if you raise the minimum wage more jobs will be automated but if you raise the minimum wage from nothing slavery to something wages
  it was revolutionary at the time and yes people would buy equipment if it helped their bottom line and train their fucking skaves to operate it you really have to remember that people who run shit that uses skaves can also train them
  but there is less pressure to save labour if it is free
  there would be more pressure to create machinery to do their jobs    machinery does not necessarily kill jobs or automate them
  thats negligible if the gains of innovation or updating shit is better or he faces competition
  im not necessarily saying it does but mechanization does reduce the amount of labour you have to put in to one specific task and therefore diminish the necessary jobs performing that one specific task
now that its officially been 25 years what really happened that day
  tfw you dont have 25 fingers and toes to count with
  you mean 63 years right op
  singing and cheering mossad cameramen and one very lucky larry
  what numeral system do you use to count kek
  i still laugh while looking at photos of americans jumping from windows
  jews did wtc
the pilot was drinking and flying with a bush from fortnite
even middle school kids realize 9/11 was a false flag to justify enriching big oil and defense contractors via an imperialist war of aggression
could he have won and reestablished the stuart dynasty to the throne of england would he and his father rule like enlightened absolutists
what was their endgame
reclaiming all germanic lands taken as war prizes by other countries in the 1800s and ww1    stomp out marxism    stomp out jews in europe
  wtf i love the nazis now
hitler literally states it in the mein kampf conquest of eastern europe and colonization of it     reclaiming all germanic lands taken as war prizes by other countries in the 1800s and ww1  except hitler literally states that borders of german empire were retarded he didnt give a fuck about that foreign policy goal of hitler and ns was the conquest and colonization of eastern europe   not just that he even states that the rise of bolshevism in russia gave them a great opportunity
  you know how burgers manifest destinyd their way across america yeah that but with europe
  to crash this continent with no survivors
  save us all     now were running towards the abyss and theres absolutely nothing we will be able to do about it
  initially just to get rid of versailles and to increase german land into old preww1 areas in the east and german territory west of the rhein    them in 1941 it was a battle of ideologies  communism vs fascism communism turned out to be stronger more efficient and more brutal
  i have asserted my opinion that if nazi germany were victorious it is more likely that europe would have devolved into a nightmare landscape than becoming a cultured soviet stand in for an alternate cold war against the united states nazi ideology was insane and if they had won there is no reason to pull back to keep the population fat happy and loyal nazism is not vanilla fascism or even fascism with abuse and genocide against a select list of the other it is a total rearrangement and upheaval of everything every terrible demented evil idea about what the world should look like would become policy it is a vague concept of pure blooded nordics existing in a germany of rolling hills and farms where troops go to no specific place in trucks while an increasingly paranoid and selfdestructive germania sits as the throne of power in my opinion it would become like the khmer rouge or maos china in the maddest throws of the cultural revolution a fantastical unbelievable hellscape that can only be imagined if someone has seen a heavy metal album cover and has the imagination and tolerance to think that deeply about human evil depravity and suffering in all the multitude of ways it could be arranged and as far as it can go
ethically speaking should trannies be accepted into society
  no
ethically speaking if youre a human you are gonna be accepted into society so fuck off trying to alienate fringe groups such as lgbt when theyre are bigger issues in the world
i wouldnt care if they didnt act like such faggots about it
  there ffs
  society and victim are incompatible
only if theyre sexy and want dick uggos and translesbians should not be
  yes pretty much all arguments otherwise amount to muh degeneracy or some conspiracy theory about the libs turning kids trans plenty of traditional societies found a place for enuchs and third genders though mostly for religious and/or sexual use its primarily abrahamic faiths and even then not uniformly that takes issue with trannies because their obsession with having as many kids as possible in order to take over the world
no hormones or surgery
  except trans people are incompatible with western values which is why there is a tremendous backlash against them a segment of society who will voluntarily destroy and mutilate itself to be accepted to deny natural biology and to impose that if anyone has a problem with them then theyre monsters for caring that these people are naïve and being led astray by predatory forces will be silently segregated when possible because people do not want to deal with them except their allies that desperately want to warp reality
  why do people bring up eunuchs theyre completely unrelated
  no
  a lot of eunuchs were eunuchs by choice and many third gender prototrannies similarly castrated themselves this goes as far as some shamans being castrated and drinking pregnant mares pee which is so high in estrogens it was actually what modern transexuals used until the past decade or so it really varies culture to culture but its not hard to believe thatthe sort of person who would be a tranny today would do what they could to combat male traits from appearing in themselves with the neans available at the time not all eunuchs were eunuchs for this reason but still
  bitches about how the concept of degeneracy being bad for society is somehow a conspiracy theory  while believing in the conspiracy theory of abrahamics having a master plan to take over the world
  shallow comparison they see a rough similarity genital removal and assume theyre different expressions of the same impulse despite eunuchs being created completely involuntary and not treated as anything other than a man   remembering that most normalfags think that eunuchs has their penises removed instead of simply being castrated
  western values  judeochristian values
  using shamans in the bumfuck steppes as a comparable norm
  im not saying that the idea of degeneracy is bad if anything im one of the people who thinks the abandonmemt of shared morality and values has ruined society i just dont think being trans is degenerate on its own    and abrahamics are pretty upfront about their universal ambitions its not a fucking secret
  there were plenty of near east cults with weird tranny practices in the classical era too where do you think elegabalus came from
  elegabalus and norm dont belong in the same dictionary
  im not saying that the idea of degeneracy is bad  do you have any fucking reading comprehension you absolute gigantic enormous massive retard
  yes however you are under no obligation to accept them into your private life
  and how many of them were widespread common practices  for that matter human sacrifice was common in several religions do you see them extend on in christian muslim and far east traditions in any significant ways also  elegabalus  he was an extremely abnormal case
  im not saying trannies are normal being 1/10000th of society ensures that just that there is a lot of historical precedent in a number of primarily nonwestern societies the wests savagery toward trannies is unique
fforgot collosal
savagery  try damage control
no hormones for kids you have to be 18 to transition there
aa lot oof shills itt
  why 18
  also you have to call yourself transgendered not trans you cant bogart an entire prefix
  the wests savagery  so are you actually so delusional that you think the west is the only place that condemns trannies out of all the places the trannies are most accepted in the west even despite the resistance against their acceptance there
  ethically speaking if youre a human you are gonna be accepted into society   unless youre an evil nazi racist homophobic bigot fuck those guys amirite
  standard recognized age of adulthood in the west
  plenty of traditional societies found a place for enuchs  yeah in the fucking harem with the rest of the slaves
  a lot of eunuchs were eunuchs by choice   stop lying
  no
  you mean 21
  are you retarded
  not her but about the guy who wrote the kamasutra
all of the tranny issues come from men wearing dresses who look nothing like women so to fix this issue all trannies are evaluated if they actually pass as women the ones who dont pass as women are forced to detransition or get locked up if they refuse
  were you held back several years
  no you dumb cunt the only thing thats limited at 21 is alcohol in the us   18 is when you can vote and are therefore an autonomous citizen with a say in your own life
  18 is the standard legal age retard never heard of 21
  passing trannies are even worse because its deception and should be legally charged with scamming literally homos duping straight men into having gay sex with them thats where the term trap comes from
  traps arent trannies traps are just very feminine men who dont take hormones or anything
    mildly degenerate act is 21  but one of the most degenerate acts known to man should be 18
  trap means theyre trapping you by making you think theyre females this happened to the brazilian footballer ronaldo who fucked a tranny thinking its a woman and the tranny ended up blackmailing him
  alcohol in the hands of retards can kill an innocent being a weird freak doesnt really hurt anyone but yourself and theres a 1/1000000 chance you get a hot one like kalindra
  picture  okay so youre jjust admitting you have a degenerate fetish and you are playing mental gymnastics right now good to know now leave to resetera
  the problem with trannies is being degenerate the not behaving properly and destroying the minds of children as long as they sincerely pretend to be proper women theres no problem in my eyes
  legal standard of adulthood you are not mentally an adult until you are in your 20s
  a lot of wellmeaning people dont realize how barbaric gender reassignment surgery is for mtfs they literally cutt off the balls and push the dick inside the body making what is effectively open wound after the operation an mtf must dilate ie stick a dildo in his/her gaping wound for 4 hours or more every day otherwise the body will try to repair and close up the new genital on its own not only that but because their new vaginas are made out of manipulated masculine parts mtfs actually grow hair inside of them and must periodically fish out gigantic hairballs to avoid an even higher chance of infection    its disgusting and not only is it disgusting it is immoral to do these kinds of operations on people no matter how much they may desire it no doctor would charge a patient to cut their arm off even if he/she had appendage dysphora
  conspiracy theory of abrahamics having a master plan to take over the world  god told abraham that his children woul be as numerous as the stars there are many things in the bible that say to have kids the catholic church is against condoms its not so much a conspiracy theory as it is a fact
  what about him
  degenerate the not behaving properly and destroying the minds of children  ahh you mean shit thats not real
  actually society is so degenerated that im pretty sure they cut limbs off now
  having children is a plot to take over the world  wew
    full name
      youre an idiot
  the scholarly research says that mentally ill people feel better when people humor their delusions  wow you dont say
  you should try actually researching modern medical techniques rather than listening to /pol/
  i dont care about the wellbeing of transgender people if their wellbeing is predicated on the destruction of my culture and its values
  shes kalindra chan     time to stop posting dressing like freaks and indoctrinating child drag queens is a thing and you know it the masculine/feminine dichotomy is integral and disintegrating it is defection and antithetical to a healthy society
  youre an idiot
  good argument
  its not how is what they do an attack on you thats absurd
  oh seeing as your argument was science doesnt work i figure youre not open to conversation
  what are you claiming they figured out a nonsurgical way to turn a mans penis inside out
  your discription of srs is horribly inaccurate thats what im saying
  that study is based on selfreporting no matter how shit transitioning is very few trannies actually would be willing to admit their mistake to themselves much less to others because it is an irreversible lifechanging operation that is until they kill themselves
  the masculine/feminine dichotomy is integral and disintegrating it is defection and antithetical to a healthy society  whats your evidence for this assertion
  how is claiming that some women have penises not an attack on your culture and values  in my culture and values system there are two genders  you are attacking that because your culture where not all women have vaginas cannot coexist with mine
  well known by now that a large chunk of trannies that went through srs are suicidal  no theyre mentally healthy  you live in a fucking fairytale fantasy land where chopping a penis off and replacing it with a wound constantly needing to be opened is an improvement on their mental health especially when they realize that they can never recover what they lost and their peak years are their 20s before the folly of their mistakes comes crashing down in their late 30s and onward
  do you know how to read or did you just blurt out whatever you thought my discourage wrongthink
  muh tradition  muh natural order
  his description seems accurate enough to me 
  the evolution of rigid and lasting gender roles in advanced civilizations all of the weird shit post modernists point to in defense of alternative gender identities are from micropopulations of tribal peoples
  in my culture and values system there are two genders  you are attacking that because your culture where not all women have vaginas cannot coexist with mine  what the fuck word salad of a justification is this answer the question please
  stop thinking with your cock you degenerate       not an argument
  the evolution of rigid and lasting gender roles in advanced civilizations  that commits the naturalist fallacy your conclusion is invalid based on this argument
  you were actually right though
  when was that video made who was it produced by
  yes i can and did read the meme link you posted btw do you think that a site called whatweknowinequalitycornelledu is trustworthy in its handling of studies doesnt it seem to have i dont know a political bias
  i was making fun of the guy not trying to argue against his absurd position and he proved me 100 right
  weird that you have no actual source may as well have posted a picture that says im right seeing as it would be equally convincing
  the studies are subject to peer review youre suggesting a conspiracy theory
  logic is an inherently flawed system of abstracts while evolutionary trends are fact
  its a perfectly straight forward statement anon  our conceptions of gender cannot coexist therefore in order for your conception of gender to exist in the same society as me you must replace my cultural conception of gender with your cultural conception of gender    replacing my culture is an attack on my culture and i am under no obligation to tolerate it for the sake of your comfort
  this  fucking this  i genuinely dont hate trannies i actually feel the whole society is trying to help in a very wrong way due to the hype of diversity politics the worst part is that the absurd procedure they call transitioning is so obviously wrong it never goes well the person will never be the gender they wanna be and theyll invariably feel depressed specially if they have a gore horror scene going on were once was a pratical functional male genitalia  female trannies have it easier most of the time they just binge on hormones till they look like a weird dude and mostly just pretend on till sex comes up then its either whoop depression timewith other femames or they find a tranny male who kept their penis and proceed to have regular straight sex and have a baby with high risk of abortion due to hormones and the media loves it  ocasionally a female tranny spends a   fortune on building herself a frankendick via surgery what insane doctors accept doing this its the most hideous fucking thing ive ever seen it does not ressemble a penis it does not work as a penis and will likely be as troublesome and depression inducing as male tranny vaginas
  rigid and lasting gender roles in advanced civilizations  how rigid are they though and why do they so often differ from one culture to another
  so youre claiming that a nonsurgical method of transforming a penis into a vagina has been discovered  could you please cite your claim
  logic is an inherently flawed system of abstracts while evolutionary trends are fact  okay then why should i believe anything you say or care what you say
  depends on what you mean by accepted the only people who i would say are not accepted in society are criminals  so ethically speaking having a mental illness in and of itself should not be a crime
  keep lying to yourself
  do you dispute that that is the method by which sexual reassignment surgery is carried out
  stop thinking with your cock you degenerate  my cock is the only thing that decides what i do and dont condone for example im opposed to mass immigration because most immigrants are single men my age therefore my sexual competitors if the mass majority of immigrants were young unmarried women my age id condone it
  what makes your version better why shouldnt worse ideas be replaced with better ones     youre basically saying to say pink unicorns are not real is an attack against me because i believe in pink unicorns     do you see any flaws with that
  the good lord endowed you with reason for a reason anon
  you dont have to    they really dont all large civilizations have the man and the woman where men are the leaders and women are the breeders
  my cock is the only thing that decides what i do and dont condone  i usually dont say stuff like this but you unironically deserve to get killed
        except for the fact that all of your assertions are misinformed and unsupported
  why do they so often differ from one culture to another  do they  they seem pretty universal from what ive seen
  you asserted that this is the method you have not met your burden of proof with reasonable evidence
  im an amoral materialistic antihumanist though
  why only rely on large civilizations there are a number of cultures which are outliers to this general formula
  what makes your version better   what makes your version better  more to the point why should i care why should i value your comfort over mine i dont care about you in the slightest    do you see any flaws with that  no and more to the point i dont see the similarity between sexually derived gender concepts and pink unicorns
  yeah and if i wanted to live in a shack and count my own bowel movements for entertainment id take their practices in mind really i only want to live in a successful state so ill hold their models in higher regard
  where men are the leaders and women are the breeders  thats not true historically large segments of the population until roughly the 1800s thanks to the spread of western influence like all of america before the europeans came for example much of russia lived under matriarchy as well
  then you are not looking hard enough
  no and more to the point i dont see the similarity between sexually derived gender concepts and pink unicorns  its an analogy dipshit
  its very strange for you to use what is natural and then claim that somebody trying to change your culture is an attack on it cultural viewpoints change all the time a culture that holds on its views forever and never changes is extremely unnatural and doomed to failure you arent actually presenting any logical reasoning for your views youre just stating that these are your views and dont want anyone to try and change them because they are normal if you arent committed to having an actual argument then i dont know why youre here
  im not playing this game with you  the burden of proof is on you to prove your claim that there is a nonsurgical method of sexual reassignment surgery
  so because the surgeons who make money from this butchering tells us so it must be so right its not at all because the tranny is bombarded with praise and mental support from the moment he wants to transition no its the surgery ignore all regret reports and the 40  what im saying is maybe there is a way to go about this better than just embracing a impossible desire from a ill person something positive but that helps the person stave off the overwhelming urge to be the other gender often trying to be a stereotype of said gender  plus i ask you this how did that big research number came to be did they interview brazilian trannies who live in slums and do surgeries even worse than the ones above described did they interview a wide population at all or just the first world trans males who are essentially a pudgy female with a pube beard  if you ask any rich hipster tranny about it youll obviously get a positive reply 100 percent of the time its obvious  what annoys me the most about this topic its that you cannot ever question iti know a person who desires transition and i cannot openly disagree with his mental illness called dysphoria on risk of being labeled a evil person
  nay we all know they are mentally ill
  its an appeal to ridicule and a logical fallacy
  i dont need logical reasons for my views  i reject the replacement of my culture with yours and that is the end of it
  christian values   theyre inseparable with the west now
  like all of america  the advanced civilizations all had male leaders and normal models of kinship who ruled the maya or the aztec even in north america chiefs were normally and nighexclusively male yes there were female leaders in all of these societies but the role was that of a patriarch occupied by a woman no advanced civilization has ever been a matriarchy    and also even if it were ruled by a woman these are still dichotomous systems of masculine and feminine
  yes it is the duty of the society to protect all those who contribute to it why would you kill people who could make your society better or at the very least keep it afloat
  did you ever see that it linked to a number of papers you can read at least the abstract without paying often including methodology
  your claim that there is a nonsurgical method of sexual reassignment surgery  you mean that claim i never made and that you have twice attempted to saddle me with    you claimed that srs was preformed a certain way your evidence was a video with no label or source i dont believe you and i wont until youve reached your burden of proof
pay for muh bathrooms     this is a troll thread
  keep the lofty moralizing at bay if transgendered people can just be normal then they can be accepted providing they act in accordance with proper societal mores if they continue to deconstruct the myths that have been built up in defense of the society they are defectors and detrimental to the whole   the transgendered arent the problem its the way a good deal of them act
  so seeing as you seem to be so confident in your knowledge of this what peer reviewed research have you published on the topic what makes your conclusions reasonable and why
  do not tempt me with such images anon
  no its not its an analogy you can replace pink unicorn with whatever you like if it make you feel better
  like i said im not playing your rhetorical game  if i was genuinely wrong you could easily demonstrate this by providing the correct method the fact you do not do this shows that your argument hangs on debate procedure rather than any genuine connection to facts
  just like you should wait until 18 to get treated for cancer  for sure hrt shouldnt be prescribed like candies or antibiotics the process for underage patients and not only should be more strict but in no way it should be denied based on artificial age
  youre basically saying to say i am not human is an attack against me because i believe i am human  whatever i want you say
  thats a rather alarmist and specious thing to have said
  i dont think you really know what culture means people can hold different ideological viewpoints and still be a part of the same culture german nazis and german communists held completely different views yet both groups were still a part of wider german culture and again one culture doesnt typically replace another there is a gradual shift as culture is in constant flux     in reality this is an ethical question culture isnt pertinent and the only reason youre trying make it a cultural thing is so you can hide your head in the sand
  trannies are cancer  well i honestly cant say that i disagree anon
  oh so now your argument is i dont have to meet my evidentiary burden for the claims ive made     look i dont know about you but i like to have my beliefs be based on good evidence and reason im not going to believe your claims when you sound like youre shouting propaganda and you refuse to support your claims
  shut the fuck up bigot species is a socially derived concept
  yes you found a way to break the analogy clap
  german nazis and german communists held completely different views yet both groups were still a part of wider german culture  thats a great example how did that work out for everyone involved
  so you admit then that your analogy rested entirely on the compared item being ridiculous thereby making your statement an appeal to ridicule
  i dont need logical reasons for my views  thank what else are you going to use shouldnt you use logic logic has been demonstrated consistently to be the most reliable path to truth
  are you seriously claiming that trying to change a culture to include a viewpoint thats disgusting false and also gay as fuck isnt an attack
  please reply   species is a socially derived concept
  when the fuck did this become 4chan i never thought id see the day    its not 4chan its burgerstan isnt it this is who we are now so this is the power of zoomers
  its just /his/ i think theres an ngo or two with posters here plus people that legitimately believe in this goofy shit from /leftypol/
  no give them 2 milograms of pimozide and therapy then maybe they can be reintroduced back into society
  a viewpoint thats disgusting false and also gay as fuck isnt an attack  it disgusts me is meaningless argument  you have not demonstrated it to be false in any meaningful way   its gay as fuck isnt an argument
  you didnt answer the question
  gets provided with evidence  deny it  gets asked to provide counter evidence  deny it  why are you trannies so degenerate why do you like attacking innocent people with axes      leftypol and reddit are raiding
    thank you for revealing yourselves to be /pol/tards with no good arguments i guess
  both sides decided that they were right and talking about issues was for idiots and therefore ensured that violence was the only option left so maybe declaring that youre right and you dont want to listen to anyone is a bad idea      maybe if you could prove its false then we could have a debate here disgusting gay as fuck and attack are personal feelings i cant do anything with that
  youre ass didnt come to the points you espouse because of a peer reviewed article that you suddenly read you fucking npc skinjob     i hate that this topic is going the way of the holocaust and if you read that and labeled me a nazi and assumed i believed the holocaust didnt happen you have proved my point
    its like claiming that kids cant have   depression   mental disorders   stds   urogenital issues  and they shouldnt get any help for that because these are adult diseases this is pretty much mindset of many if not most parents who think that kids belong to them and they decide whether they get help or not    regarding cancer been lying in a room with a boy no more than 3 years old with testicular cancer
  what am i supposed to be arguing against that a man can become a woman and that these concepts have nothing to do with biological sex or something i dont even know what the fuck youre saying
  obviously the idea of a man becoming a woman is false
  look i dont know about you but i like to have my beliefs be based on good evidence and reason    and yet youd rather hang your beliefs on procedure rather than the pursuit of evidence and reason all you have to do to dismantle my claim is post a link to the   method of sexual reassignment surgery were not in ancient greece where proof of claims is burdensome all you have to do is ask the exact same machine you are currently using to communicate with me to tell you the actual method of surgery as easy as looking up to see that the sky is blue do you really think the ancient philosophers of greece that formalized our conceptions of logic would humor your refusal to look up at the sky while demanding evidence for the claim that it is blue
  prove what is false
  even if you spoonfed him all the links he wouldnt even look at the evidence anyway because he doesnt want to actually have his beliefs challenged he just wants for you to get impatient so he can say haha i won bigot and in his own mind validate his kooky ideas
   provided with evidence   it  i was provided insufficient evidence for the claim being made for the reason ive already provided    asked to provide counter evidence   it  its not my job to provide counter evidence for your claim you have to provide evidence for your claim before its reasonable for me to consider it to be true if i have no counter evidence you dont become correct by default       why are you trannies so degenerate why do you like attacking innocent people with axes    define degenerate and explain why it transgender people are degenerate     do you care about whether or not the things you believe are true
  hormones and hormone blockers have insane and irreversible physiological side effects theyre more analogous to lobotomies than chemo
  how so we have the technology to do it it happens in nature its possible so why is it false     i frankly dont entirely know the guy i was responding to was very unclear
  both sides decided that they were right and talking about issues was for idiots  howndo mutually exclusive world views resolve their issues through talk  a  i am going to kill you  b no i am going to kill you  c  just talk it out guys
  we have the technology to do it  uhhh  what  this is an organic biological trait  its not something you can just change and even if you could should you  it happens in nature  in some frog species or something what the fuck
  youre ass didnt come to the points you espouse because of a peer reviewed article that you suddenly read you fucking npc skinjob  so you know how i came to the conclusions that i have making you a mind reader and you add a little insult on the end there for fun cool       i hate that this topic is going the way of the holocaust and if you read that and labeled me a nazi and assumed i believed the holocaust didnt happen you have proved my point  i didnt why would i assume such things with so little basis for my conclusions
  do you really think the ancient philosophers of greece that formalized our conceptions of logic would humor your refusal to look up at the sky while demanding evidence for the claim that it is blue  false equivalency
  whoa damn you just pwnt him  his whole post btfo  i definitely believe that chopping a mans cock off and pumping him full of estrogen makes him a real woman now great argument  the fuck is wrong with these people
  honestly i only got my experience with these people in real life im only so against this whole thing because ive first known people to not be emotionally satisfied by the processes nor like the aftermath then i got curious and went to see how it works and got shocked at it  i may just have met unlucky exceptions but i feel this is just not the way to go we dont handĺe knives to suidical people we dont starve anorexic people this specific disorder shouldnt be a exception     maybe im really wrong and they end up happy maybe somehow the surgery does pull the right strings on their brain and im just tripping over the extremelly rare part of your article this is a case of i hope im wrong
    so by asking you to provide reasonable evidence for your claim the same thing you would have to have in order to have come to a reasonable conclusion is actually me not wanting to have my beliefs challenged how does that follow you clearly feel you have good reason to believe the claims you have made if thats the case then you should be able to provide for me the same information that reasonably convinced you correct     or would you like to argue that your sourceless webm of simulated surgery is good evidence of how srs is preformed now
  wow what an intellectual you just be
  obviously nazis and communists are never going to agree but in order to become a radical you pretty much have to abandon any doubt that you might be wrong i e you have to conclude that debate and reason are pointless to become a radical then when radicals seize power they stop anyone from being able to debate or reason with them basically claiming that youre right and everyone else is wrong and you never want to change your views is the first step towards radicalization which is bad in my opinion      well theres a reason its called gender dysphoria and not sex dysphoria its not about changing your x chromosome into a y its about changing your appearance to fit what you perceive your gender to be which is very possible    in some frog species or something  yes
  convince me then  post your evidence  why does mutilating a mans penis and getting him to ingest estrogen make him a woman  im waiting for your arguments
  are you saying gender and biological sex are not related concepts in fact they were the same concepts until the 60s when this definition was changed for the express purpose of the argument youre making now
  we dont have the technology for giving men wombs or even a clitoris nor we have to give women functional testicles or a working penis please come on    some species of animals do it  yeah but we aint one of then would be rad if it was that case but its not our body is pretty set in its ways when we are done developping
  i can only base my conclusions off of the available evidence that means my conclusion is a tentative model of what is most likely to be true based on the most reliable process for finding truth that i have available to me   personal experience is often a poor indicator
  ad hom ad hom this is an ad hom guys
  why does mutilating a mans penis and getting him to ingest estrogen make him a woman  i never made that claim i dont understand why you seem to think it is that i would need to explain that to you as if its relevant to any of the statements ive made it feels like you keep assuming what my positions must be and then setting up a weird straw man
  see  
  nobody knows what the claim youre trying to make is
assuming its all about looking like the other gender and not functioning genitalia how do we treat the vast number of trannies that absolutely do not look like the opposite gender but rather a creepy caricature do you just police everyone to make then pretend they dont see through the poor facade so the tranny does not feel bad because it triggers their mental disability we cant turn every tranny into a perfect example of what they desire to be and we cant force every common person in the street to not even raise a eyebrow when they see em so the whole perceived gender thing becomes    make the entire world go with it    or     make the person feel good about itself    hmmmmmm what seems better
  i mean for most people they are but for people with gender dysphoria they arent the same by definition    in fact they were the same concepts until the 60s when this definition was changed for the express purpose of the argument youre making now  its almost like new evidence was discovered and the scientific consensus changed as a result wow amazing      we dont have the technology for giving men wombs or even a clitoris nor we have to give women functional testicles or a working penis please come on  i mean not yet but its entirely possible that in the future we might and even if we cant the point is to get rid of the feelings of gender dysphoria with current technology we can help people get rid of most if not all of their dysphoria
  im still waiting for you to explain your position
  so by asking you to provide reasonable evidence for your claim the same thing you would have to have in order to have come to a reasonable conclusion is actually me not wanting to have my beliefs challenged     if i told you the sky is blue and you refused to look up at the sky while demanding that i provide evidence for my claim it is clear that dont want to have your beliefs challenged
  and why do you think that is you could figure it out for sure if you read the thread back assuming you dont get me confused for someone else
  i mean for most people they are but for people with gender dysphoria they arent the same by definition  thats because of mental illness not because this person is actually a woman in a mans body  its almost like new evidence was discovered and the scientific consensus changed as a result   what new evidence this was done for political purposes
  probably because you havent outright stated it so why dont you go ahead and do that mr bigbrained intellectual
  thats a false equivalency you have brought me no sky to look up at
  i never made a claim
  do you have an actual position or is your whole purpose itt to point out fallacies and call any actual argument a strawman
   blah christian values are western values blah blah  nah christfag people who cut their cocks off being crazy has sweet fuck all to do with your stupid cult
  obviously nazis and communists are never going to agree   and im going to find common ground with the person whose view of gender is fundamentally incompatible with mine
  thats why im asking you to make one so that im not strawmanning you like i said i was imbecile
  90 percent of people wont care that youre a tranny just dont push your shit on us
  my postion is trying to believe as many true things as possible and as few false things as possible i have not called any actual arguments straw men
  do you believe a man can become a woman or not you slippery fucking eel
  western values  no such thing theres several countries where you may find stereotypical values but pretending all of the west share some kind of common core is retarded    sweden is arguably the most western country on earth yet the us is closer to india than sweden
  i have no need to bring you to a sky as you already stand under it its called the internet and your refusal to perform a simple internet search using the same program you use to communicate with me is functionally the same as your refusing to look up at the sky to see that it is blue
  the us is closer to india than sweden  what
  no such thing  not even worth engaging
  i dont have one though im just responding to other peoples claims in the hopes that they examine their beliefs in an open an honest logical way as that has been consistently shown to be the most reliable pathway to truth    a claim was presented that sounded like propaganda and had not shown reasonable evidence for the claim being made i pointed that out
  pretending all of the west share some kind of common core is retarded  not really
  thats because of mental illness  well illness probably isnt the word most would use but it is a physiological condition and according to the evidence the best way to treat the condition is for the patient to have sex reassignment surgery and hormone therapy    not because this person is actually a woman in a mans body  yes this is true but that isnt the point the point is that their mental state screams that they are a different gender and if that isnt fixed then it causes serious problems      by being open minded i used to be a hardline only two gender exist person but after looking more into it i changed my position shocking i know people changing their minds
  changing my stance to the opposing stance is not finding common ground it is capitulation why i should i be open minded if openmindedness is simply a euphemism for accepting opposing beliefs without question
  well illness probably isnt the word most would use but it is a physiological condition  same thing with gentler language  and according to the evidence   according to the politically motivated evidence  the best way to treat the condition is for the patient to have sex reassignment surgery and hormone therapy  and despite this the people often commit and suicide and continue to have severe mental issues and it also intentionally undermines the idea of gender/sex because despite whatever surgeries and treatments it is immutable  and if that isnt fixed then it causes serious problems  no that just is the problem its fixed when they dont think that theyre the opposite gender/sex youre enabling and indulging their illness by giving them surgeries and treatments to make them more feminine
  a persons biological sex cant be changed so even if they present with the traits and features typically associated with the opposite sex they would never be biologically female that all said the evidence i have found while attempting to remain as objective as possible would indicate that the transition treatment plan if you will is likely the best method of treatment for a significant number of people despite that there are some clear issues with things like informed consent and the culture around these treatments on the internet and such
  the point is that their mental state screams that they are a different gender and if that isnt fixed then it causes serious problems  fixing it causes serious problems for everyone else why should we prioritize their mental state over our own
  it causes problems for them too mutilation is not treatment
  how is enabling an mental illness a legitimate treatment
  what serious problems does it cause for everyone else in what way are they serious
  the issue is being used by ideologues to undermine gender roles in western cultures
  also theyre often physically and viscerally revolting and make people uncomfortable at the interpersonal level
  you are demanding society restructure itself to accommodate these revised views of gender you genuinely dont see how restructuring society causes problems for everyone else
  all of the most reliably true information available would indicate that its the best treatment for the patient as is confirmed through peer review
  how is that reliably true when its not even a valid treatment again thats enabling illness not curing or treating it   confirmed through peer review  nice appeal to authority its not like academics ever have ulterior motives or agendas in their studies
  the issue is being used by ideologues to undermine gender roles in western cultures  does thats a separate issue entirely though youd have to set aside this disccusion to move on to regardless the issue is being used by ideologues to undermine gender roles in western cultures     can we have that discussion after this one im up to honestly if youre willing my intent is to examine it openly
  why i should i be open minded  because you might be wrong you dont have to agree and change all of your positions but if you dont at least entertain the idea that other people are right youre doomed to hold the same set of ideas forever ideas which might be wrong youre denying yourself any chance at growth       according to the politically motivated evidence  wow thats a big claim all research into gender dysphoria is wrong and its just politically motivated i assume you have some evidence for that    and despite this the people often commit and suicide and continue to have severe mental issues  while it is true that many people that transition still have problems and kill themselves the evidence shows that trying to repress those feelings with drug causes more problems transitioning isnt a guarantee but it is better than the alternative
  i feel as though you are only asserting that society would have to restructure itself and that theres a problem with that societys must evolve and change over time for example
   confirmed through peer review  nice appeal to authority its not like academics ever have ulterior motives or agendas in their studies  so you would argue that science is wrong/untrustworthy     that has been shown to consistently be the most reliable pathway to truth so if were just tossing that out then how do we establish evidence for anything
  you are legitimately one of the dumbest people i have ever seen debate in this board
  thats not how any of this works lets keep this in perspective this is a small segment of the population and gender reassignment is a recognized cure for a recognized affliction this isnt about the sudden deconstruction of gender  its about a clinical treatment
  how is someone transitioning from one role to another undermining anything      but what if restructuring society is better for everyone in the long term
  how is that a separate issue the premise of the campaign to deconstruct gender is transsexualism thats the whole point men dressing up and acting like women is a really old phenomenon they were just considered weird freaks and outcasts and rightfully so its only an issue when this is turned into politics and culture war to say something broader about gender
  so you would argue that science is wrong/untrustworthy   the people that perform science are untrustworthy
  having private property rights over ones own body is hypocritical   isnt this the entire foundation of capitalism that we own things that we get to control we maintain exclusive and special privilege over our own private property and other people have to accept it and not launch communist revolutions
  because the whole idea is that youre born into your role because its tied to biological sex obviously like holy shit kid
  fuck capitalism this is strasserist territory
  wow what a compelling argument do you really not understand the issues that come with you claiming to have been reasonably convinced of something but not being able to produce reasonable evidence for that claim if it was equivalent to the argument that the sky is blue and me being able to simply open my eyes you would be able to show me you evidence which you cant
  but how does the idea that someone can switch roles change anything if they are still fulfilling the role who cares if it wasnt the role assigned at birth what actually changes
  would you try to disprove his claim about srs procedure being as described in the webm or just constantly shitpost about burden of proof without giving a single shred of something to counter his point
  when theyre are bigger issues in the world    98 of ppl are straight  999 of ppl are cis    if you want to protect fringe minoriites thats fine but demanding society change fundamentally to cater to weirdo faggots is dumb inefficient and counterproductive
  accepting trans people doesnt mean fundamentally changing society dumbass it literally wont affect anything in your life
  but how does the idea that someone can switch roles change anything   because you are attempting to remove stigma that enforce gender roles and keep people fulfilling them which is desirable and useful having men trying to perform the role of women is not desirable or useful  if they are still fulfilling the role who cares if it wasnt the role assigned at birth  because people of opposite sexes arent capable of performing the opposites role lol  how does deconstructing a concept change it  it renders it fucking meaningless how can you not understand this
  but you dont have to do anything if you want to misgender trans people thats your right nothing about your life has to change
  this is simply wrong
  implying this society is unrecognizable  the structures in that picture seem to be the exact same as the structures in our society
  thats the point though hes not right just because i havent made a counter claim that would be an argument from ignorance you cant make a counter claim so my claim is correct is invalid reasoning
  no
  it affects the culture more broadly because this is just another part of the campaign to deconstruct gender roles which has been going on for decades with tangible results in our time men are becoming more feminine and women more masculine as a result of these culture wars over issues like this and this isnt desirable
  would you try to prove him wrong or get out
  then youre just being an obnoxious sperg either come to the table with an argument or fuck off why is it that you only bother people with a certain position but not people with a different one could it be you have some kind of hidden agenda
  huh i never considered that
  indoctrination is aok if the buildings are the same
  because you might be wrong   so theyre not open to the possibility that they are wrong why should i be    you dont have to agree and change all of your positions but if you dont at least entertain the idea that other people are right youre doomed to hold the same set of ideas forever     i entertained the idea sufficiently when i was ten years old back in the 90s these are not new ideas for me they are very old ones that precocious yet juvenile me accepted and espoused ideas which i have long since discarded and moved past
   its about a clinical treatment  which requires the deconstruction of gender
  what is depicted in that picture is not a fundamentally different society the fundaments of the society in that picture are the same as our own
  i assume you have some evidence for that  didnt you see what just happened with that brown university study
  fundamentals of society arent just buildings and clothes you fucking moron  the ideas depicted in that picture are fundamentally different than ours
  what are you talking about that is our society
  but what if restructuring society is better for everyone in the long term  what if it isnt  good luck getting that line to fly in other circumstances   come on baby just suck my dick once real quick what if everyone is better off in the long term because of it  s l a p
    no do you really not understand the basic principles of logic and reason what is so hard about this for you i dont have to have a counter argument for him to be wrong me not providing a counter argument does not make him correct you believe he is correct or at least are arguing from that position show me what convinced you and if its the evidence that has already been shown explain where im wrong in concluding that a sourcless graphic that looks like it was made 10 years ago does not constitute reasonable evidence for how srs is preformed today and that the claims made were true
  why does everyone keep pretending thats a different society  thats literally the world we live in guys  demon trannies reading books to impressionable children
  are they looks like the same society to me
  this is my claim
  the ideas depicted in that picture are fundamentally different than ours  you mean that picture that is from the society you live in
  go bother the opposing side then nobody here is interested in playing convince me  with you
  im not arguing that he is correct i am calling you out on your pathetic smokescreen of logic and reason in place of an actual counter argument
    yeah but thats fucking horrifying
  whether it horrifies you or not does not mean that that society is a fundamentally different society from our own
  yeah so what
  go away nazbol /his/ is a radical centrist board
  i am disputing whether accepting transgenders leads to a fundamentally different society
  its fundamentally different than it was only a few short decades ago where that person would be rightfully reviled and all the staff that let this happen would be fired
  of course it does just look at the pic that was posted thats a picture taken in a dystopian nightmare that we happen to live in
  is our society today fundamentally different than our society a few decades ago because i dont think that picture is unrecognizable from the pov of our society today
    what are you talking about please consider taking a course on epistemology im not smoke screeing anything what is that even supposed to imply ive only addressed a claim that was made have you ever heard something to the effect of a wise man proportions his belief to evidence    i dont care about sides or whatever the fuck im trying to address this point now
  and keep people fulfilling them  but when trans people transition they are trying their best to fulfill a gender role so maybe instead of letting them kill themselves maybe we should let them try to fulfill a role they feel they can actually fulfill     opposite sexes arent capable of performing the opposites role  i mean if you think all their is to being a man/woman is having children then i guess youre correct but by that logic anyone who is sterile is also not fulling their role and therefore is not really a man/woman which seems silly   it renders it fucking meaningless  not really if it was meaningless then trans people would feel no desire to change at all       theyre not open to the possibility that they are wrong why should i be  because you might be wrong its not about them its about you      what if it isnt  well maybe you could try to prove that instead of insisting that it must be true      what study
  is our society today fundamentally different than our society a few decades ago  i just explained to you have how it was because this sort of behavior was rightfully stigmatized instead of celebrated again obviously what answer are you looking for here lol  because i dont think that picture is unrecognizable from the pov of our society today  probably because thats where it was taken
  you havent addressed anything you have dithered about with procedural challenges
  then i dont think were disagreeing here
  please take a course on epistemology or maybe even just a youtube video
  well maybe you could try to prove that instead of insisting that it must be true  why should i  i have no interest in humoring the delusions of the mentally ill im not going to waste time proving a schizophrenic wrong why would i waste time proving a transexual wrong
  im not going to waste time proving a schizophrenic wrong  thats exactly how we identify that they are experiencing reality differently though
  no need im already aware of the nuts and bolts of the procedural challenge you are mounting   you are claiming that i have burden of proof to prove to you that the webm is accurate i on the other hand have no interest in proving anything to you if you cared about the truth you would easily find it on your own
  the point isnt to prove if they are right or wrong its to help/treat them are you arguing that trying to help someone with schizophrenia is pointless
  and i dont care  we dont restructure reality to appease schizophrenics and were not going to do it for transexuals
there are way to many trannies on /his/ that would explain a lot
  so maybe instead of letting them kill themselves  dont be a fucking drama queen if youre so concerned for these people then advocate a real treatment some kind of therapy that help them identify with the gender that they actually are not this sick transition perversion  maybe we should let them try to fulfill a role they feel they can actually fulfill   keeping gender roles intact is more important than the personal feelings of these people  i mean if you think all their is to being a man/woman is having children then i guess youre correct  certainly not all there is to it but a big part of it  but by that logic anyone who is sterile is also not fulling their role and therefore is not really a man/woman  theyre really a man/woman since again how many times does this have to be explained to you manhood and womanhood are biological if youre sterile then no you not completely capable of performing your gender role but that doesnt make you not your gender
  if the only solution is to agree with their delusions then yes i am
  your version of treating a schizophrenic is telling them that the voices are real indeed real and then pressuring everyone around them to humor them and pretend its not weird and crazy  bbbut studies show thats how schizophrenics are happiest
  i on the other hand have no interest in proving anything to you if you cared about the truth you would easily find it on your own  the person who made the post originally asserted it as true based on their evidence that was an invalid conclusion do you agree
  there are way too many transgender people on /his/ that would explain a lot  ftfy
  no  based on my evidence it is neither true nor false it is simply an unproven statement on the internet
is human trafficking real
  is slavery real is prostitution real is your faggotry real at least i know the answer to one of these three
yes theres entire law enforcement departments dedicated to combating it
few years ago the cops in my city found a truck with a load of terrified young asian women in it    shit happens
a girl i knew was nearly kidnapped they go for kids in the middle of streets they grab them and run off she escaped because the dumbass left his door open theres a spot in hell for them
human trafficking is the nice 21st century way to say slavery
  is it like when a beer or cola truck crashes where you get to keep the mervhandise cause theyll throw it away anyways
  is she anglosaxo american i thought only lesser women were targeted
  in a fucked up way this makes me jealous of women    theres an international multibillion dollar industry based on luring kidnapping transporting hiding mentally breaking and selling women for sexual pleasure motherfuckers risk life and limb and freedom to participate in this business because the money is so damn good but as a man im out here offering free sex with no takers pussy is that powerful
  the red market my friend is a very real thing
  pathetic calling someone who is envious of sex slaves a beta male would be a compliment youre a subomega tier male
  its not too late to sell that asshole of yours out on the street it helps if you dress like you want it honest question what is stopping you
  i can think of much less pleasurable fates
  nigga i aint gay
  thinking in terms of pleasure
  but you just said you were envious of their power tip if you already have no selfrespect your preferences no longer matter might as well have some power right
  lmao theres not much pleasure for these girls believe me
  argumentum nonsequitor
  so now you know why getting sex trafficked isnt pleasurable you absolute retard
  incredibly based and blessed post
  as long as its hetero its natural
  
  men get sold too you colossal soi beta  incel fun fact if you they cant use you for pleasure you will still be used for other things
  shes a pretty blonde girl
  yes    very much so     were you not aware
  implying
  just because they arent tortured for a month like that concrete girl doesnt mean they dont have it bad
i miss jassinchan
  shame she got away then
    being gang raped in between having the shit kicked out of you is a pleasurable fate
  for women it is
  edgy
  what this anon said    now get killed by some mexicans you fucking loser
how does one get into such a business without feeling any form of remorse or pity for the girls how broken mentally and morally are traffickers usually    do they just dehumanize their product and just focus solely on the money
  empathy is a fairly new social invention particularly on the scale at which it exists today hardly existed at all until white men began leading abolitionist movements in the early 19th century
i have never seen definitive proof of the existence of wide scale human trafficking i have seen multiple supposed cases turning out to be bullshit
  lolwut
  mmhh no  altruism has always been a thing theres even evolutionary stuides made about the subject
    empathy and lack thereof are both norms
  how broken mentally and morally are traffickers usually    not really many people are perfectly normal but do fucked shit
what the fuck happened this is technically the single deadliest terror attack in postwar european history since it happened in irish airspace no less than 329 civilians were killed i didnt even know sikh extremism was a thing
indian government false flag op to cover up sikh genocide all khalistan movements are honeypots set up by india
  t pajinder singh
  in no way was it a genocide lol not even close
could a new monarchy arise in the future how would this happen how would the monarchy justify to its people a return to an archaic form of governance
  its not really archaic imo its just a different kind of social contract really all itd take is a states society collectively deciding that a monarchy is better than or has less drawbacks than democracy there are various types between the two anyways this would basically take loads of obvious corruption gridlock inefficiencies and some major crisis or two on top of all of that to give it a chance
  it would something like what happened in north korea
tec8nocratic emperors
impossible you need thousands of men to manage a modern developed country
  what if its a small country
  a modern day monarchy would still have a civil service running the daytoday stuff itd just probably mean youd have a monarch taking active part in policy
  geneticallyengineered enlightened supermonarch
  yes after a few generations      this more or less probably in space it starts out not strictly a genetic thing but grooming heirs to be head of state and people go along with it because that guy has been practicing for being head of state for 30 years of course those people groomed would tend to be family eventually people forget that they went along with it because the heir was groomed and they correlate succession with heredity then it collapses when a monarch forgets to groom his heir and they end up with an incompetent head of state and republicans take hold because they think they can do a better job ruling than the idiot monarch
  could a new monarchy arise in the future    they already do fairly regularly we call them dictatorships
barring societal collapse no people really dont like being told their leader is superior to them ot has tol many extra privileges alsi technology and collective surveillance makes it impossible for someone to appear without fault we just know too much about everyone for that to work
  this pretty much    problem is with dictatorships its usually dictator first people second usually why they get overthrown especially in the age of internet
  i live in a tiny country and we still need hundreds of men to run our tiny government its not like education and health care become easier when you are small you still need the same number of departments the same number of specializations the same institutionsetc all that changes is the number of employees that are teacher or doctors
  yeah but the monarch would be ignorant of most things which is the problem so he shouldnt have say in policy  it would maybe make sense if the monarch had 1 specific area of policy that he would have final say on like foreign policy only for example
  divine right is unlikely but companycountries where the company president officially declares himself a monarch while still providing his quality services to his customercitizens are very likely
  the monarch would be ignorant of most things which is the problem so he shouldnt have say in policy  sos the president numbnuts how knowledgeable do you think the average president is   hell a kid raised with schooling explicitly focused on governance will be much more knowledgeable than any elected official   not to mention the lowertimepreference
  their leader is superior to them ot has tol many extra privileges  thats not an essential part of a monarchy its simply a nondemocratic leader usually an inheriting one   all it needs to be a true monarchy as opposed to the jokes we have today in britain and elsewhere is for the monarch to have some power hes not afraid to use he doesnt need to be any more powerful than say the pm or president is today nor does he need to be worshiped
  if the monarch isnt the better of everyone else what makes him entitled to have power over everyone for life
  the leap from democracy to rule by strongman is not particular long and then its basically just a skip left to blatant monarchy
  the list of possible reasons is vast as fudge mate it covers both religious and secular reasons and all the subgroups in underneath those huge umbrellas
  you would need a country which went through chaotic times a new popular leader would come and be in power for such a long time that the people get afraid of changing himthis leader would then use his popularity to push a new elected leader on the people this system would continue long enough that the people would be ok with the new system which will eventually devolve into a normal dictatorship/monarchy
16 of germans wants the monarchy restored support is stronger among younger germans given its recent history id have thought next to 0 of germans wanted the monarchy back
  if the owner of a company isnt better than anyone else what makes him entitled to own that company
    khaaaan
    tfw china was the first to actually go ahead on designer superbabies    tfw other countries will have to follow along to compete on the national stage    tfw the eugenics wars will actually happen us inferior normals fighting and dying for our superman leaders
  1 op didnt specify it had to be an absolute monarchy  2 even during the height of absolutism regents still had advisers councilors etc
  nah
  germanys darkest hour was under a dictatorship not a monarchy the empire rightly or wrongly is seen as being a time of relative sanity and prosperity for the german nation
  id be unironically in favour of a monarchy the problem is that who do you decide gets to be the monarch choose some random royal from europe that has some basic ties to your country and call them king restore the living descendents of a previouslyabolished monarchy pick a name out of a hat thered be way too many power struggles involved
  first you establish a meritocratic oligarchy and then you have them elect each new king if you want to be really anal you could then have a popular vote which can veto the oligarchs nomination   however you do it the office of monarch should come with a term limit
  clarification the popular vote would be a vote against electing the one nominated by the oligarchs for kingship abstaining or voting no would mean that you accepted the choice which was picked by the oligarchs
  but thats not really much of a monarchy     this is an issue   especially if large states continue as they do today   ideally us monarchists could get together and choose some old noble to become our hereditary ruler in our own microstate
  of course it will start as a normal political position that is either elected or appointed that is gradually dominated by an oligarchy and then a private individual the first few decades or generations the new monarch will pretend they are not monarchs look st augustus but eventually we will all just accepts the naked exercise of power
  how is that not much of a monarchy
  its not really what most monarchists imagine its basically presidentforlife as opposed to being raised for the job like most monarchists want
  you needed thousands of men to manage any monarchy too dipshit    same way it always happens either a breakdown of authority leads to an age of warlords who become monarchs and aristocrats or some charismatic individual seizes control of the republican organs of state to establish a dictatorship democracy is not a new concept regardless of what the peddlers of macrohistorical narratives would have you believe democracies and republics have existed in the past and have been supplanted by monarchies in the past
  its not really what most monarchists imagine  so what  being raised for the job like most monarchists want  theres nothing about what i wrote which precludes that if anything it would encourage it while also providing the state with a larger sample of options
both sides unfortunately suffered deaths  armenians killed turkish babies  it was a simple deportation  it didnt happen but we wish it did  kurds did it  we did armenian genocide and proud of it were going to do it again
  they keep deflecting to armenians and russia whats their excuse for killing assyrian christians and mount lebanon famine against maronite christians
  its illegal to deny so it must be (((bullshit)))
  illegal where
  honestly the most common excuse i hear is that it was never intention and a bunch just happened to die while being moved
  it was a simple deportation
    armenian genocide is a revisionist lie and backed exclusively by vile people armenians were revolting before the russians had even arrived joining the russians and killing muslim civiliansbut thats okay in the minds of these people    fabrication made up to gloss over the warcrimes and genocide the allies greeks and armenians attempted on turks kurds and other muslims  numbers are impossible  armenian rebellion before they were relocated  no intention or objective to kill anyone    1914 ottoman census  1161169 armenian gregorian  68838 armenian catholic including the western portion of the empire  genocide claim 15 million    before russia invaded turkey russian military officials met with many high ranking armenian leaders dashnak and hunchak leaders and it was already apparent with the thousands of armenians who deserted the ottoman army with their guns to join the russian army or the armenian rebel armies the armenians promised many volunteers to guide the russians into the ottoman territory and many soldiers to fight    let me make this clear for some who claim that armenians rebelled in selfdefensethat is absolutely false the armenians offered to help the russians attack before any massacres or attacks by ottomans if you were wondering if the armenians or ottomans started the fight well it was absolutely the armenians who were filled with nationalistic ideas of establishing their ancient homeland of greater armenia    a dispatch received by the daily telegraph from tiflis capital of the government of caucasia by way of moscow says the turkish town of van 140 miles southeast of erzerum is being besieged by a detachment of armenians who are aiding the russians the town has a large arsenal another armenian detachment is operating in the rear of the turkish army during the invasion the city of van was captured and many muslims were massacred by the armenians
  how do turks explain the badr khan beg massacres of assyrian christians hamidian massacres of armenian christians in 1895 and adana massacre of armenian christians in 1909
  impartial people know that those were radical rebellions that got crushed
  all sunni rebellions will get crushed the same way then
  we did armenian genocide and proud of it were going to do it again  thats not denial tho
  you realise they didnt just round up armenians from within the ottoman empire right later in the war the turks would advance all the way to the caspian ie through eastern armenia
  literal white christian genocide  /pol/ still denies because one armenian made shitty game reviews for a couple years  right wingers literally have no consistent ideas
  /pol/tards are really atheist or agnostic
  they tried to get independence as a people so we tried to kill them all   thats justified   holy fucking shit
  watching trks deny the genocides ever happened and try to justify them at the same time is truly fascinating mental gymnastics of the highest order
the real shit is when you realize that by so thoroughly and consistently denying the armenian genocide they get away scotfree with the genocides of the other christian minorities  also remember that time the un helped genocide millions of greeks i remember
  the un didnt really help they just did nothing about it  the soviets helped though and the french and the italians and the kurds   the only ones that got their just desserts were the kurds
  why is she wearing a union headband in anime
  armenians arent a real people anon those are just christian turks
  gamergate are largely white male atheist incel hentai anime addicts
  armenians are not and never will be white narek
  literally from caucasus   not caucasian   what did he mean by this
  from the armenian highlands
  russians dont consider caucasus people to be white they call them churka or blackarse
  we didnt do it but we totally couldve if we wanted to and the people would cheer if we did
  is the armenian genocide the most apolitical one out there seems like nobody but the turks denies or really downplays it
  well sunnis are all nutjobs i just assume they are on the wrong side of everything
  turkey
  warcrimes against turks and mudslime tribes are real  sorry what
  after the russian retreat the armenian armies were unable to continue their efforts they relied heavily on aid from the british french and russians however they were not good soldiers and so in full confrontation against the ottoman armies they had to retreat and they resorted to hit and run tactics    the ottoman leaders issued decrees to relocate armenians in eastern anatolia because of the difficulty of identifying armenian rebels who disguise themselves as innocent armenians during the day and at night become guerillas     regardless the ottomans did still try to pay the armenians shelter the armenians and guard the armenians all of which is contradictory to the concept that an armenian genocide took place the hanging of criminals who attacked armenian convoys is also documented in many archives    by the end of the war the armenians had been driven back to yerevan where they established their new nation however the armenian armies had massacred and decimated hundreds of ottoman villages     the propaganda today declares that turks were at fault for genocide but they provide no proof that there was intention to exterminate the only thing used today to back up their claim is to quote antiturkish newspapers or henry morganthau who was asked to create propaganda by woodrow wilson to convince the american public that america must join the war against the central powers    if we were to believe the western lies which is widely spread today then any rebellion that was put down can be marked as genocide the ottomans may have been unprepared for armenian relocations but that doesnt make them guilty of genocide trail of tears is more of a genocide than this
  so yeah hey i want to be independent too so when am i allowed to come to your place to kill you and your mom
  there is a difference between genocide and mutual conflict my braindead friend
    a couple of trks died in a terrorist attack so the only proper response is raping dead armenian babies   i see i am wrong thank you for enlightening me
  a couple    hundreds of thousands of armenians volunteered in the russian army preparing for an invasion of turkey    youre a retarded deniar yourself which is ironic      
  armenian what
i mean why even bother talking about it on the internet the turkroaches will screech and crawl wherver the word armenia or genocide is uttered
i am the last one
  t armenoid
  last what
  armenians volunteer in an army to gain independence from oppressor  thise fucking traitors how could they being systematically targetted by the young turks was a privilege  ungrateful scum all of them
  i love how the armenian argument always falls back to well we are allowed to kill turks
  it falls back to people have a right to fight for their independence especially if they are systematically targeted by an oppressive government
  ottomans treated nonsunnis as second class
    the ottomans and turks before were way too kind to you they should have deported you 1000 years ago when they took over but instead they allowed you to keep your freedom and parasite on the realm for a thousand years and as soon as turkey was weakened you jumped on them like opportunistic hyenas you wont get any sympathy here
  when their oppressor was weak they tried to get independence how vile how could they go against the hand that feeds them with forced conversions extra taxes prohibiting education restricting religious freedom and just recently started conscripting them to death camps hyenas indeed the turkish leadership was all honey
  turkroach
in their entire history the turks have tried to either assimilate aryan people or destroy them
armenians quality  turks quantity  you see that today 3 million armenians surrounded by 90 million genocidal roach bastards 80 million to west and 10 million to east and armenians are still kicking their asses around artsakh
  kurds did it  this peculiar point has a part of truth in it kurds along with circassians and other caucasian muhacirler made up most of the rankandfile of the special organization
  literal white christian genocide
  literally got retardedly lucky the battle
live under ottoman for hundreds of years  pretty peaceful  no riots or attempts to break free  pay higher tax but dont have to do military servicewhich was minimum 5 yearsup to 10 years  hold high positions in bureaucracy29 armenian pashas and countless other positions including ministries  decide to cooperate with enemy  kill civilians  get dead  current year  make same thread everyday
  adana massacre of 1909 hamidian massacres of 1895
  whats your excuse for assyrian christian genocide and the mount lebanon famine against maronite catholics
  kurds did it  but this is literally true and of the big 3 pashas 2 of them were balkanites larping as turks one was a pomak and one was albanian kurds are the ones who currently live on most of the former armenian land as well
why wasnt there a polish genocide if they did the same thing as armenians

which books do you recommend me to comprehend more about philosophy related to historiography and history for starters i just started studying history at college but my knowledge about philosophy in general is really poor ill appreciate your help
historians craft by bloch
  i already read that one then i guess im having a good start
does a state of constant war really keep americans safe
  no fundementaly nukes keep us save from invasion at least unwanted ones however the protect american influence and power which is supposed to help ideologically defend you guys but really it seems to have had the opposite effect
  yes i thought the same about nukes as the ultimate deterrent i have never understood the argument that american forces being sent to die in unethical wars somehow keeps us safe at home wtf is the imperative to send troops to die in afghanistan 17 years after 9/11 to protect against some dumbass peasants     i understand the geopolitical reasons to want bases right up in the collective asses of iran and china but the muh fighting for our freedoms argument is such shit
yes it is essential for national defence stagnation is subtle and can creep in no matter how intensive your training or how much you read there will always be some fiddly detail you missed or some new development there is no substitute for real experience as they say further while there is no shortage of psychos in the world they may not be the most challenging sparring partners due to their impulsive short term thinking it is sometimes necessary to target more rational opponents even if they have shown no belligerence towards you
  no but it keeps the military keen and practiced
its about resources i reckon
its good for the economy
  yes it is essential for national defence stagnation is subtle and can creep in no matter how intensive your training or how much you read there will always be some fiddly detail you missed or some new development there is no substitute for real experience as they say further while there is no shortage of psychos in the world they may not be the most challenging sparring partners due to their impulsive short term thinking it is sometimes necessary to target more rational opponents even if they have shown no belligerence towards you    then why has the quality of the us military hardware and training plummeted in the last 17 years
  its mostly for looks the real stuff is in orbit
  what constant war the burger shits have never had a land war from a foreign nation ever they dont know shit about war
  the quality of the us military hardware and training plummeted in the last 17 years  proof of this
  literal jannies
  your nation can only know war if it pissed away millions of lives in worthless unnecessary wars almost a full century ago  nice meme faggot if you think modern day french or germans know more of war than americans entirely because they have longer bloodier histories then youre a fool
  would you rather we just wait until someone bombs us
  what is it like to be totally devoid of morals
  the fact most of the country is obese to the detriment of the quality of manpower was one of the details discovered during the iraq war also things like iedproofing vehicles
  what is it like to be totally devoid of functioning brain
  you tell me assuming you replied to the wrong post lmao
  he mightve been calling the same person stupid that the other guy called immoral
  being this ignorant of history  on /his/  wow
  i replied to the right post imagine being so retarded you think someone will bomb you if you dont cause misery and death across the world these subhumans literally believe everyone is out to get them what an insane nation
  imagine being so retarded you think someone will bomb you if you dont cause misery and death across the world  so let me get this straight nobody has ever been attacked or invaded in the entirety of world history unless they were causing misery and death across the world hmm i wonder why this foolproof world peace plan hasnt been implemented yet
  yes i have tried to talk some brainwashed normie friends of mine i hate both of those terms but it really is applicable about what if any utility america gains from bombing the hell out of peasants half a world away and continuing a 17 year war wherein all the original actors the united states went after are all either dead or in guantanamo bay they said to keep us safe at home and that people died so you could say that    these are full grown educated adult lawyers
  proof of this    i could post article after article about defective equipment from uniforms to the f35 and training requirements that have been dropped or loosened demonstrating this but ill just go with the one that hits home the most    
  muh fighting for our freedoms argument is such shit    its necessary to keep citizens who cant be arsed to actually study geopolitics in line its working which is a good thing
  wtf why did i join the airforce try for pj i want to go green now
  why did i join the chairforce     id assume you did such a thing to fly a desk and get all the benefits like a smart aspiring pog i certainly hope you werent expecting to fly anything
    i am former us army here there is some truth to this image once both iraq and afghanistan were fully underway the military branches seemed to lower their standards to boost recruitment numbers by 2010 it wasnt uncommon for a troop to have been through 5 deployments there was a desperate need for more recruits to spread out the burden of deployments i know of guys who failed drug tests albeit weed but were still sent overseas after 2013 the standards quickly started to tighten back up as combat operations were concluding how it is these days i have no clue as ive been out 4 years now
  craziest shit you saw over there i knew an army officer who did tours dont know how many but it was more than one in afghanistan that says he saw navy seals get away with blatant war crimes gunning down children
  but when the green berets one of the greatest fighting forces of all time  im not sure that article is worth much desu
  you dont understand the security that the military as a joint operation has the military of the us much like other nations go on numerous peace deployments as well   but hey if you dont believe the military is fighting for your freedom then move to iraq or bosnia hell you could even shorten the trip and go to mexico where the governments can even cule their own insurgents and your in danger of your life being threatened by other evil individuals who would kill you for your watch wallet car or just because they dont like you every time you step out of your house  and dont even pretend like you feel threatened in the states im sure you enjoy your barbeques and mcdonalds drive throughs with a complete sense of security other than your ads getting too fat
  its necessary to keep citizens who cant be arsed to actually study geopolitics in line its working which is a good thing  this it reminds me of the people who love to talk about how stupid the government is for waging a war on drugs not realizing that the highly profitable agendas the war on drugs is waged for have been massive successful by any reasonable metric and are completely different from the bullshit excuses the general public is told about why the war on drugs exists you can attack the morality of it all day but thinking these are stupid pursuits just reveals youre accepting the fairy tale version of whats going on and then criticizing it for being the oversimplified nonanswer excuse that it is
  gunning down children  war crime  is that always a war crime automatically arent there at least some situations where itd be justifiable like kids strapped with bombs or kids being used as human shields
  who the fuck will invade you   you have 2000 nukes huge army biggest navy in the worldyou have all the fucking resources you need in your continentsized country what the fuck are you doing in other countries   id get it if you had some higher purpose or goal but all that is a fucking charade as demonstrated hundreds of times   your only goal seems to be to cause death and misery and for your elites to get even richer because insane wealth they already have isnt enough youre like a cancer you just consume and pump out shit
  why do i get the feeling that gunning down kids strapped with bombs isnt the smartest decision you could make there
  im not saying that any of this isnt important in terms of longterm national security on the contrary i think its 100 necessary i was just pointing out that the somewhat outdated and reductive our boys overseas are keeping us safe from the hajis narrative is useful because its an unnuanced rationalization that works for unnuanced people the types that would feel upset if they knew that soldiers lives are actually on the line over things like force projection something they dont understand or relate to
  literally said i joined for pj they are part of the special operations and deploy 90 of the careers their job is to jump out of planes in hostile territory to recover military casualties and preform a very in depth medical triage as well as surgery on the spot if need be all while taking fire  got dqed for injury in my leg
  from the way he described it to me it was murder plain and simple went into a house to search for a terrorist alleged to be there killed the children that were sleeping war crimes
  oh no war crimes inconceivable the sky is falling
  missing his entire point  the idea is to nip the problem in the bud keep them down before they get up in the first place etc
  
just by focusing a bit more on developing your own country you could easily retain and even improve your current living standards   you dont really need imperialism usa is sitting on insane natural wealth   yet youre still doing it so only conclusion is that youre psychopathic dumb or combination of both     threat of nazism threat of communismall that is gone yet your imperialism is only intensifying   your own fucking president says he wont do shit about a murderous dictator who ordered a critic to be chopped up and dissolved in acid in a consulatebecause he can allegedly sell them a bit more weapons which they will then use to support islamists and kill civilians in yemen and elsewhere     youre not really threatened by anyone or anything youre doing this shit to earn more money most of that money goes to people who already have enough money that their offspring doesnt have to do shit for the next 200 years     i cant stress it enough youre fucking cancer   meanwhile in your own backyard some of your regions are third world yet you dont seem to give a fuck about your own people either     youre a fucking psychopath and you dont seem to understand that youre literally creating the problem by such approach fuck you
  yeah we should all go to iraq and tear down those huge oil wells the evil us government set up after invading
  yes having an experienced military core on hand has decided multiple wars
  what the fuck are you talking about
  no it just keeps americans rich
        im fairly conservative but im convinced that most seals and other elite troops are human pieces of shit who only managed to pass psych tests to get in because theyre borderline sadists with massive egos    a fellow /his/fag after he read this        the fact that chris kyle so openly bragged about butchering people on the flimsiest of excuses and so many seals are into what amounts to psuedodeath worship with their schutzstaffeltier obsession with skulls reinforces that sentiment desu
  yup my buddy had the same impression
    i often think of my fellow americans as slightly dumb due to a lack of knowlege not brains    foreigners like you on the other hand are too stupid and to comprehend even one meaningful good thing america has done for the world    you say its all about money then explain americas intervention in the korean war wheres the money in fighting for some backwater shithole country    jk i know you useful idiots dont read stay mad
    i think that was the joke
  youre a fucking psychopath  quit throwing around buzzwords as a supplement for having an argument you overemotional child  dont seem to understand that youre literally creating the problem  how so if anything history has shown the opposite to be true the failure of america to act in certain situations is directly responsible for the existence of half of her serious international rivals could you imagine how different the cold war would have been if they got of their asses and helped the kmt no red china north korea would have been crushed no vietnam no laos no cambodia  fuck you  you seem a little asshurt friend where did the american intervention hurt you
    say what you will about these men but they are the only thing keeping your soft pampered first world asses in a position so privileged that you can criticize them for defending their own damn nation heres a hint dipshit  if these warriors didnt risk their lives fighting for you wed all be living in tribes in a kill or be killed environment do bad things happen of course thats why its called war do you think that the great armies of the past cared about human rights no thats a privilege that soft spoiled kits like you get to have because of their fighting
  sometimes i could see an argument that dumpstering hajis prevents them from forming an actual islamic state would it threaten people in the us maybe not but theyd have better funding for their jihad and if their conquest was unchecked it could get really annoying
  i should thank the seals and delta for my job at mcdonalds
  laffing at this entire post m8
  without them youd be fighting a war against bk because thered be no monopoly on force working as a check against all sorts of aggression
  if they would attack saudiarabia maybe
  does a state of constant war really keep american military industry safe  fixed
    ywn live in an anarchocapitalist america where seals hired by mcdonalds and coca cola battle it out against delta hired by bk and pepsi all while wearing livestreaming gopros for ad revenue so they can afford expensive surgeries and designer steroids to augment their bodies and new weapons
  but they are the only thing keeping your soft pampered first world asses in a position so privileged that you can criticize them for defending their own damn nation heres a hint dipshit    im pretty sure an ocean of water and a restrictive immigration policy is whats doing that these guys exist so the us government can fight wars without the knowledge or consent of the people ie knowingly violating the constitution they are not there to defend your rights or your freedom
  why the fuck is the us army screening people who smoke the grass     its one of the most commonly used substances aside from alcohol among young kids and the army has a long tradition of blazing up nam    if my army fren is to be believed whole squads would get blazed up once they got in country in afghanistan and iraq     yet they fail people whore eager to be recruited for being stoner fags
  it keeps the profits of armament companies safe
    the failure of america to act in certain situations is directly responsible for the existence of half of her serious international rivals    glad someone here gets it    they got off their asses and helped the kmt    ok this is where i have to stop you america was arming taiwan so it could eventually recapture china but after the korean war plans for a serious ground war on the mainland was seen as a very bad ideanukes were off the table    americas foreign policy for most of its history has unironically been ok we sit back we fuck with them a little bit to let em know were here but eventually theyll go away        ya because we all know how peaceful place until america fucked it all up
  theres no rules because i say so you cant make value judgments because they did something for you in a nebulous way that i cant fully explain    ok
  the only analogue in the world that are as repugnant as the seals are the spetsnaz no other country has an analogous special force as morally bankrupt as the seals
  absolute brainlet what are you even doing on this board did you get lost
  i guess the unfortunate problem is that every society has sociopath pieces of a shit and you might as well use them to go do bad things with than let them go nuts on your own population  glorifying them is probably not a great idea
  if these warriors didnt risk their lives fighting for you wed all be living in tribes in a kill or be killed environment  
  america was arming taiwan so it could eventually recapture china  thats exactly the problem if theyd acted before the situation was unsalvageable it may have been different they could never have recaptured china as you explained but with the proper support the kmt may have been able to hold it and avoid getting thrown out in the first place
  nigger no country on earth can get up enough to constitute a serious threat to the us
  the invasions of iraq and afghanistan have in no way made the us a safer place
  indirectly probably have by focusing islamist extremist efforts in those regions
  this happened all the time it was easy to get weed if you know the right guys and pay them off youll get tipped off about the tests and bag clean piss easy as hell anybody who got caught either didnt make the right friends or fucked up somewhere down the line
  extremism which would be a much smaller problem without the invasions
  stuff like this is why i fully support piss tests in the military if youre too dumb too inept or too strung out to pass them you shouldnt be fighting
  i wouldnt say every elite tropp are pieces of shit but they are not normal my next door neighbor was a green beret during nam and from the stories he told me he did enjoy the war and conflict putting sights on the enemy going through tunnels and help training sv soldiers    he has said that he would do it again if he was asked to help the us and its allies and actually believes in the domino effect
had the gdr survived the fall of the wall as an independent state what would have happened to the stasi  would it have been totally dissolved or would they have opted for the polish model of discharging every secret police member deemed unreliable and too close to the old regime while everyone else would have been allowed to continue to serve
yes but not really
why the shogun never bothered to abolish the imperial title or even better usurp the throne i can understand the kamakura shogunate didnt control the western part of japan but the ashikaga and tokugawa had nothing that could have stopped them from doing so
    first of all the kamakura shogunate did control the entire country it was the ashikaga shitters who never had anything more than a tenuous grasp on anything     as for why they never got rid of the emperor i guess there really isnt any need to rock the boat is there when you already have all de facto power what is the point     i guess another reason is the soga clan back in the early days like before heian period maybe nara period or something around the time of shotoku taishi the soga clan had basically control over the imperial house and tried to get rid of the emperor and establish thrmselves as top dogs   except the mononobe and every other party ganged up and raped them to death ever since it was seen as bad juju to try to get rid of the emperor fujiwara minamoto hojo ashikaga oda toyotomi tokugawa etc all seized power de facto but didnt fuck with the ceremonial power of the emperor because theres no need everyone else might have a reason to gang up on you if you try and the gods might punish yoh for it
  because the shogun derived power from the emperor as japan saw it whether or not it was true its like saying why didnt the monarchies of europe just kill god
  good and simple answer too high political cost for little gain
  first of all the kamakura shogunate did control the entire country  i always had the impression the kamakura shogunate was more like a deal between the warriors of the east and the imperial court who still had a lot of power in the east but i might be wrongi didnt know about what happened to the soga thanks ill have to check    well in europe usurpation werent uncommon the carolingians took the throne from the merovingians closer to japan the cao clan also forced the last han emperor to abdicate if anything thats the japanese case that is a bit weird
  yeah but in japan emperor was semidivine japan was also more insular and traditionoriented   shoguns de facto ruled so who cares about a figurehead if anything it provided them legitimacy
  the chinese have a totally different take on their emperors as opposed to the nip emperor while the emperor worship wasnt a thing until meiji state shintoism showed up nonetheless the jap emperor was utterly linked to the divinities and is a chief priest of shintoism in addition the mans dynasty founded the country known as japan    whereas the chinese believed their emperor was only an appointee of heaven tasked to rule wisely and if he didnt and there are signs to know this then the dynasty should be replaced by someone who could do job better    ergo power struggles in japan revolved around a bunch of cunts saying hurr i serve emperor  state better than u emperor make me military dictator need not dirty your hands with shit while in china they involved hurr emperor sucks because of x he has heavens favor no more must replace
  during kamakura the court was still administering much of the country yes though most high ranking warriors east and west answered to the shogun or wished they did because being the shoguns vessel meant to answered only to him and thus could get away with all sorts of shit
  many shogun did intermarry with the imperial family i think at least one even had the title of prince but actually abolishing the position would be seen as sacrilege and the position of emperor had been a figurehead long before the shogunate was created so there was no desire to combine the titles
did the 90s ever truly end
they objectively ended at 9/11
  this    the real question is did the 2000s include the recession
kinda annoying that consumer grade 3d printers werent a thing in the 90s  theyre hella fucking simple and could have easily been made with the tech of the time  think about it the 90s but with 3d printers
  then why is fight club still real
  the real question is did the 2000s include the recession    i dont know 20012007 just seemed to whizz by compared to 20082016
  fpbp    and its true
  fight club is a prophetic allegory to the postmodern world and mindset that was beginning to set in after the cold war ended the theme of a general lack of purpose destruction of the idea of totality and the infusal of irony and relativism into our society and thus creating a sense of general apathy and lostness is the main motif of the movie  we have no great war no great depression our fight is spiritual  its the idea that in a world where we are more connected then ever we are also more worthless and small than ever and that we must learn to accept this inevitability
  we can fight against
  theres always postpostmodernity which could be incomprehensibly insane to the average person and produce terrorists with methods that are unprosecutable in court
  hmm id say they objectively ended with the advent of smart phones about 6 or 7 years later
i miss the 90s  we had flashy clothes the burger king kids club safety scissors actually good songs crash bandicoot green ketchup purple ketchup hope innocence toys in cereals funny commercials gays didnt exist all the disney films were good cool black people like mrt and michael jordan apple didnt exist twitter didnt exist 30minute recess action man     the day the 90s died everything died
  the 00s are the 90s
  we have no great war no great depression    well get those eventually war is like death its inevitable and all you can do is delay it    if we dont get ww3 the country may just tear itself apart from the boredom
  yes 2015 when a university lecturer false flag failed a final of mine unprovoked    omerta
yue fought a long campaign against the invading jurchens in an effort to retake northern china just when he was threatening to attack and retake kaifeng corrupt officials advised emperor gaozong to recall yue to the capital and sue for peace with the jurchens fearing that a defeat at kaifeng might cause the jurchens to release emperor qinzong threatening his claim to the throne emperor gaozong followed their advice sending 12 orders in the form of 12 gold plaques to yue fei recalling him back to the capital knowing that a success at kaifeng could lead to internal strife yue submitted to the emperors orders and returned to the capital where he was imprisoned and where qin hui would eventually arrange for him to be executed on false charges10
decades later his grandson yue ke 岳珂 had retrieved documentary evidence of his grandfathers achievements and published an adulatory biography of him in 1162 emperor xiaozong of song posthumously pardoned and rehabilitated his honours     for their part in yues death iron statues of qin hui lady wang and two of qins subordinates moqi xie 万俟卨 and zhang jun 張俊 were made to kneel before yue feis tomb located by the west lake hangzhou for centuries these statues have been cursed spat and urinated upon by people the original castings in bronze were damaged but later were replaced by images cast in iron but these were similarly damaged 
qin hui is just a pawn that faggot emperor got away with it
yang led more than 40 engagements in jilin province despite critically lacking supplies in response the japanese committed a scorched earth strategy by routinely looting rural harvests confiscating food from villages and forcefully segregating civilians into lawful settlements in the attempt of depriving the resistance any means of supply large collaborationist patrols were also frequently deployed to inflict attrition on the guerrillas    yang and his men were closely encircled by 40000 japanese troops in january to midfebruary 1940 facing a dire situation he organized his forces to disperse into small units and break out of the encirclement his detachment of 60 troopers were betrayed to the japanese by a staff officer on february 18 after the last two soldiers at his side were killed in action yang continued fighting alone for another 5 days he was eventually cornered in a small forest by a large combined japanese and collaborationist forces in the mengjiang county 蒙江县 and was killed during fierce fighting by multiple shots from machineguns it was reported that the japanese troops fearing yangs famed marksmanship from previous encounters refused to approach his body for a while after his death    unable to understand yangs source of perseverance yang had not eaten for over 6 days the japanese ordered an autopsy after cutting off and preserving yangs head when they cut open yangs stomach they found only tree bark cotton batting and grass roots within  not a single grain of rice the japanese commander at the scene ryuichiro kishitani 岸谷隆一郎 was so shocked at the revelation that he went silent and appeared aged a lot within the next day kishitani committed seppuku after japans defeat but wrote in his will that his majesty might be wrong in launching this war china has steely soldiers like yang jingyu and it would not fall
  yue feis direct patrilineal descendant yue zhongqi was a qing general and governorgeneral who conquered tibet for the qing from the dzungar khanate in 1720 the manchu garrson in hangzhou worshipped yue fei as a god in the qing and the manchu bannerman jinliang born in hangzhou believed he himself was a reicarnation of yue fei

hey i dont post on 4chan a lot but i have a query my friends and i have been arguing about    what would the implications be of a society where we domesticated bears instead of wolves especially in an ancient setting    how long would they be viable in warfare are they too expensive to feed would two archers on a 2 horse ancient persian chariot be able to take out a warbear    a discussion of questions like this would be appreciated thanks
ever played red alert 3
we domesticated elephants and used them in warfare and they are much bigger and more dangerous elephants were devasting in combat see hannibal until people figured out how to exploit there lack of mobility bears would suffer the same problem the reason why horses were so dominant was because of there mobility they are very difficult to trap with infantry
this is an interesting question    what is it that makes dogs/horses domesticated there is a question of neurochemistry right and thats why they couldnt domesticate say zebras
  we never domesticated elephants tame / domesticate
why do we need two of those threads
  in places like india very large numbers of them were bred and used for labor and warfare for thousands of years as close to domesticated as an animal of that size can get of course you cant get a pet elephant but fuck off with your semantics bullshit
stupid phoneposter
  it was ment for 
why didnt the russian federation keep this as their coat of arms historically its a lot more based than that doubleeagle thing
  because they were no longer committed to the ideology of communism
  belarus kept theirs
  no one cares about belarus desu
  why didnt germany keep the swastika
  if belarus said they were gonna rejoin with russia 90 of the world will ask what the fuck is belarus
  bad comparison soviet union dissolved german reich was militarily defeated and occupied with the goal of destroying any remnants of the old regime
  npc ignorance is something to be proud of
  its a lot more based than that doubleeagle thing    wrong
  belarus still tries to pretend
why did westerners never produce anything like the kama sutra
  but there are lots of sex manuals in the market by westerners and they are much less pretentions and absurd than the kama sutra
  ovid  ars amatoria  i remember him dedicating a full poem on how he scored a sexbomb gal and how he was not able to get an erection describing all the things they both tried positions and tricks to get it up with no success during whole night
  indian sex advice  hahahahahahaha
  you are the reason we cannot have nice threads at least from time to time
  they did the kama sutra is compiled by europeans into a book
read irish history  believe ireland should have made a descendant of the flight of the earls king after independence  anyone else
  why not a stuart
responses to this idea are mixed first of all the oneills traditionally controlled most of ulster and the fact that most of ulster was now controlled by the british meant that this would have seemed a bit weirdsince they were king of their ulster kingdom first and high king second  secondly republicanism went hand in hand with irish nationalism relatively early onwhile some did speculate on bringing over a prussian prince or something similar it was generally dropped in favour of a republic  there were some attempts by early presidents of ireland to make the role more than a largely ceremonial head of state however most of these fizzled out    not an issue though nothing wrong with being a republic and irelands journey to the republic is quite impressive
  once scotland got prodd the links between scotland and ireland dissolved somewhat the last major engagement between the two was an attempt by scottish presbyterians to launch a military invasion of ulster which collapsed almost immediately after their army was assfucked at benburb by an oneill
  the stuarts were scots who mostly screwed over the irish especially with the ulster plantation
  the stuarts were normans

why did the nazis hate the klan
because they are mutts
  the irony
  what irony
i think its more that its something that symbolizes america
  that they portray the americans as being the destroyers of europe
  why wouldnt they most high ranking nazis came from a catholic background and the kkk was an extremist anticatholic organisation at this time
  arent their robes some kind of catholic ritual robe though
  then why did nazis persecute catholics
  its calling america hypocrites for producing propaganda about nazi germanys racist policies while the kkk runs rampant and there is segregation
  repressed memories from the priests having their way with them during childhood
lack of ordnung
  its just mutts aping europeans like usual
  less competition
  thats not irony though
  makes some propaganda depicting enemy as bringing of death  when you are the bringer of death  yes it is brainlet
    klansman would unironically have saved pregnant anne frank    defending white womanhood from naziggers has been the klans primary mission from its inception
  no its not its just classic deceit or propaganda pointing out your enemies wrongdoings while trying to cover up your ownis in no way irony
  most nazis with a catholic background were either lapsed hated it with their very guts and became pagan larpers or were the most rational of them all
  kkk  saving jews  anon
  kys youre selve
  look at the picture its a klan hood over a cage that contains dancing niggers americans have always claimed to hate niggers and be prowhite yet they take extreme pleasure in nigger entertainment and culture embracing all kinds of degenerate nigger shit rap rock and roll jazz blues all nigger music prowhite conservative americans spend their weekends watching millionaire muscular niggers crash into each other in the nfl sports music film literature everything about american culture is negrified white americans have became so tolerant of cultural niggerdom that they fail to recognize it even exists so the picture highlights american hypocrisy/obliviousness on the surface they pretend to be europeans but under the hood its all just dancing niggers   go to /pol/ right now and youll see americans claiming to hate niggers yet they speak exactly like them  dabbing based fam all nigger slang and thanks to this cancer of a country spreading its cultural influence all across the globe the entire planet is becoming negrified
  kara boga
  implying the kkk was lutheran
  its just a picture i had available do you seriously believe the klan did/ does not hate the jews as well
  using a grman to refute me        rope yourself
  
    shut up and play along with the meme you idiot
  implying protestantism isnt quintessentially lutheran
  hahahahah memes xd am i right my fellow redditors  no
  american protestantism is quintessentially calvinist and obsessed with money iconoclasm and republicanism lutheranism is unironically more similar to catholicism than it is to calvinism
  unironically true as baptists came from calvinists
  implying calvinism isnt quintessentially lutheran
  calvin and luther hated each other so no it isnt
  a bunch of white knight faggots indeed
    you say that if theres something wrong with stringing up black and grman rapists
  you sound a little obsessed there anon
  killing nigs who your thot women fucked consensually to protect the thots who are fucking niggers behind your back  white knight
  strange only one of us seems obsessed with the other
  anne frank  white woman
  implying luthers example didnt entice calvin into following into schismatic heresy
  not the other guy but you americans are just realy easy to make fun of
    marx was a marxist
  thats pretty much what im implying yes historylet
  not the other guy but you americans are just realy easy to make fun of  i guess it is true that simple things please simple minds
    youre right shes a white girl
  jews cant be white and neither can americans
  but why would either of those groups want to belong to your group when they both outperform you you say it as if being inferior is a boast
  this but calvin and zwingli too iirc also hated the jews with a passion
  wwell i didnt want to be white anyway
    crying poloids nothing is sweeter or more beautiful
    the protestant founders hate jews as a religious group not as an ethnicity unlike nazis who hated jews who converted to christianity luther would have welcomed jews who converted to his religion the russian empire similarly discriminated against jew religiously but not ethnically jews who converted to russian orthodoxy would have all restrictions on them lifted nazis hated jews as an ethnicity no matter what religion they followed
  no white actually means me and me alone  t inferior person  lol nice try
  the russian empire similarly discriminated against jew religiously but not ethnically  wtf they had a society for generous donations that sent jews to school in higher education it was primarily funded by the tsar
tbqh the klans aesthetic is toptier  t jew
  they didnt they were just accusing america of being hypocritical no idea if this is true btw its just what my professor said
  indeed
  plus the klan was very relevant at the time in us politics or had been within the last generation or so  so its not like today where the klan is either something from history or a few hundred rednecks out in the woods being irrelevant
  hard to tell if youre being dumb on purpose
  70 years later  the united states exists  the third reich doesnt  there are still stormweenies who believe that pic is showing great foresight
  no way the pointy hats are stupid as fuck and hiding your face makes you a pussy they look like larping priests
  masturbated too much to be a gril grils are innocent she was a woman or a jewess
  hiding your face makes you anonymous
  i think the anon ai actually dumb and probably finally looked it up in the dictionary and did not reply because you are right unfortunately the frequent misuse of this word will change its definition
  fuck tripfags
  do elaborate mutherfucker
  uh okay
  im saying that the kkk doesnt hide their faces because they are pussies
  hiding your face makes you a pussy
none meme answer    the nazis hated the kkk because of their ideas of the time    anti science muh evilution is not muh culture  not really pro european they had their idea of pro american and saw a lot of european culture and people as trying to fuck their american ways  only accepted wasps they hated everybody else who was catholic which at the end is merely ideological   another example of american ignorance  etc    you know the kkk and the nazis are not really anything alike is weird that people tries to paint them as being close or anything like that having say that the nazis did use the kkk in their propaganda as a way of showing usas hypocrisy regarding the nazis they also used the uk and frances colonial policies uks laws and oppression regarding ireland and so on the same way nevertheless the nazis did try to use the kkk as a way to infiltrate usa but they were rejected by the kkk    the kkk wanted to restore a protestant small government america they say the nazis as a bunch of socialist european fags the kkk knew the nazis were anti christian anti capitalist etc how the fuck to you expect the klan to follow them sure some kkk members had favorable views of the nazis before the war but said support disappeared when the usa declared war on germany the klan in their our view of things is pro usa before anything    today in usa all those dude larping as nazis and kkk members are not even nazis or kkk shit they barely classify as white supremacists they are a bunch of racist white dudes who know nothing about the nazis or the klan and simply like to draw swastikas and say nigger because the nazis and the klan hate the niggers and kikes just like me
  retards only lump the kkk and nazis together because they were both racist which is fucking stupid because everybody was a racist 80 years ago kkk unironically had more in common with churchill than with hitler
  the nazis who tried to make connections with the klan judged it to be a bourgeois social club full of larpers in other words the klan wasnt radical enough for the nazisthey saw them essentially as cuckservatives     the nazis were right in a way because the goal of the klan was primarily to uphold white dominance over blacks not to exterminate them or deport them the klan was for white supremacy in the real sense not the postmodern sense of white people existing of establishing formal de jure supremacy of whites in general over all blacks whereas the nazis were looking to kill or expel all jews    hitler also thought that the us a mutt nationnot unlike today there were warnings that america would become a nonwhite nation but this was mainly based on the ramblings of hateful eugenicists towards european immigrants that werent anglos the nazis were influenced by this but i think the klan was more mainstream on this issue they had more of a problem with catholicism as a religion than italians in general if im not mistaken
  because they didnt think blacks were evil per se
  hiding your face keeps you out of jail you cant just go around killing and showing your face ask a klan member if he is a pussy and see what happens
  on the surface they pretend to be europeans but under the hood its all just dancing niggers  this is an interesting viewpoint anon  dabs
  pretty much the only thing the nazis and the klan had in common were their hatred of black people klansmen were by no means fascists they believed in democracy they just wanted that democracy to be comprised white protestants
  the kkk didnt consider themselves european  their rallying call was 100 americanism they only supported white supremacy insofar as american whites were understood to be englishdescended protestants and nobody else they were violently nativist and hated most white immigrants especially if they so happened to be catholic they probably despised the irish more than they did the chinese
      
was watching footage of the summit last night and i couldnt help but wonder why for example the japanese prime minster was wearing a european suit instead of traditional formal japanese robes the saudi arabian prince was wearing the traditional middle eastern garments because hes from the middle east and not europe obviously why are the leaders from other nations wearing suits that came from european design
saudi arabias more traditionalist
them nihonjin arent super religious ya know
the west won
  because gulf arabs are special snowflakes not even other arabs do it
hes a saudi arabian prince while the rest are just commoners in undistracting bureaucratic garb
  every single man besides the prince is wearing a suit be it chinese african turkish or japanese not even the respective european countries are wearing their traditional dresses it just became commonplace formal attire because it was used by the brits afaik and everyone wanted to emulate the most civilized and powerful dogs and eventually it just stuck   the saudis are being special to illustrate they dont subscribe to the western values systems culture etc  not even in clothing will they submit they have their own and are proud to show it good for them i say
  yeah i was thinking along those lines too how saudi is being defiant etc     indias prime minster was wearing a different outfit as well it was a suit i cant remeber the name and basically they adopted it because it was made by their own and to sort of separate themselves from the past british colonial rule
lets post some leaders wearing weirdo special snowflake clothes
they both look like shit
  whats your problem hes right leaders should wear historical traditonal garb  why are you so against that  and wishing for all racial identities to melt into your bullshit malleable mono race what are you a kike lord     lets all just be a bunch of fucking sheep and yes men in our business suits to bow down and suck off the international jew go fuck yourself you transparent fuckhole im coming for you bud
  copies stalin in everything with minor differences  what a fucking incel
  the weaker they are the more they have to defend their culture see the french and their shits who try to defend their culture
  this
  minor differences they were remarkable different except for both being socialist dictators certainly much more different than stalin and any other eastern bloc leader
  gaddafi is a fashion icon
at some of these summits all the leaders dress up in local clothes
  do americans really wear straw hats and overalls to summit meetings
  its a kurta
  if you want to be taken seriously you wear a suit like everyone else    no matter what they say saudi arabia isnt considered a world power and if it wasnt for oil god knows where they would be today    india doesnt really count most of its diplomats wear suits and even the stuff modi wears is not that much different compared to the suit
  yer darn tootin partner
    western suit with a blanket thrown over it
  ah the jimmy savile look
  based n3v3r 4get  n3v3r 4give
  japan pushed for modernization in the 19th century they emulated england germany and america all 3 wore those suits so japan switched to those suits when doing business
  cape
  photos on clothes is traditional   leather jacket and ushanka is traditional  dress uniform is traditional
  i like how pretentiously unpretentious commie leader uniforms are they want to make a point out of not making a point
  post wwii japans been a puppet government installed by the west for obvious nukes reasons
  chad
  japan is an american vassal and they are influenced by american culture
  whwhite peepl hav no culture
     petition to make usian government officials wear cowboy hats to differentiate themselves from us europeans
  desu the japanese elite started wearing suits because they were studying abroad in european cities not because of postworld war relations with the us
  this they are super arrogant and elitist literally got made because of oil yet they think they are better than white people even       early years gaddafi was very western only started pretending he was african after it was clear that he would never be accepted by the west
movies and shows portray ancient and medieval battles as lotr style 1 on 1 fights with no regard for tactics or troy style battles where one side bum rushes the other side who is in a tight formation what are some books or movies/shows that show how they were actually fought
  alatriste have fun      alexander    full fight    better quality
  unironically those king arthur movies from the 60s
  the movie zulu acurately shows how zulus and brits fought in the 19th century
outlaw king
  whats a good book that is about how military tactics evolved with equipment inventions/innovations like 17th20th century
  from barry lyndon a great film in its own right      the reason why they seem to just be advancing into enemy fire and dropping like flies as a result is because their guns muskets were absolute garbage  weak slow unstable and inaccurate if they started running and getting dispersed they would basically ruin the entire regiments military capability keeping calm staying together and getting closer was not an option thats the only way you could do damage to the enemy
   it was in the reign of george iii that the aforesaid personages lived and quarreled good or bad handsome or ugly rich or poor  they are all equal now
  still incredulous that people were willing to engage in a war where you just stand your ground while cannon and shot is raining on your ranks  i know that if you try to avoid it you get routed but why engage in such a war in the first place its madness
  stab a charging horse in the chest  it just stops
  movies and shows portray ancient and medieval battles as lotr style 1 on 1 fights with no regard for tactics  have you read the iliad thats how it was
  the last kingdoms pitched battles are generally pretty good representations of what would probably have happened the othismos is well shown i think
  based
  no development happened between 2500bc and 1500ad
    i have a hard time believing that this is how cavalry works just run into the enemy and hope things work out
pullloooo formation    
  the first and only proper battle scene in that film
  show fuck
  i watched some behindthescenes of this battle scene many years ago and i remember the director or the fight coordinator if thats what theyre called being a total grade a hollywood asshole to the poor extras
  and chivalrypilled
  there was only one more battle in that show tho and it was between two roman armies and it was accurate also
  war isnt madness its the norm
    im glad netflix is trying and people are watching a black guy i work with said yall white people was wildin then after he overheard my coworker and i talking about the movie      there was no other way if the neighboring empire was coming and your local leader your trusted elder told you that they were going to tax the shit out of you and rape your daughters youd stop at nothing
  man alatriste would have made a great tv show or movie series  somehow they decided to condense like five books into one movie and i dont even understand why they bothered
  cuz you own side kills you first if you dont stand and fight
  its an anon on /his/ explains something everyone here already knows episode    this isnt facebook lad
  it really would have
  holy shit is that the un
  barry lyndon
  still incredulous that people were willing to engage in a war where you just stand your ground while dirty screaming men with spears and axes pour down on your ranks  i know that if you try to avoid it you get routed but why engage in such a war in the first place its madness
  nani
  watching gore videos you see guys take like 15 baseball bat hits to the head and theyre still conscious or they get stabbed 30 times before they die  it really makes you wonder how an ancient or medieval battle wouldve worked irl and not in movies
  well just take any of those gore videos or stabbing videos and multiply it by about 5000 and thats what ur average ancient battlefield looked like except maybe a little more organanized then ur average liveleak street brawl
  a horse can weigh up to just shy of a ton so sometimes thats all you need
    they were fucking nuts
why do people expect to see 100 historical accuracy in movies and video games of course people didnt fight like a lotr scene but its certainly fun to watch which is the point of movies
  damn
  i dont think they expect it all the time but it is nice every once and while to see a really brutal realistic reminder of how savage we really were are    i enjoy both the fantastical/hollywood style is fun and i appreciate a director bold enough to step into the realm of realism
  why wouldnt you want to see how it really was like to fight a battle like that
  i would im just tired of people complaining about the lack of realistic battles in historical fictions
    holy shit
  if you go to the historical wargaming general in /tg/ theres a giant ass repository of anything you could ever possibly want to read
    no this scene is not accurate at all the romans didnt fight that tight at all read polybius and vegetius the romans preferred to fight in open order the romans also didnt rotate individual warriors like that but apparantly whole units the romans had a fighting style that was individualistic and honored those that showed their prowess in battle see je lendons soldiers and ghost    this scene is nothing but pure pop history that masquerades as a legitimate scene
  the iliad is basically a piece of fiction too
  the human body is weird as long as an injury doesnt hit anything vital it can carry on like normal but sprain 1 ligament and the entire thing is crippled
  a black guy i work with said yall white people was wildin then  what did he mean with that
      no way could this be how it was too many battles show the knights suffering minimum casualties in battles where thousands died
  pic related  i heard swedish caroleans did the same thing where they would rush the enemy fire then emerge though the smoke and engage melee combat was this a commonly used tactic   sorry for derail i just thought this was intresting
  what are some books    frontinius led his centurions down the hunters path at the trot in a minute or so their centuries would follow them down the through the trees and in those few seconds he needed to lay the foundations of a successful defence if he mused humourlessly while his mind worked on their options for defending an apparently hopeless position the entire cohort not simply dying in the first barbarian assault could be termed a success ten yards from the forests edge he stopped and gathered his officers around him their faces betraying the same grim determination fixed in his own mind    brothers there isnt time for any inspirational stuff or exhortations to heroism put simply weve been sent to fight and likely to die in order to buy time for the other legions to jump those bluenosed bastards from behind and put it to them the oldfashioned way your men are going to realise that soon enough when they see thousands of men coming up the hill for their heads they will look to you for an example give them one show them a grim face but not despair lead your centuries with aggression but keep them disciplined if we do this right we can still pull a victory out of this disaster but that depends solely on us we are now the most important ten men on this battlefield  so lets live up to that burden in the next hour    he paused looking at each man to take a gauge of their resolve good enough
  orders the cohort will come down this path in number order with the fifth at the rear and the ninth in their place in the centre the prefect will make sure of that take your centuries down the slope to the line i point out to you and set up for defence two men deep and no more threefoot spacing per man were lucky that the wood curves down on both sides to meet our flanks so we can anchor the line off the trees get the ground in front of you dirty as quickly as possible and get your caltrops out straight after that speaking of trees  bear    the big man stepped forward    your axemen will be last down the path take them to left and right and make me an abatis as fast as you can three rows of fallen trees deep all the way from each end of the line back round to the path but leave the path clear of obstruction when the obstacles are in place widen the path enough to let four men down it abreast in the unlikely event of our being reinforced id like the way in behind us wide enough for a cohort to move down it at speed everyone clear and remember brothers win or lose this day will be sung about long after the rain washes our blood away lets make it a story worth telling
  the tungrians exploded out of the wood on to the open ground the centuries hurrying down to the line pointed out by frontinius as they cleared the trees the first spear barked at his centurions to speed up their deployment as he pointed each century to its place aware that the tribesmen pausing in their assault on the shrinking remnant of the sixth legion to watch the new development could turn and charge towards them at any second the wood behind the cohort echoed with the growing racket of eighty axes working furiously on the treefelling that would defend their flanks and rear each tree was under attack by two of the 10th centurys men as they laboured with expert blows to drop it neatly into position with its branches facing outwards presenting an impassable obstacle once the line was established each end anchored in the trees to either side as the wood curved around their defence he gave a small sigh of relief and shouted his next command    get that slope dirtied up    the cohorts long line marched a dozen paces down the gentle slope then stopped the troops fishing under their groin protectors to urinate on to the grass selected men ran to the small stream that ran through their new position and filled their helmets with water carrying the load carefully back to their places in the line before emptying the liquid on to the ground on command they stamped and twisted with their hobnailed boots digging at the wet ground beneath their feet ignoring the spray of acidicsmelling mud that spattered their lower legs and retreating gradually back towards their former positions to leave a fiveyard strip of ground in front of their line an oozing mess frontinius ignored the drama taking place below them as the 6th legions surviving troops huddled into three ever dwindling groups with the ground to their front made treacherously slippery he called for the last element of their defence    obstacles and tribuli
  the centuries mustered the heavy fivefootlong staves each man had carried from the camp each one sharpened to a firehardened point at both ends and lashed them into giant obstacles each formed of three stakes tied together with rope bags full of the small iron tribuli were strewn around the obstacles presenting sharp points to the feet of the unwary attacker julius standing with his 5th century behind the main line of defence both escort to the cohorts standard and tactical reserve turned to speak to his chosen man    you can keep an eye on this lot im going down to the front to get a better view and have a chat with my young roman friend i see no reason why he should get all the fun    he strode down the slope clapping an arm around marcuss shoulders and pointing out across the warbands presently scattered force lowering his head to the younger mans ear he spoke quietly a gentle smile on his face    well centurion there they are twenty thousand angry bluefaced men who will very shortly come up this buttock of a hill to take our heads are you ready to die with your men    marcus nodded grimly    ready enough but before they take my head ill send a good number to meet cocidius before me    julius laughed slapping him delightedly on the back    and you dont mind if i stay for the fun i cant stand being stuck back guarding that bloody statue while you get all the glory and i might be of some use when the shit starts flying     marcus nodded but raised a finger in mock admonishment    as long as you contain your contribution to swordplay and the occasional piece of advice its a deal if you want to command the scout century make sure you come second in the competition next year    
      as the cohort stood helplessly and watched the final destruction of their beleaguered colleagues in the valley below them a keeneyed tungrian called out a sighting pointing at the valleys far slope there made tiny by the distance moved a party of three war chariots accompanied by some fifty native cavalry cantering steadily across the battlefield a great dragon banner flew proudly in the wind of their passage its forked tail whipping eagerly from side to side the prefect stared out at the oncoming horsemen raising his eyebrows in question    the infamous calgus coming for a look    frontinius snorted    probably wondering whats going on i doubt perennis actually told him that he intended to send us to our doom here and were on rising ground and in good order eight hundred spears could make a mediumsized mess of his warband before they roll over us and slow up his next move if hes the strategist i believe him to be hell be worried keen to take his prizes and get his men away before second and twentieth legions come over the horizon baying for blood id suggest that we might look a little more confident just to reinforce that nagging doubt perhaps we could make some noise    equitius smiled    hail calgus those about to die salute you    something like that    very well trumpeter sound prepare for defence
  the notes sang out sweetly hanging for a moment over the hill piercing the continual hammering of axes after the shortest of pauses frontinius heard his centurions shouting their commands then the soft rattle of spears being readied frontinius strode forward in front of the cohort as was his right drawing his sword and raising it above his head polished steel shining in the midmorning sun then turned back to face the ranks of grimfaced soldiers he swung the weapon down to waist height rapping the blades flat on to his shields scarred surface repeating the blow to establish a slow but steady rhythm that was easy for the soldiers to follow as they rapped their spears against the metal bosses of their shields the noise built quickly until the pulses of sound echoed distantly back from the slopes about them a basic intimidating noise that put heart back into the more timid troops and swelled the anger of the rest as they stood and waited for the chariots and horsemen to draw close the dragon banner snaked across the valley floor drooping limply back on to its standard as the horsemen came to a halt two hundred paces from the tungrian line    after a moment a rider came forward cantering within shouting distance and then stopping to stare across the lines of hardfaced leanframed soldiers before calling out his message over their noise    the lord calgus suggests negotiation man to man no others to attend safety is guaranteed    he wheeled his horse riding back to the knot of barbarian cavalry without a backwards glance frontinius glanced over at the prefect seeing the romans jawline tighten as his lips pursed to a white line    well prefect shall we go and meet the man that tarred and torched the inhabitants of fort habitus and roaring river
  the prefect stared at the distant dragon banner fitfully prancing in the gusts above his enemys bodyguard for a long moment before responding putting a hand on his first spears shoulder    the invitation was for one ill go youll stay here and lead the cohort if this should be some sort of device to distract us or to capture a senior officer    and if it is      ill probably be joining my father rather sooner than ive previously thought would be the case as might the lord calgus    he walked on down the slope watching his step on the treacherous strip of glutinous mud and stepping carefully to avoid the tribulis eager spikes and came to a stop halfway between his own troops and those of his enemy a figure had stepped from their ranks as he had and paced towards the field towards him carrying a bundle wrapped in a bloodied blanket until they were close enough for spoken conversation although beyond swordthrust    they stared at each other for a moment the prefect eying the other mans bundle with unhappy certainty as to its contents until the briton chose to break the silence his latin unaccented    well then prefect i am calgus lord of the northern tribes i broke the wall i despoiled your forts from three mountains all the way south to noisy valley and i pointing a thumb back over his shoulder caught your legatus in a trap of my careful making with his legion and now i have something to show you
  he allowed the bundle to fall open its contents dropping to the grass at his feet the highly polished bronze eagle from the 6th legions standard gleamed prettily in the morning sun its defiant spreadwinged pose incongruous under the circumstances while the helmeted head rolled slowly across the grass and came to a stop on its side sollemniss dead stare facing out towards the waiting tungrians equitius sank to his haunches staring intently into his friends lifeless eyes calgus put his hands on his hips and waited for a response while the prefect took a long moment before rising silently to his feet the roman nodded still staring down at his friends severed head his face stony then lifted his gaze to stare back at the waiting briton    this man was my friend for more years than i care to recall we drank together chased women together in our younger days and we fought romes enemies together too men like you we tasted the barbarity of combat with men like you and we rose above it we kept our humanity but we always won those battles by doing whatever we had to so if youre hoping to unman me with this display youre going to be disappointed its nothing less than i expected and nothing less than i would have done in your place but it changes nothing    he took a deep breath and squared his shoulders    so calgus lets get this over with i am prefect septimus equitius of the 1st tungrian cohort i found your cattle in front of the hill and burned them to deny your men their flesh and prevent your attack on my fortress i lured your cavalry from the cover of the forest for the petriana to destroy and i and he in turn pointed back over his own shoulder am going to keep your warband here for long enough that the rest of our army will fall on them and utterly destroy them    
    they will not withdraw their prefect was disappointingly resolute    aed raised his eyebrows indicating a desire to speak    then we must fight my lord no warrior will willingly walk away from that many heads begging to be taken besides many are not yet blooded     i agree but it must be fast the roman spoke of other legions and at the very least the other cohorts commanded by their legatus must be close at hand and their bloody petriana too handled properly their cavalry and even one full legion could carve us to ribbons if they caught us here even though we would be more than twice their number send a rider to emer and cataluss warbands  theyve stood and watched the others kill romans they must be raring to get into the fight    the tribal bands moved forward at the run eager after watching their fellows rip the guts out of the hopelessly outnumbered cohorts the younger men joshed each other as they ran boasting breathlessly of the heads they would take the older warriors straining to catch a glimpse of their adversaries and take their measure the two leaders met as they ran agreeing swiftly on a simple left and right split nothing fancy in the amount of time they had a straight forward charge and hack using their superior strength in numbers to overwhelm the auxiliaries
  on their slope the tungrians stood impassively still hammering out the menacing rhythm of spear and shield the noise numbing their senses to any fear replacing the emotion with an incoherent sense of common identity the cohort had ceased to be a collection of individuals and had become an engine of destruction ready to strike the relentless pulse of its fighting heart had stripped away the feeling of self from its members and left them in a state of detachment from reality ready for the impersonal fury shortly to be required for their survival they watched still pounding out their defiance as the enemy advanced quickly across the open ground to their front forming up into lines that roughly matched their own one hundred and fifty paces down the slope out of spears throw another brief command rang out from the trumpeter silencing the drumming and bringing their spears into the preparatory position for the throw in the sudden silence the slight noises of weapons and armour were suddenly magnified the dull clink of equipment ringing out across the slope as both sides made ready    in the 9th centurys front line scarface and his mates braced themselves for the fight to come the veteran soldier talking quietly to the men around him even the tent partys watch officer deferred to the scarred soldiers twenty years of experience    now lads this is going to be a right gang fuck once they get up the slope so heres how its going to go when uncle sextus gives the order well sling a volley of spears into them aim for the men whove lost their footing the ones too distracted to see your spear coming until its tickling their backbone youve carried the bloody thing on your back since the day you joined and never really had the chance to use it properly so make the fucking thing pay you back for all those miles youve carted it thatll be one less bluenose to wave a sword at you
  once the spears are gone we air our blades double quick and get the shields set strong ready for them to hit the line with everything theyve got you lads at the rear you get a good fucking grip of our belts and brace us to hold firm were on a nice slope so it shouldnt be too hard to hold them if we work together after that you just concentrate on the same old drills board and sword parry and thrust put your gladius into a bluenoses guts twist the fucker kick him off it and get back behind your board dont fucking stand there watching him die or his mate will carve you up just like you would if you was him    he paused swelling his chest with a great draught of air    breathe deep lads youll need all the air you can get in the next few minutes and just remember any of you bastards turn from this fight before its done and youll have me and my blade to deal with once were done with this shower of unwashed hairy arseholes we stand together    along the tungrian line a few men quailed and were swiftly dealt with by the officers and their older comrades slaps and kicks putting them back into the line the majority listened to the cohorts veteran soldiers tell them how to deal with what was coming and stared impassively down the slope at their enemy prepared to kill in order to live a stark equation both understood and accepted in order to live through to see their women and children again they would have to slaughter the tribesmen in great numbers almost to a man the soldiers were ready to start the butchery
  in the tribal ranks men swiftly made their last preparations discarding heavy items of clothing that would restrict their movements in the coming melee muttering hasty prayers to their gods for victory the older warriors alive to the possibilities of the coming combat sensibly added the hope for a clean death should their time have come without the time to indulge in any lengthy diatribe against the invaders the chieftains looked to each other nodded their readiness then charged forward up the slope hurling thousands of warriors at the flimsy roman line    the tungrian centurions looked to frontinius at the lines centre waiting for his signal as the barbarian horde surged up the gentle incline waiting with one arm raised he watched the shaggy warriors storm towards his men thirty yards twentyfive the usual range of the initial spearthrow twenty until at fifteen yards from the shield wall they hit the strip of greasy mud that his troops had painstakingly stamped into bubbling ruin the leading wave of attackers slowed fighting to stay on their feet as they bunched to avoid the giant wooden obstacles sharpened points crowded from behind and perilously close to falling headlong into the mud more than a few suddenly shouted their pain as the scattered metal caltrops half hidden in the mud pierced their feet the tribesmens attention was suddenly focused more downward than forward    scarface raised his spear shouting encouragement to his comrades easing the weapon back and forth in readiness to throw as he searched for a target among the mass of tribesmen struggling towards the tungrian line
  frontinius whipped his hand downward in the preagreed signal a volley of spears arced flatly into the struggling tribesmen finding targets unprotected in their struggle to stay upright the front ranks shivered with the impact men screaming as flying steel spitted them through limb and trunk their flailing bodies adding to the chaos as the barbarian charge faltered    the veteran soldier found his mark a big man carrying a sixfootlong sword momentarily distracted by the greasy footing and stepped forward to throw his spear arm outstretched as he followed the weapons flight through to his point of aim the barbarian jerked as the spears cruel steel head punched into his belly blood jetting from the wound as he sank to his knees drawing his sword with a smile of satisfaction scarface backed up the slope until he felt hands grab his belt to steady him lifting his shield into line with those to his right and left    along the line the centurions bawled new commands their men drawing their swords and crouching deeper behind their shields as the barbarian wave regained some of its momentum shrugging aside the dead and dying to struggle towards the silent tungrian line seeing their momentary difficulty frontinius made a snap decision lifting his sword and pointing at the barbarians with its blade bawling the order that unleashed his men down the slope    with a shrill of whistles from their officers the cohort lunged the few remaining paces down the hill into their enemy smashing into the struggling barbarian line with their heavy shields and bowling the enemy front line back into the warriors behind then stepped in with their swords
  scarface heard the whistle kicked back to disengage the soldier held fast to his belt and bounded down the slope alongside his comrades with a bloodcurdling howl punching his shields metal boss into the face of a warrior with his sword raised to strike then stabbing his swords point into the mans guts and kicking him off the blade in one fluid motion he shouted to his mates as he raised his shield into position    line reform the line    the cohorts front rank snapped their shields back into place presenting the barbarians with an unbroken wall to frustrate their attacks the soldiers repeatedly punched the metal bosses of their shields into the faces of the oncoming men upsetting their precarious balance then stabbed their short swords into their chosen targets aiming for the body points that centuries of experience had taught would kill a man in seconds blood flew across the gap between the two lines in hot sprays as men fell back from the point of combat weapons falling from their hands as they sought to halt the flow or hold intestines into torn bellies or simply explored agonising wounds with shocked bewilderment as life ebbed from their bodies the ground beneath their feet doused with a mixture of blood urine and faeces became steadily more treacherous the tungrian rear ranks role became one of keeping the men in front on their feet and not exposed to an enemy blow on the ground punching and thrusting at the seething throng that railed desperately at their shield wall parrying enemy sword and axe strokes and striving in turn to murder their deliverers the tungrians fought as men who understood that their only survival lay in slaughter cold blooded and clinically efficient
  in the 9ths front rank scarface crouched behind his shield his left arm shuddering with the shock of swordblows against its scarred wooden face watching the barbarians intently through the gap between his helmet and the shields top edge looking for any chance to strike the longhaired warrior facing him hemmed in by the men around him raised his sword to chop the blade downward in the only attack open to him and presented a fleeting opportunity that the experienced soldier took without hesitation stepping forward one pace he thrust his sword between the other mans ribs and dropped him doubled over with the sudden awful pain into the bloodspattered mud    a tribesman already fallen with a spear through his thigh gathered his strength to strike at the romans extended leg but the wily soldier simply slammed the sharpened metal edge of his shield down across the mans sword arm slicing down to the bone before stepping quickly back into his place in the shield wall the man next to him slipped on the mud going down on to one knee and opening himself up to the blows of his attackers without conscious thought scarface shifted his shield to protect his mate for the critical seconds required for him to regain his footing ignoring his own peril the man to his right killed a tribesman shaping to attack the momentarily unprotected veteran ripping open his throat with a swift stab of his gladius within seconds their wall of shields was complete again steady against the barbarians railing at its unyielding face    to marcus standing behind the double line of his men with a tent party of soldiers ready to thrust into holes hacked in the line it looked like a hopelessly unequal battle as the seconds passed he realised that most of the dying was being done on the other side of their shields relatively few of his own men had gone down despite the thick throng of enemy pressing up the slope
  stand fast ninth century parry and thrust    dubnuss familiar booming voice gave him heart and he shouted his own encouragement above the screams and shouts of the battle a gap opened in the line in front of him a pair of men felled by the same massive axe blow and he instinctively pushed the replacements aside and stepped into the breach before any of the enemy could surge through the tribesman wielding the axe stamped down at his victim attempting to wrench the blade from deep in his victims chest then gaped as marcuss powerful chopping blow hacked away his right arm a heavy boot striking him under the chin the maimed man fell back into the wall of frenzied bluepainted faces that confronted marcus and was lost to view replaced by another who seeing marcuss rank leapt forward in attack only to be spitted by the cavalry swords length twisting the blade in a savage halfcircle inside the barbarians scrabbling hands to loosen it within the body cavity he punched forward with his shield at the dying mans chest ripping the sword free in a shower of gore that painted both the shield and his chest dark red    to his left a man from the neighbouring century suddenly leapt forward into the mass of the enemy thrusting about him in a blood frenzy killing one then another barbarian then sank bloodsoaked into the throng of the enemy screaming as a dozen battlecrazed warriors bludgeoned him to death the centurys chosen man pushed a man into the gap bellowing at his men to keep their heads and hold the line
  to their front marcus reckoned as he parried and stabbed at the enemy in front of him with his men the onslaught was easing as the tiring tribesmen found it harder to stay on their feet with so many of their own dead and wounded underfoot one of the less seriously wounded attempted to cut at his ankles from the ground provoking a hacking stroke that neatly removed his arm at the elbow the man rolled back under his comrades feet tumbling two of them on top of him with his agonised writhing    the mass of tribesmen in front of marcus parted without warning allowing a tall and heavily armoured man to step out into the gap between the two lines his black helmet and chest armour were intricately decorated with silver inlays and already coated with dried blood his thighs and calves protected by iron greaves he eyed the young centurion with cold appraisal for a moment then with a sudden lunge sprang to attack the officer three savage hacking blows from his heavy sword smashed into marcuss shield their power numbing his left arm and putting him on the defensive the big warrior paused in his attack laughing down into marcuss face his voice a grating boom over the noise of the battle    ive already taken the head of a legatus today so i wont bother with yours ill leave it to the crows are you ready to die little roman
  marcus held his ground ignoring the taunts and readied himself for the next onslaught the big man sprang forward again but this time marcus met his sword not with his shield but blade to blade turning the blow aside and stepping close in to slam his shields iron frame down on the warriors unarmoured foot feeling bones crack under the impact as the warrior fought to control the pain he attacked again stabbing downward with his sword and spearing the blade through the mans shattered foot and into the soft ground below before twisting it savagely and ripping the sword free then while the huge warrior staggered where he stood paralysed by the crippling pain marcus raised his shield to the horizontal and chopped its harsh metal edge into his attackers undefended throat with all his strength with a stifled gurgle the tribal champion fell back from the shield wall fighting for breath that was never going to reach his lungs through a ruptured windpipe the barbarian line shivered and inched backwards away from the cheering tungrians as their hero fell to the ground his face darkening as he twisted in his death throes    along the line the gap between the two forces widened a little as the tribesmen paused to regain their wind in dismay at the failure of their initial assault the tungrians straightened their line one eye for the man next to them one on the enemy horns blew to the warbands rear ordering the tribesmen to pull back and reform and they backed reluctantly down the hill still shouting defiance at the roman troops no command was given to follow their retreat
  on the slope before the panting tungrians lay hundreds of enemy warriors some dead some dying all spattered with blood some moaning pitifully with the pain of their wounds others screaming intermittently in their agony and distress the men of the 9th stared bleakly down at the scene some those few among them familiar with the sights and sounds of a full battle with numb indifference most simply wideeyed at the horror of the scene one or two made ineffectual efforts to wipe away the gore that had blasted across armour and flesh with each sword stroke but most restricted themselves to wiping the blood from their eyes and mouths knowing that there would be more to replace whatever they removed from their bodies and equipment soon enough julius sought out marcus pulling him from the front rank with a rebuke softened by the young officers wideeyed look of astonishment    thats a good place to get killed stay behind the line next time and put your soldiers into the fight weve got a short time before they come back it would be a good opportunity for the century to drink some water ill check for casualties     he looked down at the two men killed by the axeman one without head and right arm the other cloven a foot down into his chest    best you remove these two theyre already with cocidius     marcus pointed down at the wounded tribesmen to their front almost within touching distance    what about them    the reply was dismissive    theyre dead they just havent realised it yet leave them there theyll slow down the next attack    the young officer nodded jerkily calling for the water bottles to be passed along the line and commanding the closest men to carry the ruined corpses of their dead into the forest at their rear
  in the tungrian front rank scarface leaned on his shield grateful for the chance to get his breath back and take a mouthful of water to swill away the coppery taste of blood    that was good enough we must have done twenty or so of the bastards and lost what two of ours who came forward to replace them    the promoted rearrankers raised their hands sheepishly    you two eh welcome to the front rank boys this is where the corn gets earned the hard way keep your heads for a few minutes more and youll have a place here for the rest of your time    he laughed at their comical expressions as both men realised that their lives as soldiers had just changed for ever    oh yes all that pisstaking the front rank always gives the girls at the back thatll be you giving rather than taking from now on welcome to my army    the 9th drank gratefully the more composed soldiers discussing the fight almost conversationally leaning tiredly on their shields like pottery workers taking a break from the kilns some the more experienced and perceptive knowing the danger of the less experienced men losing themselves to the battle rage when the fight renewed itself worked on the men next to them coaxing them back to reality with words of home and family morban found marcus checking the edge of his sword with a careful eye and offered him a drink from his bottle    nicely fought centurion you took that big bastards arm off like lopping a sapling and the way you did the boy in black armour with your shield was nothing short of poetic the ladsre already talking about the way you jumped into the line and got stuck in    marcus nodded sheathing his sword and holding on to the hilt to hide the shaking of his hand    thank you i hope your son escaped injury    indeed i think so the little i could see of him from here
  a shout from the line of troops grabbed his attention pointing arms guiding his stare to the edge of the valley a mile or so to their right past the small forests edge there silhouetted against the skyline a mass of horsemen was moving into position perfectly placed to sweep down the slope and into the barbarian flank their long lances were held vertically the points making a winking glitter of razorsharp steel in the midmorning sunlight    get the bluefaced bumfuckers    give them the eightfoot enema    a chorus of shouts implored the riders identified as the petriana and augustan cavalry wings by their twisting white banners two thousand men strong to attack the mass of men below but their inaction once their deployment was complete was just as equitius had expected an unsupported charge against so many warriors could end only in a glorious failure all the same anything that gave calgus one more thing to worry about and heartened his own men had to be good even as he watched a force of some five thousand men detached themselves from the barbarian mass on the plain below wheeling at speed to form a rough defensive line of archers and spears ready to absorb any charge    he walked on to the point where his command ended and caeliuss started hailing his brother officer the other man strode down the line of barbarian corpses keeping one eye on the ground against the risk of being surprised by a wounded man feigning death    hail two knives freshly blooded from the rumour passed down our line and from the blood painted across your mail i hope you offered that prayer for me    marcus smiled wryly    i was a little busy at the time ill be sure to mention you next time i can get to an altar    good enough what do you think theyll do now
  both men stared downslope at the milling horde order gradually returning to their mass    if i were leading them keep the cavalry safely at arms length put some archers and slingers out front harass us with darts and stones to keep our heads down and pull the rest away before two full legions take them dry from behind     equitius was weighing the same question    we came down here as bait to keep the warband in place until the main force can be moved up i dont believe weve been here long enough to have achieved that aim do you    frontinius shook his head with pursed lips    another hour at least id say i presume youd like to attract their attention some more rather than letting them slip away into the hills    yes they can break into family bands and worm their way into the folds in the land we might only take a tenth of them if that happens     the first spear called a man to him muttered instructions in his ear and then turned back to the conversation    i have a way to hold them here but it wont be pleasant especially since theyll come back up that slope like wild animals    the prefect nodded slowly    as long as calgus doesnt pull his men away to safety the price will be justified do whatever you have to    the first spear nodded impassively and turned away walking down the cohorts line at the hightide mark of barbarian dead inspecting the troops as if on peacetime parade giving an encouraging word here and there the man hed sent to help him search for a particular corpse had succeeded running down the line of shields with a freshly removed head dripping blood on his leggings
  the first spear took it from him examining the slack face with an intensity that was almost feral the owners hair was long and greasy the seams of his face dark with the grime of long days on the march his eyes stared glassily back their animation long departed along with the man that had formerly watched the world through their windows    how do you know he was a chieftain    the other man held out his hand showing his superior an impressively heavy torc stained dark red with blood the gold wrapped in a serpentine arc that had previously been around the dead mans neck frontinius took the heavy piece of jewellery weighing it in his hand and remembering the one like it that dubnuss father had always worn even after his dethronement    somebody was important    he turned to stare down at the barbarian warband quiet now waiting for a command and spoke again without taking his eyes off the mass of warriors    go to the prefect warn him to be ready    he stood silently on the slope for a moment the head dangling almost forgotten from one hand the torc in the other until the men below him alerted by those at the front grew silent at the sight    
      frontinius lifted head and torc the former dangling by its greasy hair the latter glinting in the early afternoon sun inflating his barrel chest he bellowed out across the mass of men below silencing their growing noise    leave this place now or we will kill you all warriors you have failed once and you will fail again like the children that you are compared to real soldiers    he paused for breath and allowed the silence to drag on for a long moment    we killed your leaders and threw you back down this insignificant hill with ease you came seeking heads and left your own by the hundred if you come back up again we will do the same to you see the head of a defeated chieftain    he swung the dead mans head in a lazy arc by its hair resisting the temptation to hurl its obscenity away from him and into the seething tribesmen raising the heavy torc to glint in the sunshine and be recognised as a symbol of authority    you were weak and we punished you now run away before we treat you all like this    feeling queasy he put the head to his crotch and pushed his hips at it in an unmistakable gesture then threw it high into the air above their heads with an angry roar the tribesmen surged forward charging up the hill in their mad fury frontinius ducked back into the line of soldiers shouting for them to ready their spears    and that seems a good place to stop right right  ave atque vale
that feel when you learn about realistic combat and its even more stupid than what you see in hollywood movies
  that guy is a notorious hack who has been disowned by the rest of the hema community for years why do people keep posting this webm
    making precise aimed stabs at the only weak points available is stupid
  i hope you dont actually believe this shit lol
    there is a tv series though
  troy took place in the heroic age of very very ancient mediterranean bum rushing was par on the course especially when your entire society is into champion combat and chad warrior heroes
    source
  par on the course  yikes
  many unironically believed theyd go straight to heaven when they die then there was the collective tribalist thing going if all your friends are going you cant let them down you cant abandon them you dont want to look like a soiboi coward the bait and switch scam could be used even if youre a professional soldier if youre pigshit poor waiting around doing nothing and someone gives you and all your buddies a gold crown you will be tempted to take the short term gain over the possibility of marching to your death similarly you may have entered into a contract for military service years ago many were petty criminals who had decided they dont want to grow old poor and were willing to take risks for the pay and opportunity for loot of course they could be forced to join despite having no prior obligation however this could result in mass desertions
  because its funny
  it is well known that premodern battles were brutal melees where it took a long while to kill anyone especially if they were armored
would it be nice to just sit some hill next to some battlefield where two armies fight like they did in the past and watch how it really is
  how the fuck do you survive all of that  also source
  it bothers me that hollywood seem to think that shields were only some sort of fashion statement rather than a tool
  this was incredible more pls
  was this specific characteristic rare enough to be noteworthy something common  ill let you think about your question for a second
  it works a few times because other side doesnt think youd actually be a madman and do it  it sort of loses its effect once people expect you to do it a la the scottish
  cool havent seen it though
clip     movie 
  youre wrong in fact due to the technological advancements of the time it was advantageous to be the last one to fire as it meant that you would be closer to the foe human psychology however dictates that you waste a motherfucker that attacks you and to not expose yourself to immediate danger which meant that you needed discipline to be able to pull off something as counterintuitive as calmly marching into gunfire and taking a volley before you get near enough to fire back the follow upcharge is also a great use of human psychology as no person likes to be charged by some mad blokes in funny hats whore wielding sharpened objects to stand and fight definitely does not come natural to a human being but must be trained in and even then its not guaranteed
  just imagine how pissed youd have to be to be able to shrug that shit off and keep fighting
  swing a sword at someone wearing mail and presumably gambeson  he just fucking dies  thats some grade a bullshit right there
not posting an actual sword fight    
  its called adrenaline and discipline
  didnt some crazy middle class people go and have picknicks on the hills surrounding some american civil war battle before they got chased off by some cavalry charging after fleeing enemies
  that old guy charging down the stairs by himself and then just casually strolls back up when he loses his sword
  the sword gets knocked from his hand  it reminds me of rennaisance spain or italy romeo and juliet type of aesthetic fighting with sabres on a big white staircase
  kek    think about it harder    he doesnt realize how savage his own race is/was in combat using spears and clubs to massacre each other blacks diassociate from negative parts of their history actively
  not related
  its the battle of bannockburn and the english themselves recorded 700 cavalry dead
  robert was using an axe there and the other dude who swung at the rider hit his armpit which is definitely a weaker point since they came up with a specialized piece of armor for it him getting knocked off the horse by the blow is bullshit though
  the pay was good
  but then people adapted to that by improving the method of delivering volleys  despite the emphasis that generals liked to put on the bayonet it was firepower that won the vast majority of any conflict
  i know that if you try to avoid it you get routed  how about not standing as tightly packed together as possible  20 meters between each man should be doable
  horses often put on the brakes after being stabbed like this even a little bit they sometimes even stopped before they even reached the men they arent just machines they are animals who arent going to necessarily suicidally charge into a wall of spears
  that is literally how it worked and that is why pike formations were the beginning of the end of cavalry
  not realistic the french should not have been able to reload and shoot so many times before the british line reached them    also  muskets  weak
  john clements is a nutbar who requires complicit students for his martial arts like those aikido guys who claim to use mind rays to knock people over
nobody can come up with how ancient battles were fought how do expect movie directors to do the same    you have people that see ancient battles as literal shoving matches with two sides trying to roll the other in a giant shoving match you also have those that subscribe to the pulse theory in which there is an initial clash of lines a retreat for both sides to catch their breath and during these time warriors would be hurdling missiles there would be duels and independent group of warriors would go engage the enemy before another engagement
  but then people adapted to that by improving the method of delivering volleys  which didnt happen overnight which you seem to suggest with your problem previous post
  then you get an absurdly long and weak line and a diluted volley
  his point was that if a horse charges straight into a spear the spear wouldnt be sufficient opposition to break the momentum of the horse the horse wouldnt be able to stop at the spot but would atleast dead or not travel some distance further
  how do expect movie directors to do the same  they could atleast try to depict it in a realistic fashion instead of using formations like some sort of prebattle teambuilding exercise
  realism is a crutch for bad story tellers
  did you watch the video each dude put his shield in front of him before each conflict
    same thing happened in ancient greece
  my girlfriend cried about all of the horses being killed and asked if i thought any of the horses doing the filming were hurt  great movie though one of few on netflix
    troy kinda had a bit of the pulse feel and the choreography of achilles and hektor was beautiful didnt really feel excessively western wuxia like so much melee in hollywood except for achilles jump attack
  if youd watch the clip youd see actors draw their shield away from their own body when they attack with their weapon
the reason the massacres of the first half of the 20th century in europe came to such a shock to europeans was not that they were unprecedented in recent history rather it was that such treatment used to be reserved to the colonies outside of europe  africa india east asia etc    the extreme devastating violence of 20thcentury europe was a case of europeans getting a taste of their own medicine or more accurately of largely innocent european civilians suddenly being ruled with the same brutality and cruelty extraeuropean colonial subjects were    change my mind
  ya pretty much
    how about you post proofs instead of writing stupid white guilt fanfic lets start from there
  why change your mind if it is true
  this has nothing to do with white guilt im white and i dont think white as a whole are responsible for that turn of event which is why i operate a distinction between european civilians and their rulers
  post proofs then its pointless to debunk complete nonsense this is not /b/
  its not hard to find anon                
youre retarded if you assume only europeans are capable of such brutality    youre uneducated if you think europeans werent less savage    
  at no point did i pretend that european powers were the only ones capable of brutality and cruelty they most certainly arent
    churchill contemplated using lethal gas en masse against anticolonialist uprisings
  only grmanic brutality matched that of primitive cultures
  this statement is wrong because grmanic culture is primitive culture
its just how humanity is as a whole and how individuals perceive the world
  ehhh i think the colonial era had that futa/traps arent gay/queer as fuck in europeans at the time where questioning it or critically review led to sperg outs by various peopled
  actually the reason the world wars in europe were shocking was because they took place between industrialised stable nations with high populations armed with weapons and ideologies of immense killing power without ever having truly seen them unleashed or an opponent who could keep feeding men into the mincer when they did the colonial wars and massacres of the 19th century might be deplorable but they never created something as hellish as the killing fields of verdun or erected temples to extermination like auschwitz the closest thing was the free congo state and that abomination still took five times as long to murder half as much as wwi did
  except they were unprecedented unless youre actually gonna claim there was a previous conflict that killed as many people
  but they never created something as hellish as the killing fields of verdun or erected temples to extermination like auschwitz    boer camps the hellish plantations in portuguese africa or any colony that used massive forced labour the massive deaths in french kongo building a train to the ocean namibian genocides indian famines
  wwi didnt kill as many as some of the chink wars      nope 100 correct the russojap war is proof of this look at their propaganda then they got their ass handed to them by an inferior race and it shook europe
  leaving aside the rest because they are all horrific  boer camps  what the fuck is up with /his/ and their constant weeping over goddamn boers what a bunch of misplaced dutchmen fuck around in the cape for two centuries then get into some interimperialist scrap with some bongs and suddenly theyre not white settlers anymore that theyre now victims of colonialism instead of agents fucks sake youd think antiimperialists would give the british some rare kudos for fucking them up a little instead of making them some kind of equivalent to actual martyrs like the herero
  wwi didnt kill as many as some of the chink wars  lol are you seriously blaming european colonialism for those
are miracles real have you seen one
the fact that youre still a virgin after all these years
  now thats hardly a miracle aint it
while im no longer a huge fan of bad orange man i consider his election to be a miracle in every sense of the word ie an impossible event made real by supernatural forces or events
the year is 1790 you are a seer brought by grigori potemkin to the court of catherine the great you have seen the fate of the romanov dynasty potemkin believes you and has brought you to court you are about to announce this to the entire court
  liberalize and industrialise and take one for the team by dropping all your dumb privileges otherwise your nation will go to ruin
  dont talk to serbia
  catherine seized power via coupd etat killing her husband in the process she was a disciple of enlightenment philosophy    she would not be shocked nor will she care if you tell her nicky was shot and monarchy overthrown shed certainly answer well he probably deserved it and highfive joseph stalin
5756633 hey nobles ive just talked to a seer he says if we dont give up our serfs and privileges the nation will be in ruin in 110 years and will any of us be alive then well no but we have to take one for the team here right the nobles would rise up en masse    5756676 always good advice    5756753 you are about to announce this to the entire court not just catherine i disagree that she wouldnt try and preemptively prevent the fall of the romanovs
implying i want to save the monarchy
kill every last jew in russia and anyone named lenin
name a more based statesman     spoilerpro tip you cant
  i just did    unifies germany
  i think you mean ruined hanover bavaria wurttemberg saxony bohemia schleswigholstein and others with prussian militarism and autism
  except austria
  revel in the majesty of the sunking
  cuxhaven  tee hee
  he thinks tito was based    yikes
  maintaining stability between a handful of ethnic groups with the biggest hatred for one another  being based  pick two
  he would be cool if he didnt have that gay ass helmet  seriously that alone just makes me think of him as a fag
  creates a retard governmental system which can only barely operate under his rule and american money   falls apart in a violent series of wars never before seen in europe since the ww2 as soon as he dies/americans stop cease giving money     this hellhole of a country is only successful in the minds of absolute retards and illiterates such as yourself    also reminder that communist yugoslavia had the last peasant uprising in europe so based
  pilled and redbased
  the fact that the government actually worked under him is a testament to his statesmanship if there was a leader who united israel and palestine it would make them a great even if it fell apart after they died
  lol
  nije moguce brate
  african dictators are great statesmen because they managed to have a working ie barely functioning government after colonialism which unsurprisingly falls apart as soon as the dictator dies or runs out of money from colonial administration
  enver hoxha
why is he jealous of jordan petersons success
  is it not obvious
  seems like peterson is jealous of him why else would he argue with a robot besides zizek is better dressed
upon further reflection wipes nose i should have gone for the pshoodo intellschhual demographic schniff and exhploited the shelf help philosphy
  essentially
  the chad zizek jealous of some reactionary pseud whose only following is a cult of 1419 year old incels with dirty rooms
  its the key to success what fraud like peterson is doing is providing meaningless alternative to disenfranchisedthat alternative of course still being palatable to neoliberal order basically changing nothing and doing nothing new
  the key to happiness in life is to accept that capitalism is human nature and embrace your life as a wage slave dont get politically involved its meaningless until you have perfected yourself
  capitalism is human nature  no its not neither is communism or any ideology those are all social constructs capitalism as we know it appeared in early modern period evolved in 19th and 20th century and this modern cancerous version appeared in late 20th century and established itself as a global system with the fall of ussr   i suspect youre sarcastic just saying
  is being productive and functional first and foremost essential to the neoliberal order
  being productive and functional only insofar as you are those things in a capitalist context is its not like jp encourages you to read widely and study opposing viewpoints or anything like that everything that constitutes productivity and functionality for jp reinforce neoliberalism
  read widely and study opposing viewpoints  this is neither a function of the productivity nor of the functionallity of a person
  if the only things that are productive or functional are labouring to enrich the capitalist class then yeah productivity and functionality are essentially neoliberal
  if peterson is successful in preventing groupthink among conservative minded people it will but an end to the current escalation of the hegelian dialectic    essentially peterson undermines zizecs sneaky accelerationist tricks
  
  being a good consumer and not rocking the boat is whats essential everything else is a bonus   theres no relevant alternative to it peterson various populists including trump altright and all that shit thats virtually nothing just a charade russia chinathey are just worse versions of it   we live in an apolitical and apathetic agepolitics are fake interest is fake culture is fake   communism/marxism was an alternative in its time so was fascism in a way now we have nothing just cosmetics the order prevailed but its now in a terminal decline however technology of the future has a dreadful potential     i dont think that shit that peterson proposes is bad fixing yourself is fine being more disciplined is fine but peterson is fucking nothing beyond that hes just a hodgepodge of bygone ideologies
  pretty sure the little lebowski won that movie so the bums won lmao
  i dont think he even back his rug desu
  politics are fake interest is fake culture is fake  postmodernism detected
      reeeee pseudo intellectual    why do /lit/ pseuds get so butthurt at the mention of petersons name
  t pic related  while you learned what postmodernism actually means i studied the blade
  because he literally knows nothing about anything except for jungian psychology which is itself shit compared to chad freudian psychology
  its now in a terminal decline  and what makes you think that child  stop waiting for a day that wont come this state of things is productive and lucrative for all of those with the potential to change it expecting things to be different in the future is nothing but a childs wish for power     accept that change is impossible and try to live to content otherwise frustration is inevitable
  is he that guy was so dismissive towards jbp i wish he took him more seriously typical haughty professor
  t fukuyama
    i like whenever you get so desperate that you unironically post that video where he had serious disgestive issues as somehow being proof that hes wrong
  i cant imagine what level of faux leftism you have to be on to consider the goofy voiced canadian who cries about helping people as a reactionary that really blows my mind
  he constantly talks about stuff he doesnt know case in point postmodern neomarxism
  dan harmon
  i never read baudrillard but i guess now after a cursory skimming of his views thats it     im not butthurt im kinda sad you arent using your dissatisfaction to actually do something instead of going through the motions and indulging in escapism craving the safety of bygone times of which you have a simplistic and naive vision peterson is one big nothing hes a snakeoil salesman in the sense of social critique its like having cancer so you take pain medication for it     this state of things is productive and lucrative for all of those with the potential to change it  youre partly right   expecting things to be different in the future is nothing but a childs wish for power   thats a weird accusation im merely pointing out what i see as you can see im not saying what should be done i dont have any idea  accept that change is impossible and try to live to content  i cant technology doesnt let me look at china and the social credit system its terrifying its like feudal period you have a warrior class that has a distinct advantage which allows them to perpetuate their system however awful it isbut even worse methods of control are being perfected in all aspects   frustration is inevitable  frustration is good and nothing is actually impossible they are good at avoiding mistakes but they arent that good to avoid making any
  yeah you say this same line every time and conveniently never actually even attempt to explain why hes wrong or you try to and end up just embarrassing yourself
  how is he not reactionary he essentially accepts the idealized capitalist order as perfect
  because there is no such thing as postmodern neomarxism
  im not butthurt   youre angry at people because the self help book they like is written by a guy who doesnt like the edgy failed ideology youve made your thing in place of developing a personality anon youre very obviously butthurt and probably have some unresolved daddy issues
  accept that change is impossible and try to live to content  isnt it ironic that in the domains of science sniff we know think tugs shirt that everything is possible while on the other hand sniff in politics everything is impossible you must just accept the current order it can never change and sho on and sho on
  fukuyama was satisfied with the state of affairs and saw this order of things as a chance for human progress   truth is human progress isnt useful to the market the neoliberal order is perfectly comfortable in keeping things as they are and there is no possible mechanism to challenge it if the only expense in all this is our humanity so be it its a great profit margin
  no and im not sure how you came to conclude i have some strong opinion about peterson personally   edgy failed ideology   what ideology is that buddy
  have some unresolved daddy issues  t jung
  yes there is
  pretending you have no strong opinion on peterson when you just went on some spastic tirade about him  lol youre sad
  the whole ideology of marxism is built around being jealous of whos doing better than you
  all modern far leftist have weird daddy issues
  okay     there is no possible political mechanism there are other mechanisms
  i cant  frustration is good  your attitude will only lead to disappointment anon dont expect the world to change just because you feel its wrong   a brick house doesnt fall with whispers
  im not the only one though
  isnt it ironic that in the domains of science sniff we know think tugs shirt that everything is possible  who told you that and i highly doubt zizek would say such a thing hes not a fool
  jealous of a glorified selfhelp author    suuuure
  there are other mechanisms  as in    well mr lennon no one is alone in a world of 7 billion people   it doesnt change the fact that people like the way things are and that you have no means to change that
  
  hes not a fool  his whole appeal is being an entertaining bafoon no matter how much he tries to claim otherwise his ideology is irrelevant and literally has no chance of ever being anything again
  critical theory is pretty popular in academia
  should start at 550
  hes not really a critical theorist though and hate pc culture hes basically just some nostalgic old slav whos blackpilled while gullible kids take his words about the good old days as gospel
  in what way is he not a critical theorist he is a communist who is interested in the culture capitalism creates and how that influences the possibility of revolution in our society and his position on those things is derived from the frankfurt school
  he was born in the soviet sphere of influence and operates from that marxist view while critical theory is a rejection of soviet styled marxism that instead focuses on race obsessed oppressed
  while the general attitude is tina at the same time the social sciences as a whole are in total disarray from multiple scandals were beyond fucked there is no alternative beyond human extinction
  critical theory still upholds the class struggle as the primary struggle
  not him but zizek did start off as a postfrankfurt school kind of theorist the sublime object of ideology was obviously influenced by critical theory sometime however he went against the then current and ended up being somebody who could fit right in among the german idealists in the 19th century except he calls it materialism kek
    how is he not reactionary he essentially accepts the idealized capitalist order as perfect  1 he does not think capitalism is perfect  2 capitalism is not reactionary it is centrist moderate liberalism and the fact that you think it is reactionary reveals you to be a massive communist shill
actual thinker gets rekt by a selfhelp guru
  taking some junglet seriously  no
  le centre meme
  centrism is reactionary
  are you really sad for the death of the false gods of ideologies if your life consists of nothingness try actual religion
because zizek enjoys being as obtuse as possible with no real substance something that true pseuds eat up like candy because they enjoy preforming the mental gymnastics necessary to understand his bullshit    meanwhile peterson is a down to earth very straightforward man who offers a logical but easy to comprehend answer to actual questions and problems that plague people today leftie pseuds are jealous of petersons rise because in a matter of a few years hes overshadowed the coke sniffing idiot theyve all been worshiping
/his/lets would rather listen to a literal tankie than kermit man who tells you to clean your room  hmminteresting
  zizek  tankie
  zizek likes being obtuse and bullshitting about irrelevant things because its amusing    petersen likes to pretend hes smart when hes just give common sense advice but in an authoritarian matter to people who lack common sense
  preventing groupthink is just forming another cult of personality
  is he does anyone even treat peterson seriously
  petersen likes to pretend hes smart when hes just give common sense advice but in an authoritarian matter to people who lack common sense  absolutely true he throws around fancy words he barely understands sometimes to make his advice seem more intellectual than it is
  have you seen zizek audiences
  because hes a libtard socialist newsflash libtards socialism does not work see venezuela and sweden for example
  youtube comment/10
  pure ideology
lacanian jewish pseudoscience vs freudianjungian jewish pseudoscience the thread  youre all brainlet redditors kys yourselves my dudes
  we all know deleuzian psychoanalysis is better than lacan or freud
being a jordan peepeerson fan  lmao
  i think its this same guy who is a massive fan who makes threads about his constantly and then gets super assblasted if you make fun of daddy peterson
  deleuze is a cryptofascist like foucault
  pretty sure youve got that backwards
  the problem is one of them tries really hard to get taken seriously and is taken seriously
i bet slavoj has a really messy room
le unkempt postmo nonsense mumbling leftie vs le poppsy clean up your room altrightie  truly we live in exciting times full of rich intellectual debate
slavoj is the most disgusting person i can possibly think of both on a mental and physical level how can one man manage to be so fat and so gaunt at the same time it boggles the mind
  no  deleuzian philosophy is incapable of thinking in one in a sufficient reasonable manner because it goes against its own principle  therefore what you have is the spontaneous multiple which can only be equated to some degree  ie fascism
  gaunt  what does this even mean in this context
arent they both famous and rich af
  cause petersons a fucking charlatan
you reckon petersons going to fall out of fashion now netflix is bringing back evangelion to introduce to a new generation of dissatisfied pretentious teenagers
  what is peterson pretending to be that he is not
why does peterson sound like he is about to cry all the time
  intelligent
  jealous of a shittier epictetus pandering to the unread  is he
  jordan peterson joined the socialist party in his teens he clearly doesnt think that capitalism is perfect all he says is that a society without hierarchies that enforces equality of outcome that commies want is literally impossible because you cant twist and bend humans anyways you like he backs this up of course with lobsters and evolutionary psychology
  communists literally dont support equality of outcome they support you freely determining your outcome
  they never debate
  equality of outcome  to each according to bla bla bla
  hes definitely reactionary
  jordan b peterson looks a lot more happy to me
  the social sciences  always been a joke
  žižek worked his whole life and you actually have to look him up to know who he is i live in the same country as him and i only recently found out about the fat fuck  peterson passed him in 2 years and is known worldwide
    popularityintelligence
  didnt say anything about intelligence  the question was why zizek is butthurt about jordan
  he is a near perfect example of a reactionary
  zizek makes a living doing what he loves to do shitposting hes like an oldfag intelligent but would rather waste time on /b/ meming and occasionally being clever than do anything society would see as productive petersen has a real job because cleaning your fucking room is like socially productive and will make the world a better place without harming anyone so like stop shitposting and clean your room also give me your money
  he cant even get jungian psychoanalysis right lmao
  go wash your dick before posting in here please
  le jooz  you know where to go back
  how so
  stop defying common sense is pretty traditional reactionary because common sense is usually mostly just social norms they then advocate for the old common sense before it was all messed up its just not extreme larp cringe reactionary
    peterson has to cater to his uneducated flatearther fanbase    zizek does whatever he wants
  meanwhile peterson is a down to earth very straightforward man who offers a logical but easy to comprehend answer to actual questions and problems that plague people today  fuck off peterson suffers from magical thinking everyone he attempts to explain his values or goals hes kierkegaard for people terrified of critiquing their own values or reading
okay so i only recently started paying attention to this whole peterson fad but why in gods name are all his followers such tremendous fags
  i basically came to terms a few years ago that fanbases and followers can absolutely ruin right about anything in terms of petersons followers theyre about the same as radical atheists
  everyone i dislike is a fascist    a university students guide to political discourse
  believing in common sense makes you a reactionary    this is your brain on socialism
  zizek is like shittier version of diogenes
anyone else frustrated by how complicated certain debates seem  how can a layman have a reliable and informed opinion when even experts disagree on some topics like for example british responsibility for various indian famines  how can we be sure scholarly consensus on topics like evolution or the existence of a historical jesus is reliable when there are critics writing such long complicated and vociferous critiques  how can i know anything when reading long articles on such things just leaves me confused  am i just incapable of ignoring irrational cranks because of ocd
  if these issues were certain there wouldnt be a debate in the first place dont freak out because of barriers to knowledge and ambiguity work with what you have and learn more before forming an opinion
  /his/ is the most reliable and informed source of information for past and contemporary issues
  is anything at all certain debates seem to solve nothing because people can always just use language gimmicks to ignore what the other side has said and proclaim oneself victorious conclusions in social science are based on hopeless competing studies based on different complicate statistical tricks
hawkish shit fuck him and the entire bush dynasty shame he didnt die earlier
i dunno he didnt really do much of anything kind of a lame duck
  like father like son
  desert storm wasnt 100 necessary but our motives were decent enough all objectives were achieved quickly both civilian and military casualties were incredibly low considering over a million soldiers were involved on both sides   that out of the way bush was ill equipped to swing politics one way or another but was composed enough to serve as a by the book statesmen he was merely ok and inoffensive especially being bookended by reagan and clinton
    go listen to bill hicks on ghwb fuck this piece of shit you young fucks dont understand how him and his fucking republican cronys were genocidal fuckwits murdering everyone in south america the middle east and southeast asia so american corporations could set up shop
  go listen to bill hicks
  he was the last semidecent president he peacefully ended the cold war and he should get credit for that     the gulf war wasnt really his fault it was the affirmative action hire woman april glaspie that accidentally gave saddam a green light to invade kuwait
    hw was much better than w in every respect      he peacefully ended the cold war
  go listen to bill hicks
he seems quaint in hindsight but he was still shit perhaps less damaging than bush ii but a spook all around and i aint even /leftypol/     he further enabled christian evangelicals and their insane policy influence in the us defending kuwait acceptable and it certainly was a turning point in middleeastern politics iraniraq wouldve probably reignited within a couple years had desert storm not occurred     the end of the cold war would have happened regardless his role is often overstated it was just a momentous occasion in general the recession wouldve happened regardless dukakis wouldnt have made much of a difference on those fronts bush won thanks to successful smear campaigns and dukakis simply wasnt as mediasavvy although i think dukakis wouldve been a lame duck president regardless in terms of the primaries he was unapologetically part of a masshole democratic clique ironically a certain yale fratboy candidate criticized him for this
    right place right time he didnt really do anything special about it that another president couldnt have
    ttoo rude for my ffroggy tastes
    without western passivity and a total lack of hostility in the us led by hw russia could have easily resorted to war to keep the ussr together had they felt threatened at all they could have easily put that military to use to crush the national uprisings
  he was a loud douche that didnt tell jokes and like cobain his early death grossly inflated his reputation   why do you require a comedian to make your point for you
  republican bad    republican bad    republican bad 
  50 years from now hell be remembered as little more than a reagan holdover
  he was far more competent than reagan though no irancontra he didnt get a bunch of marines killed in lebanon and he even prosecuted and jailed bankers after the sl crisis something that no president has done since
  a pederast
  he even prosecuted and jailed bankers after the sl crisis something that no president has done since  story on this
  hundreds of wallstreet bankers went to jail after the sl crisis because they committed obvious securities fraud and hws justice department actively pursued criminal cases against them after the dotcom bubble and the subprime crisis no one in any big wall street bank went to jail or were even prosecuted by the justice department you can say a lot of bad things about hw but at least he didnt give trillions of dollars to bail out the banks like obama or w and then refuse to prosecute them on criminal charges
  democrat bad  democrat bad  democrat bad
  what im finding suggests that hw gave at least over 100 billion to failing banks and while he was vp he apparently had a son who was directly involved in an investment scheme collapse who was bailed out by the reps still in power where are you finding that hundreds of bankers went to jail im sure a few shady investment brokers did but so did madoff and kenneth lay
warhawk who nepotized his halfretarded son into office to continue warhawkery  glad he is finally burning in hell
  normal /pol/ thinks this guy is a spook
      like you were going to read book recommendations you faggot plebs
  peacefully ended the cold war  passed the clean air act of 1990  built an amazing coalition and waged a near perfect war to liberate kuwait   laid the foundation for a balanced budget    best president of my lifetime i consider obama the 2nd best
    like most politicians his legacy is mixed he was patriotic as an individual but theres a reason he lost reelection also things like the willie horton ad paved the way for guys like trump
  nobody cares about a balanced budget
  i was looking at his footage and its actually surreal to seem someone so calm and at ease walking around giants of the time trump makes you feel scared for what clumsy thing hes going to do in a way obama was also sorta scary because you werent sure if he was going to bow to a oil lord    bush and clinton were why the 90s were awesome solid leadership that showed american power responsibly
  last competent us president
  im not that anon but bill hicks is a comedian doesnt matter if he didnt follow the typical punchline format hes not on my top 10 but nothing wrong with him at all deal with it
no new taxes  raises taxes  what did he mean by this
  russia did try to resort to war yeltsin and co managed to convince coup leaders not to  had they felt threatened at all they could have easily put that military to use to crush the national uprisings  its like you know nothing about history    haytch dubya didnt contribute specifically anything to the collapse of the ussr that another president wouldnt have ussr crumbled of its own accord
  no new taxes  i wont do what the other guy does in general  raises taxes  does what the other guy does in general    works on earthlings every time
  if you watch a hicks special and dont laugh you must genuinely be autistic he wasnt a master of wit or punchlines like idk jimmy carr but he was a funny observational comic and a master of exaggerations and ironies
  political rants are not jokes anon
  he orchestrated iran contra and got away with it and pardoned those who should have spent the rest of their lives in prison
  pull your head out of your ass teenage edgelord
  post a comedian you think is funny
if nothing else you cant deny that he was the most qualified of any president to lead foreign policy he handled the end of the cold war pretty well
  he did more for the united states than the current president thats good enough for his legacy
  rank him 23
  s   the only thing saddam did wrong was lose
  who do you put in last place    spoilerthe only correct answer is pierce
  andrew johnson pierce is 3rd to last in my opinion
    drumpf
  teenage edgelord  but thats who political rants or jokes appeal to
  bush supported barre and hussein
country would be better off had he won in 1992  fuck ross perot
lol i eagerly await the paid shills over at reddit to start rewriting his history like they did with his son
  founding father of international jihad based and kikepilled
  that would be eisenhower
  better than a lame duck
  his work in the cia as a spook wasnt particularly partisan
hes not a bad person but just because war with iraq is justified doesnt mean that its a good idea the idea that nations are bound to principles is a dangerous idea he should have been bound to prudence but maybe his advisers could not foresee the mess that would come from desert storm
  how many millions did ike gift to bin laden
  blind faggot theyre already doing it in this thread
  what is highway of death  murica
  what is highway of death  talk shit get hit is what its called saddam was free to unconditionally surrender at any time
  and according to geneva convention attacking an out of combat withdrawing force is a war crime but hey nevermind
  no its not your thinking of attacking surrendered forces thats against the geneva convention at the point that the highway of death occurred iraq had not surrendered yet thus they were shooting at active albeit retreating enemies in war its not a good idea to let your enemy retreat and regroup therefore killing retreating enemies is a means to an end
he made the right move by repelling sadam but the wrong move with the oil embargo
  he will be remembered as the guy who lost to the rapist
  no he lost to perot
in the kitchen making coffee  hear dad obsessively watches tyt and secular talk shout from his room another war criminal dead
  tyt  ew
  does he still post on democracynow as well
  genociding kurds is good  invading iran and killing thousands of innocents is good  blatantly invading kuwait for its resources is good
    no    also he refused to vote for hillary in the general election and wrote in bernie sanders
  honestly that makes me respect him a bit more
  immigration act of 1990 gulf war and setting in motion and putting all but the bow on nafta should be enough to rank him among the shittiest weve ever had thats the say nothing of him being an archglownigger also the invasion of panama which had the bonus of cleaning up a loose end from his time as the archglownigger if bush was good at any one thing it was getting us into pointless onesided conflicts so he could boost his pr    also say what you will about trumps brashness or obama being a pussy neither of them did anything as embarassing as puking on another head of state
  reagan  reagan was a doddering old empty suit and bush was running the show
  he was the last semidecent president  thatd be clinton
  he fucked little boys
  the years of clintons presidency were good but clinton himself had little to do with it thanks based gingrich for bending that arkansas bitch over real nice
  also say what you will about trumps brashness or obama being a pussy  obama and bush senior are actually respected statesmen trump is actually seen as a sad joke by the entire world the only people who actually like him are israelis who got his dumbass to do their bidding and the russians who love the fact that the us elected a dimwit who spends more time ranting at fucking canada over aluminum than he does talking about the current ukraine situation
  genocidal fuckwits murdering everyone in south america  fucking based  after living in south america for 18 years i can safely say this continent deserves to get fucked by first worlders separating from spain was a mistake
  canada hurts us by protecting their farmers from competition with our own how does ukraine matter to us
  he was such a legend that he recognized the need to raise taxes despite knowing it would destroy his personal rep  god we dont deserve such statesmen
  attacking an out of combat withdrawing force is a war crime  was that written by reddit idealists who think pursuing the still armed and intact enemy is le evil
  theyre just regurgitating a chomsky talking point
  canada hurts us by protecting their farmers from competition with our own  a minor issue overall not one that warrants making all of canada despise you and despise the usa and its people even more you are hurting relations with a close ally over literal spilled milk  how does ukraine matter to us  showing commitment to those who you promised to backup failure to do so ruins american reputation and trust in the us to serve as an ally thereby diminishing american softpower and international standing     christ thank fuck the state department doesnt employ people here
  ukraine is a neonazi state that praises stepan bandera
  heh humor is for small brained sheep not true gentlesirs like me  tips fedora and does heckin epc back flip away
  the most successful coke lord of all time probably a homosexual pedophile his friends planned the jfk assassination extremely submissive to israel bought his sons presidency and helped him rig the election against gore friends plotted 9/11 completely illegitimate invasion of iraq after he and friends put saddam in power in the first place one of the most evil people to have ever lived smiled the moment i heard he died just like with rockefeller kissinger is next i will probably have a beer and buy someone else a drink as well when he goes
  a patrice oneal fan thinks bill hicks is unfunny  my point proven and not even surprised
   obama  2nd best
  another disciple of comrade jimmy arm the poor dore excellent  
  the us does the exact same thing with its farmers kiddo canadian labour standards and everyday expenses are higher its a big country with distant supply chains hence a long tradition of pooled resources and in last few decades subsidies very little american dairy is imported into canada anyway as canadian domestic supply is too high as it is    canada has lost the most from nafta good production jobs with high standards and reasonable pay have been outsourced where canadian firms are bought out by american firms who promptly close the canadian production and ship any assets and factory parts to the us these then go to niggertier states with virtually nonexistent labour codes like tennessee or texas that also rely on illegal mexican black market workers    americans love to bitch and moan about their precious feelings but they are the real ebil goons in this story

  wrong  trump did approve the sale of lethal weapons to ukraine in december 2017    on the annexation of crimea sarah huckabee sanders stated we do not recognize russias attempt to annex crimea we agree to disagree with russia on that front and our crimea sanctions against russia will remain in place until russia returns the peninsula to the ukraine    trump has ordered missiles to be fired at syrian military sites after president assad was accused of using chemical weapons on his own people which have a strategic alliance with russia in response putin accused the us of making the already catastrophic humanitarian situation in syria even worse and bringing suffering to civilians with its strikes    in august 2017 trump signed into law caatsa the countering americas adversaries through sanctions act which imposed sanctions on iran north korea and russia in the words of the geopolitical intelligence platform stratfor caatsa demonstrates that the united states is more strident than ever in pushing other countries to reduce their defense and energy ties with russia    in march following the poisoning presumably by the russian government of former kgb agent sergei skripal and his daughter trump expelled 60 russian diplomats    in april trump imposed more sanctions on russia following the indictments of 13 russians for malicious cyber activities earlier in march russias stock market dropped 11 on the news shares of the russian aluminum giant rusal which is the worlds second largest aluminium company tanked 40 on the news
  yeah all of this shit was pushed by congress not trump who dragged his feet for months on signing them   trump signed into law caatsa  president donald trump signed it into law while issuing two statements simultaneously that he believed the legislation was seriously flawed
  pushing sanctions through executive orders and expelling diplomats was a push by congress
  pushing sanctions through executive orders  which    and expelling diplomats   yes you have to do that theres countless historical examples of a formal political action taken while the real intentions of either side remained the same   all of this is granular to the fact trump has a long history of association with russia the rumors of which began circulating in the msm well before he secured the gop nomination his only response has been to deny everything i have zero ties  which his own lawyers said wasnt strictly true   
  which  imposing sanctions one ordering missile strikes one    theres countless historical examples of a formal political action taken while the real intentions of either side remained the same  which
  well he murdered 3000 civilians in panama in order to destroy evidence of his drugrunning ties during the irancontra years so he will probably be regarded as a war criminal and a moral monster
  imposing sanctions one  which ones   ordering missile strikes   every president for the past 50 years had green lighted bombs dropped in the middle east   which  molotovribbentrop pact for starters
  do i have to show you my post again it is right there for you to see    a nonaggression pact that neither side was going to respect is the same as putting sanctions on a nation people claim your are soft on     would you rather a reset plan like in 2009 or not acknowledging ukraine at all to be considered tough on russia
  so he will probably be regarded as a war criminal and a moral monster    dam if only every us president who dies seems to become secular saints almost that we must regard as gods
  helped end the cold war and signed treaties that reduced the worlds nuclear arsenal    war hawk    he was one of the sanest world leaders in history when you look at the numbers who died on the red side of the iron curtain
  do i have to show you my post again it is right there for you to see  and none of them are indicative that trump has a consistent policy on russia he is ultimately beholden to congress and his administration so one definitive amidst much ambiguity doesnt add up to much unless you demonstrate trumps sincerity   a nonaggression pact that neither side was going to respect is the same as putting sanctions on a nation people claim your are soft on   yes in that theyre in contradiction of peoples true intentions this isnt black and white its perfectly possible that putin is willing to take sanctions on the chin while getting away with other shit while a weak prez is in office   all the shit trump talks about being a tough guy and a patriot he the word of 3 of our own intelligence agencies all corroborating russia fucked with us then he completely threw them under the bus at helsinki he elected to be a punk fence sitting bitch
  why didnt he veto if he was against the bills and acts    while a weak prez is in office  he had that with the obama administration considering the lack of action or condemnation when he invaded ukraine or the reset plans failure or allowing russia to be more interventionist after axing missile plans in poland and the czech republic and when romney talked about russia being a threat in 2012 replied that it wasnt the 1980s    its perfectly possible  so speculations    fence sitting bitch  so what obama was    trump has been tougher on russia than obama and bush were combined and you can thank the congress for that or not
  why didnt he veto if he was against the bills and acts  because the us isnt an autocracy plenty of his gop congress want the sanctions ignoring them is putting the only reliable voting base he has at riskagain this is black and white   he had that with the obama administration  a conflicted and inexperience idealist and a corrupt inexperienced megalomaniac are weak in different ways trump is a bully not in that he says mean things but in that he can only domineer over people he thinks are beneath him and crumbles in confrontation with people who wont take any of his shit   furthermore hes delusional in the same way as a child who achieves something then thinks its the bestest ever no one else could have do it better than him thus why he claimed his presidency did more than any other in our history to the un and they laughed in his face   he lives in a shallow stupid world and serious players like putin are born to toy with crackpots like him not to mention the russian elite and gangsters trump has become acquainted with over the years
  its the same as with the antifascist hero jeb bush its because hes funny
  from what ive seen its regular /pol/ that loves dore because hes a leftist that doesnt do much virtuesignalling/identity politics stuff and he attacks the endless msm muh russia stories
  red pilled and based
  so what obama was  is obama president does his fence sitting cancel out trumps you are dumb   trump has been tougher on russia  bush started a whole war on iraq had wmds 3 intelligence agencies conclude russian interfered in our elections and trumps modus operandi is to discredit and downplay it all

never trust an englishman the english have been enemies of all of mankind including other englishmen since their wretched inception  no ideologies or systems work but some fail better than others  major historical figures usually propped up as either perfect heroes to be revered or evil doers to be despised were actually just people and often have really surprising flaws or positive traits  africans arent actually equal to white europeans intellectually culturally evolutionarily or really in any form and not only desegregation but the emancipation of slavery were net negatives for the world both white and black  japanese imperialism is actually superior to european imperialism and often times justified and the japanese were superior to several european countries in almost every regard  the irish have contributed more to humanity than the english  american exceptionalism is very real

first enslaved by egyptians  then enslaved by each other  finally enslaved by whites  when granted freedom they do incredibly poorly with almost unbelievable numbers for poverty and violent crime  were given the richest and most prosperous island of the caribbean with architecture already installed but still managed to fuck it up to the point they need bailing out by white countries twice a century  it seems to me like a selective breeding sorta thing like grey hounds are meant to run niggers are meant to be in chains
  i cant tell if this is bait or if youre just retarded   read a fucking book
  youre not providing any counter arguments just ad hominems  are you by any chance black
  maybe now that slavery has been made obsolete in a few hundred years they will revert back to a more natural human state baring any civilization collapse of course this process will be accelerated by racemixing at least in the west i wonder if other races also have unique attributes like the races in oblivion/skyrim in that case multiethnic countries could have a big advantage if they were aware of these traits and used them properly
you are retarded     t ghanaian
  im op and i have adopted relatives who are from ghana  now im not saying the brutalities of slavery should have remained but blacks perform best when theyre told what to do and dont have the burden of thought my relatives adore working for others for example  without direction blacks simply either laze about or commit violent crime heck one of my relatives has shown a propensity for unprompted violence beating his adoptive father to a pulp literally just to show he was stronger    banning slavery wholesale has been a disservice to africanamericans as they have nothing to do and cannot compete with whites in society  we should have just created slave rights laws to let the negro live as he was created to without the unnecessary cruelty of historic slavery
  no op could be onto something if african countries voluntarily gave replaced their leadership with one dominated by a more intelligent race the whole country could benefit if the slavery system of old was refined to be more streamlined and fair it could help a society tremendously so what if you divided a society into a caste system like termites have you breed certain races for certain traits like the africans would be slaves more like involuntary workers who perform manual labor and receive a weekly profit from their labor that they could spend on upgrades like a nicer room or a potted plant if they saved up
  african   countries  brainlet detected
    ebin shitposts
  im not saying that there isnt instability due the negros lack of guidance in the region im saying that hypothetically if the africans gave up their freedom and were put to productive tasks they would be happier its like school children if they arent told what to do they suffer from it of course children shouldnt be beaten the system of slavery practiced by the europeans was bound to fail because of its brutality im advocating a gentler more humanistic approach where negros are given a meaning as opposed to the poverty and suffering many of them are experiencing now i would even be open to giving especially talented and gifted negro individuals the freedom to pursue their interests under guided supervision of course
  egyptians  so were talking bcs here  each other  something that happened to large swathes of virtually every population from the invention of agriculture to the early modern era  finally by whites  with a gap of at least two thousand years between them and egyptians  it seems to me like a selective breeding sorta thing   most americans black slaves were west african and only half of them were sub saharan youre talking multiple different african groups here that eventually intermixed not some single homogeneous ancestral population   but lets elaborate on this point what is a selective breeding sorta thing can you explain what that actually means in biological terms what alleles increases in frequency that supposedly make them ideal slaves what frequencies are these found in what specific african populations and how to they statistically compare to frequencies in other ethnic populations also if the stereotype of black people being naturally unruly and criminal is true as you imply how does that make them ideal slaves  wouldnt they be submissive instead why did they demand civil rights if theyre such perfect slaves in the first place    seems pretty transparently like youre trying to justify slavery with a veneer of scientific post hoc rationalization rather than actually explaining anything and you left out the middle eastern slavery which would have helped your point implying youre historically illiterate of course that trade also enslaved whites
      many carribiean slaves and ethnic groups of africans were noted by european slavers as being unruly and prone to rebellion im on mobile so not gonna look it up but check out the coromantines from jamaica and other akan slaves btw sub saharan africans arent one race because they have dark skin they are multiple races brianlet
  10000 years ago post younger dryus impact even the sahara turned into a desert the cosmos cucked egyptians you fucking faggot not that shit fuck off
  many carribiean slaves and ethnic groups of africans were noted by european slavers as being unruly and prone to rebellion  they were treated with violence so they retaliated thats why the system im proposing is mostly carrot with punishment coming into play only if they are still unruly  btw sub saharan africans arent one race because they have dark skin they are multiple races brianlet  of course there are but they share enough traits that they can be lumped into one group for easier categorization except for a few anomalys like he ethiopians and bush people
yes
  egyptian slaves were probably ethiopian stock not west african negroid stock
  same shit
  but theyll have a massive disadvantage if they choose to make it illegal to acknowledge them as they do now
  this isnt a question rhodesia proved the principle beyond doubt blacks flourished under the guidance of the white minority while the country was racist and unfair but the moment they got put in charge of everything they literally fucked everything up they even fucked up their most recent election
  well have you ever interacted with the average african theyre just plain dumb not much else to say having a slave populace which isnt very good at plotting to overthrow you is a good thing
  
  im of eritrean descent and seeing constant posts like these i honestly cant tell if its bait or legit mental dullards if its the former its well crafted and if the latter i truly weep for this site
  its more a matter of him getting btfo so many times hes blatantly shitposting at this point out of frustration
  we should have just created slave rights laws to let the negro live as he was created to without the unnecessary cruelty of historic slavery  theyre called jobs
  he is lashing out pardon the phrase the reason is primarily the utter general failure of blacks everywhere they find themselves and secondarily and probably most importantly the practically zero amount of self insight negroes seem to have or be allowed to express the amount of violence and thuggery and anti social behavior from blacks is frightening and knowing that part of your salary is used to care and pay for these people is angering  they go on about muh slavery but that is bullshit they are as violent and ill performing anywhere they go even in my country where we took no slaves they act like shit and feel entitled to gibs they do not deserve
i wish blacks were still slaves so that i could buy a qt black gf
  what books do you mean are theories of the beyoncé plot that drives flying pyramids
  they are not docile thus not born to be slaves
  did weeaboos evolve to be cucked out of existence  make retarded comments on the internet all day  opinionated and completely unread  cringy avatarfagging  will never ever get a gf  despised by everyone  will always disappoint their fathers
  oh yeah  what are you ghana do about it
did whites evolve for slavery  first enslaved by each other  then enslaved by the arabs  finally eternally enslaved by jews  when granted freedom they plunge into degeneracy obsess over chink cartoons  literally unable to breed will definately be extinct within 100 yeas  it seems to me like a selective breeding sorta thing like grey hounds are meant to run whites are meant to be in chains
  kwasi is that you
lol look at all of the steamed negroids itt
  youre not providing any counter arguments just ad hominems  are you by any chance white

why did the english and scottish fight for hundred of years when they unified without firing a shot
  england and scotland is a based union  not even a bong but for some reason i love the uk and 17th/18th century britain
  they were both protestant at a time when there was a legitimate fear of catholics taking the english throne
after a certain point england started to see a political union as an acceptable way of bringing scotland to heel to that end they launched the early modern equivalent of an agitprop campaign where they tried to change both english and scottish attitudes into viewing a prospective union with positivity which worked to some extent on the english side but not really on the scottish side    i wrote this a few years ago it was mostly deals with linguistics but still shows the type of thinking that was common at the time    there were attempts even in the early 16th century to emphasise the linguistic similarities between the languages of scotland and england usually with a political motive edward seymour protector somerset wrote in 1548 that of all nacions in the worlde that nacion onely beside england speaketh the same language and as you and we bee annexed and ioyned in one islande so no people so like in maner forme language and all conditions as we are     seymour was a general during the rough wooing the mid 16th century period of war between england and scotland with the objective of achieving a personal union between the two countries seymour himself personally ordered the burning of edinburgh seymours views on the matter are overwhelmingly biased and the same is true of most of the cases made for the similarities of english and scots in this period nicholas bodrugan writing in the same year similarly advocated english hegemony and used language as a component of his justification patten also in the same year calls upon his countrymen of the north who according to him shared both language and manners with england with one or two exceptions this newfound affection was not returned and was viewed with intense suspicion by most scottish contemporaries
  also  on a similar note in 1585 there was a court case in which a scottish defendant in an english court argued for the customary privilege of having half of the jury composed of people who spoke his own language this request was denied as it was ruled that scotsmen were not considered foreigners in england and scots was not considered a different language from english
  despite their motivations i dont think their statements are exactly false  northern england and southern scotland have been blurringly close for a long time  scots and english were closely related though scots being a language not separate from english is bunk its been only what 2300 years since scots basically became an dialect
  i think thats partly why there wasnt more upset over the union than there wouldve been during the 1540s the upper echelons of scottish society were anglicising themselves pretty quickly
i fucking hate these threads we never should have fucking bothered with ireland so many problems immediately avoided with basically 0 drawbacks if we never went near that bog and just stayed buddies with the scots i fucking hate ireland
  you could argue that if the english never got involved in ireland then scotland mightve eclipsed england as the regional power if edward bruce became high king and created a union between scotland and ireland the new gaelic kingdom wouldve probably whittled and chipped away at the north of england for some time
  scotlands edinburgh is in the germanic scots speaking lowlands and edward bruce was not a gael bruce were french
  daww we hate you too pal and we wish youd left us alone just as much
  edward bruce was not a gael   he literally wrote a letter to the pope talking about how his ancestors came from ireland and how scotland and ireland should be regarded as the same country because they were basically identical
  bruce were french  would genuinely love to know where this meme started
was womans suffrage one of historys mistakes what are some good arguments against womens suffrage

    whenever someone draws a parallel between imperial germany and nazi germany he automatically admits to his audience he has no clue just how horrific the latter actually was
  in your gut you know hes nuts
  to be fair i think his only parallel is that in both cases you had an ambitious expansionist german political elite that was bent on instigating war i dont think he actually compares the two regimes in terms of things like how they treated people on the ground but its been a while since i read anything of his
  he has no clue just how horrific the latter actually was  not really i dont have to claim that blacks in namibia had it worse than jews to point out there were parallels between the genocide in namibia and the holocaust the nazis radicalized many of imperial germanys worst traditions and rejected the legacy and order of the weimar republic that attempted to move past them in a halfhearted way
  well he was a member of the nsdap before the end of the war
are human born good or bad
  depends on their genes
humans are social animals but the social system in which they live greatly amplifies or diminishes the level of social cooperation
  good or bad can only mean in relation to something according to a certain measure
  there is some evidence that political ideology is linked to certain behavioral traits that might have a genetic link
good in the sense early humans only cared about survival for them and everyone in the clan
  only rightwing people think like that this is not a dig on rightwing people there is a legitimate difference in mentality between leftwing and rightwing people possible due to genetics and this is one of the difference rightwing people are able to empathize with you as long as you are part of their tribe leftwing people can empathize with people who are not part of their tribe or indeed they dont identity with any tribe in the first place so that is how their mentality differs
obviously both
  neither both or either good and bad are relative terms that change as time passes
  leftwing people can empathize with people who are not part of their tribe or indeed they dont identity with any tribe in the first place so that is how their mentality differs  right up until they adopt their political leaning as their tribal identity and then its work camps firing squads and plastic bag choking for everyone else
  born good badness is a learned experience that results from failure to develop social links to achieve your needs to survive most human beings have social habits from the day theyre born and unless provoked into a trauma that causes a need for violence to survive most humans dont have a love of violence and conflict the military has worked hard for years to understand how to easily train people to be okay with killing specifically because this is a hard trait to get rid of in a homeostatic human being
    pretty sure crushing somones balls because you like hearing their screams is definitively bad unless youre some edgelord who needs a cult of personality to hide your faggot insecurites
  100 environment    you get remnants of evil/ignorance sometimes coagulating in pockets and perpetuating such    generally the finding hunting and removal of such is what brings about better ages of civilisation removing unjustice and bullshit like dystopic violence of governments needlessly against their own citizens etc etc    compromisations for strawmen where innocents should suffer for the guilty
born bad savages but with a predisposition to do good
  if humans are born good you will need to explain why we need laws and authority usually it goes by the civilization makes you evil kind of argument which is nonsense contrary to that humans are in fact sinful creatures by nature politics is basically a way of organizing this bunch of sinful creatures so that they dont chimp out against each other this is why politics is pretty much a matter of theology because it is grounded by selfaffirming beliefs that are supposedly inhuman in nature
  political leaning is determined by genetics  for fucking christ almightys sake what the fuck
  what is false dichotomy
they just are
all humans are born bad
  dont ever come near my kids
good
  bad think about it we need every egghead in the world to try as hard as they can to formulate a concept of the good for society evil is so mundane and primal that we dont even notice it
  good and bad arent real
  if you want to throw away the good intellectually then so be it go your way in peace but if you try to tell me that evil doesnt exist in this world ill call you a fool
  id say it has a lot less to do with genetics or political ideology and more to do with environment     people who live in densely populated environments are more likely to be empathetic toward strangers then people who live in inclusive relatively small environments this makes intuitive sense when you consider that a major part of city living is having to interact with strangers on a daily basis
  if humans are born good you will need to explain why we need laws and authority  because circumstances can influence good people into doing bad things    the average person does not gain gratification from stealing for example but when youre starving youre willing to perform amoral and taboo acts like theft out of a sense of necessity the average person does not gain satisfaction from bashing a motherfuckers skull in but if they walk in on their spouse getting donkeypunched by the mailman they may be too angry to care
  define bad and good
  left wing people think they can empathize with people outside their tribe but really they just end up in their own tribe of like minded individuals
  civilisation is based on specialisation and division of labor to ensure the specialists are fed and offcourse its governing body and protected you require rules enforced by coercion that allow effecient production for that society to take place and progress to power and be protected from other societies who seek to raid usual babarians or conquest another civilisation or insiders who have interests opposing the ruling class the governing body like for example the opposition of certain level of taxation
sociopaths have malformed brains at birth
babies will assault other babies as soon as they are physically able to do so they go straight for the eyes
  humans are good for the first second after they come out of them womb and as they grow and are socialized inevitably they become more bad this happens to everyone its impossible for someone to be 100 good 100 of the time some people are better than others but it is impossible for anyone to be 100 good all the time
  have you dealt with a 2 year old
  what a stupid nonquestion  but lobsters man
    some genes lead to a higher proclivity toward good or evil and then environment shapes the person some genes such as the case with psychopaths and others are so extreme environment has little to no effect
no one is born any way morally speaking the goodness or badness of your life has to do with the choices youve made given your circumstances
  no
literally define good and bad
  humanity is above good and evil
right wingers are all born bad
  leftwing people can empathize with people who are not part of their tribe  you have got to be kidding me
we are a convolute of evolutionary waste and that should spur you to have empathy with everyone
  most humans are not psychopaths
  were neither born evil or good were born selfish as our only existance and its purpose is to continue spreading your own genes to the natural cycle were not meant to do it for our species but our own which can be seen in penguins monkeys pigs zebras and many other species
  b l a n k   s l a t e  i unironically believe locke was right
  blocks your path      it is affected by various heritable traits so its not entirely wrong the rest of his post is shit though     rightwing conservative people value ingroup loyalty on a moral level and balance it with many other moral foundations among them care but liberal people are much more fine with betrayal and subversion so theyre mostly concerned with care and fairness

03 invasion of iraq was the biggest military victory of the 21st century prove me wrong
  terrible strategic victory left a previously stable country which had at times been amenable to the us a breeding ground for terrorism almost without a central government over the majority of iraq
  russia did an oldschool conquest and got away with it in crimea the 03 invasion of iraq was an embarrassment then and now being proud of it would be like being proud of obesity
    okay then
  i thought you hated saddam and loved bush
  what the fuck the russian military wasnt even involved the crimeans just voted for annexation
  the crimean referendum was valid
you would think the leftys would have loved taking out a fascist dictator
    the only memelords who say the invasion of iraq was a success are niggereocohens whove never picked up a weapon in their lives    every person ive ever met that actually participated in it has said that it was a massive failure
  why not
whats the history of postmodern neomarxism   when did it start and what did it split from why is it so subversive compared to other forms of marxism
  it was invented by jordan peterson in 2017 as a blanket term for anything vaguely left wing making it seem subversive because the sheer vagueness of the term allows it to be portrayed as omnipresent dozens of mutually incompatible schools of thought from stalinism to socdems terfs to trannies intersectionalists to classical marxists nihilists to relativists unionists to neolibs etc can all be handwaved as postmodernism without even knowing what postmodernism is if you vaguely support anything other than hardcore reactionary shit in any form youre pomo which means you literally eat babies  this isnt to say no leftists are postmodernists of course but the way far rghtoids use the term is entirely divorced from what the actual theory or history of the movement actually is itd be like if zizek started using the term neoconservatism to refer to every concept made by any monarchist paleocon anarcho capitalist or fascist ever and then declared neocons to be ubiquitous subversives by his own self serving definition
  its the latest buzzword for degenracy
  peterson  far right    far right  not having already gone full nazbol   not drawing from french pomo philosophy and respecting the frankfurt school  lad you needs to listen to how everyone from cantwell to heimbach to truediltom to striker talk rn
  its a buzzword that is as vague and meaningless as cultural marxism and other idiotic terms reactionary individuals spout in their attempts to sully any idea or movement that is deemed degenerate or leftist
  foucault invented it
  i didnt actually call peterson far right i called his fanboys far right and jp himself reactionary but he uses that many cryptofascist dogwhistles i literally dont give a shit whether im politically misgendering him since hes clearly intelligent enough to know what pm actually is i can only assume he uses the term in bad faith same as sowells republicuck faggotry of conflating public services and communism
  postmodern neomarxism  did you finish school
  ok so you have no problem spreading falsehoods to other people for the sake of your political team
  i can only assume he uses the term in bad faith  spend enough time in academia and youll be very surprised how far obvious misconceptions can be taken where peterson acts in bad faith is through his reluctant messiah act when he knows fully well what he is doing
  aha gotcha pomo neomarxists btfo
  cryptofascist dogwhistles  i can tell you get your education from a youtube trannie 
  im sure this seemed like a good post when you typed it out but its not is it its not even a good shitpost
  postmodern neomarxism  no such thing
   subversive  lmao those pomo philosophy professors sure are serious security risks capitalism would literally crumble if they werent held in check  meanwhile the mere mention of the black panthers made the us govt shit themselves back in the 70s
  youre a dishonest piece of shit
  what falsehood is he spreading he said he didnt know whether jp knew he was misusing it or not and he made the charitable assumption that the guy isnt a moron since he talks about this shit every day
  wheres the lie
  peterson is a classical liberal who defends jews against even being named you disingenuous sack of faeces   youre the kind of people who make fascism seem more palatable because youd hopefully be repressed although more likely youd just backflip to supporting the new ideology and spreading bullshit about its opponents
  classical liberalism is being chucked around as a sort of altright get out of jail free card its clever because you can be really fucking vague with it its what peterson does suggest something awful without being clear as to what so that you can shut the argument down when challenged fucking coward
  its literally a contradiction    postmodernists reject the possibility of reaching truth or reason for humans because what you look for as the truth or what you consider to be reason is socially determined constructed basically if you look through the history of different cultures reason they all have varying ideas of how to do it which is something foucault explores derrida further points out that in part because of this and also because people have different symbols words and ideas which differ in how they can be applied to the world it is impossible for people from different systems of symbols cultures civilizations to have productive dialogue postmodernism is a rejection of modernism the enlightenment    on the other hand neomarxists the frankfurt school are outandout modernists they extend marxs analysis of economics further into culture and politics and some of them branch out further into intersectionality they believe there is one system of analysis which can explain all of culture and history and because of this systematizing philosophy they are fundamentally at odds with postmodernists
  it started with as cognitive semiurban transrussians disregarding spinal chords in postgargantuan theory which merged with subkantians and through hegelian dialectics gradually transcendented to exgenital symbols
  you do know that the alt right hate him right  like youre smearing this nigga because hes an easy target and if you call him the far right you dont have to spar with actual nationalists absolutists nazbols and tradcaths  the layers and layers of dishonesty
  postmodernists include derrida foucault deleuze and baudrillard    frankfurt school marxists include adorno horkheimer marcuse lukacs and habermas    if you actually want to read further
   hes an easy target and if you call him the far right you dont have to spar with actual nationalists absolutists nazbols and tradcaths  ah yes edgy bloggers  a very intimidating enemy indeed
  there you go again with your thats not what i meant and what about x and your implied assumption that im clued into whatever youtube conspiracy theory youre clued into this week     im on to you coward im not going to play your game of getting into altright factionalism i dont care if youre a lobster or a pede or a proud boy youre all a part of the same rotten dark cult
  sjws invented to destroy the must oppressed group in history gamers  they would have gotten away with it too if not for peterson  now go subscribe to his patreon and head on back to 4chan
  how dare peterson use a vague expansive signifier   i dont care if youre a lobster or a pede or a proud boy youre all a part of the same rotten dark cult  how about none of them you lying cunt
  go back to watching chapo you ugly halfbreed
  implying people who use the term pomo cultural marxism seriously are capable of reading books  foucault is based though
  peterson  4chan    hes court philosopher of reddit
  oh please as if you spastic nerds dont have that feeling of superiority over thots and chads learned from an online community dictated by the school playground logic of following the most edgy fucker and parroting all of his worst jokes and most savage opinions in hindsight it seems unsurprising that an online community based around its anonymous nature would lead to severe depersonalisation and the complete surrender to these conspired assumed truths which drags every online debate into the shithouse
  you  listening to people does not make me them you puritan weirdo
  i dont think listing three examples of online altright factions who all seem to pass the other side as the problem is vague or expansive kind of seems to the point to me are you the classical liberal poster worst and most cowardly alt right faction of the lot the one who buys the conspiracy and thinks larping in wigs and refounding colonial empires is any kind of solution
  ive no idea what part of my post youre replying to but it clearly had an effect so good for me
  also lol at nagle who went on the chapo podcast you probably listened to as part of your means of developing your dismissal of what anonymous people say going nazbol        the highlow alliance bourgeois and lumpenqueer left is getting very allein       im largely apolitical i just get frustrated at the impediment your ilk make to social science
jp is expressly and emphatically a liberal accusing him of even flirting with fascism is as disingenuous as jp accusing intersectionalists of culturalmarxism     criticalintersectionalists the folks jp routinely beefs with are not marxists they reject class consciousness and embrace capitalism
  i really dont know what this podcast is man i told you im not a part of your youtube cult you have to understand there is a whole world outside of your discord group factionalism i just dont like hack frauds like peterson and i hate cults i dont see where i suddenly became nationalist or bolshevist its actually a bit absurd
  lukács wasnt part of the frankfurt school though he did influence them and many other marxists habermas is indeed associated with the frankfurt school but hes part of a younger generation of thinkers that many claim has broken from proper critical theory
  he might not be a fascist himself but hes inadvertently given a lot of fuel to the fire of fascist movements by coopting the terminology of psychology and classical liberalism to claim that theres some grand postmodern neomarxist conspiracy out there any unsavoury reactionary / fascist type can dismiss and shun anyone they disagree with using his arguments i mean the dude has done videos for prageru and refuses to accept that pepe is a symbol of the altright hes clearly not too worried about being associated with growing nativism
  he might not be a fascist himself but hes inadvertently given a lot of fuel to the fire of fascist movements  i really do think he knows what hes doing its not all just some accident with him as the reluctant king thats how they want it to be
   being this triggered by small caps  how fragile can you get
  whos they youre referring to
  he started out as an unrelated antipc activist then he saw the opportunity and jumped on the altright train he knows perfectly well the kind of people that support him
  i think thats a huge stretch although if you could provide some documentation of his widespread fandom among the altright id be willing to concede
  blames people who used echo memes for a synagogue shooting   alt right talk mad smack about him  the kind of people that support him  i think youre both dishonest and politically illiterate
  here ill run the experiment   
  thank you very much that was a quality post
  kekvery well played anon     seems the altright cant stand the guy
    theyre attacking him for not being antisemitic enough lol
  accusing jp of being altright is like accusing womens studies departments of being fascist for their professional and ideological ties to law enforcement
  his fanbase is definitely an online collective of right wingers who have tapped into a certain narrative though    what else is the alt right this is what i was talking about with the factionalism
  what else is the alt right  the alt right according to people who actually call themselves that is white nationalist/prowhite  trying to broaden the term to include all nativism all nationalism and all classical liberalism is a dishonest attempt to paint the entire right as fascist and thus morally correct to physically attack and suppress with all means available   ie its dishonest cuntery meant to get people hurt
  trying to broaden the term to include all nativism all nationalism and all classical liberalism is a dishonest attempt to paint the entire right as fascist and thus morally correct to physically attack and suppress with all means available  you know thats not true im not equating all of the altright with the worst of who exist among them im just acknowledging the loose collective of right wing cyber activists who exist under a broad conspiracy     either way though your argument that groups have a right to self identify and others should follow by using their nomenclature is pretty postmodern and neomarxist my dude
  im not equating all of the altright with the worst of who exist among them  he said placing all those people into the category alt right you lying cunt
  i dont think you quite understand my argument i mean youve acted with the opposite of the definition of the words i do not think that 1488 tiki torchers are the entirety of the alt right just that they exist in it a faction so to speak am i using the wrong pronoun
   being this triggered by a passing comment about all lower caps posts  how fragile can you get
  youre a lying piece of shit and everyone here knows it
  you started with writing paragraphs before insulting me now were down to bare insults is this the moment youre broken
  peterson didnt invent it fuckwit he coopted it into his meme ideology as the dragon of chaos
  postmodern neomarxism  wtf is postmodern neomarxism / cultural marxism anyway i see the terms thrown around by /pol/ types but they never define what they mean
  things i dont like
  did you finish your cult orientation program  ftfy
  its something that happens in countries that dont have culture nor experienced marxism
  this    pajamas media and other murrican right wing sites and figures have been talking about the frankfurt school cultural marxism and marxist postmodernism way before peterson was known
  criticalintersectionalists the folks jp routinely beefs with are not marxists   criticalintersectionalists are not marxists in the same sense that the french are not franks
   but hes inadvertently given a lot of fuel to the fire of fascist movements  fascist movements dare not fueled by their reaction to jordan peterson they are fueled by their reaction to people like you    which do you think would have amore damping effect on fascism  jordan peterson disappearing or the modern left disappearing
  peterson  hardcore reactionary
  not him but the answer depends on long term vs short term  short term peterson  long term left
  fuck tired wrong way around  in the short term petersons removal would cause many of his followers to go fash  in the long term petersons removal would cement the hegemony of the left   although really individual people are pretty much irrelevant  if one goes down another stands up
  underrated b8
  u dun nuh nuffin
  is proud to be stupid
  cryptofascist dogwhistles  this
  accusing people of saying things theyre not actually saying and referring to it as a dogwhistle encapsulates how insufferable and stupid the altleft is
  postmodernism  based on shit from the 50s and 60s took off in the 80s penetration of alwayson entertainment media allowed for a grossly oversimplified version of it to make its way out into the masses mostly supposed to be about realizing that observed information is necessarily transformed by the individual as they observe it and anything that individual communicates about the information is necessarily going to reflect the attitude and perspective of the individual more so than the original information itself youre supposed to work to decouple the observer from the observed basically a pseudoscientific method for the humanities somehow this got twisted into facts dont exist unless i like them by most lay people academics only struggle with it because the overall quality of academia has fallen and because americans never got postmodernism to begin with but took the global spotlight around the time it was getting mainstream  neomarxism  i dunno lol mostly seems like people who are deeply humanistic but overly individualistic looking at the intrinsic failings of capitalism ignoring the intrinsic failings of communism and suggesting that communism could actually work this time guys i swear seems like they misinterpreted postmodernism and flung it around like a hammer to decide the only reason my life sucks is because ive been oppressed by white men for the most part as far as why its subversive thats probably got more to do with this trend towards associating facts with morality and that the people who have been decided to be factual are the popular ones and its popular to be leftleaning right now in the media because the internet is principally occupied by disgruntled teens and college students
  not that other guy but  knowledge has a causative relation to intelligence  those are some pretty fucking serious implications
anything realated to marxism postthis guy
  those are some pretty fucking serious implications  and over the course of human history we accepted those implications and shaped our societies by them
  in the long term petersons removal would cement the hegemony of the left   do you honestly think peterson is some kind of key leadership figure and not just another piece of flotsam buoyed by this wave of sentiment
  everyone that isnt in the cult is stupid
  im just acknowledging the loose collective of right wing cyber activists who exist under a broad conspiracy    you have got to be trollingi suppose you think joe rogan and sam harris are altright
  its the rights version of the lefts use of the term altright or fascist pretty much stuff i dont like
  looks at file name  its time for you to leave
  over the course of history we accepted the implications of racism too that didnt stop people like you from undermining them though
  literally my next sentence   i mean cement it more  ultimately their battle is unwinnable and theyre already losing  what will come after is harder to guess
  fascism exists though people have described themselves as fascist and altright cultural marxism is a conspiracy theory nobody goes around saying they are a postmodern cultural marxist or whatever
  the altleft  the what now
  more like the english are not normans     criticalintersectionalists really dont give 2 shits about class and eagerly embrace capitalism in fact capitalist actors are often the ones most eagerly pushing it just go hang around /tv/ or /v/ for examples     that said its a very underdeveloped ideology kinda stalled out in the identify the issue phase
  uh  no  thanks 4 understanding
  why are furfags like this
  postmodern implies we can go no further and often end up either going sidways stagnating or cannibalising for the perception we are making continued progress when really we arent    neo implies collective nationalistic socialism    marxisms just a higher tier of gibs making the individual non functional in the sense it is no longer responsible for its own actions or so hypocritically ignorant in its displayance that someone mentioned it earlier false equivalence    also typical distortion techniques like trying to extreme the arguement and make it bipolar remove logical discussion avoid concensus and stop progress    i think this all comes ultimately from hard evidence things like managerial entrenchment from positions of statism at the deep tier level and bad drugs in the environment affecting everyone as we are all one/tied together with one environment ultimately    marxism is fucking terrible first of all u are saying the top 50 should actively suffer loss to help the bottom 50 and it should be imposedly done through the state mechanism of physical violent force    its a real shame we generated a general level of excess more so then in history and people are so dimwitted to apriori intelligence they cant understand that just because its more then yesterday in terms of  utilisation of what was actually possible that we may even be worse off then yesterday    people are great and people are entitled to what they earn not others anarchism is capitalism in the sense that if you think someone is genuinely disadvantaged and you can use the mechanism of state to achieve this you can invest on an individual basis off the fact you think you will see return tangible or un/in just like we do when we associate ourselves to ideas free of duress and doing so freely we do it because we are anarchical beings not because we are forced to breaking contract formation and peverting law dystopically
  nobody goes around saying they are a postmodern cultural marxist or whatever  proof
  classical liberalism is being chucked around as a sort of altright get out of jail free card  no retard theres very striking differences between classical liberalism and third position fascism/altright    t actual fascist
  give me proof that people dont do something  lol not how it works
  jordan peterson disappearing or the modern left disappearing    very good point a genuine dirty liberal movement inspired by classic american populism would tear the heart out of the secular right     many of the powers that be really dont want that to happen
  criticalintersectionalists really dont give 2 shits about class and eagerly embrace capitalism   critint see class in racial terms and they most definitely do not embrace capitalism just because they no longer use the traditional marxist definition of class does not mean they are not an evolution of marxist ideology
its the new veriety of marxism theyre pushing on our kids at universities these days
  and whats your point exactely the fact that better education translates into better intelect is nothing controversial
  in the long term petersons removal would cement the hegemony of the left    you make him sound like the most important and powerful psychology professor in history
  dogwhistles    this is the most insidious term in modern american discourse     t progressive lefty
    yeah thats about how leftists feel when they get accused of promoting postmodern neomarxism for advocating for black lives matter or whatever
  altleft    thank you for using that term the criticalintersectionalists bark loudly but are a very small  of the actual american left
    postmodern neomarxism  exist
  the fact that better education translates into better intelect is nothing controversial  so was the fact that niggers are inferior yet here we are
  black lives matter is postmodern neomarxism though
what the fuck is everyone is this thread even talking about anymore the amount of ideologies and movements being mislabeled and flung around is absolutely mind boggling even for this byzantine basket weaving bazaar
  they exist because the normal left has gone full shekels for major corporations the cia and militarism
    everyone wants to believe that their opponents arent smart enough to have their own thoughts theyre just being controlled by some sinister other
  what does this have to do with niggers are you american or something
  cultural marxism is a conspiracy theory    no its mislabeled because those who use the term are playing for conservative audiences     the ideology is intersectionality more accurately intersectionality combined with critical theory its has marxist roots but if very different than marxism
  lol and you claim to be smart
  i disagree in action the critint dont want to destroy capitalism they want to take it over take google as an example or better yet the entire industry of consultants antiracism feminist etc that has grown up around critint ideology     they dont want to destroy the bourgeois they want to take it over
  i wouldnt go so far as to say its very different theyreboth movements which attempt to organize the lowest of society against the highest
        
  i disagree in action the critint dont want to destroy capitalism they want to take it over   semantics    they dont want to destroy the bourgeois they want to take it over  just like every other marxist in actual practice
i would love to hear some of these arguments happening irl not at colleges either just like walk into a local meeting of a political party and start throwing these terms around
  intersectionality is about organising the bottom against the middle with the support of the top
  critint doesnt give 2 shit about economic oppression because its most powerful backers are affluent white women the one group capitalism has benefited the most
jordon peterson is correct about cultural marxism and has never been wrong about anything
  its impossible while one side dobs workers into their bosses
  thats fair everything i dont like is socialism
  this but unironically  name one occasion where hes been wrong
  its older than intersectionality its just cluster of emancipatory movements like libertarians feminists advocates for sexual and ethnic minorities free love people etc that just dont really have a collective label one might try to call them leftists but that would also include socialists who would frown at them for being bourgeiose degenerates
  the altleft is corporate as fuck also seems to have a pretty big hardon for violent government authority too
  when he tried to start an argument with a zizek bot accoun t
  education correlates with intelligence  thats very serious claim  indeed it is and its acknowledged so  niggeeerrss lol xd  what do niggers have to do with this  lol u styoopid xddd    ok
  tfw neomarxism is real  tfw most neomarxists have no idea what it is  tfw most antineomarxists have no idea what it is either  it feels good to be smart everyone in this thread with the exception of 2 posts is a simpering retard though which just makes it all the better to be otherwise
    when he didnt know what treason is
      the disregard for economic oppression and class issues it a huge break between critint and marxismalmost as huge a break as exists between marxism and liberalism     critint doesnt hate corporateamerica or private property a huge part of their ideology is focused around helping groups succeed in corporateamerica and acquire private property     capiltalism is an active participant in critint ideology because its so easy to marketize
  race correlates with intelligence  thats a very serious claim  indeed is and its acknowledged so  are you fucking kidding me i cant even right now educate yourself bigot    still dont see where im going with this champ
  astute
  its some shit with international relations or 1950s soviet economy isnt it
  youre actually one hundred percent correct and i spoke imprecisely it is more accurate to say marxism is also in practice the top organizing the bottom against the middle
  i agree critical theory is older that intersectionality too but it seems the modern concept of intersectionality is an awkward and often inconsistent bringing together of all of the above
  no i dont i dont reee at the fact race might have something to do with intellect like you reee at the fact education does neither i see where does your obsession with niggers stem from is it something personal or is it the constant shitposting of interracial pornography that got in your brain
  that literally is treason though
  you sound fat
  at the expense of the top thus removing them from such clarrification ur clearly not an economist nor even a philosopher
  i mean zizek is an npc so hes not wrong really  a bot makes better arguments than the real thing thats an argument against zizek if anything
  is an npc  what does this even mean anymore
  critint doesnt hate corporateamerica or private property a huge part of their ideology is focused around helping groups succeed in corporateamerica and acquire private property     and  classical marxists werent luddite their goal was to seize the means of production how is that any different than seizing control of successful corporations
  race might have something to do with intellect
  what does this even mean anymore
  critical theory mostly deals with other stuff like capitalism adverisement ecology pacifism etc this cluster of mevements can stand on its own without it plus those movements most often originate in 19th18th century if not further    reality is that if you label them by singular label you are doing a mistake feel free to interpret this fact as either a reason that you can always feel smug when righties try to label it or as a proof of lefts dishonesty
   i dont reee at the fact race might have something to do with intellect   what you personally do is irrelevant as it it doesnt change the fact that what was once a historical norm was overturned making the idea of appealing to historical norms a poor foundation upon which to mount an argument
  weighted noncommittence meaningfully discardant
  i would strangle your stupid marxist ass with my bare hands god you people are dumb brainlet mother fuckers
  making the idea of appealing to historical norms a poor foundation  you should practice your reading skills anon was saying that knowledge has a causative relation to intelligence has some kind of pretty fucking serious implications to which i responded with a fact that those implications were accepted and that there is a clear consensus against what he would want to be true correct step in his argument would be to bring out facts against this consensus instead of niggers
  im ok with just calling it intersectionality its just the movement seems to use critical theory as their worldviews main lens so critint seemed more accurate
  intersectionality implies intersection most of those people focus on one field and sympathise with others they dont focus on intersection
  jordan peterson merges two words at odds with each other to make a new word to describe everyone he doesnt like  somehow anon is the brainlet for pointing this out
  correct step in his argument would be to bring out facts against this consensus instead of niggers  consensus is not an argument in the first place therefore no facts are required to reject any claims which are made based upon the justification of consensus
  two words at odds with each other   well i cant really argue with that marxism is at odds with the concept of culture
  heт
  pomo and marxism are at odds with each other and the cultural aspect of cultural marxism is the critique of western culture not any suggestion of a marxist culture whatever that may mean
  what would you call it then
  its about his analysis about everything else being completely fucking retarded i will have no pity when real fascists come and string you faggots up from trees you cant cry wolf forever and expect people to give a shit saying peterson is altright or that his viewers are cryptofascists is such a disgusting lie that i dont even have the words to respond leftists will deserve everything coming to them
  consensus is not an argument in the first place  by convention it is the starting point but i guess you dont respect conventions either plus the argument started with pretty fucking serious implications to which consensus is perfectly valid response    if you want to me to prove that water is wet heres the first study i got from google  
  whose analysis neither postmodernists nor critical theorists actually accept marxs analysis    if youre talking about jordan petersons analysis then yeah its completely fucking retarded
  again there is no such label if you pressed me i would say emancipatory movements but that would include plenty of others eg people who fought against serfdom
  why are alt right guys so insecure about their masculinity
  id say hed be more insecure about having shitskin family
  by convention it is the starting point  irrelevant and your own language acknowledges this as you recognize that convention is only the starting point and not the ending point    but i guess you dont respect conventions either   correct    plus the argument started with pretty fucking serious implications to which consensus is perfectly valid response  incorrect on both parts
  its a brainlet term that doesnt even mean anything stop making these fucking threads
  but he willingly married into a nonwhite family
  postmodern neomarxism is an oxymoron it mashes together two ideologies that are directly at odds with eachother marxism believes there is an identifiable progression in history while postmodernism rejects the idea that there is any kind of progression or logic to human development marx would have found more to agree on with rockerfeller than he would have had with foucalt or derrida anyone who uses the term unironically is a brainlet who has no clue what theyre talking about
  haha le pic is you xd it means u r dumb and i am woke    people who post brainlet wojaks need to be dragged out into the street and shot
  no true postmodernist believe there is a progression to human development
  not that anon but what do you mean by postmodernism exactly
  dont play that game with me faggot
  asking you to define your terms is unreasonable    whatever brainlet
  uh yes just like how no true capitalist believes that workers should own the means of production
  why should i define the term that someone else used he should be the on to define postmodernism if hes going to be making claims about it
i like how you faggots will claim literally anything as long as its the opposite of what peterson says  there are only two genders its a biological fact
  lets clarify some words    marxism is the critique of capitalism which karl marx and friedrich engels started workers are paid wages which do not represent the value of the work that they do and the remainder of that value created goes to the people who own the tools they use the bourgeois are then seen to be exploiting the proletariat and because what they produce is taken from them in order to be sold by the bourgeois the proletariat are also alienated from their labour since all it produces for them is money marxism says capitalism is bad because of economic exploitation    critical theory cultural marxism the most prominent strain of neomarxism is when a bunch of guys got together and wondered why there hadnt been a western revolution yet even though pretty much everyone had heard of socialism they thought it was because western society cutlure statecraft etc was made to hide oppression from people in addition to the west they also thought a bit about how bad the soviet union was and why fascism came to rise    in marxist terms marx focused on the base while critical theorists focused on the superstructure in doing so though critical theory also rejects some of the tenets of classical marxism they are not explicitly materialist and so their conception of dialectics differs from marxs    on the other hand intersectionality focuses on the way that racial economic religious gender etc interact to create a system of oppression most of the time these are actually the people jordan peterson is talking about although he makes remarkably little reference to them    all three of these groups are modernist they believe in systematic thought than can describe all of history and society    postmodernism is the rejection of systems of thought and grand narratives for history in part because they see the idea of rationality and even the meaning of words as fundamentally variable
  dont lump all leftism in with retard terms like postmodern neomarxism  lumps anything remotely right wing in with fascism
  just like how no true capitalist believes that workers should own the means of production  are you claiming that true capitalists oppose the concept of private ownership that no true capitalist believes a skilled worker should ever go into business for themselves
  stop trying to bring up a completely unrelated issue to signal how smart you are you fucking pseud christ jp fanboys really are braindead
  as you recognize that convention is only the starting point and not the ending point  it is very relevant because it allows for human communication without this metaargumental bullshit also you are correct in saying it is the starting point but you fail to realize that if you want to move from the starting point youll have present valid arguments    incorrect on both parts  good point on the first one i should specify im speaking about my involvement that started with the eduint correlation bad point on the second one if you say are you saying that fire can hurt those are some pretty serious implications i can say yea thats why we dont touch it acknowledging those implications and refering to the fact there is a consensus and that you should start by disproving it by presenting studies that prove fire doesnt have high enough temperature to hurt human body
  gender is socially constructed that there are two sexes is the biological fact you are referencing
  no he is saying that no true capitalist is a socialist
  based and redpilled
  jordan peterson is the only redpill for me senpai
  gender is socially constructed
  dude im not claiming sex is socially constructed but it is a fact that what people think of genders is by and large determined by their society
  le pic is you xd  reddit is that way
  so your claim is that no owner of capital can ever advocate for socialism
  alright even if this absurd stereotype somehow existed it wouldnt discredit that person or their beliefs at all its very offputting to see young men so readily discredit the the pursuit of truth by focusing instead on personal character
  this /pol/ brainlets arent concerned with being right they think if they can put their opponent in a box of failed masculinity it means theyve won to them signaling how much better you are than others is more important
  im saying that guy is claiming noone who believes the means of production should be privately owned can believe that the means of production should be collectively owned
  gender is a construct based on the biological reality of sex i can give you an example as men we are expected to be assertive that is our gender norm    however this is not simply created out of thin air as multiple research have shown that an increase of testosterone leads to more assertive behaviour
  welp the movement is real so for ease of reference lets refer to it as critical intersectionality may not be perfect but it is the most accurate
  you are literally doing that same thing with this comment
  bingo marxism is a modernist ideology
  what do you people even mean by gender because it has always meant man or woman
  im not saying theres no foundation to the construct but there are things we associate with gender which are not biologically determined     that gender is socially constructed doesnt mean i think that it is constructed out of thin air rather it is constructed from the biological basis of reality but with other stuff thrown in which is socially determined for example that women should stay in the home is a social construct common during a certain not too distant era in the west ancient humans had women gathering fruits and men hunting medieval societies had different roles for men and women etc etc
  peterson has explained this multiple times he knows its contradictory to hold those two views at the same time these people dont care about logical consistency they use postmodernism to deconstruct ideas different from their own neomarxism
  in the west it means man or woman but other cultures can recognize different genders and different cultures will also associate different things with the genders    when people say gender they mean the things which are socially as opposed to biologically associated with people based on their sex so obviously that men cant be pregnant isnt a social construct but that men should be the ones who work is pregnancy is part of sex but workroles are part of gender
  for example that women should stay in the home is a social construct common during a certain not too distant era in the west ancient humans had women gathering fruits and men hunting medieval societies had different roles for men and women etc etc  having different behaviors doesnt change your gender thats ironically a pretty goddamn conservative idea i honestly think you people just have mental problems
  postmodernism is the rejection of systems of thought and grand narratives for history in part because they see the idea of rationality and even the meaning of words as fundamentally variable    huhi guess im a bit of a postmodernist     great post btw
  literally no wellestablished philosopher uses postmodernism as a means to neomarxism and no random college student actually understands either of these well enough to use one for the other
  you are arguing about gender roles you dont seem to understand that cultural marxist intersectional feminists are literally arguing that very concept of gender is culturally constructed to level that if you see in mirror that you have testicles penis and beard and bone structure that doesnt look like your moms you assuming that you are male is because of cultural construct
  your gender doesnt change if youre a woman who goes to work you would still be called a woman
  they implicitly understand that you can deconstruct or unpack any concept they just never apply critique to their own ideas
  thats kind of the point of critical theory it was a bunch of marxists who decided to use the dialectical method on dialectical materialism
  today yes but there was a time when the doing that would make you a masculine woman
  you would still be a woman i seriously think you people are crazy
  gender is gender roles gender roles are the main thing we associate with gender    gender is separate from sex in the west there are two genders man and woman which are more or less associated with two sexes male and female neither man nor woman are sex and neither male or female are genders
  gender roles are largely uniform throughout traditional societies with some small degree of variancethat would imply strongly its a biological construct more than a social one
  gender is gender roles gender roles are the main thing we associate with gender  no one uses it like this when you fill out a form that asks you what gender you are they dont care if youre a stay at home dad you still put man   you are out of your mind genuinely tapped
  gender and sex are interchangeable they were even called transexuals it was called sex change surgery hating women is called being sexist
  blanket term for anything vaguely left leaning  you do know that he clearly and specifically defines both postmodernists and neo marxists  his definition of post modernists are people who accepts the axiom that anything can be interpreted in infinite amount of ways so therefore its useless to pick one interpretation  marxists is self explanatory
  not him but if a /pol/ster could come up with convincing arguments for their worldview i would gladly accept it so far i havent seen any though and ive been here since before /pol/ was created
  in the west there are two genders    why the caveat in the west there are two genders in the vast majority of human societies
  good point
  because theyre liars anon they are out of their minds and they literally do not care about reality just their ideologies they lie day in and day out
  when was that time exactly
  no gender roles are called gender roles and gender is called gender
  they are fairly uniform but there are also a number of matriarchal societies societies which have a gender other than man/woman transgender people sometimes homosexual people etc there are societies that associate agriculture with women which in the west is associated with men different societies will assign different virtues and vices as primarily masculine or feminine etc      yeah thats true but it isnt universally true should have given the caveat in most societies      gender is the things we associate with sex which are not directly determined by sex      the 50s id hazard
  gender roles are an integral part of gender
  im saying that guy is claiming noone who believes the means of production should be privately owned can believe that the means of production should be collectively owned  thats not what he said though
  gender is the things we associate with sex which are not directly determined by sex  its determined by your sex not your behavior women do not suddenly become men if they work in construction or some shit you people are seriously out of your fucking minds
sexual dimorphism exists in humans therefore gender can not purely be a social construct
  a true capitalist is someone who believes the means of production should be privately own by the bourgeoisie who are the people who own the means of production look i think this is semantics the point hes making is that no postmodernist believes that human development is linearly progressive because postmodernism is exactly the rejection of that idea
  no they are not
  not necessarily although women did venture out to collect water and food such as berries they would do so in a range where their safety could be ensured by the men in the village     now compare this with bands of men who would hunt up to 50km in a single day for a hunt furthermore women were bound to their house as they carried out domestic literally tasks while the men were away    thus although the idea of a woman being completely housebound is a somewhat modern idea they are far more domestic compared to men which is where my idea of biological core comes to be men can physically afford to be away from the home women can not     sexual dimorphism is a key feature in attractiveness therefore the loyal housewife shows a feminity which is deemed attractive to men again a biological argument
  how am i doing the same thing im just pointing out your shitty behavior either learn to argue without memes or fuck off
  gender is socially constructed on the basis of sex like how race is socially constructed on the basis of genetics or skin colour or whatever
  you labeled the guy into a box im not him
  gender is the things we associate with sex which are not directly determined by sex    gender is clearly heavily influenced by sex
  sexual dimorphis is social construct implanted by gender study feminists claiming gender is pure social construct makes very confused people
  but there are things we associate with gender which are not determined by sex women having long hair for example is womanly but not female
  by pointing out hes putting people into a box you are putting him into a box    okay
  you cant separate gender from biology or race from biology just because you have some retarded very confused humanist with agenda with zero understanding of biology claiming so doesnt make it so
  you labeled him as a /pol/ brainlet you did exactly what you were chastising him for dont reply if you dont acknowledge this
  there are some biological reasons to hair amongst men and women short hair squares out your facial features which are considered more attractive amongst males    hence why women dont really pull off short hair too often
why does a selfhelp guru make leftists this mad
  a true capitalist is someone who believes the means of production should be privately own by the bourgeoisie who are the people who own the means of production  a true capitalist is someone who believes the means of production should be privately owned by the people who own the means of production  /  the point hes making is that no postmodernist believes that human development is linearly progressive because postmodernism is exactly the rejection of that idea  so what about all those postmodernists that wind up applying a linear progression to human development anyway
  because they are mentally ill messes and their ideology requires that you have serious mental problems in order to follow it they also just hate anyone or anything empowering men if youre wondering why they do anything the answer is that they want to overthrow the patriarchy and that theyre insane
  and a woman with short hair is still a woman jesus christ you people are insane
  read preparata
  thoughtful but i dont think i agree    there are societies that associate agriculture with women which in the west is associated with men    traditionally in the west the vocations traditionally associated with men usually involved violence or heavy manual labor thats pretty much uniform across all human society agricultural was traditionally a cooperative enterprise see milk maids    also examples of matriarchal societies are extremely rare and typically outliers     gender is the things we associate with sex which are not directly determined by sex    i would say not totally determinate but gender is highly influenced by sex for the vast majority of people     the 50s id hazard  fair but it was a rather short and unique period in even the scope of american society
  /pol/tard spews /pol/ meme  call out his pseud behavior  ur just as bad as him    so posting a /pol/ meme doesnt mean hes from /pol/ i never even said that it meant he was wrong again i was just pointing out his shitty behavior    why does pointing this out put you into an autistic frenzy
  which postmodernists are those
  great post
  sexual dimorphis is social construct implanted by gender study feminists claiming gender is pure social construct    huh sexual dimorphism is the reason im taller and stronger than most women its a biological trait of humans
  not him but i think you misunderstood his post
  sop being such a drama queen you whiny feminine bitch
  true some aspects of gender are cultural trends but the impact of these trends on gender roles seems to be way overstated in modern intellectual circles     toxic masculinity for instance has at least as much a basis in biology as it does society
  that guy is arguing that gender is determined by behavior style and personality not sex that is the weirdo faux progressive mindset
  you cant separate gender from biology or race from biology    the biological differences between genders are much greater than those between races
  stop putting people into boxes you whiny feminine bitch  if hearing this makes you have an autistic meltdown you can always go back to your reddit containment board
  and a woman with short hair is still a woman    a very good point     modern society seems very confused about the difference between preferences and immutable characteristics
  i think he made the distinction between gender and sex didnt he im not even trying to argue im just trying to understand both your positions better
  i think they both have good points but its a squishy subject
  of course someone like you would interpret any criticism as dramatically as possible that im not simply dismissing your squirmy hipster bullshit that its a fit of rage put on your chastity cage and calm down
  its not squishy at all man its just the overthrow the patriarchy crowd using yet another childish word game to move toward their goals gender and sex are interchangeable terms
  the immutable characteristics are obviously sex the things we associate with people on the basis of those immutable characteristics but which are not immutable are gender
  im not claiming theres any kind of a patriarchy i just think its a useful distinction to separate the things we socially construct on the basis of sex but which are not themselves inherently associated with either sex from sex
  ive literally never met one person who calls a man or woman the opposite because of the way they live their lives outside of jokes    youre the one perpetuating the old ass conservative idea that a stay at home dad is no longer a man but actually a woman i have a theory that you guys are actually hyperrepressed conservatives an antigay preacher sucking dicks in public bathrooms
  im not from /pol/ but im going to piss my pants and cry about it when someone calls out their shitty behavior    okay again if hearing me shit on /pol/ makes you cry so much why are you still here im not even particularly leftwing but of course youre going to assume that because you have to signal to the whole thread how smart you are
  s just the overthrow the patriarchy crowd using yet another childish word game to move toward their goals gender and sex are interchangeable terms  yet another childish word game to move toward their goals  in finland where we have no gender/sex synonym or gendered pronouns feminist bats in university keep gender study courses in you guessed it english gotta drive in propaganda that allpowerful patriarchy is keeping up sexist power structure somehow when native language doesnt really support that
  its a useful distinction  for what
    
  im not saying that a stay at home dad would be considered womanly today but there was a brief time in western history when yeah a stay at home dad would be considered to not be manly
  a brief time  you mean all of it including today
  okay that clearly didnt work maybe put on your chastity cage and read some buzzfeed listicles
  he would still be called a man his gender wouldnt change it would still be his sex sex and gender are interchangeable and all your ideas are insane
  its squishy because while sexual tendencies are extremely influential they are not completely determinate there are always exceptions     transexuality is one of those exceptions less than 1 of the population that seems to be strangely influential in cultural discourse
  i think it depends where you are where i live at the present time stay at home dads arent really considered unmanly in feudal europe too men also did tasks on their property like harvesting the crops grown on their plot gardening even vegetables in a good portion of the west is considered none too manly
  that last portion should be qualified with in the present era or today or something like that
  where i live at the present time stay at home dads arent really considered unmanly  are you sure about that i mean maybe if you live in california and you are already rich but i dont know anywhere else where this would be considered ok    i know many places where the /idea/ of a stay at home dad would be considered ok but not any actual existing man staying home and just taking care of kids and wouldnt be looked as a weirdo
  yeah man but you dont yell at people who say humans have 10 fingers just because a very rare exception of people dont its fundamentally a crazy person thought process fundamentally unreasonable
  i get what you are saying and agree
  youyoure a cuckhold  couldnt have expected any better from a /pol/tard i like how youve tried to turn this into a petty political shitflinging competition even though i havent actually stated my own political views again if youre still shitting your pants over the fact that i called out some /pol/tard why are you still here is your aspergers so bad that you have to get the last word
  i dont know man i dont think that was long enough for you to saddle up with your chastity cage and get really into more than one buzzfeed listicles
  dont think that the 9 fingered traditionally had as hard a time of it as the heshes
what is even being discussed in this thread
281 posts and not a /pol/ shit fest    /his/ im proud of you
  weve gotten to the subject of gender vs sex and the altleft are insisting that gender and sex are different because stay at home dads are actually women   normal people are pointing out that those people are out of their minds
  girls mostly
  /pol/tard is getting this asshurt  why are you still here what are you hoping to accomplish are you hoping to post a screenshot of this to your discord group im sorry but you need to be 18 or older to post here maybe you should give your mom her phone back now
  gender and sex are different    i mean they are technically its just that the critinerts really really overstate the difference
  lol trying so hard
  leftist are incapable of discussing this so they just shitpost these threads into oblivion this is because they are clueless to any of this so their go to damage control point is to claim it isnt real and just a phantom made up by nazis    heres a pretty good lecture on the postmodern neo marxism thing for anyone interested                 
  its an efficient way to distinguish between biology and sociology the rigid scientific distinction of a biological male vs the less rigorous conception of masculinity
  this
  there are feminine men and masculine women you probably know all about that it doesnt change the fact that theyre still men and women
    reminder that the whole gender/social construct meme is literally pseudo science based off a failed and unethical human experiment involving children by dr john money    david remier was his guinea pig and when it didnt work money just lied and leftist didnt care and just ran with it cultural marxism is a chimera of bile and insecurity and is the most disgusting ideology ever vomited out
  thats not how its used though they get butthurt at things like boys preferring toy cars and girls preferring baby dolls and in the wider scope women choosing feminine fields of work and men choosing masculine fields of work even in the most open and tolerant societies
  this post  haha no im not mad you can tell by the smug tone of my posts im above this whole conversation bro
  because theyre crazy people anon they are out of their minds theyre control freaks and parrot things theyve been told by professors from wildly unscientific fields without a single ounce of critical analysis
  but money developed his theory of gender before reimer it was hardly based off a failed experiment certainly it was bad what happened to reimer but that doesnt make his theory wrong
  oh yes this case where john money proved that david remier whose dick was cut off was a woman by for example making him have naked homosex with his brother when david was 11 and filming it
  his hypothesis was rejected by the failure of his experiment you cant cut off a kids dick and raise him as a girl because gender is a result of biological sex deal with it
  what an evil sick fuck of course these progressives worship his word as gospel
  even in the most open and tolerant societies people are conditioned from birth people tend to interact with male and female infants differently so that by the time they even have the agency to choose a toy they have already been conditioned a certain way to a degree
  marxists dont care about gender theory since the primary axis of oppression is classbased and not genderbased you are arguing against social constructionism here and not cultural marxism
  disproves his own theory in sadistic incredibly perverted child experiment which results in suicide of test subject  wwell that didnt prove his theory wrong hehe
  men and women have differences in interest and personality that is a direct result of different hormones and brain this is very well established and frankly should be obvious
  neomarxism is the marxist prinicples of class and capital applied to gender and race
  yes but cars are not natural so how could you say that boys selecting cars is based in nature the symbolism of the car is determined by society to be masculine more than feminine
  yes and with the concept of gender you can discuss those concepts of masculinity and femininity without being distracted with the minutia of chromosomesthe word doesnt have to be viewed through the lens of a website made in 2007
  it literally is not im not sure if youve read anything written by a critical theorist but you clearly have no idea what they claim
  moneys work has been criticized even by modern psychologists and sexologists its not based off his work its almost as if theres many different theories on the nature of gender/sex and isnt some politically charged black and white debate
  no they arent youre just making shit up science trumps your ideology     
  gender theory was developed through critical theory which was created by marxist
  i know of no leftist liberal or socialist who believes the reimer experiment was not inhumane and misguided the whole disaster actually relied on gender essentialism you have no penis so you should be forced to behave like a girl even if you dont feel like it gender theory grand wizard judith butler wrote an extensive critique of the procedure that was forced upon reimer in her book undoing gender
  yes it does retard he had a theory he tested it out it didnt work and then he just lied and made shit up so it would fit his hypothesis    this is another major problem with the modern left critical theory is based on a rejection of reason
  men are more interested in objects and representations of objects usually tool/machine type things  women are more interested in people  a car is an object and tool not a representation of a person    you dont have to discuss chromosomes its a given that theyre involved in the story dont act like normal people agree with this ideology anon its academics who need to make work and ugly college girls who graduated along with their scrawny hipster whipping boys
  just because they dont describe it as such doesnt change the fact that its how intersectionality manifests oppressor vs oppressed and marxism applied to social capital
  yes it is how many times are you faggots going to keep saying wow you dont even understand critical theory when its very clear you know nothing about it marcuses whole thing was to ditch the working class as a vector for revolution so he turned to a social outcast of any type
  i doubt that children believe toy cars are machines    a monkey playing with a doll truly the epitome of the scientific method  it is a matter of fact that people play with boys and girls differently
  john money sure did bad things to children  and he disproved himself  buuuut his theories which he disproved are still kinda interesting  yup we take his theories sans experimental results and run with it    is what your blabbering sounds like but fact is money hid his own results for decades and during that time gender studies was formed its avalanche of bullshit based on lie thats all gender studies are
  marxism applied to notmarxist is not marxism the idea that people can be oppressed is not a marxist idea and any philosophy that has an idea of oppressor and oppressed is not necessarily a marxist philosophy the fact that philosophies that you disagree with have this feature does not mean that philosophies you disagree with are marxist    feminism is not necessarily marxist antiracism is not necessarily marxist etc
  a girl monkey you dont get to act like some arbitor of science when you are literally rejecting science and spouting dogma at me    
  its not necessarily conscious and im using the word machine very loosely they are instinctually wired to gravitate toward objects similar to tools and machines
  ah so gender theory is not marxism
  wow thanks for the study dr peterson
  oppressor vs oppressed and distributing capital equally equality of outcome as well its neomarxism not marxism
  i never said that it was youre being a typical retard and conflating marxism with cultural marxism no one is saying marx himself came up with these ideas
  why are you shitposting after you talking point was disproved anon is this a coping mechanism for you since your world view is literally scientifically false
  no youre being a typical retard and conflating cultural marxism with gender theory which are in reality completely different things one of them is influenced by the other but they are not remotely the same thing
  theyre a lot like religious people in that this doctrine is sacred to them and they literally cannot handle it being false guy genuinely thinks men and women are biologically the same what a fucking circus lmao
  it is literally true that infants are treated differently on the basis of their sex
  they are not biologically the same and i have never claimed that they are some of the things we associate with them are not biological and that is the entirety of my claim and always has been
  thats all gender studies are  not than anon but saying that gender studies is complete bullshit is pretty antiintellectual
    dont get angry at me for educating you that your worldview is literally pseudo science theres a reason you arent posting anything to back up your claims    
  youre confused by these terms and literally just thought cultural marxism was something marx himself came up with rather than it being a neo marxist thing from the minds of marxist seeking to revise marxs ideals
  your claim is that behavioral and interest differences are entirely due to raising babies differently youre wrong this is well established  at a certain point people cross a line where they should know the science and theres no excuse figure it out
  it really is a religious like dogma it is a rejection of the enlightenment after all
  i am literally not cultural marxism was developed by the likes of adorno horkheimer and marcuse and they certainly did very little philosophizing about the oppression of any gender
  i am claiming that they are in part due to raising them differently males and females have behavioral differences that are biologically ingrained but they are also pushed to develop a certain way by society which does not necessarily arise strictly from sexual differences
  cultural marxism is entirely an enlightenmentbased philosophy
  i am claiming that they are in part due to raising them differently  no one disputed that people argued there were biological reasons and then you started arguing that the differences are due to society
  i am claiming that even in the most open and tolerant societies there are still differences between men and women which are created by society the differences between men and women in scandinavia are not strictly biological
  no it isnt the core of it is literally a rejection of reason     this is why those who follow it dont believe imperial evidence or stats or worthy sources of truth they think the scientific method is white and therefore wrong so other poc sciences are taught    some universities reject colonial science and instead teachtribal sciences from native american tribes not a cultural or historical class about their beliefs but teaching that shot like rain dances work
  jp himself reactionary  for having the politics of a 90s democrat  i hate this board tbqh
  dude cultural marxism is not postmodernism
  further i claim that these differences in interaction with infants are not necessarily reduced by affirmative action policies or allowing women to be in the workplace
  see    they are very intertwined peterson isnt making shit up or dude he has no idea what hes talking about when he mentions how neo marxist post modernist are doing whacky things
  critical theory is based on a rejection of reason  not that anon but you seriously dont know what critical theory please stop
      its a straight up conspiracy theory anon the enlightenment is based on the use of reason to build grand systems and this is exactly what the frankfurt school did through marxism on the other hand postmodernism is a rejection of this and consequently postmodernists also reject critical theory one of the big arguments in philosophy departments today is between postmodernists and critical theorists although postmodernism is kind of going out of fashion
  maybe instead of watching conspiracy theory videos by people who have no idea what theyre talking about you should do the intelligent thing and engage with what youre criticizing by i dont know actually reading a single page from any of their books
  conspiracy theory videos  its the president of wesleyan university discussing it maybe instead of being an arrogant pseudo intellectual little shit you should at least look at the thumbnail of the video before commenting on it and dismissing it
  oh great some faggot repeating you dont understand it like a mantra over and over again
  maybe instead of being an arrogant pseudo intellectual little shit you should at least look at the wikipedia article of what youre criticizing before commenting on it and dismissing it
  its a valid critique when you dont understand something
  so youre just going to ignore the fact that you look like a jackass for calling an actual academic who know more than you on this topic a conspiracy theorist       you dont know what it is though which is why you never actually comment on it
  academics can be conspiracy theorists they are not mutually exclusive    and you have any idea what it is what have you read from critical theory champ
  i have a better idea how about you explain the connection rather than relying on someone else to do your arguing for you you wouldnt happen to be that jp fanboy whos constantly cyberbullied here would you
    you cant just keep denying reality and making asses of yourselves anon you also dont really have any place to call others conspiracy theorist when you believe in the white male conspiracy theory
  i dont believe in the white male conspiracy theory and neither is it a cornerstone of critical theory and as it so happens neither does it have anything to do with postmodernism
  yes it is anon thats the core of intersectionality its so odd how pathological and worked up you get over a school of thought you know nothing about
    not that id expect you to know any of that because evidently you havent read a single book in your entire life
  critical theory is not intersectionality theres a gigantic post about this earlier up and you could figure this out with a cursory googling
  intersectionality literally derived from critical theory whats shock the guy who can only say you dont even understand critical theory over and over again has no idea what hes talking about
  yeah its derived from it but you cant say critical theory endorses the white male conspiracy theory because one of its derivatives does
  yes it does since thats a logical conclusion from its basis of power structures in society and how they oppress people     critical theory is paranoid retarded anti science dogshit and your apologetics for it are awful this is to be expected since the entire apologetics for it is just to deplatform everyone and since you dont have the power to do that all you can do is impotently sputter and shitpost
  im not making apologetics for it you just straight up dont understand everything and just believe every philosophy you disagree with is the exact same thing postmodernism critical theory and intersectionality are different philosophies which have had conflicts and influences among each other but there is a reason they have different names because they are different things    critical theory has a specific emphasis on the class dynamic as the dynamic by which people are oppressed    intersectionality basically claims that every other dynamic is more important    and postmodernism has basically nothing to do with any of this and is not really about oppression
  youre horrible at this anon intersectionality isnt some separate ideology its literally the logical conclusion of the oppressed oppressor power structure meme certificate theory established they both are heavily influenced by post mods too i linked you to a video to explain this more and not some random youtube eceleb but an actual academic the president of wesleyan university and you wrote it off as omg a conspiracy theory like a child keep assuming this bullshit gaslighting will work and see how that works out for you you are stormfag tier i hope you realize that
  they have two separate conclusions    critical theorists reach the conclusion that race and gender oppression are secondary or only a product of class oppression for marxists if we solve class oppression we solve oppression    intersectionalists disagree with critical theorists they think class oppression is secondary to race and gender oppression the main way people are discriminated against is on the basis of social constructs apart from class to claim that class is the primary axis of oppression is for them to downplay the struggles of other oppressed groups    postmodernism on the other hand which can be distinguished from these two theories which are both modernist claim a whole bunch of stuff almost none of which is relevant to oppression deleuze makes a bunch of claims about metaphysics to counter kant and hegel foucault claims that the way science operates is determined by the society youre in and also that what madness is is decided by the society and isnt necessarily inherent deleuze claims that it is impossible to really know what stuff means and baudrillard claims that the media and culture is basically just a representation of itself
  sorry should be derrida after foucault
  the ones were talking about in this thread
  no postmodernist does this because postmodernism is a rejection of grand narratives in history and the idea that history is a linear progression is a grand narrative
  you could not name a single postmodernist who believes history is a linear progression from primitive to ideal
  why does it matter who had a harder time
  cultural marxism was developed by the likes of adorno horkheimer and marcuse  i thought there was no such thing as cultural marxism
  its not a word they use but you could use it to describe them because they in some ways extend marxs analysis to be more rigorous with respect to culture critical theory is the more correct word i think
  you could not name a single postmodernist who believes history is a linear progression from primitive to ideal  sure i can frank down at the coffee shop
  im not sure if this is intended to be in any way a counter
i shall declare this day the grand day of the peterson
sniff yep ill have to make a new one
goes from 98 white in 1900 to 44 in 2010    what went wrong
  jews
  italians and 
  hard to believe that degenetate shithole looked like this
  they dont count as white if theyre not wasp dutch knickerbockers and french huguenots are practically wasps too
  the great migration
  italians poles jews white
  yes
  isnt new york pretty safe these days the crime rate is down at an all time low i thought
  niggers
  wrong  are you trying to imply something anon
and it was 90 anglo/dutch in 1800 things change
  avoid the bronx
  that doesnt mean it isnt a disgusting filthy shit hole that doesnt feel anything like america
white got outbred by immigrant groups not to mention white phenotypes are often highly recessive reminder that op is a faggot    hurr what happen to the indians
  what cities do feel like america
  what flyer over state are you from anon
  ny is a honkie majority state though
  yea it is manhattan is too loud and smells as it always has but the city seems pretty nice these days   t was there in july
  nothing  new york is the world financial capital and crime rate is at the lowest it has been in nearly a century
  what cities are america then anon
  did you even look at the picture you posted nyc has always been filthy just compare how it was 35 years ago
  nothing at all     it was a shitpile then its a shitpile now
  im from a city of more than 600000 which is almost just as bad as nyc
  looks pretty clean other than the horses brapping and a couple of puddles
  all states besides like mississippi alabamba louisiana were majority white anon
  what went wrong  jim crow laws and the black exodus    due to increasing work shortage and racial tension and discrimination alot of black americans left the south and moved into the larger cities
  none of the big ones
  98 white in 1900  1 lets see your source on this i highly doubt it since new york has always had a large black community going back to its dutch colonial days  2 what you define as white would probably not have been considered as such in 1900
  yea bro i miss the days of living in tenements with the boys
    huntsville nashville boise denver memphis buffalo raleigh etc
  ny shouldnt have allowed them in to begin with
  why
  at least they would be of your own people
  1 why  2 by what right would they have to deny them
  because niggas are loud and stupid
  because theyre filled with real americans not a bunch of hyphenated traitors in waiting
  1 quantify this statement  2 explain why this is justification to deny citizens the right of free movement  3 explain what nys legal justification would be to do this as it is a clear violation of the 14th amendment
  true but capitalizing words for emphasis just makes you seem like you have aspergers
  well id write them in bold or underline them but i cant here
  independence obviously
  1 go on the train and listen to how fucking loud they are  2 because nig nogs are annoying  3 who cares lmao
  be pole   move into tenement populated by irish italians and creepy grmans
  a high level of discourse is expected
  reeks of literal piss and shit and garbage all the time
  oh an intellectual
  at least they would be of your own people    people seperate into the groups regardless of race if it wasnt italians vs irish it would be belfast irish against dublin irish if not that it would be neighborhoods vs neighborhods and if not that families againts families     if theres poverty and squalor people will fuck each other over regardless
  some advice anon liberally underlining or bolding words ouside of grammatical/mathematical use in a paper or essay or anything that is supposed to be persuasive doesnt help
  has that changed
  but its fun and makes me feel like a total badass like im really giving you the business you know
  1 get on the train with a nig  2 he look up at me i at him  3 he puts on headphones  4 nothing happens cause im not retarded
  it has not
  yes the streets are literally cleaner than the were 40 30 years ago or so
  youve never been to nyc and/or are very young
  they always start squawking at each other and blasting rap music
  nyc used to be brazil tier until giulianni  the fbi crushed the gangs and mafia     times square is fucking disneyland now
  i dont believe you ever lived around a shitton of black people
  explain what nys legal justification would be to do this as it is a clear violation of the 14th amendment  implying the reconstruction amendments have any legitimacy  implying the us government had any legitimacy after 1861 when it ceased to be a white mans government
  my city is literally 50 black
        reported  saged
  tough guy
  what are real americans anon
  1 the noise you think modern cities are loud horse carts are even louder then you have 15 000 horses and carts in the street and the noise is deafening    2 horses shit alot the cities had entire armies of street sweepers whos task it was to pick up horse droppings which they didnt drop far outside the city and the smell would usually carry with the wind back to the city    3 horses freak out and run off on a rampage through crowds of people happened alot    4 less efficient sewers    5 few buildings had plumbing and indoor bathroom facilities people dumped their night pots right out the window into the street    unless you lived in the richest part of the city or in the middle of a business district shit would probably be filthy and smelly as fuck
  excellent rebuttal
  dude the constitution doesnt matter  gash your wrists
  piss off kike
  lol this cuck thinks niggers need a reason to fuck with you
  based and redpilled
  forgot my pic  nyc 1900    might dump some more
  blacks are primitives
  look at these white apes they ruin every country they go to
  shut up african monkey
  the constitution is the law of the land state and municipal governments are bound to obey it
  this
  lived around blacks my whole life never been fucked with and you
  dont forget that factories were built right in the middle of residential areas so the workers wouldnt have to waste time going from home to work and therefore could work longer hours this was what eventually prompted the creation of zoning laws and city planning as we understand it today
  according to the constitution itself which he rejects so what is your point
  yeah especially considering its size its quite safe
  he isnt an american
  that his argument has no merit because we were talking about the governments of ny and nyc not some random racist anarchist on 4chan
  not to mention that you had familes of 1015 people living in apartments meant for 4 in most of the cases    and garbage disposal forget about it
  you should be grateful nyc represents america it paints a far better picture for the country than some flyover state shittier city like lincoln or billings do
  you bullied by a black kid or something in high school
  look at this jolly looking motherfucker
  people meme about the irish destroying america but the second they got in and had enough population to outvote the natives in certain districts they did everything they could to get more immigration for the sole purpose of replacing the native english americans
  the post youre quoting answers that question
  fucking unit
  he looks like someone id vent to at the bar
  such beauty such civilization
  we arent memeing its forreal anon the irish are always used as the example of but they assimilated so the hispanics will too bastards fucked us beyond all salvation
  ill teach you a lesson you little snot nosed unamerican punk
  definitely better than some shitty midwestern city that has ugly buildings all younger than my grandma and with massive roads and atomized suburbs
  only foreigners give a shit about timesquare
  solid infrastructure   uptodate technology  abundant transportation  variety of consumables  financial powerhouse  employment opportunities   global connections  towering edifices a testament to human accomplishment   diverse yet relatively harmonious population  yes
    america is arguably the most mickd nation on the planet several of your nations founders were irish the father of your navy was irish several commanders during your war of independence were irish irish served with distinction on both sides during the american civil war and st patricks day is the only celebration in america thats just about as big as the 4th of julyyour national holiday  well and truly paddyd

  goes from 100 native american in 1624 to 100 white in 1625    what went wrong
  earplugs faggot
  yeah those years before 1624 really went wrong
  urbanite technocratic whtoids overpowered the noble indians
  public transport is shit in nyc like the rest of america
  thats not what i said though of course plenty of people go to ts but its not even near what the average new yorker has to endure everyday    also  going to any store over there  did your parents want to spend 2x the price for toys though i admit that the store used to be nice for kids my parents brought me there once but didnt buy anything just let me play around
  the only correct answer is 1965
these little town blues  are melting away  ill make a brand new start of it  in old new york
  english americans made up 25 of the entire population by far the largest ethnic group before an american ethnicity was introduced in 2000 thats not even counting scotsscots irish and welsh who are practically the same people plenty of us still here
  if 75 of your country is only visiting i dont think theyre only visiting
  nigga nyc was just as ethnically diverse as it is today the only thing you had in common with them was having a european phenotype
  is  ought
  you take it for granted
  they can think what they want when you showcase loyalty to a foreign nation youre not a real american
  all of those cities sound like boring shitholes lol
  ellis island mongrel
  what foreign nation
  part of the beauty of america any one can be an american the only prerequisite is you have to love it
  desu the only ones that can claim the title of true americans are the natives
  paul jones was scottish you fucking mong not a mick
  nice lies any honkie that has lived with negros has been enriched by them
  scottish are basically wasps too they only started that oppressed celt larping shit after braveheart came out
  shit taste hick new england is true america
  i dont even know what youre trying to say     no
  still waiting for a source on these statistics
works  everyone hates it    why
  because capitalists get paid less so they pressure the government to implement policies increasing unemployment to drive down wages and cut social programs so workers have more pressure to work in inhumane conditions furthermore the welfare state needs money to support it so without a welfare state you can cut taxes on the rich
  in anglo states we have a oh you silly you arent actually supposed to use it mentality and funding cuts of social programs     in my city its literally impossible to get the discounted monthly bus passes for low income families or individuals
  thanks to the welfare state the world is much much poorer than it would be with open low tax economies that is a fact
  youre gonna need citations to make a claim to a fact
  wow seriously even in the uk and au thought that was a us thing
  misesorg  econliborg  feeorg    hope i didnt forget any
  ah no citations very good to see
  kind of a tragedy of the commons where the commons are the citizens none of the corps want to pay taxes but they all want consumers and competent employees
  its painfully obvious just look at how much the chinese economy grew since neoliberalism took over the world had developed countries closed their economies to protect jobs all that growth wouldnt have happened and the world would be much poorer
  china is hardly a neolib country
    because people only want the welfare to be for themselves and people like them
  everything is obvious in austrian fantasy economics world thats why it doesnt work and nobody takes it seriously
  wow people want welfare to go to the poor and not the rich
  implying the economy cant be modeled as a perfectly rational mathematic equation
  why cant every country just be like meme country that is successful due to factors that few other countries share
  chinas growth wasnt because of its government it was because of foreign investment and consumers which wouldnt have arrived without neoliberalism
  you can build simple models of everything but their predictive power wont be so good
  thats why it doesnt work and nobody takes it seriously    implying neoliberalism and free trade havent lift out of poverty billions in asia how fucking stupid you have to be
  or because china was recognized by the united states allowing americans to invest in china while simultaneously chinas economy was being liberalized to allow foreign investment
  what does any of that have to do with problems back home welfare concerns the local economy
  works  tell that to every ghetto in the usa
  welfare is funded by taxes taxes reduce the amount of money citizens can invest less investment reaches where its really needed poor countries with high growth potential the world ends up poorer as a whole
just eliminate the welfare state and let people who cant compete in the free market starve what could go wrong lol
  less investment reaches where its really needed poor countries     lol no sorry you cannot play this crafty game with me nobody elect their government to take care of some random third worlders what a dishonest argument disgusting bunch of people
  the next thing coming out of your mouth is going to be trickledown economics isnt it
  implying starvation of whites existed in the usa prior to welfare
  denying history on a history board
  i posted objective fact
  john f kennedy stated the purpose of the war on poverty to be to help our less fortunate citizens to help themselves2 he said we must find ways of returning far more of our dependent people to independence3 the whole point of currently increased federal spending on this effort was to strengthen and broaden the rehabilitative and preventive services offered to persons who are dependent or who would otherwise become dependent so that longrun savings in government spending were expected from a subsequent decline in dependency as president kennedy put it  public welfare in short must be more than a salvage operation picking up the debris from the wreckage of human lives its emphasis must be directed increasingly toward prevention and rehabilitationon reducing not only the longrange cost in budgetary terms but the longrange cost in human terms as well4    the congressional quarterly of the same date february 2 1962 likewise reported the president stressed that the welfare program should be directed toward the prevention of dependence and the rehabilitation of current relief recipients6  the same theme carried over into the johnson administration where the antipoverty program was sold as a way to break the cycle of poverty and to make taxpayers out of taxeaters7 give a hand not a handout was the slogan of the war on poverty in keeping with that theme president johnson said in august 1964 when the legislation was finally passed the days of the dole in our country are numbered8 this initial thrust of the war on poverty programs must be clearly recognized at the outset for one of many responses to the failures of government programs has been to redefine their goals after the fact to make the programs look successful  a subsidiary theme of the war on poverty was that social programs were a way of heading off urban violence lyndon johnson spoke of conditions that breed despair and violence
  despite initial claims that various government services would lead to reduced federal outlays on welfare programs as more people became selfsufficient the very opposite happened the number of people receiving public assistance more than doubled from 1960 to 1977 the dollar value of public housing rose nearly fivefold in a decade and the amount spent on food stamps rose more than tenfold all governmentprovided inkind benefits increased about eightfold from 1965 to 1969 and more than 20fold by 1974 federal spending on such social welfare programs not only rose in dollar terms and in real terms but also a percentage of the nations gross national product going from 8 percent of gnp in 1960 to 16 percent by 197425  as for urban ghetto riots they raged across the country during this era later they declined sharply after the beginning of the nixon administration which opposed the whole war on poverty approach and eventually abolished the office of economic opportunity which had been the spearhead of this program still later during the eight years of the reagan presidencysupposedly the nadir of neglectmajor urban riots became virtually extinct the fact that the actual course of events followed a pattern diametrically the opposite of what was assumed and proclaimed by those with the vision of the anointed made not the slightest dent in the policies they advocated or in the assumptions behind those policies   stage 4 the response the failure of the war on poverty to achieve its goal of reducing dependencyand in fact an increasing dependency as these policies went into effectbrought no acknowledgement of failure in the many retrospective evaluations of these programs in later years and decades most of their political and media proponents resolutely ignored the original goal of reducing dependency the goal was instead redefined as reducing poverty by transferring resources
  yes we just need to pay more taxes and we will get more competent employees and more educated citizens just keep spending more money eventually it will work
  its because they think its only ok if their group uses it
  not playing any game just putting the blame where it really belongs first world leftists are the reason there is so much poverty in third world countries neoliberalism and free trade have lifted billions out of poverty in the last 30 years and thats a fact
  cato  lol
  fuck off bill gates nobody cares about your mosquito nets youre still evil
  department of education  lol
  are you contesting the stats  or are you saying its not coming from a pro big government source so it should be dismissed without acknowledging of facts
  the facts are clear about who is the evil one causing so much poverty my evil retarded leftist friend
  dysgenics of the already shit poor class
  i dont read koch brothers propaganda mate if they had anything relevant to say they would be published academic economists in a respectable university not quacks getting paid by a think tank to push an agenda
works   
  it works
  facts are facts
  poverty is a symptom of capitalism but that is outside of the boundaries of this debate
  facts are facts and but you dont have any such facts
    isnt blindly attacking the source a logical fallacy
  i have presented facts about the increasing cost of education per pupil  do you have any evidence to the contrary
it works but only in places that are 99 white
  yes but we dont follow logical fallacies in real life if that were the case every academic would spend 100 of his time discrediting all the insane crap that crackpots come up with you have to have some legitimacy before you get taken seriously
  not from a reputable source
  the department of education isnt a valid source
  yeah there was absolutely no poverty before capitalism
  if you cannot find facts from a reputable source to counter mine i am presenting the correct information by default
  because it allows the most parasitic lumpen mentally and morally deformed elements of society to cling to their loathsome existences instead of dying in the gutter as would happen in any decent functioning system    trust funds and corporate stock accounts also serve the same purpose btw
  welfare measures and social programs work allover the world look at the massive gains made in the developing world
  care you give examples beyond public healthcare
  it clearly doesnt because its collapsing the capitalist classes are rolling back all their concessions
i think welfare is perfectly good in a closed system like milton said you can have open borders and no welfare state or closed borders and a welfare state you cant have both because the system cant support it
  also i should note that milton friedman was not against the idea of a welfare state in of itself he just believed that instead of the welfare programs we do have instead he thought we should have a higher bar for negative tax in other words you simply didnt pay taxes if you were below a certain income and he was in favor of making that minimum number higher than it currently is iirc he didnt think you should be paying taxes unless you were making at least near 100k a year
  true    politicians actors popartist etc they are all the most honorable and nonparasitic individuals of our society     kill yourself chronic retard
  politicians actors popartist etc they are all the most honorable and nonparasitic individuals of our society    this but unironically
  no it doesnt the moment number of beneficiaries exceeds ratio of number of people paying for it all by certain degree welfare state runs into massive problems huoltosuhde in finnish translate it yourself we are at about 72 of people working right now and that number includes people working on public sector actual number of people funding this all is below 50 let that sink in big topic here because our entire system is in deep shit now that boomers are retiring en masse and accepting thousands of unskilled third world migrants only made huoltosuhde worse to neoliberals/leftists amazement we are looking at numbers below 70 working and below 40 in private sector within some years
  shit i misread yeah theyre also fucking useless eaters too as am i for posting on 4chan
  what is pellagra among sharecroppers
  anon that woudl happen with or without the welfare state lol
    what i find super funny is that cato quadrupled romes spending on the closest thing it had to a welfare state and then libertarian dolts come along and name their think tanks after him
  humans also didnt live in concrete jungle hellholes where private entities all drunk on the individualism meme own all of the resources and land
  oh look its latestagecapitalism handicapable kid making entrance explain how
  unironic capitalist in the year of our lord 018  calls others handicapped
how about getting a job and not spending your money on frivolities
  i said explain how deep shit finland is in would have happened without welfare state everyone knows you fucks are completely retarded you dont have to demonstrate it anymore in every message
  appeal to space civilisation is one of the biggest signs of a brainlet
  im not that same person retard noone cares how badly you fucked up your noncountry ours work quite nicely by comparison maybe move somewhere where the fucking weather doesnt make you want to kill yourself and your cognitive faculties will repair themselves a little bit
  appeal to space civilisation is one of the biggest signs of a brainlet
  no
  unironic latestagecapitalism socialist  interrupts conversation  starts pulling not same person in place where everyone is anonymous  calls person replying in good faith retard because no mind reading capabilities  calls anyone else retard in general despite self being unironic latestagecapitalism socialist and incapable of communicating in chans    just fuck off
  work to earn money  some of that money is taken away from you and given to people who did not earn it  you get nothing for this  how is this fair
  wanting to live in a society of stupid and sick people
  hurr durr if youre not a socialist youre a capitalist  replying in good faith while slinging around insults  good lord how do you have enough brain cells to use a keyboard
  without the welfare state the west would of fallen to communism and thats a fact
  welfare is communism the west is dead
  lower taxes for the rich by and large do not encourage spending consumption narrows because you have a smaller slice of people with disposable income in fact in the us food stamps provide something like 180 returns to stimulus for each dollar spent because of this although it would plateau at a point if such a trend were so generous that employment dropped    lacking welfare also means the poor are more likely to commit crime to make ends meet or have health problems in the future which reduces their potential to reenter the labor force and costs society money on law enforcement and healthcare you can privatize healthcare entirely but that just leads to debt becoming a major social problem
  not him but i agree there will never be a space age its reddit tier bullshit fantasy from the hangover of russian cosmicism the most we could achieve is a colony in the solar system but even then theres no way terraforming another planet would be easier than geoengineering earth ftl is impossible there have been crackpots trying to prove it could fork for a century and it just doesnt physics is a house of cards and even theoretically justifying something like that goes against all we know not only about science but causality itself and is inconsistent with absolutely everything we observe about the universe time to take your head out of the clouds stormfag spacebabby
  this is unironically the correct approach weed out the retards and unlucky
  considering the economy is literally based off irrational drives to consume things people dont need manipulated for the irrational desire to earn more wealth the answer is no no it cant
  monarchs invent welfare state  monarch has state enterprises  monarchy is literally capitalism
  i mean literally communism
  welfare is communism  this is unironically a good thing
    tldr
  wagies
  and it would unironically be a good thing
  rome was communist
  that moment you realize that capitalism is built on random chance  not even talking about welfare even businesses are often made or broke due to random chance this whole idea that the best businesses survive and the worst die off is just an approximation
  provide examples
  myspace vs facebook
  psychadelic prohibition
not scared of a little mushroom and a flower or two are ya
  people who made money off bitcoin all their predictions about what bitcoin was going to be were wrong yet bitcoin went up but for completely different reasons they made money despite being 100 wrong
  i refuse to believe that this wasnt made as a false flag to expose the complete and total ignorance of history shared by all stormshills    soviet space age futurism  russian cosmism  
  its not about being fair its about helping the people around you which in turn benefits you think of it as an investment if the people around you have their basic needs met they will probably be less likely to commit crime and steal what they need for basic survival improving everyones health wellbeing and living standards benefits the society
  how is that luck myspace was ugly and not nearly as well integrated as facebook despite having a firstmover advantage they lost fair and square    first off bitcoin isnt really a business per se but even if it is its still moving along despite being in the depths of a bubble crash youre right that getting into a speculative bubble is a matter of luck but thats totally different
  sounds like its anglid thing
  damn bismarck that fucking communist shit
  is this critique of capitalism or critique of welfare state
    facebook is very boring and corporate compared to old school myspace
  oh no no no
  based
  turns out that trying your hand at colonialism wasnt such a good idea aftr all    and turns out that you need to spend good money to create an actual market and not just a frankensteins monster of starving medieval serfs and lumpenproletariat
    some jobs do require formal education and credentials that isnt to say that all courses should be public expenses or that credential inflation isnt a problem
  you didnt read the sources provided even if you distrust the cato institute you can see they took their intel from sources you likely respect
  welfare state   works    capitalism does not work
  i have presented facts about the increasing cost of education per pupil  not him but do you think the graph really says anything those scores are constatnly readjusted wages grow equipment grows more complex pupils might spend different amount of time doing school or homework the study is done on single country buildings are more expensive et cetera     while i agree merely throwing more and more resources at a problem wont solve it but this graph is practically meaningless
  welfare bad  d
  if they have anything worth saying they can publish it and have it peer reviewed the academic process exists for a reason only crackpots and propagandists have to publish on their own websites because they are publishing hogwash this is just basic common sense
why do americans love giving their tax money to the rich but get triggered by using it to help the poor  it doesnt take many brain cells to see why your countrys poor are one of the best investments a government can make
  its open to review more and more academics are going for open research because a you can reach the broader peerage if you bypass the journal subscription barrier and b peer review journals are increasingly less respected on account that a few orgs control most of them some get paid by the applicants to get publish and zoltan and others have shown that the prepublishing review process is lacking to say the least
  decades of propaganda
  part of american culture is trying to climb up the ladder keeping up with the jonesetc   the notion is inherently competitive and americans want other americans to be worst than them thus the lower class votes against welfare because they dont want poorer lower class people from catching up with them
  the rich are white the poor are not
  tfw the cold war was just a communist civil war
lmaoing  people posting individual cases of someone abusing the welfare system as some sort of proof that it doesnt work when the people in question are one in ten millions
    the answer to that is plain and simple there are too many people who take advantage of the welfare program to live on state assistance instead of using it as a tool to aid in social mobility     you have certain subsections of the population that are perfectly content living on government assistance because its a natural human reaction to go for whats easy starvation or the threat of it is the best way to get people off their ass and do something with their lives
  are you born to middle class parents
    let me guess youre asking that question so you can try to make a point to me that my middle class life means that im unable to relate to those in poverty well bad news for you is that i came from a third world county and my family came to the us with nothing but the clothes on our backs and what we could carry and not once did my family ever get on government assistance my parents worked hard in their careers scrimped and saved to eek out a middle class lifestyle     people who were born in a first world country like the us lucked out they have all these opportunities that they were born to that people back in my country could only dream of so the poor here have no fucking excuse whatsoever
  go to work every day  get paid  have to drive a car every day to work and waste my paycheck on gas/repairs because public transit isnt funded  have to avoid certain parts of town because everyone is too poor/sick to work because their neighborhoods are falling apart and underinvested  have to pay  for my kids university tuition or otherwise make him indebted for life because education isnt funded  have to pay  at the hospital because we dont have socially funded medicine  at the end of the day im broke but at least i got a tax break 
  third world middle class  even worst even more unable to relate you are wealthier than pretty much all the lower class yet you come here and you presume that just because you were originally from a shithole country that means that everyone in the us is automatically richer than you
  because its bankrupted the richest countries on earth during the most prosperous period in history while delivering basically no tangible returns giving money to the poor is basically the same thing as piling it up and burning it     for the amount americans spends on entitlement programs in a single year they could rebuild their entire national highway system fund every moon mission in history and still have enough left over to build a monument on the scale of notre dame de paris in every state in the union but instead that money goes to supporting a growing population of useless eaters who only serve to turn cities into overcrowded ghettos and fill once beautiful suburbs with sprawling trailer parks and squalid apartment blocks
  one in ten millions  this is how i know you didnt grow up around poor people
  people cheat welfare  lets dismantle all welfare  people cheat in capitalism      wage theft is the most prevalent form of theft by a huge huge margin should we abolish private enterprise
    that means that everyone in the us is automatically richer than you    thats because they are poverty and economic status is completely relative to a geographic region objectively the us is wealthier than most nations in the world and the average american live a higher quality lifestyle compared to the average person anywhere on the planet yes even the american poor    for every sob poverty story i hear amongst americans theres always a tired excuse that follows the most common excuses are lack of motivation and being irresponsible with personal finances the only acceptable reasons to be poor and on government assistance is if you have poor health mental disabilities and/or physical disabilities that prevent you from working the rest are just bullshit excuses
  because it doesnt help the poor  they react to incentives and have their lives made worse off  
  we need to reform our police system because of 1 in a million shootings  we need to reform our immigration system because of 1 in a million immigrants  what people reacting to welfare negatively those are one in a million and should be ignored
  crime that can only be blamed on capitalism is the kind of crime that actually pays since the only measure of utility in capitalism is profitability crime that pays is a good thing for capitalism therefore the system is working as designed and you have nothing at all to complain about
  how much was stolen from companies in the form of not repaying loans and bankruptcy
  companies default on their loans and use bankrupcy to protect their assets from lenders all the time debtor companies dont have the same obligations as debtor individuals and lots of their execs which are responsible for burning cash get away for free because of limited liability afforded by the companys name    why are you even trying to downplay the problem that is wage theft breach of contract is just bad business ethics and the fact that the gov and the courts dont do more to put the screws to fraudulent employers should make any honest merchants blood boil
  let me guess youre some sort of third world latin american/european monkey who looks down on the us while secretly envying them
  sure its a problem with corporations as well  wage theft is a problem taking out loans and not paying them back is equally or more of a problem  taking out a loan for 10000 and saying you will pay it back and not paying it back is obviously a problem
  lol thomas sowell
  you know a fucking of rural people are on welfare
  wage theft is essentially the same problem you promisse to pay someone for x x gets done the payment doesnt happen we dont call it debt but that is what wage theft is
    refute him
  giving money to the rich doesnt help them any more than giving money to the poor helps them which is what the person you are responding to is claiming
  the cost of someone abusing welfare benefits is minor and pretty much unnoticeable to you a taxpayer the cost of police brutality is much higher this is a stupid argument also police misconduct is much more common than that
  yeah those fucking swedes colonizing half of africa and sandniggistan
  i agree  lets compare stats for the source you provided is it using global estimated wage theft or within the continental us  i need to clarify this before providing countering information
  how is money given to the rich
  is it  i never got shot by a cop nor has anyone i known have nobody i known has been beaten by police either  how does it effect me that trayvon martin or martin brown got shot
  it needs to be hated to work otherwise wed have tons of dole bludgers
    it encourages low iq freaks to breed without care its a heavy drain on the economy and it is also currently being used as a wealth redistribution scheme in the west favouring government officials big capital and the underclass at the expense of hard working citizens
  it sows distrust in the justice system which leads to resentment and disassociation within the community affected black community in those cases which means people less likely to call the police cooperate with them which means more crime goes unpunished which means a greater chance that criminality could affect you also trayvon martin was shot by a private citizen not a cop    it also helps if you arent a sociopath  lol not me dont matter  injustice is injustice and human empathy behooves you to care you chose two bad examples there since those 2 guys kinda earned their fate while tamir rice philando castile the thanksgiving ccw mall guy baltimore rough ride and the nyc cigarette seller guy would have been better examples or that guy whose car broke down on a florida highway then was shot by an off duty cop in the back for no reason every one of these things rows resentment and distrust in the system which can come back to bite ordinary people like you in the ass but it shouldnt have to hurt you personally for you to care if your argument that it doesnt affect me personally means you can ignore stuff like this dont even pretend for a second you have the right to complain about injustices for groups of people you actually care about despite you not being one of them
  thats such a shitty backasswards mentality no one britain is such a shithole
    its backward because people dont want to give you neet bucks and support your unproductive lifestyle healthy and capable people on welfare are social and economic parasites shaming the fuck out of welfare recipients is the best way to discourage welfare abuse
  its backward because people dont want to give you neet bucks and support your unproductive lifestyle  the problem is that in basically all statistical reports the actual dole bludgers make up at best 5 of the people on welfare everyone else is surprisingly people actually using it to make ends meet while they look for work / get assistance whilst studying / actually buy food despite being in a wheelchair/having cancer/breaking three limbs    shaming the fuck out of welfare recipients is the best way to discourage welfare abuse  no its not shame is an awful strategy full stop thats just your own inner pathos being directed at undeserving victims maybe if i make fun of people on government handouts ill be able to ignore that im just one major calamity away from being one of them
  this  but without the edge  a nice person will say its not your fault and enable your selfdestructive behavior a kind person will scold you for them having to support your ass
  and yet a kind person will never scold corporations for literally taking government money to support their meaningless profits people abuse welfare recipients because theyre cruel and greedy thats it
  a kind person maybe but not a kind person and they are out there and you wont find them if youre too scared of bumping into an asshole
  in what bizzaro world are assholes now kind people
  it encourages low iq freaks to breed without care  so what we need people to do the shitty jobs that nobody else is willing to do     its a heavy drain on the economy  nope the welfare state is good for the economy because it promotes consumerism the people who receive welfare money end up recycling it into the economy by spending it    it is also currently being used as a wealth redistribution scheme in the west  nothing wrong with that rich people have far too much money already its about time they paid their fair share
  one where being honest makes you an asshole
  theres a time and a place for honesty its like your kid being upset your dog just died and you just telling them all animals die stop whining about it you are technically being honest but youre also being a giant ass
  i heard in a study that naming any social program or welfare thing anything but using the word welfare they are much more receptive to it
    the problem is that in basically all statistical reports the actual dole bludgers make up at best 5 of the people on welfare    firstly thats clearly a number you pulled out of your ass because in the us that number is about 21 and welfare fraud is fairly widespread with people participating in welfare programs long after achieving financial stability secondly why are you so adamant that all types of social assistance be carried out by the state     no its not shame is an awful strategy full stop thats just your own inner pathos being directed at undeserving victims    shame is one of the best strategies for enforcing prosocial behaviors and discouraging antisocial behaviors that are harmful to the group and people who consider themselves victims are nothing more than selfpitying in a free society where you have choice and selfdetermination there are no victims the only people who can be considered victims are people who have medical problems and mental disabilities that prevent them from work any other reason is a bullshit tired excuse
    in life its sometimes necessary to be cruel in order to be kind kindness wont save the world but neither will cruelty both elements need each other to have a positive effect on the world as marcus aurelius points out people are made for one another
  shame is one of the best strategies for enforcing prosocial behaviors and discouraging antisocial behaviors that are harmful to the group    no it doesnt it never works on too of making any sort of dialogue impossible
  firstly thats clearly a number you pulled out of your ass because in the us that number is about 21 and welfare fraud is fairly widespread with people participating in welfare programs long after achieving financial stability    the threshold for financial stability is a meme by lowering what is considered poverty many nations like china have been able to inflate the number if people who have left poverty alongside the fact that many go back onto social assistance if fluctuate a ton on top of health issues affecting ones finances
  money and wealth needs to be recirculated even fucking adam smith thought that there should be something like a progressive inheritance/estate tax
  its theft
  in modern western countries governments are mostly democratic which means they ostensibly represent the will of the people insomuch as anything actually belongs to you its because the law recognizes your ownership and that the people at large respect the law and thus respect your property for what it is thats what modern government is essentially the plebs accepting the wealth of their betters and living peacefully and according to the law so long as they get a tiny cut without that government the only thing keeping your property yours is your physical ability to keep it by violence if necessary    you want no taxes and no welfare go ahead but the plebs wont respect the systems that say whats yours is yours anymore taxes are a concession for public order and trust want riots and rebellion or would you prefer peace with your wallet just a bit lighter
  those scores are constatnly readjusted  correct tests have been made progressively easier in the last couple of years     wages grow  slower than inflation and the graph adjusts for inflation this doesnt help your argument     equipment grows more complex  yes and apparently its not helping     pupils might spend different amount of time doing school or homework  trends for time spent in school go up not down     the study is done on single country  thats a good thing they want to make a statement on us spending throwing in other countries serves no purpose     buildings are more expensive et cetera  buildings what the fuck am i reading
  stolen  thats not theft thats risk that the original agreement between lender and borrower accounted for
    recirculation of money  go to bed cenk
people who are against welfare are in some ways much more extremist than the fascists and the monarchists and the communists there is absolutely no reason to hold such banal and patently false ideas
  american poor are not wealthier than the middle class in third world countries neither in nominal nor relative terms
  trading freedom for security
  shut the fuck up
  american right wing propaganda
  so no real sources
  theyre really not
  theyre not collapsing  america is
  not true btw
  like milton said
  a century of anticommunist propaganda
  sowell doesnt understand economics  he is a cheerleader and uncle tom ass nigga
  taking out loans and not paying them back is equally or more of a problem  waaaaaaaaaaaah my interest payments im entitled to    gimmie money i didnt make or earn  its so much more of a crime and problem than stealing the wages of a worker
  thats false look up poverty reduction lie they moved the goal post
  i didnt provide any stats i entered the discussion midpoint
  implying absolute values are better than proportional values  the quickest way to end extreme poverty and hunger would be to let those people die assuming we dont want that the absolute number of people living in hell isnt as useful as the proportion of people living in hell because even if you do uplift a great number of people the ones left behind will still breed thus replenishing their numbers to some extent
  misesorg  econliborg  feeorg  ayylmao  fuck off brainlet
  lol 6000 years of history and reading becomes a secret power once again
because taxation is theft
  32
  the world is much much poorer t      makes no sense more people are alive today and happy because of the welfare state who cares that some rich porkies didnt have an extra million in their bank accounts
  i also hate it when niggers get my money but mark zuckerberg or jeff bezos dont get another billion to their bank accounts  how many shoes have you licked fellow /pol/bro
  implying neoliberalism and free trade havent lift out of poverty billions in asia      wrong    it was actually countries like south korea who rejected neoliberalism and protected their local industries that prospered     poorer countries who didnt have china protecting them like ghana tried to grow national industries but were fucked over by westernaided coups for free marketism which has perpetuated poverty in africa because the west keeps dumping cheap product on them to undercut local farmers and industry
  this is true just look at the stats of professionals making 6 figures living in rent controlled apartments  
  just to clarify the welfare state made countries rich neoliberalism has been a disaster    pic is the world bank report from 2000 where they admitted poverty was growing except in the following years they didnt why because they changed the fucking measurement of poverty and no one said anything
youautistic      socialismautism        own research all underlying mental illness is schizophrenia based on poorly wired endocannabinoid system no dudeweedlmao use
  what do you mean by recirculated do you mean that adam smith was against deflation that money was not being circulated as a result of deflation and it wasnt being spent or invested as you could get a return by holding it inside your mattress  thats obviously bad but you dont get an interest rate by storing it under your mattress but by storing it in a bank or stock or investment and that money does circulate
  yep
  was slavery wrong even if it was a policy passed by the people in a democratic republic and had public support
  because there is 0 national unity and identity
  i am against welfare i am for charity one is an entitlement and has no obligations and disconnects what you produce and what you consume breeds dependency and leads to criminality    the other builds a sense of obligation and uses shame to encourage positive change in behaviour it connects people to their community and family there is no virtue in taking money from other people and using it to buy political favors from your friends
  centralised states can facilitate charitygibs based on individualpersonalised caseoccurances
  or who knows it has a balance to rectify at the end level
  sk is in a problematic state since its economy hinges on several corporations near entirely and the growth and start up of new companies is heavily hurt by how the sk economy and culture is
  one is an entitlement and has no obligations and disconnects what you produce and what you consume breeds dependency and leads to criminality  i too am against capitalism
  individualistic society where capital is the highest ideal creates a sense of obligation and encourages a change in behaviour    yeah right fuck off mutt
  yeah so south korea is an example of where nonneoliberalism was very successful
  it connects people to their community and family    that is what the welfare state does the difference between private charity and welfare is that private charity means that the givers can distribute their money in a highly arbitrary fashion giving it certain types of people for example and excluding other now of course welfare stateism has an arbitrary component too but it is much more fairer and in things like healthcare and education does not discriminate
  how can the government facilitate it better  centralized charity isnt necessarily better charity
  what are you trying to say  what do you mean it has a balance at the end level
  the states existence is justified by the facilitation of the ends it was brought into existence to extract namely things like justice under the light of truth not being false flag compartmentalised into acts of injustice      economies of scale
middle class ends up paying for it because upper class controls the government and make sure they dont have to pay for it
  capitalism has no disconnect between what you produce and what you consume  doctors are producing more valuable services than shoe cobblers and therefore consume more because their product is more valuable  a corporation like airbnb has value as it takes a resource people already had and lets them utilize it in such a way they are able to come away with more money at the end of the month its value is as a platform in the same way its not useful to have oil underneath your property unless you have a way of tapping into it like through a drill it is not valuable to have an extra room in your house unless you have a way of tapping into it which airbnb provided  airbnb has unlocked a resource with billions and so the people who maintain the platform have a high rate of consumption most people at their headquarters make 6 figures
  youre kidding right
  40 of it is paid by the top 1 70 of it by the top 10  this is over half on social spending
people get their news from newspapers billionaires own the newspapers welfare state only harms the wealthy wealthy use newspapers to spread propaganda to people    why did people vote for brexit because the owner of the ritz millionaires and aristocrats told them it was for the best    sadly there are many who vote against their own interests they support the monarchy flat tax immigration bans brexit austerity and privatisation a because the right wing media says so     plump geese voting for christmas
  except that youre wrong the wealthy put the lowest proportion of their income and wealth back into local economies and are the most likely to tie it up in unspent capital if you give someone with little or no disposable income more money they will spend practically all of it locally if you want to make jobs make consumers theres also the fact that desperately poor people are far more likely to turn to criminal income sources which further drains the economy and ironically means that now those people arent paying tax on their drugs or stolen goods    im convinced that the majority of hurr tax and welfare is for commies posters collective historical knowledge goes back as far as about 1935 and is thread bare at that
  so the candidate that got 999 of newspaper endorsements in the 2016 election was the one wanted by billionaires  i guess donald trump won a true victory
  similar arguments were made in the 1960s        they failed their stated goal of reducing dependence and crime and instead had their goals changed retroactively to be about bettering the lives of the poor through wealth redistribution  why was it that there was crime waves after the introduction of welfare and not before  why was the single motherhood rate so much lower before welfare as opposed to after     the welfare state is the worst thing to happen to the poor since slavery
  no sources then
  where do the rich keep their money dipshit in banks which loan out to consumers and investors which stimulates the economy further through the multiplier effect as well as increasing the money supply by losing to other banks
  okay so lets look at the economies of scale when it comes to charity for the poor  we could look at ghana and the ivory coast or burma and thailand and their gdp after the introduction of centralized government  and not just food as like all other transactions it is a trade off we may get a new shirt instead of a steak and the introduction of these economies of scale without profit motive ends up in failure  not to say theres no roll for food banks there is something to be said about these affiliate networks      there was an interesting working paper about the introduction of a currency for food banks to increase the productivity of the market allowing them to facilitate trades and donations in a more efficient way even though no money was changing hands
  hillary and trump are both capitalists
  those nations i dont know about thailand had massive administrative issues form the start on top of history being a huge factor
  cant make a simple operation   capitalist shill  everything is correct here
  the welfare state is the worst thing to happen to the poor since slavery    social support and aid programs in ethiopia are doing a great job at reducing poverty on top of bettering the lives of its citizens hell in terms of poverty eradication and progress its doing lot better then india but india has its massive population regional dispraises inside the nation and its absurd bureaucracy
  why was the single motherhood rate so much lower before welfare as opposed to after    it was pretty high as fuck before women just reported their spouses as missing dead or other ways to avoid saying he isnt here it was never significantly lower prewelfare it was always large which is typical as fuck for poor populations where getting jobs is harder or the type of jobs pay shit
  what did you mean by this
  ghana had the same administrative problems at the start as the ivory coast  and yet when the ivory coast introduced socialist policies you can see what happened to the ability for people to buy food water and shelter
  ic is a literal thrall of france
  sure but the question is as opposed to what  and i would say that free market capitalism is the best way to reduce poverty there are people who are going to bed hungry in ethiopia tonight who would have full stomachs if there was an embrace of free market capitalism
implying human capital isnt capital  investing in food for a kid stopping them from starving allows them to work later on in life which is good by externality to the tax payers
  a poorly run welfare state made with the intent of keeping blacks down combined with state sponsored narcotics distribution was bad for blacks  no fucking shit retard
  i agree  now lets look at the efficacy of distribution  whether in france during the 1790s the soviet union after the bolshevik revolution or in newly independent african nations during the past generation governments have imposed artificially low prices on food in each case this led to artificially low supplies of food and artificially high levels of hunger  
  why place a price ceiling on food there are many other ways to distribute food to the poor that dont cause a shortage
  was that the intent of keeping blacks down  weve heard the lbj tapes he believed that it would help the blacks  you can always complain that welfare systems are poorly run as they welfare systems theyre always going to be benefiting some group more than another
  poverty is a symptom of capitalism
  okay you were using language like investing in food for a kid so i assumed you were talking about government intervention and not social institutions or private food banks
  a poorly run welfare state made with the intent of keeping blacks down    thats not true continued erosion of government programs by successive governments led to welfare not being as effective as it could be but it has helped poor americans allover the nation
  
  in newly independent african nations during the past generation    they didnt actually face food problems though that only occurred later with conflict when people cant commit to the buying and selling of food during the crisis
  and i would say that free market capitalism is the best way to reduce poverty    you actually cant rely on it also poverty stats are extremely prone to manipulation by china also ethiopia isnt a communist nation but it being more protective of its industries and actually helps it fmc is a myth because even if you actually adhere to it sure as hell no on else will    ethiopian social aid and assistance programs have made huge gains for the nation
  the data from the graph i posted uses the same metric to quantify poverty nice try commie
  if the government buys milk at or above the market price and distributes it to schools then kids get milk and producers arent disincentivised  or a subsidy could be given to milk producers to lower the price  or regulation could be passed to stop the watering down of milk to increase its nutritional value  point being there are many ways a government can intervene to get kids milk that dont involve fixing prices
  as of the time the war on poverty programs began the number of people who lived below the official poverty line had been declining continuously since 1960 and was only about half of what it had been in 1950 on the more fundamental issue of dependency the situation was even more clearly improving the proportion of people whose earnings put them below the poverty level without counting government benefits declined by about one third from 1950 to 1965 in short dependency on government transfers as a means of warding off poverty was declining when the war on poverty began  stage 2 the solution the economic opportunity act was passed in 1964 creating the office of economic opportunity the war on poverty agency as an historian of poverty programs put it congress was quick to buy a program that might help welfare wither away  stage 3 the results the percentage of people dependent upon the federal government to keep above the poverty line increased although the number of such dependent people had been declining for more than a decade before the war on poverty programs began this downward trend now reversed itself and began rising within a few years after that program got underway  official poverty continued its decline for some time   eventually however even official poverty began to rise so that a larger number of people were in poverty in 1992 than had been in poverty in 1964 when the war on poverty began   although the office of economic opportunity itself was modestly funded by government standards it was a spearhead a catalyst and to some extent a coordinator of antipoverty programs in other agencies as well overall federal spending on programs for the poor escalated as eligibility rules for welfare and social security were loosened the size of benefits was increased and unemployment insurance was made more available to more people and for longer periods of time22
whats wrong with leftists why do they want to ruin nice things
  glad you brought that up    if you want to see how government programs like the ones you suggested work out in reality look at the government subsidies on cheese
  the thing about poverty is that its relative according to the standard of living one is impoverished merely if they have much less than the average person in their society in that regard there will never not be poverty until you divide all wealth and property equally in all societies everywhere
  subsidies arent efficient but they are still better then price fixing in terms of a basic lost value equilibrium model  why are you pointing out singular possible measures for intervention and using that as a basis to call them all useless  you replied to a post calling you out for this by stating an ineffective example of an ineffective government intervention strategy
history proves that welfare was a huge success in literally every single country in which it was tried  dipshits still arguing about it
  the thing about poverty is that its relative according to the standard of living  no its not     one is impoverished merely if they have much less than the average person in their society   you dont die because mr goldberg has more money than you you die because you dont have enough money to buy food thats poverty
  32
  food costs the same amount in mr goldbergs neighbourhood as it does in vietnam  fuck off adults are talking
are there even any developed or developing countries that dont have a welfare state i dont think that is even possible its a fundamental of modern capitalism
  im sorry kid i forgot to mention that the statistics above are adjusted by purchasing power so that buying a piece of bread in vietnam or mr goldbergs neighborhood costs the same thats what the ppp from the chart means
  just checked there are none this is such a stupid discussion its like debating whether or not a car needs a suspension system sure it might still work without it but it wont be a great ride
  well now i feel bad for not scrolling to the top of the comment chain  relative vs absolute poverty is a thing though
  switzerland has a minor welfare amount but has tied this with free market principals such as no state provided healthcare no minimum wage and denying welfare recepients from obtaining citizenship until they pay it all back  
  okay then let me change my response  what i mean to say is you cannot get something for nothing  the federal government could make a rolls royce affordable for every american but we would not be a richer country as a result we would in fact be a much poorer country because of all the vast resources transferred from other economic activities to subsidize an extravagant luxury  of course it might be nice to be sitting at the wheel of a rolls royce but we might be sitting there in rags and tatters and gaunt with hunger after having squandered enormous amounts of labor capital and costly materials that could have been put to better use elsewhere that doesnt happen in a market economy because most of us take one look at the price tag on a rolls royce and decide that it is time for another toyota  the very notion of making things affordable misses the key point of a market economy an economy exists to make tradeoffs and a market economy makes the terms of those tradeoffs plain with price tags representing the relative costs of producing different things to have politicians arbitrarily change the price tags so that prices no longer represent the real costs is to defeat the whole purpose  1/2
  what about basic necessities shouldnt they be a right  the idea certainly sounds nice but the very fact that we can seriously entertain such a notion as if we were god on the first day of creation instead of mortals constrained by the universe we find in place shows the utter unreality of failing to understand that we can only make choices among alternatives actually available  for society as a whole nothing comes as a right to which we are entitled even bare subsistence has to be producedand produced at a cost of heavy toil for much of human history  the only way anyone can have a right to something that has to be produced is to force someone else to produce it for him the more things are provided as rights the less the recipients have to work and the more others have to carry their load  that does not mean more goods are available than under ordinary market production but less to believe otherwise is to commit the rolls royce fallacy on a more mundane level  for the government to make some things more affordable is to make other things less affordableand to destroy peoples freedom to make their own tradeoffs as they see fit in the light of economic realities rather than political visions tradeoffs remain inescapable whether they are made through a market or through politics the difference is that price tags present all the tradeoffs simultaneously while political affordability policies arbitrarily fix on whatever is hot at the moment that is why cities have been financing all kinds of boondoggles for years while their bridges rusted and their roadways crumbled  2/2
  no state provided healthcare    brah they force all their private insurance guys to offer a base healthcare plan that is all the same between companies its basically state healthcare    no min wage but they have real unions
    i appreciate you writing out this novel took more effort then the rest of the lolbertarians in this thread combined  comparing a luxury car to basic necessities of life is in my view a false equivalency you are correct in an absolute sense that redistribution would lose value from the market but in my view raw value is not as important as the consumer utility the utility from mr goldberg buying a 100000 luxury car would not be the same as the utility from 100000 worth of bread for the starving  this is then ultimately a question of morals and ethics not economics
  relative poverty  aka inequality aka not poverty      chile has a welfare state but its privately funded or something like that
  in 1776 adam smith in the wealth of nations argued that poverty is the inability to afford not only the commodities which are indispensably necessary for the support of life but whatever the custom of the country renders it indecent for creditable people even of the lowest order to be without    imagine being btfo by your own holy bookyikes
    suppose instead that the rich wanted the same things that everybody else wanted what if bill gates developed a fetish for meat and potatoes and spent ten or twenty billion dollars collecting vast amounts of meat and potatoes in refrigerated warehouses this would deprive many working families across  america of food and drive up the price to others the more far out and offthewall the purchases of the rich are the less anybody else is deprived when some rare stamp or antique piece of furniture is auctioned off for a small fortune at sothebys it is no skin off anybody elses nose mr goldberg buying a luxury car is similar if not the same as it doesnt use up resources that would be consumed by the poor just human capital
  but the government could tax that 100k from mr goldberg and accounting for inefficiencies could get 90k for the starving
  your own holy book  dont put words in my mouth   the only true prophet was milton friedman   stupid commie     also that definition of poverty is not the same as yours and is compatible with mine internet access being an example where i and smith would agree is something that determines if someone is poor or not
    youre talking about income distribution and apportioning his income to the poor   money is not apportioned at all it becomes income through an entirely different process  the very phrase income distribution is tendentious it starts the economic story in the middle with a body of income or wealth existing somehow leaving only the question as to how that income or wealth is to be distributed in the real world the situation is quite different in a market economy most people receive income as a result of what they produce supplying other people with some goods or services that those people want even if that service is only labour each recipient of these goods and services pays according to the value which that particular recipient puts on what is received choosing among alternative suppliers to find the best combination of price and qualityboth as judged by the individual who is paying  this mundane utilitarian process is quite different from the vision of income distribution projected by those among the intelligentsia who invest that vision with moral angst if there really were some preexisting body of income or wealth produced somehow like mana from heaven then there would of course be a moral question as to how large a share each member of society should receive but wealth is produced it does not just exist somehow where millions of individuals are paid according to how much what they produce is valued subjectively by millions of other individuals it is not at all clear on what basis third parties could say that some goods or services are overvalued or undervalued that cooking should be valued more or carpentry should be valued less for example much less that not working at all is not rewarded enough compared to working  nor is there anything mysterious in the fact that at least a thousand times as many people would pay to hear taylor swift sing as would pay to hear the average person sing
    thats complete nonsense the welfare state does the exact opposite it disconnects people from their community and places their social safety net in the hands of the state therefore theres no incentive for individuals to act on good faith with towards their community because regardless of their actions they will still be taken care of by faceless bureaucrats
    exactly the welfare state as a concept feeds into the selfish desires of people far worst than capitalism as a system         hes right read some de tocqueville
      the fuck is this shit
welfare state doesnt work
    conservatives always think that people can be perfected and that all it would take is the right kind of environment to produce a population that would never require welfare they believe the proper place for the government is to ensure people dont need welfare and not to waste too much money on welfare itself in the meantime     liberals tend to think that human nature is human nature and humans cant operate at peak efficiency at all times and humans cant recover from all problems without any help and so welfare is a necessary function of the government
  verbal garbage especially considering who fucking started implementing welfare lol
    who started implementing welfare     any government that can afford it spends money on welfare or on policing the poor its conservative governments that would prefer to spend more on policing and less on welfare theyre the ones who think the population can be correctly educated by their authority figures
  no its not  oh youre a complete moron if you have 20 in your bank account in america youre poor if you have 20 in your bank account in niger youre middle class
    how many weeks of food can twenty dollars buy you in america more or less than in niger
  again retard the statistics from the graph are price adjusted by purchasing power ppp fucking moron go back to /pol/
  purchasing power is irrelevant garbage because markets and purchasing opportunity are not equal its fairy tale trash that assumes every single society is organized the same way and nobody ever distributes goods and services except through capitalistic means
   if you have 20 in your bank account in niger youre middle class    wrong thats actually not much there at all
  purchasing power is irrelevant garbage because markets and purchasing opportunity are not equal  they are adjusted by purchasing power   holy shit what a fucikng moron you are get out already     its fairy tale trash that assumes every single society is organized the same way and nobody ever distributes goods and services except through capitalistic means  you have no idea what you are talking about     now out of pure curiosity what kind of communist are you my bet is on the ml kind
    thats because people can be shaped to be productive people who lead meaningful lives and have a positive impact on their society this is an idea that has dominated human philosophical thought for most of history then you have this bullshit idea during the enlightenment that the flaws of humanity should be accepted rather than being remedied this lead to a nihilist and fatalistic outlook on life culminating into the pervasive ennui of modern life     and humans cant operate at peak efficiency at all times and humans cant recover from all problems without any help and so welfare is a necessary function of the government    yes take the community out and replace it with the government it baffles me how socialists always think that more government is the key to solving all problems
    the threshold for financial stability is a meme    no it isnt and magnifying the issue by cherry picking a situation where the concept is arbitrarily abused doesnt change facts    alongside the fact that many go back onto social assistance if fluctuate a ton on top of health issues affecting ones finances    and thats what a social safety net is for which should be your friends family and community the state has no business nor should they in that situation
  how does capitalism not alienate you from what you produce by depriving you of every decision related to it  in workers coops and even medieval guilds the people who produced the good workers had the right to decide what was produced how and even further determine its sale here what the worker produces is truly the workers own and the decisions effecting it are determined by him  under capitalism the worker is strictly a worker and what he produces is deprived of him at the moment of production by the capitalist  im not sure what the point about airbnb was but doctors salaries are overinflated by an artificial shortage created by doctors
  and thats what a social safety net is for which should be your friends family and community      and what if you have none of that or it doesnt provide enough for your needs then what
  well you choose what you produce by choosing where you work  in the modern society the people who produce the good have a right to decide what to produce and how by choosing where they decide to work
  but they are still effectively alienated from what they produce their product is taken away from them as they produce it to me that seems like a disconnection between the worker and what they produce  again i would like to contrast this with coops and guilds
  but doctors salaries are overinflated by an artificial shortage created by doctors  in free labor markets gluts are selfcorrecting
  what would stop doctors from continuing to throttle university admittance and surcharge
  its been llike that for ages doctors deliberately try to keep others from entering as well as forcing hospitals to understaffed so they get paid more    in cabana we have a ton of accredited doctors/surgeons and other medical professionals basically zoned out by peopke in the field nursing us the same hospitals would rather be understaffed and get nurses do do overtime then just rite the right number
  like in hong kong which is damn close to a free market paradise and has poor people living in literal cages
  i dont think thats fair  why not compare the homelessness rate in hong kong and other major metropolitan areas neighboring on poor areas
  every capitalist is a low key commie and every commie is a low key reactionary
  any competent banks is going to take into account that some people wont pay their debt  if they give a 20 interest loan on a 40k car to a guy that is already 10k underwater they know that he will never pay them back and they hope that the resale value and the little money he managed to pay is enough to make some money
  smith is a commie
  there are people who are going to bed hungry in ethiopia tonight who would have full stomachs if there was an embrace of free market capitalism
  its true compare how slow government aid was to fix africa vs how quickly it fixed china
why is chinese culture so resilient it has lasted for thousands of years and even foreign conquerors end up adopting it the ccp tried stamping it out but its clear that they are going back to it     and before anybody posts that copypasta about chinese genetic mixing im just talking about the culture not genetics
  whats bred in the bone will come out in the flesh
  the chinese motto of you can conquer us but we will absorb you according to my father    that being said does any anon know anything about chinese inheritance law my cunt of an aunt is trying to cuck my impotent father on his half of 15 mil
  when that sort of money is at stake just get a lawyer it doesnt cost that much if anything to set up an appointment and consult with one
  chinese have high iq only because they are robot bugmen they dont have creativity unlike genetically superior nordics
  chinese culture has changed as much as western culture has changed saying that china has lasted thousands of years is like saying that the west has lasted thousands of years from the ancient greeks to modern europe
  to be fair though china has been fairly consistent and lasted longer
  youre a clueless retard if you think nordics are capable of anything other than gay saunas and rolling in the snow the height of human achievement took place in the classical hellas and china nobody can read texts from the spring  autumn/warring states period and think that the chinese lack creativity now get off 4chan and tend to your wifes halfsomali son
  ancient chinese were ruled by nordics from scythia  greeks were ruled by nordics  the idea that athens was a democracy is shitskin cope they had a nordic nobility
  dreaming your false boasts refer to an earlier period than i referenced and they have nothing to do with modern snowmen the only intelligent and white people remaining in the west are brown haired brown eyed people from england and wales
  the majority of china was han and retained the same ancient genetics both y chromosome and autosomal and that is the reason all invaders were a minority and could not change chinas genetics they went by paternal descent in order to discriminate so people paternally mongol were considered mongol not han so they could discriminate against paternally han people if everyone had mongol fathers then mongols would consider all chinese as fellow mongols not as enemies because they consider anyone with a mongol father as mongol manchus did the same anyone with a manchu father was manchu and thats how paternal han people were discriminated against di qiang jie xianbei khitan mongols jurchen all had official categories of classification separating han from nonhan based on paternal descent and giving them different punishments or positions as officials accordingly   khitan stayed in mongolia and even segregated han provinces from khitan provinces mongols stayed in mongolia the mongols and han defectors helped rape and kill jurchens in northern china reducing the jurchen by millions the same happened to the di qiang jie and xiongnu at the hands of the xianbei try finding foreign mongol indoeuropean or semitic y chromosomes like c3 r1a r1b j1 or j2 in northern china east of gansu you can barely find any of those han people have the same y chromosomes o3 o2b q1a1 and n as 3000 years ago  only whites who consider white masters rapebabies of black slave women as black dont go by paternal descent
specifically say my thread isnt about genetics  people start talking about genetics
  all nonhan dynasties had entire censuses distinguishing their population between han and nonhan based on paternal descent
  fuck off you mong the op had a question and we have the answers i didnt read the ops post because why would i he doesnt have the answer i do he is a beggar and beggars cant be choosers
its basically if rome recovered 100 from the crisis of the 3rd century
in other places like iraq and egypt the native genetics were raped into oblivion in the majority so only the minority christians preserve genetics and culture   iraq got raped by every single invader so the sunni iraqis are turkic mongol rape offspring from getting conquered and raped shia iraqis are 99 tribal arab recent migrants from arabia who refilled empty southern iraq after the mongol and turkic massacres of the natives only the minority assyrian christians and mandeans in iraq preserve mesopotamian genetics and culture   same for egypt egyptian sunnis are rapechildren of turks circassians turks albanians only the coptic christian minority preserve ancient egyptian genetics and culture  the ottomans did not distinguish by ethnic paternal descent they distinguished purely by religion and called them millets in the millet system all muslims belonged to the muslim millet all greek orthodox were in the greek orthodox church millet all armenian apostolic christians were in the armenian apostolic church millet so if a turkish sunni man raped an iraqi arab sunni woman in ottoman iraq his rapebaby would be considered part of the sunni people of iraq with no ethnic distinguishement thats how turk rapebabies became iraqi sunnis
  westerners believe in advancement theres no looking back only forward the goal is to create    chinese believe in cycles its all according to nature the goal is to rebuild
  no outside cultural pollution
  thats not a contemporary depiction  he had light brown hair and green eyes
  think again cracker    
  genetics are the reason the confucius family is the oldest recorded family of paternal descent and the one who has held a continuous noble title the longest among with other han noble families like the mencius family yan hui family zengzi family duke of zhous family   every single invader xianbei jurchen mongol manchu recognized their noble titles and fiefs the northern wei jin yuan qing the northern wei and qing emperors came to qufu to pay respects to the confucius descended noble marquises and dukes  only the communists dared to attack them and abolish their noble titles and fiefs the han nobility have the same y chromosomes as their ancestors  westerners have no roman republic noble families with them
  a handful of families  the largest population in the world    in terms of ratio thats rather negligible wouldnt you say
  it has lasted for thousands of years and even foreign conquerors end up adopting it  nonhan people in china had no philosophy advanced government system bureaucratic statcraft why would the reinvent anything going to call themselves imperatvr
  confucius family is q1a1 same y chromosome subclade in china 3000 years ago and widespread among han people and unique to han people cao caos family was o2b which many han people still have
i believe decades of ccp rule has effectively destroyed genuine chinese culture religion and spirituality
  ok retard
  still negligible were talking about the largest population in the world most of the chinese population were peasants
  the rome of the east with cyclical collapses and restorations built in
  each of those families has cadet branches all over china there are many people with the surnames kong meng zeng and yan all over who belong to those families numbering millions there are even overseas branches in korea now
  millions    millions thats not a lot nothing but a drop in the ocean there is something like one and a half billion chinese in the world millions thats nothing
  the afansievo culture gave the chinks horses chariots metallurgy which radically transformed them from neolithic tribes into the nation it became
  mongolian mongoloids   nordic
  ancient chinese were ruled by nordics from scythia  greeks were ruled by nordics  do you have sources for these claims that arent infographics from /pol/
  metallurgy  copper metallurgy existed in china before afansievo and how come these aryans spread their seed all over india leaving r1a there but not leaving a single r1a in china east of gansu where they that generous and suddenly turned into celibate monks when they came to china
  want to know where most assimilated han come from not from invaders outside but from former ethnic groups inside of china han people used to only be restricted to the yellow river and wei river valleys in henan province and southern shaanxi province and the fringes of eastern gansu the rest of northern china like hebei and shanxi were inhabited by beidi eastern china like eastern shandong and liaodong were inhabited by dongyi jiangsu was inhabited by huaiyi anhui by shanyue western gansu by quanrong southern china by baiyue and man sichuan by shu and ba yunnan by dian all of those people were conquered by the shang zhou and qin dynasties and assimilated into han people now its stopped with the ethnic minorities gaining their defining characteristics so you wount see that anymore
  greeks were ruled by nordics  well what else would the ie hordes invading europe at that time would do other than replace the elites there
  bbut theyre indoeuropean
  because they did not invade china they just traded with them    and they were r1bl23 haplorgoup      red haired green eyed  mongoloid
  mix with them
  yeah except the first chink state emerged because of the written word shamanism and state religionism based on an agrarian community     chariotniggery  metallurgy is meaningless without organization the other protochinese tribes had them from said mustard race who were so advanced yet we do not know who they were lmao yet they didnt found states
  sure but also repace their elites with their clan
      as a vietnamese i think its pretty funny that after vietnam get semisinicized migrated han chinese get absorbed into vietnamese instead
chinese culture is not really resilient all sorts of customs languages and cultures have come and gone throughout chinese history the idea of an eternal china is a nationalist tool that the historical record doesnt support also it is untrue that the ccp failed they succeeded in destroying huge numbers of vernacular architectural styles languages and minor religions and traditional practices what they did end up doing was compromising in the whole clean slate idea instead creating a simplified history that was easy to control
  hahahahaha mad shitskin  china was ruled by nordics look at ancient descriptions   same with greeks their ruling class anyone that did anything relevant was blonde
  you were called out for lying about chinas historical record and the concept of china        
  i said sources not just rephrasing what you already said work on your reading comprehension
  the idea of an eternal china is a nationalist tool that the historical record doesnt support    but it does the continuity of a chinese state forms a huge part of the mandate of heaven justification not to mention an existential reality for the chinks no unified state  chaos    what was different is said state wasnt a nation state it was an empire hell literally it meant everything under heaven
  china whether you are referring to it being derived from qin or the title zhongguo does not literally mean everything under heaven everything under heaven is a popular turn of phrase but it was never the actual name of the empire or country itself also it wouldnt make sense anyway because china has always had neighbours at most they talk about unifying all under heaven in times of civil strife
han chinese is a catchall term that is as vague and inclusive as something like european or middle eastern    there were literally race wars between different subgroups of han chinese such as between the hakka and the cantonese yet now today both hakka and cantonese are considered the same han chinese    han chinese is a pseudoethnicity furthermore its meaning has changed multiple times throughout history
  there were literally race wars between different subgroups of han chinese such as between the hakka and the cantonese yet now today both hakka and cantonese are considered the same han chinese    its not vague geographic or inclusive at all zhuang yao tujia she are not considered han despite zhuang being sinicized using chinese names and sharing culture nothing like european or middle eastern    there is severe hatred and civil wars between northern yemenis and southern yemenis who are both arab they south view the north as barbaric savages and the north use insults doubting the arabness of the south    the ethnicity now known as han chinese was always known as hua people or huaxia and that definition never changed cantonese hakka northern han always valled themselves hua people
  north yemenis are a distinct subgroup and south yemenis are divided into further distinct subgroups the hatred and violence between them is a race war
  zhuang yao tujia she are not considered han despite zhuang being sinicized using chinese names and sharing culture    exceptions to the rule    there is severe hatred and civil wars between northern yemenis and southern yemenis who are both arab they south view the north as barbaric savages and the north use insults doubting the arabness of the south    sounds like a race war    the ethnicity now known as han chinese was always known as hua people or huaxia and that definition never changed cantonese hakka northern han always valled themselves hua people    hua was a cultural identity
  its not exceptions most of chinas 56 ethnicities are found not in tibet or xinjiang but in southern china where they live next to han people most she speak hakka but arent hakka zhuang bai koreans vietnamese in china have sinicized culture and names but are not considered han yao people practice a han invented religion daoism but arent considered han do you know how ethnicity works yemenis werent actually arab before islam despite origin myths they spoke different south arabian languages not arabic the arabs expanded south from northern arabia and assimilated the yemenis so yemenis are now arab
    koreans and vietnamese are not considered hua despite their sinitic influenced cultures northern han chinese mandarin speaking diaspora in korea call themselves hwa hua and are called hwa by koreans southern han chinese cantonese hakka and minnan diaspora in vietnam call themselves hoa hua and are called hoa by vietnamese vietnamese and koreans never call themselved hua but they both call all han people as hua hua is very much an ethnic label used by all han people from beijing to guangzhou
  in korea the han are called hwagyo huaqiao its ethnic not cultural
      hua was a cultural identity now its an ethnic one something tells me that those vietnamese and korean terms for han chinese are relatively modern inventions
always    ummm no sweetie sounds like youre talking about postunification china
    hua was used as an ethnic term since the zhou dynasty to distinguish chinese from the dongyi nanman xirong and beidi koreans and vietnamese were never considered hua and always grouped as barbarians yi even in the ming dynasty chikese beliebed there must be clear boundaries between hua and barbarians yi
  hua was used as an ethnic term since the zhou dynasty to distinguish chinese from the dongyi nanman xirong and beidi  all of whom are now considered han chinese    koreans and vietnamese were never considered hua and always grouped as barbarians yi even in the ming dynasty  no shit they were separate countries    chikese beliebed there must be clear boundaries between hua and barbarians yi  yes a cultural one
  the ming founder said there must be ethnic boundaries between hua and yi separating mongol from han zhuang and bai people in china were always considered yi despite being in china and having a sinicized culture script and names zhuang are descendants of nanman qiang are descendants of xirong manchus and korrans are among the dongyi none of them are considered han only those totally assimilated intermarried their languages culture identity and memories gone
  is it though it might have been it the past because the territory couldnt be conquered by others but i hate to break it to you that china got westernd pretty hard from the mid19th
  be conquered by others  chinese culture    what does that have to do with culture arabs conquered and ruled spain but i dont see any arab culture in spain
  whyd you put ethnic in brackets did he say it or not no shit he would want to separate mongols and han after the mongols had conquered them    manchus are too recent to have been assimilated into the han blob furthermore they were the rulers of china in the not so distant past koreans have their own country
  ming hongwu said that of all yi people mongols jurchens vietnam that there must be clear boundaries between hua and yi there have been ethnic minorities living in china like monguor tujia baima for centuries and never assimilated bai people have lost their country dali for centuries now and still arent considered han koreans in china are not considered han people
  so youre telling me that the han assimilated many ethnic minorities but not all of them    okay

  this wont get 4chan blocked in china you absolute fucking moron you are only taking up more space on 4chans servers
  xinjiang uyghur autonomous region is the prcs official name for the region you fucking idiot
china is one unbroken culture  well despite the massive periodic purges of historical records and industrial scale destruction of documents art and cultural artifacts by different dynasties  and centuries of foreign domination  and the spread of islam christianity and buddhism    china just purges all previous history and culture then shapes what is left into a new form and proclaims the nee bastardization is part of the great chinees glorious 6000 year history    kek
  the ccp tried stamping it out    they didnt actually tried to do that
      its a bot the same thing is posted on china threads on every board within an hour    my guess is a russian set up since 4chan is high traffic and generates a lot of memes that travel far and wide to normies and they have basically got /pol/ swallowing kremlin propaganda whole its a logical place for chinese influence but if people fall for chia shilling theyll drift away from based putin and based assad
  well despite the massive periodic purges of historical records and industrial scale destruction of documents art and cultural artifacts by different dynasties  chinese use the same names calendar religious holidays deities other culture traditions and the language is descended from old chinese  and centuries of foreign domination  do you know what culture is even during the qing daoist priests continued wearing the han topknot since they were exempt from the queue and shaving the forehead many daoist clerics passed down their position from father to son han daoist priets still wear the topknot today like they did during the qing and 2000 years before them  and the spread of islam christianity and buddhism  islam has never been more than 5 of the population of china in its entire history christianity is not a majority religion either buddhism is part of the majority chinese culture now but there are still daoists
  the native chinese religion daoism still exists and the leadership of it is passed down from farther to son in the zhang family since zhang daoling the han dynasty down to the present day they never wore the queue in the qing the qing could not dare force daoist priests to shave their heads and braid their hair they do the same religious rituals as they did before
less than 05 of the han chinese population were exempt from wearing the queue    gee
    t chang ching chong
  each dynasty in chinese history commissioned an official history of the previous dynasty to become part of the official canon now the twenty four histories the 24 are always preserved along with the confucian four books and five classics chinese still practice the calligraphy of ancient zhou dynastys scripts like the seal script and clerical scripts in a continuous line from ancient calligraphers use it on official seals institution religious daoism in the zhang family is as old as the catholic church in the west and daoisms origins stretch back to centuries before that since laozi in the 6th century bc chinese use the same classical chinese language to write all the official imperial histories religious texts and documents since the zhou dynasty
  the daoist priests of that order were also the ones who dont practice buddhism and practice the same ancient chinese religion continuously they were the ones least influenced by anything foreign whether religious or culturally and preserved their religious and cultural traditions continuously
    right and rich people around the muslim world really are part of an unbroken line going back to mohammed
    every single dynasty in chinsee history including mongols and manchus kept the ancient han chinese nobility descended from the first dynasties confucius was a descendant of the shang dynasty kings and mencius was a descendant of the zhou dynasty kings their descendants all kept their continuous noble titles into the qing dynasty the qin dynasty was the first to award the confucius family a noble title and it was continuously promoted to marquis in the han dynasty duke in the tang dynasty duke yansheng in the song dynasty and still exists in the republic of china no other nation has a title of nobility in the same family that stretches back continuously    genetics are the reason the confucius family is the oldest recorded family of paternal descent and the one who has held a continuous noble title the longest among with other han noble families like the mencius family yan hui family zengzi family duke of zhous family  every single invader xianbei jurchen mongol manchu recognized their noble titles and fiefs the northern wei jin yuan qing the northern wei and qing emperors came to qufu to pay respects to the confucius descended noble marquises and dukes  only the communists dared to attack them and abolish their noble titles and fiefs the han nobility have the same y chromosomes as their ancestors  westerners have no roman republic noble families with them
  each dynasty in chinese history commissioned an official history of the previous dynasty to become part of the official canon    the chinese got the we wuzzery down to a science
  not any rich people the sharifs of mecca are descendants of muhammad and lived there for centuries the zhang family was recognized as leaders of their daoist sect by every dynasty they were given titles by the ming and qing emperors cao wei accepted the surrender of the zhang family and gave them official positions
  so a handful of families were spared    a handful of families in the largest population in the world    insignificant
  each reigning dynasty expected that the next dynasty which would overthrow them would commission an official history    
  well yeah considering they did it themselves to the previous dynasty lmao
  so a handful of families were spared  spared this is about keeping records and noble titles not killing they did not massacre all commoners you are talking about cultural continuity china has the oldest continuously held noble titles down to the present day and the oldest continuously recorded family genealogies in the world you claim each dynasty destroyed the old culture and invented a new one and claimed it was part of 6000 years they did not no dynasty ever dared to abolish the noble titles of those families
  you    i never said that
  the genealogy of the confucius family is even included in each of the twenty four dynastic histories if that dynasty ruled the area where they lived in qufu their fief each dynasty confirmed their noble titles and renewed it and recorded the succession to the title of marquis or duke but confuciuss descendants in their official histories
  wow thats nice a drop in the ocean
    each dynasty also customarily granted a noble title and fief to a male member of the previous dynasty in a practice called the two crownings and the three respects        the zhou dynasty granted the fief of song and title of duke to a member of the shang dynasty it overthrew the han dynasty then did it for the zhou dynasty cao wei did it for the han dynasty the yuan did it for the song dynasty and the qing did it for the ming dynasty the marquis of extended grace
  a drop in the ocean
    its almost like you can destroy a bunch of art and documents and proclaims a new tradition going back millennia    youre talking about a nation that denies shit that happened as recently as 1989 lol
  chinese daoists still follow the same religious traditions as they did 2000 years ago use the same names as they did over 2000 years ago use the same calendary and holiday sas they did 2500 years like cold food festival mind autumn festival solstices ordinary chinese still have genealogies centuries longer than ordinary westerners yoyo mas genealogy stretches back over 800 years as an ordinary chinese while an ordinary westerner can only trace to the 17th century americans celebrate fake holidays like thanksgiving and british invented a holiday guy fawkes day and pope gregory even changed the calendar
  and qingming festival
  im just talking about the culture not genetics  it is not chinese cannot even understand writing from 100 years ago modern prc chinese cannot understand qingera written documents from two centuries ago or even kmt roc written documents from 80 years ago there is no continuity in terms of writing because of how drastic the overhauls were so chinese peasants could finally learn to read    huge amounts of chinese culture and traditions were forever lost in the maos cultural revolution like ancient books confucian and buddhist scrolls numerous temples old customs culture habits idea etc were destroyed long ago and modern china is based on two things 20th century maoism and westernmimicry
  it is not chinese cannot even understand writing from 100 years ago modern prc chinese cannot understand qingera written documents from two centuries ago or even kmt roc written documents from 80 years ago there is no continuity in terms of writing because of how drastic the overhauls were so chinese peasants could finally learn to read  westerners travelling in qing china said 90 of commoners could read prc people can easily read traditional characters many simplified characters were centuries old shorthand forms already in existence    huge amounts of chinese culture and traditions were forever lost in the maos cultural revolution like ancient books confucian and buddhist scrolls numerous temples old customs culture habits idea etc were destroyed long ago and modern china is based on two things 20th century maoism and westernmimicry  the main confucian neoconfucian and buddhist texts exist in an established official canon the four books and five classics they do not exist in single copies but are all over east asia korea japan vietnam sometimes chinese emperors sent for envoys to korea and japan to find lost buddhist texts and chinese books temples can be rebuilt like they always were chinese still celebrate their 2500 year old holidays and worship their gods chinese religions like yiguandao daoist zhengyidao all still exist and are practiced today
  yeah the chinese have larping down to a science
  do you know what a textual canon is or are you paralyzed its like saying if french burned all the bible manuscripts in france the bible is lost forever there are tons of daoists in china
  if you think prc people cannot read traditional characters you probably dont know any chinese asking a prc teenager to write it would be hard but reading is easy
  westerners travelling in qing china said 90 of commoners could read  they absolutely could not qing literacy rate was 5   prc people can easily read traditional characters   they cant  many simplified characters were centuries old shorthand forms already in existence  even the kmt roc had the problem of chinese peasant unable to learn because the writing was too complex for them 99 of the simplified characters only happened in the 20th century maoist regime today mainland chinese cannot even understand books from kmt roc era without learning traditional characters
  they absolutely could not qing literacy rate was 5  there is a difference between literacy in classical chinese and literacy in vernacular mandarin westerners referred to vernacular literacy in the qing  even the kmt roc had the problem of chinese peasant unable to learn because the writing was too complex for them   do you know the difference between classical chinese and vernacular novels were written in vernacular average qing and roc commoners could read novels
  westerners travelling in qing china said 90 of commoners could read    uhhuh and how did they come up with that statistic you believe it are you dumb
  prc people can easily read traditional characters  you definitely havent seen online debates between mainlanders and taiwanese
  oops referring to   they cant
  ive written to prc people and showed them writing they displayed no confusion
  no confusion then why are we arguing
  im not him
  height of human achievement is today you fucking retard saying its 2000 year ago is intellectually moot
  ff anything they didnt go far enough      basically even the ccp was/is still trapped with the central kingdom agrarian mentality its easy to destroy tangible culture like some statues talisman or whatever but to destroy the whole old mentality requires a massive amount of time and effort
  honestly all iconoclasts should have their tongues cut out
  trying to fuck your family is standard practice it should be ok in the end
  there are still lots of artifacts problem is there are also lots of forged ones physical destruction is always the brainlet way of doing stuff
  delusional
  its a human spamming it he even posted an image once
  ancient china was ruled by nordics  do you have any proof  well what else would they have done lmao  do you understand why this is not a basis for a credible theory
i have a philosophy question can the erudite redpill philosophers ify /his/ help me i believe asking your community of learned men who discuss difficult philosophical problems with the irreverent authority that only comes from passionate arduous scholarship will be more expedient than this lass figuring it out on her own  here it comes    i was reading something in the standford encyclopedia of philosophists about some analytic metaphysics it was somewhere in the location and mereology or plural quantification i think but i dont remember as i was very high spinning around could be anywhere and prehaps it was in a journal it was about someone who wrote about the mind as existing in context it sounds very similar to what peirce says about mind existing in the mind of naturei dont think this can be properly interperted as a kind of panpsychism and that thinking is the process of paying attention to certain parts of the continuous development of the reality of thirdness represented in signs that semiotic reality is what i like to call the reality of living thirdness  does anyone know where this radical contextual substantivalism comes from im very interested in studying analytic metaphysics with peirceian semiotics    my blessed teachers thank you in advance for your wise words
wwhites are better1  tabula rasa bitch
  tabula rasa is outdated yet another /his/ post that only exists because too many of you guys totally disregard learning general facts
except fuck redskins  t sophisticated angloid philosopher
footfaced fucking english scum
  white isnt a racial identity you degenerate
  yeah this post reeks amerilard
  go fuck yourself  you just dont want people to be proud of their ethnic racial identity
  what identity posting pictures of greek statues and calling it muh heritage even though youre a northern euromutt is not a fucking racial identity   there is legitimately no white identity aside from screeching mother evropa inconsequentially or claiming that you wuz inventors and shit which is what every nationalist already does
when will this embarrassment run its course are we going to have to sit through 2000 years of pretending to believe in man and the holy human spirit
  humanism is kinda lame i agree although i agree with its basic tenets the problem is that since its materialistic in outlook the only people who can reasonably buy into it are those who are already wealthy and welleducated telling a poor person from the ghetto to support universal human rights and to treat all people with kindness and dignity while their neighbours are drugdealing hooligans that blast music until 3am every night without giving them a good reason why means that most people arent going to care about it
  humanism isnt materialistic enough it holds humanity as sacrosanct in principle and falls into every pitfall of religion
  are we going to have to sit through 2000 years of pretending to believe in man and the holy human spirit  why the fuck not
  because you cant go around criticizing religion and then make your own religion either accept the true amoral monism or declare yourself an insane person
  metaphysically it is it says that humanity is sacred but only in a sort of vague life is meaningless so we may as be awesome to each other3 way theres no divine or revelatory component to it
  its dogma
  so is communism nazism and libertarianism though why focus on humanism
  because its what im focusing on now its a dogma that claims to abhor dogmata and is therefore the supreme hypocrisy its a romanticism dreamt up to pacify the pious
  honest question how many humanists do you know in real life ive seen like one humanist office in my city and know maybe a couple of people who would agree with its ideas but i dont think ive ever met an actual selfdescribed humanist
  its just a religion for brainlets it will die or something else will take its place
oh ffs these autists again
ok everyone thats it give it up someone just tell me how the pyramids were built
  jewish slaves
with slaves and water
  you and me both know this isnt it
  one stone on top of the other    first you clear the sand away from the bedrock they did this with a huge quantity of workers with baskets    then you use chisels to dig trenches into the bedrock fill it with water and you clear the bedrock so that its completely level with the height of water    after that you begin laying stones the stones came from a quarry and were moved using levers rolling logs and grease    once you have the base up to the level with the surrounding sand you fill in the sand with sand you removed and you continue to lay stones on top    as you go up you keep putting sand and small rocks up around so you can have a long ramp to get to the top of the structure    once you have put the cap stone on you then start clearing away the sand down to the base using an army of workers and baskets to clear it away
  ayyy lmao
  
  so what do you think the purpose of the pyramids was
  open your mind
  anti spacecraft weapon relic of hyperspace war
  rock stacking that got out of hand also the economic and agricultural abundance of the bronze age made everyone bored enough to do outofthisworld rock stacking for shits and giggles
  dont you know the level of intelligence that went into this
  im gonna guess ancient egyptians had an average iq in the mid 90s but i dont actually know
  ayy
  is there a simulator of this 
  an average iq in the mid 90s relative to what population isnt iq always determined as a standard distribution where the average person taking a given exam has an iq of 100 and differences in iq are relative to that
  royal dickwaving every king needed a royal tomb and egos being egos every king wanted a tomb that was more awesome read expensive than the last king so first you had underground burial chambers then you had a mastaba put on top of the burial chambers then you started stacking the mastabas to form a step pyramid and finally you got true pyramids
  no bodies have ever been found in the pyramids
  maybe because theyve been sitting there in plain view for 4000 years and more than one person has probably had the cheeky idea to go take them out for whatever reason
      the majority of the workforce were egyptian citizens
  if thats what you think fair enough but i think its a lot less mundane than this
  its never less mundane
  reality is always boring my dude
  
    i came here to post this
  thats because they fucking rose up my guy they reign in the underworld at osiris side now
  prove it
  by nordic ubermensch who enslaved jews to do it      
i like the internal ramp theory but it doesnt explain how they got the cap stone in place
  no
  masses of manpower were able to be pulled from what today is upper egypt sudan and ethiopia
  the idea that they were jewish slaves is a hollywood invention that they did back when they were making shitloads of movies about ancient egypt they did this to sort of smash thousands of years of egyptian history into a shorthand for the audience who at the time were primarily familiar with it through the bible and a handful of archaeological discoveries exodus itself never even mentions jews building pyramids just houses and monuments
  white americans just like everybody else since he doesnt have any data anyway theres no difference between using some absolute score or a conventional relative measure in his guess
  not necessarily the understanding of who jews are is wrong they originated in east africa not israel when you understand that everything else makes sense
  its all speculation all archaeologists will say is well they were probably built this way or well they probably did it that way    no one really knows exactly how with any conclusive proof
fun fact 1 the door to the tomb in the great pyramid is too msall to put the sarcophagus sitting inside through    fun fact 2 that same sarcophagus is too small to hold an inner coffin for a normalsize adult body    fun fact 3 there is no book of the dead on the walls to help the dead nor anything at all that even says who the pyramid is for    fun fact 4 on the lower level is a room where either the room is incomplete or badlyweathered due to being much older than the pyramid
so youre probably wondering why so many retards believe in crazy ass shit conspiracy theories about how the pyramids were built let me explain    1 they never see a photo of them from the other side showing the city and so think the pyramids are in the middle of nowhere    2 they dont know about the aswan dam the area around the pyramids was not empty desert at the time of their construction the stone was transported along the river again the pyramids were not in the middle of nowhere     3 they dont know about earlier architectural experiments with pyramids earlier failed designs such as the bent pyramid were improved upon by egyptian architects idiots imagine there were only ever three pyramids that just appeared one day     4 they believe that the pyramids are hollow or are designed with elaborate network of passages and traps as though they contained crash bandicoot levels they are almost entirely solid sparing the tiny burial chamber and escape passage    5 they dont understand how ancient/medieval masons designed these things there were no formal engineering equations and the architects didnt need modern formality or proof the egyptians used the 345 triangle rule discovered by the mesopotamians they couldnt prove the relationship but that was irrelevant the gothic cathedrals were similarly designed geometrically the mason would begin from a circle the circumference would become the side of a square then a rectangle and a triangle and so on the perfect proportionality of the cathedrals comes from simple geometric relationships which are elaborated into a complex and rational structure the architectural equivalent of fugal counterpoint     6 it fits with their zionist/nwo/flat earth/illuminati conspiracy theories
  i would recommend reading up on jeanpierre houdins theory as to how the great pyramid was constructed it has quite a lot of circumstantial evidence supporting it and i think its the most reasonable theory to date regarding how the pyramid was constructed
  im open to the possibility that the great pyramid was possibly intended for some other purpose other than simply being a tomb but theres really no other good explanation ive seen
the subterranean chamber looks so much more ancient than the rest of the pyramid yet the egyptologists insist its an incomplete room when it instead looks so heavily eroded over the normal interior wear of the pyramid    and lo and behold its within a very short distance of the tomb of osiris an egyptian diety     personally i think the great pyramid was built on top of something much older than it and possibly some other holy site that they wanted to build a new in an ancient sense monument for
  yeah juat drag that 80 ton granite block up a hundred foot pile of desert sand using levers lmfao
  it also discounts the dramatic slope of the ramp in order to elevate hundreds of tons hundreds of feet the only thing more poorly thought out is the theory that hebrews did it with the power of righteousness and innate purity that mainstream academia preaches
  its in the bible and my middle school textbook
  his doesnt know anything not even about ww2
  top to bottom using sand the word giza gave rise to the word guise to hide to some it depicts a map of their known realm and 3 kingdoms that exist outside their realm
  the word giza gave rise to the word guise to hide  no it didnt
  look it up its pretty well known they were mostly paid labourers or farmers during off season
  bricks and peasants
  houdins take on that seems pretty concise  heres a simulation of the build process         the outer ramp is bullshit it would have needed 3x the mass of the pyramid in order to reach 2/3 of the height   a build in ramp in the pyramid is much more likely and supported by evidence    the attribution to khufu is more than questionable btw it rests on that one name tag in the relief chamber and there have been suspicions since pretty much the beginning that vyse forged that to have something to show for blasting holes into an ancient monument
how did they retrieve the footage from the camera
grabbed it with gloved hands
  how did they see the landing live    it wasnt a film camera genius it was a type of camera designed to broadcast
  livestream in the 60s  xd
  not him but youre actually retarded
  just asked the moon people to send it in the mail
  ddont question the goverment   good goy
  question the government in an intelligent manner my useful idiot friend
  low iq post
  livestreaming is harder to believe than landing on the moon
    look at these braindead people and laugh imagine having to live with an iq this low
moon landing deniers and 9/11 truthers are essentially pawns who are permitted to spout ridiculous bullshit in order to discredit actual conspiracies like testing biological agents on american citizens
  9/11 was legit fishy
  next manned mission retrieved it
  they used to livestream directly into everyones home
what went wrong again 
grmans
  (((them)))
unironically hitler
   wilhelm
alienating france instead of teaming up to crush the eternal anglo
overestimating austriahungary and underestimating france in ww1 they also underestimated russia to an extent
  they didnt underestimate france they underestimated belgiums willingness to fight back and britaind willingness to intervene
lesser people got lucky
  mainly  hussite revolution  deluge  30 years war
  30 years war  the 30 years war was a positive for germany because of it the hre was neutered and his vassals were more autounmus the great elector fredrick willhelm used that to start the first steps toward the creation of the kingdom of prussia
  yea thats main point plus it killed of half of bohemia which was be replaced by germans
its funny how germany on the map looks exactly like the average german woman
  deluge   negative for germany  swedes kicking polish asses was the starting point of the polish partition you see that northeastern protrusion impossible without the deluge retard
the eternal anglo and autistic poles there shouldnt have been a ww2
  implying france would even want to ally the kaiserreich while they still held alsace lorraine  i know you eufags have gone apeshit at the anglos since brexit but a french2nd reich alliance is pure fantasy
behind every jew there is a kraut
  sag das nochmal
  no they underestimated france it was mostly french soldiers that stopped the germans at the marne and moltke took 2 divisions from his armies farthest in western france to shore up prussia against russia also the french stopped the german advance in eastern france at charmes and couronne that was what ultimately killed the schlieffen plan more than anything in belgium in fact the german advance into belgium was about on schedule it was only the massing of a new french army in paris that really saved the day for the french
  based and redpilled
  they didnt push the polish and nongermans culturally out of the nation    bismarck didnt crown himself emperor in order to secure his position for life    they allowed austrians as citizens hitler and for some random ass reason allied with them when bismarck was right in every sense to exclude them and not classify them as german    they allowed the aristocracy and monarchy to be abolished instead of allowing it to continue    allowing for the existence of a navy who were literal fucking cowards and traitors to the nation who would rather throw a revolution than fight tooth and nail for their nation which the army did    germany should really berate the existence of its navy fucking pussy cowards
  retarded leaders and hubris    they didnt push the polish and nongermans culturally out of the nation  right and if they did try to assimilate they did so badly with the stick instead of the carrot  bismarck didnt crown himself emperor in order to secure his position for life  even if he wanted he couldnt have crowned himself emperor he was servant to the prussian king  they allowed austrians as citizens hitler and for some random ass reason allied with them when bismarck was right in every sense to exclude them and not classify them as german  austrians are germans bismarck only didnt want austria part of germany because austria would be an internal rival to prussia not because he thought austrians werent german  they allowed the aristocracy and monarchy to be abolished instead of allowing it to continue  nothing wrong with that as long as the system that replaces it is good  allowing for the existence of a navy who were literal fucking cowards and traitors to the nation who would rather throw a revolution than fight tooth and nail for their nation which the army did  the navy did fight bravely it simply wasnt capable of challenging the much superior royal navy thats why it sat in the ports for much of the war and the navy was always loyal only when the war was already lost in the field and the leaders wanted to send the navy on a hopeless suicide mission did they refuse to obey orders and they had every reason to  germany should really berate the existence of its navy fucking pussy cowards  you should really stop posting you stupid retard  tho the buildup of such a large navy was idiotic it had no real purpose pushed britain into the arms of france and russia
  what about a french3rd reich alliance
  swedes kicking polish asses was the starting point of the polish partition  thats exactely what i meant retard
  t frog
  everyone should have just bowed down to their germanic overlords without a fight t b h  fuck off
  alsacelorraine would wreck any potential alliance
  southtyrol didnt either and hitler officially explained he had no interest in regaining elaßlothringen how its called correctly
  he incorporated it to germany after defeating france
  but it wasnt a goal of him initially
yfw the eternal butthurt of the french was caused by the king of bavaria demanding that alsacelorraine be annexed  yfw if willy1 had said no then the french would have no cause for revanchism
  thats germany in the picture you imbecile hes not asking for the polaks what kind of slav inbred are you
whats up with western european incels fantasising about their country being ally to nazi germany
  what went wrong what allowed germans to spread so far  one of the factors was deluge which destroyed poland as a power leaving germans an easy vector for expansion    i dont see any problem there did all that nigger semen contaminated your brain
  petain didnt see it that way he was a reasonable man
  mr anglo i dont feel so good
  they see what happens when they were not
  vichy frace was barely a country certainly not a worthwhile and loyal ally if germany allowed them to rebuild properly than france would probably stop germany in the back the moment they were weak to retake alsacelorraine

genocide tens of thousands of southern minority cultures such as the chams for centuries   scream genocide war crimes like little babies when americans slap their shit down
  americans slap their shit down  they still lost   what did he mean by this
  genocide tens of thousands of southern minority cultures for centuries  scream genocide war crimes like little babies when japanese slap their shit down
  tens of thousands is well an interesting figure but it still amuses me how little play fulro and north vietnams historical expansionism gets when its time for lefties to bawl about evil amerikkka and france and their bullying of poor innocent vietnam though i still believe the viets were the more justified side in both those conflicts
  american slap their shit down  ho chi minh city  what did he mean by this
  this also its not like the cham were native tribals they were a kingdom and it was a war they lost deal with it
  genocide tens of thousands of minority cultures like ainu emishi azumi kumaso kuzu mishihase for centuries  scream genocide war crimes like little babies when americans slap their shit down
  degar montagnards in the central highlands and the natives of the annamite cordilleras are native tribals who are being genocided by vietnam chams are native to champa and khmer krom are native to kampuchea krom
genocide tens of thousands of minority cultures for millennia  screams genocide war crimes like little babies when it slaps its own shit down
    annamite cordilleras native tribals  
  they did quite a bit more than just scream about it considering they defeated american imperialism
    pales in comparison to what china has done for not centuries but millenia
  they dont america still won the cold war  vietnam never give a damn about muh international communist brotherhood since the start
  chinks didnt genocide viets they civilized them
  god i love the manchus for spanking the chank and giving them a much needed haircut
  dont forget defending vietnam from the french even if the qing failed
can we stop pretending genocides are rare   theres probably not a single culture or ethnicity in existence that hasnt genocided something
  chams asked china in the song dynasty and ming dynasty to invade vietnam and fuck up viets so vietnam would stop attacking champa champa asked china to attack vietnam four different times
  but if we do that then i cant pretend that insert enemy ethnicity here are a bunch of ravening demons entirely removed from the rest of humanity anymore 
  the baiyue of southern china hate vietnamese rule and revolted against vietnam or invaded vietnam  the baiyue nung/zhuang leader nong zhigao nung tri cao revolted against vietnam too to establish an independent nung kingdom   an duong vuong was from the ethnic minority baiyue shu kingdom in sichuan he invaded vietnam van lang violently overthrew the vietnamese king and crowned himself king
what are the best general survey books on the roman empire     im particularly interested in works on the early roman empire but recommended books for would be great
im sure there are some copypastas around if someone could dump
bump
when you commit some of the worst mass killings of the 20th century and no one gives a shit because henry kissinger ford and carter supported you
  he genocided east timorese animists and catholics west papuan animists and christians and fellow muslim acehnese by the hundreds of thousands indonesian javanese muslim settlers and soldiers raped tens of thousands of east timorese women west papuan women and fellow muslim acehnese women rest in hell suharto
  chinks and commies didnt count
  gaddafi in libya supported the west papuan free papua movement opm east timorese fretilin and acehnese free aceh movement gam giving them weapons and training to fight against the indonesian terrorist army while america australia and the united kingdom supported indonesias invasions of east timor and west papua and the subsequent mass genocides mass rapes and horrific atrocities
  ah yes the religious acehnese muslims are commies and chinks0 oh not wait a minute what go tell all the religious acehnese muslims who were massacred and raped by indonesian troops in the aceh insurgency that they were chink and commies
    this is what the indonesian military did to acehnese muslims    the mysterious killings petrus in aceh had the following general features the corpses of victims were usually left in public places  beside a main road in fields and plantations next to a stream or a river  apparently as a warning to others not to join or support the rebels most had clearly been prisoners when they were killed their thumbs and sometimes their feet had been tied together with a particular type of knot most had been shot at close range though the bullets were seldom found in their bodies most also showed signs of having been beaten with a blunt instrument or tortured and their faces were therefore often unrecognisable for the most part the bodies were not recovered by relatives or friends both out of fear of retribution by the military and because the victims were usually dumped at some distance from their home villages
  indonesian javanese muslim soldiers raping torturing killing fellow acehnese muslims        indonesian forces are continuing to rape torture and murder acehnese despite signing a peace treaty this year according to a british researcher         indonesias national commission on human rights komnas ham announced on june 2 that it would investigate more than twenty cases involving murder rape and forced displacement in aceh since the conflict began commission member mm billah stated that both warring sides have violated the humanitarian law as stated in the geneva convention and the human rights law as well  we call on both parties to end hostilities and reopen peace talks and this time the talks should involve civilians2 un secretary general kofi annan has also voiced concern stating on may 29 deep concern about the impact of the renewed hostilities on civilian populations in aceh indonesia particularly by the reports of extrajudicial killings and widespread burning of schools3     newspaper and ngo reports have detailed numerous extrajudicial executions of civilians by the indonesian military tni in the first week of hostilities the most widely reported took place on may 21 when indonesian soldiers reportedly dragged a group of men and boys out of their hut in the village of mapa mamplam according to eyewitnesses the soldiers lined the victims up and shot each one dead execution style among those killed were three boys aged eleven thirteen and fourteen5
    look at these chink commie acehnese muslims attending an islamic boarding school        drought before a parliamentary panel investigating human rights abuses in aceh province indonesias former military commander denied today that he and other commanders had ordered troops to kill and torture acehnese people to crush an independence rebellion    it is not true at all that the central government and the military engineered any atrocities said general wiranto who stepped down as the armed forces chief last month to join the cabinet of president abdurrahman wahid        the soldiers and their civilian guide were given sentences of up to 10 years for killing 56 students and a teacher from an islamic boarding school in the remote village of beutong ateuh central aceh in june last year the trial is seen as signalling the determination of jakartas new government to crack down on human rights abuses by the indonesian army    the killings were carried out during a military crackdown on separatist rebels of the free aceh movement who want the province on the northern tip of sumatra to break away from indonesia the rebels want a greater share of profits from the oilrich region as well as the right to impose islamic laws
    based indonesians forcing a chink commie acehnese muslim to give up his kidney        one of the most disturbing accounts was of muhibbudin a young acehnese man with a massive scar on his torso  he says this is where his kidney was forcibly removed to give to an indonesian soldier
    based indonesian military human rights violations against chink commie acehnese muslims    
  acehnese muslims are notorious for being more religious than javanese muslims for actually following purer islam not mixed with hinduism unlike javanese muslims for not using hindu names unlike javanese muslims acehnese muslim women are more religious and dont have sex with random western tourists unlike the average javanese muslim women   we have a badass here proclaiming them to be chinks and commies
  15000 acehnese muslims were raped tortured and killed by the indonesian javanese muslim army the indonesian javanese muslims did the same in east timor and west papua against christians and animists they resettled all those lands west papua east timor aceh with javanese muslim colonists in the transmigration program to overwhelm the natives and make them a minority and kill them
  his closeness with the us helped some of it be brushed under the rug i always find it funny how edgy kids worship pinochet for killing communist when suharto makes him look like a fly
      it is the second time rapes have been reported since the military and police on may 19 launched an allout assault to crush free aceh movement separatist guerrillas who have been fighting for independence since 1976    earlier this month police said a police paramilitary soldier had been detained for allegedly raping a 15yearold girl    the military which has a record of gross rights abuses during earlier campaigns in aceh has said it will try to ensure its troops behave better this time
  be indog  fuck aceh backward ragheads should just separate from the country  also indog  reee separatists are civilian killing terrorists  you want to separate and become an aussie puppet like east timor
indonesia is still a shithole because of him
  youre a fucking moron
    an ancient ring found in bethlehem belonged to the man who crucified jesus scientists believe    the bronze ring was discovered 50 years ago during a dig at herodion near the west banks bethlehem by professor gideon forster from the hebrew university    it had an inscription on it which included a picture of a wine vessel surrounded by greek writing but it was unclear who it had belonged to    five decades after its discovery the identity of the owner appears to have been established the roman governor of jerusalem pontius pilate  the man who ordered that jesus be crucified and then ran the subsequent trial    the name was deciphered after a thorough cleansing when it was photographed with the use of a special camera at the israel antiquities authority labs according to haaretz    it is thought the item is a stamping ring which would have been used to symbolise the status of the cavalry in roman times    as the governor pilate who was also known as pilatus would have worn a ring of this nature
i found a really heavy ring in my back garden with a hammer scratched on it its thors
  all those militant atheist comments  theyre becoming a hateful little bunch arent they
i hafe a vevy good fend in wome called biggus dickus
  i know hif wif shes called incontinea buttocks
  they know theyre wrong
  theyve always been     i dont get it atheist deny pontius pilate was governor of judea during christ lifetime     pilate ordered his guards to crucify jesus at the bequest of the jews subject should be man who ordered christ crucifixion its not like pilate did it himself
  i think that comment section just goes to show that atheists are not intellectually superior like they like to believe all attack nothing to show despite history attesting to jesuss existence
  i dont get it atheist deny pontius pilate was governor of judea during christ lifetime  they think he was fictional in addition to jesus
  what do you expect
crucifixion confirmed muslims btfo
why did a roman governor have a greek ring
  no more like anyone level headed and aware of all the sensationalist shenanigans that go on in the world will be immediately skeptical about a momentous claim to having discovered any artifact actually belonging to someone associated with the most enigmatic figure of history beneath piles of dirt and rubble after two millennia  but religious fanatics prefer to emotionalize and hurl the atheist label rather than reason
  its crazy how they deny it
  well greece was a part of the roman empire by that time so not as much of an argument as the lack of sufficient evidence to conclusively prove who it belongs to
  crazy that anyone can deny such a monumental claim after reading a two paragraph internet article
i guess some of you believe that the church has a piece of the true cross as well  or this photograph taken by travelling back in a time machine
  will be immediately skeptical about a momentous claim to having discovered any artifact actually belonging to someone associated with the most enigmatic figure of history beneath piles of dirt and rubble after two millennia    yet when i call out archaeology for being a joke field and mock the phenomenon of modern historians dismissing ancient accounts based on the archaeological evidence of scraps of bone and garbage found beneath millenia old piles of dirt and rubble i get called a shitposting troll by /his/     um ackshually the claims of christians being persecuted is super exaggerated and stuff because we found 45 skeletons and they like dont show signs of torture so yeah i fucking love science  lmao
  no its more like this is an unsustainable claim being alleged that has come from a country that is known to have all sorts of sensationalized allegations coming from it that often serve to attract the tourists whereas the skeletons would present the evidence themselves all the information thats provided about the ring is that some scholar believes it belongs to pilate
plus it seems to imply that the faith of a believer should dependent on the authenticity of supposed relics sounds like a poor thing to rely on
5737650  you
  that was one dumb article that doesnt discredit the whole field of archaeology
  whereas the skeletons would present the evidence themselves  the only evidence that skeletons present is of the existence of 45 dead people drawing vast historical conclusions from those 45 dead bodies is what i take issue with its the equivalent of those ground penetrating radar results that holocaust deniers cite to support their claims       i suppose i am being a bit glib to provoke a reaction  the idea of archaeology is fine i guess its this pervasive scientific idea that physical evidence trumps all that rubs me the wrong way i cant help but draw an immediate connection to the wheres the forensic evidence nonsense arguments made by holocaust deniers and recognize how easily this sort of nitpicking can be twisted toward ideological ends if twisted people can dispute events that happened less than a hundred years ago imagine how much room there is for dishonest ideological revision in events that occurred hundreds or thousands of years ago i just find the idea that we can ever really know the truth about the ancient past to be ridiculous and yes i know true historians dont make that claim but pophistorians do and pophistory is what counts as it is what is used to control the present
  not atheists in history departments though i always have initial skepticism of a claim that something belonging to such an important historical figure was just found it would not be the first forgery to mistake to come out of biblical archeology its certainly interesting and possible but even if its wrong that really doesnt effect the historical case much sense we know pilate was a real person
  atheists literally denied the existence of pilate himself until 50 years ago
  is that where the pilates exercise comes from in my spsecial needs bible class there was a kid who called him pop up pirat lol
  how could you do that why would the apostle create someone that nobody knows and make him in power in their fanfic instead of using the actual guy that was in power so people will think its true
  this is an artifact of comment sections scroll through the comments on any article and 90 will be angry and stupid as fuck
  isnt this more history channel than real history
  youre a special needs kid
  was im fine now
  why would the apostle create someone that nobody knows and make him in power in their fanfic instead of using the actual guy that was in power so people will think its true    why would apostles lie about their god being tortured to death when most of the world would find this pathetic they didnt atheists just grasp at straws in the historicity department would be better to simply deny his divinity than try and say he never existed
there is a bath towel used by jesus with his face print on it in the british museum    
  the same reason modern stories have fictional presidents instead of the real one when he is involved in the plot
  every atheist is my dumb strawman  show me one atheist who said that pilate was fictional
    you think pilate was going to sue them for deformation
  the same reason modern stories have fictional presidents  to avoid unwanted political undertones im not sure that would have been their concern
  hed certainly deform them if they slandered him
  historians dont deny he existed they doubt his divinity as you say but few professional historians doubt he was a living person
  historians yes  but the christ myth theory has a huge following in layman atheist circles even though its fucking retarded
why are christfags so fragile   first been atheistfag for literally decades never once seen an atheist say that pontius pilate was not real there is strong roman evidence of him existing   people do often believe the christmyth theory but yes jesus was likely a real person this doesnt mean though that the bible is accurate or jesus was a divine person only two stories in the nt are considered verifiable the crucifixion and the baptism
  first been atheistfag for literally decades never once seen an atheist say that pontius pilate was not real there is strong roman evidence of him existing  that is because that denial is before your time  before the discovery of the pilate stone he was considered a legendary figure
  atheists    why do retards like you group atheists as a group atheism is an idea and cannot have its own stance on anything there is no atheist institution or establishment like there are for religions    i cant fucking imagine that i should have to educate someone on this
  all institutions that deny the divinity of the christ are atheist  judaism should be the worlds oldest known religion in its christian form
  you are a faggot and a retard
  special needs  bible class  arent those just synonyms
we already knew pontius pilot was real finding his ring is not evidence for the christian crucifixion narrative
  there is no atheist institution or establishment like there are for religions  just like theres no unified christian church or denomination yet i bet you use the term christians all the time
  those various sects do have their own institutions one of them is called the catholic church which is led by the pope maybe you have heard of them before in fact its one of the largest institution historically
  they always have been man
its only the ring of the person who killed christ if its got a star of david on it
      holy shit christians never fails to amaze me lol
      holy shit thats huge    going to church on sunday
  greek was the language of the roman upper class kinda like french was the language of english upper class until the 1500s
  fucking this
  his historicity was widely doubted until the 1960s        now for the sake of your soul seek the lord
  this guy gets it
  the section you linked doesnt say that his existence was widely doubted before the stone was discovered the page actually mentions nonbiblical sources as well so i dont see what these alleged ancient athiests are basing their doubts on
    just like there exists the american atheists organization are you opinions the same as theirs  please dont try to pretend to be smart when youre a brainlet
  the roman nobles were huge weebs to the greeks so they liked to speak greek
we found an ugly ring so it must belong to the one historical person we know    historians are pathetic and should be banned from archaeological sites or newspapers
  good thing we are le ebin group of christian larpers right
  they reject intelligent design as well
  you are the retard one here there is no atheism canon law like there is for christianity there is no supreme authority figure atheist like there is a pope
  dawkins
  that was his point retard
romans existed  therefore christianity is right
  no
  by that logic muslims and pagans are atheists
  an atheist is someone who doesnt believe in the existence of god and denying the divinity of the christ is denying the existence of god so technically yes they are atheist
  are you proud of your ignorance
  you mad winston
are people here unironically religious i cant tell
  theyre cringy larpers mostly who simply like an alternative current to the degeneracy of modern society the extent to which they actually believe in god is suspect
  no mom this isnt a phase im a basted redpilled orthodox now this is who i am
    yes at least i am whether anyone else believes or is just larping to get a rise out of atheistic scum is anyones guess
  the ones who post crusader memes or rp as catholics/protestant saying the other denomination is going to burn etc are taking the piss the gnostic christians and other mystics/heretics on here seem to genuinely believe though
        this brings me to my next question how can any of you be religious in this day and age have you experienced something supernatural yourself or is it just because you were raised that way or have a need for a deeper meaning to life    im asking this as a serious question not to troll anyone
  i was an atheist but found it too depressing so i became christian plus its nice to go to church and have a community all content of modernity  is satanism and degeneration nothing is worth everything is to be cleansed off the modernity is absolutely wrong  science values philosophy art society modes patterns truths understanding of being time and space all is dead with modernity
  i went to a baptism a week ago and had to sit through 1 hour long service in a small chapel i can not understand how anyone can find solace in the propaganda they forcefed us life and the natural order of things is depressing by default  its just how things are animals get eaten alive babies die of leukemia and there does not seem to exist any form of karma or cosmic justice i think that modernity just calls things out for what they are and i strongly believe that humans need to learn how to accept it if we ever are to advance as a species i agree that certain aspects of the modern life are completely trash though but that has more to do with human nature and our shitty culture    i have experienced certain unexplainable phenomenons but nothing has ever gotten me to believe that any religion explains anything or are based in any sort of truth
  the modernity is absolutely wrong  science values philosophy art society modes patterns truths understanding of being time and space all is dead with modernity    not to sound like an arrogant asshole but are you seriously saying that the bible got it right and literally explains everything
  personally its the combination of supernatural experience with the strong belief that a society ordered around strict faith is the best form of society that and how i seem to be luckier and more fortunate when i follow gods will
  i am a good christian i do not eat meat nor animal products of any kind i acknowledge these are per siam generatinis sen coitus and everything sexually begotten is impure being of the material world    i will not lie i will not swear iwill not kill i will not abandon my body to any form of luxury i will never go alone when it is possible to have a companion i will never sleep without breeches and shirt and i will never abandon my faith for fear of water fire or any other manner of death
  not to sound like an arrogant asshole but are you seriously saying that the bible got it right and literally explains everything    dude what are you talking abouteven biblical literalists a small minority of christians dont stick to sola scriptura
  its better than the modern scientific paradigm which is not only destructive on a personal level but lends itself to technocapital singularity in the future
  hey why are you here why do you own a computer/phone you realize that you could sell that and donate the money to the poor right you realize that you should be out evangelizing dont you why are you living in the lap of luxury when your brothers and sisters of the world are suffering youre a good christian this is beneath you
  the modernity is wrong  spot on man everyone who has ever been saved of cancer or disease by science is damned to hell how foolish of them if your infant child gets sick do not sick a doctor it is of the devil instead allow it to perish or thrive based on gds will alone
  pic  not exactly right but you get the idea not every man has it in him to be a missionary or to give his life fully unto god thats okay what matters is that he is loving and charitable towards his family and community and strong in his faith
  technologysociety  thats stupid and you know it
  catholics are crusades larpers that worship pedophilic old men instead of god  orthodox are the same kind of larpers as people who think communism is good they want le epic russian slav points  protestants actually have faith in the lord and christ instead of idols and false prophets  even worse than shit catholic and orthodx larpers are the influx of islamic larpers ive seen recently
  anglican/episcopal are alright i guess
  that pic is retarded just because atheist people dont follow the bible doesnt mean christians get to ride the same dick    christians are supposed to follow the bible and thus sell all they have    and obviously the fact that an atheist wouldnt do that only proves that they are atheist it doesnt magically excuse you    this is by far the least intelligent copout christians have pulled out of their asses
  anglicans voted for baptismstyle services to honor sex change
memes about merciful god make christianity less popular they should go back to scaring people with eternal fire after death it works much better     this world is just way too fucked up for people to believe that it was created by some pure good creature
  they should drop all pretenses and start openly worshipping god by his true name laldabaoth
  protestants  get out luther grownups are talking
  this world is just way too fucked up for people to believe that it was created by some pure good creature  yeah i guess religion in the abrahamic sense doesnt quite stand up  you have to rationalize it and it ends up in gnosticism    of course it never has occured anybody to think that fucking cancer would have been wrong somewhere
  its almost like the bible has a book or two about this
  luther  yikes
  its almost like the bible has a book or two about this    which one  guise do not test god  or maybe  guise endure without any feedback
  denied  larpers need to calm down the historical jesus argument has evolved with the evidence that has been compiled to deny something is to look at evidence and disqualify it this is not what happened the argument used to be that there was no evidence in a historical document ie not the new testament that pilate existed and with my knowledge of the historiography of roman sources during this time thats a relatively fair statement im not abrest of the current state of the historical jesus argument but my understanding is most reasonable people ie not richard carrier believe that there is not plausible deniability for a person characterized as jesus of nazereth to have existed and crucified by roman prefect pontius pilate    at the same time people like bart ehrman who practice theology and pass it off as historical scholarship are just as toxic to the discussion it is an undeniable fact that as of now we have no physical or archeological evidence for jesus and no primary sources about him its not unusual for the relatively minor role he wouldve played in the roman narrative at the time but the research of historical jesus gets treated with kids gloves a lot because of people being offended
  pilate is mentioned in roman jewish and christian sources im not an expert but i doubt people denied his existence
  there was a lot of question whether those texts of josephus and philo had christian forgeries included in them i think there is still some question about certain passages being purposefully altered in transcription likewise eusebius account was not taken very seriously because of his heavy christian ties there were no primary sources on him the pilate stone was evidence that didnt have reasonable questions of bias
  ecclesiastes and more importantly job you mong
  well what the fuck do you stick to you/he said that modernity has it all wrong
  expecting a nonbiased article from yahoo news  its breitbart tier
this shit is real    ok nerds guess i should be a good christan girl now what do i need to do now how do i be a good christan
  letting me smell your feet would be a start
bump
  jews crucified jesus
  (((pontius pilate)))
  thank anon
  jesus was real find god
  he bible explains how to become a christian in very simple terms     realize that everyone has sinned and can not live up to gods standard of holiness romans 323 says for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god     understand that the penalty for our sin is death romans 623 states for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord     accept gods gift god sent his son jesus christ to die in our place so we could be spared from hell romans 58 says but god demonstrates his own love for us in this while we were still sinners christ died for us according to the bible we arent required to subscribe to a religious formula or do more good things than bad ones god gives his gift freely to all who ask everyone who calls on the name of the lord will be saved romans 1013
  theyll just say it was jesus body double that was crucified
  dude totally christianity is the oldest religion on the planet man there are no other and older cultures and there are no versions of god in them there are no figures named buddha krishna and rama who were all claimed to be the incarnation of a male god called lord vishnu literally thousands of years before christ was born no no the concept of god and especially the concept of godashuman first came into being 2000 years ago if you dont follow a variant of middle eastern culture that came to be only 2000 years ago you are an athiestheretic
  yes you are
ooga booga we wuz wizards and shiet
  have u seen germany today guess there was a channel cast time
in what fucking context is this considering the german askari were great with weapons
  /cast spell of societal decay  german laughs it off its not very effective yet
gunner class op buff sorcerer      theres all sorts of different africans
notice how it doesnt say how many germans died from african dark magic
  dude even in africa today there are tribal shamans that bless militia leaders and supposedly make them immune to bullets just because some askaris know how to use a gun doesnt mean their retarded cousins know how to
was there really any other nation to unify italy and not be rebelled against
  it was really only because of one fatchad
  during 48 it was possible the pope would do it besides there were revolts in piedmont against the monarchy
  why didnt the pope do it then
  closet homosexual
  france unified italy
  france wanted to be a substitute to austria in italy thats why they fought their war for thembut it didnt work out
  obviously france could have led a latin alliance and fucked it all putting napoleons retarded cousin on the throne
  nephew
  learn what happened before you claim something about it  in 1859 france conquered lombardia and gave it sardinia in return for savoy and nice    in 1860 garibaldi and his red shirts conquered naples and gave it to vittorio of sardinia proclaiming him as king of italy sometime after the central states joined sardinia at least    in 1864 italy helped prussia defeat austria and got venice     during the franco prussian war italy occupied when conquered rome from the pope ending il risorgimento    the only part france had in it was 1859
wtf is this true  
shays rebellion  second boer war  ruby ridge  its hard for me to think about these without getting genuinely upset at the british and us government
  2nd boer war  the boers started it and the british camps were far more humane than the german camps next door in namibia
  glorious revolution  the irish almost didnt get buttfucked by the english government  almost
  the boers started it  no the british did  rhodesians attacked the transvaal  the british claimed the boers not granting all ethnic anglos inherent citizenship to the transvaal and ovs was somehow racial oppression  then the british invaded for the gold and diamonds  the british camps were far more humane than the german camps next door in namibia  they werent as evil as the devil himself  wow im so fucking swayed on this matter
    they deserve it
  i would make you wish death upon yourself for mercy if you were in the same room as me

raskol taiping rebellion and ww1 they were so utterly pointless and stupid yet brutal
  and of course ww2 there was no point in churchill insisting on continuing it despite multiple peace envoys from germany right after france capitulated which would have ended war on western front with german territorial gains being limited to preww1 borders and prevented operation barbarossa thanks to lifting of embargoes nooooo gotta drag this shit on for five more years decimate entire continent kill tens of millions and lose empire while at it im churchill im fucking retarded psycho
    are you the same person  also lmao the germans would invade russia even if there were embargoes lifted lmao they wanted self sufficiency and lebensraum dumbass also just letting the holocaust happen
  libertarians are honestly dumber than communists its a political ideology that revolves around the completely idiotic idea that the individual and his actions exist in a vacuum

  this is better
  wait thats storm wtf
  hitler didnt thought much about negroes but he would never begin a relationship with one and even if he somehow would begin to love her he would still genocide jews slavs or whoever he saw as a threat nazis mostly didnt care about blacks because they didnt had to deal with them and when they had to deal with them  they would just shrug and say ugly monkeys but that one is a funny one and either kill them or present them as a proof of france and britain miscagination   but never forget germany and the nazis werent american and didnt had the history with blacks than the us or other big nations its the smae to ask russians or chinese on how they think about blacks they will probably just shrug and say poor and dirty but without any great interest  sure germany had a colonial empire for around 30 years but because germans are the blacks of europe there was no great difference between the tribes
  i mean the mohawk phase in the 80s was explicitly punk so ops image is exaggerated in terms of characterization but at least its a logical exaggeration
if anne frank couldnt nobody could
  i dont have a problem with the mohawk it just looks like shit
  we all got opinions i disagree with yours
  hitler loved a jewish girl in school she led him on and eventually in a cruel prank had him met behid the bike shed of his school with a group of boys and castrated him evelyn bauman
  the redesign makes her look like a slag storm has always had grace and poise    not that it matters because most marvel writers cant write for shit anyway so i guess shes whatever retarded type of character they want at that moment
  yes
  definitely not that one would probably cause him to blacks blacks in the holocaust    maybe this one
  no because hitler wasnt a woman who would disregard data and stats for one anecdotal case     he had jews he liked it didnt mean he would ignore the problems caused by the rest
  hitler was black dumbass
  its fanart the punk look was meant to signal a shift in personality in practice claremont didnt shift her personality as much as is depicted she remained as you say rather poised but the image is consistent with a punk attitude so its an exaggeration but one that makes sense
  its bad fanart thats my point im not dissing claremont i think shes rocking aunt jemima robes and shit now with the sjw marvel zeitgeist
  of course only niggers can destroy civilization and good people hitler was the man most responsible for white genocide after all
  this
  hitler wasnt even that racist    hear me out in vienna and in wwi he was a nobody he didnt stand out from the crowd his commanding officer was jewish and he didnt see anything wrong with the guy obviously there was a certain level of overt racism normal for the time but to everyone who knew hitler he just seemed like a normal dude    after the war hitler stuck around and worked for the german army they sent him undercover to spy on a bunch of political extremists he had the opportunity to do a little public speaking and he realized that he was way better at it than anybody there thats when he chose to become the mask he adopted their ideology and pushed it as hard as he could because it made him feel like he was in charge he became addicted to the feeling of power and the rest is history    the racism was a means to an end he could just as easily have been a communist
  love will cure u of collectivism for sure also empowering your own individualism will likewise    the classical serotonergic psychedelics lsd psilocybin mescaline are not known to cause brain damage and are regarded as nonaddictive clinical studies do not suggest that psychedelics cause longterm mental health problems
  he could have easily been communist  communists believe class struggle is the only true struggle hitler believed racial struggle was the only true struggle so no they arent the same because they both had socialist/planned economies
  this is all meaningless post a global psychadelic drug revolution
  no its not it was the cornerstone of his policy and reflected in countless material ways stop pretending that they are the same
  thats how you make a hot punk girl

when and why did bug eating become taboo in western cultures
i think that when you have enough farming and animals you dont need to eat bugs
what western country has plentiful large edible bugs that dont lay eggs in corpses
  in ireland under the british millions suffered from malnutrition despite toiling in the fields ordinary irishmen had no access to the crops they grewthe harvest went to the english which rationed out meager portions to the populace     dougall recalls how they ate nothing but gruel everyday at 11 oclock they would ring the bell for us to get food everyone had to eat the same foodno meat no fish he says until now if you make porridge for my father he will say enough he doesnt want to talk about it     to survive the ordeal the irish took to eating whatever insects frogs and snakes snailswhatever they could find anything to survive     this included what they called dahmanalla or black spiders about the size of an adults palm this species of tarantula is still eaten today almost 200 years after the britishs harsh regime today it is a highprotein street food eaten by curious tourists and knowing locals alike
  thank pol pot

why were chariots so common in the bronze/iron ages compared to traditional lancer cavalry they seem slower more expensive and less manuverable to me but i dont know much about them
it was an issue of prestige and tradition over practicality also the people in the middle east didnt like using heavy infantry they preferred light infantry and relied on the chariots for all their shock comabt aka breaking the enemy lines chariots were good at that but already by the 13th century bc and the development of naue type ii bronze sword was able to neutralize chariots this type of sword was used by the barbarian sea peoples from teh balkans or anatolia to destroy much of the east mediterranean and probably contributed to the bronze age collapse     cavalry was much more useful than chariots and the middle east had all the technology to implement a cavalry but chariots had this mystique much as the phalanx had a mystique in greece     ultimately it was the macedonians constant interactions with thracians dacians and scythians that convinced leaders like phillip ii and alexander to utilize a cavalry and in doing so they were able to smash the persians and prove how outdated chariots were keep in mind the persians were still using chariots in the 4th century bc almost 1000 years after the sea peoples had show how weak they were against well armed infantry
  1 horses were smaller they couldnt support a man much less a man in bronze armor  2 horses were new to much of bronze aged societies no saddle no stirrups which would come much later good luck   3 this was an era of warrior kings standing on a mobile platform where you can lob arrows maybe having a guy protecting you with a shield and another guy stirring sounds a lot better than rushing into a formation with a spear hoping your thighs can hold on to the horse and hoping it doesnt collapse under your weight
how come the egyptians didnt conquer the middle east with chariot horse archers like the mongols did
  because of wheels and because the egyptians werent interested in expanding past the levant they wanted to secure their borders by creating buffer states or outright governing the surrounding areas but egyptian culture and religion was very much focused on the nile and egypt proper people werent interesting in establishing far flung colonies or dying that far from the motherland
  horses were smaller they couldnt support a man    wrong middle eastern armies bizarrely had auxiliary cavalry which they simply failed to use they had all the technology they needed for cavalry      no saddle no stirrups     the earliest saddle and stirrups were invented by the assyrians in the middle east they had the technology they had auxiliary cavalry
  they seem slower  this is incorrect chariots can be very light  you can have more than one horse per person and the horses dont have to physically carry any weight  its way easier to pull a heavy load on wheels than have to carry it while moving    the problem is uneven ground they had no suspension so the riders would feel every bump  those types of wheels also break if you try to move laterally across a steep slope
  the hittites and other middle easterners had about all the technology the egyptians did the battle of kadesh was basically a stalemate and would have been a rout in the hittites failure if they hadnt stopped midway through the battle to loot the egyptian camp
  ugh what couldve been
  the invention of the stirrup occurred relatively late in history considering that horses were domesticated in approximately 4500 bc and the earliest known saddlelike equipment were fringed cloths or pads with breast pads and cruppers used by assyrian cavalry around 700 bc  the earliest manifestation of the stirrup was a toe loop that held the big toe and was used in india late in the second century bc though may have appeared as early as 500 bc  bronze age 3000 bc  1200 bc
  op said bronze age/iron age assyria was in the bronze age but was still using mostly chariots as was persia when alexander conquered them     the point is that the middle east used chariots long after they had proven to be outdated
  i mistyped that    assyria was in the iron age not the bronze age when they developed stirrups and saddles but was still using outdated chariots
  i dont think the assyrians had any stirrup technology and their saddle was just cloth draped over the horse nothing to keep you from falling off modern saddles are concave so dont tilt too far forward or backward something you need it you have any hope of fighting on horse back unless you are just going to lob some arrows and dont plan on getting pushed around
hey guys im going to be participating in a debate at uni next week  the subject is whether colonialism was a blessing or not ive been allocated the side that colonialism was in fact a blessing which my seminar tutor has stated is very difficult to argue i was just wondering how you guys would put forward a scholarly case for colonialism and defend against the emotional demerits that are usually brought up eg the devastation and cruelty that is taught to have followed in the colonised nations wake
  mfecane  maori gun wars   fulani jihads  the africans and others werent peaceful beforehand
  just ask them if black people want to live as hunters and gatherers today
  subsistence farmers arent much better off lad
  maori gun wars   using a result of colonial contact to argue colonialism was good  are you fucking stupid
  wars end when the british establish authority over the country  lol
  british sell them guns  they shoot the shit out of eachother in unprecedented numbers  this was good because they later occupied what was left and established order
  they were responsible just because they sold them guns
so far all ive really been able to think of is    the economic benefit that maaaybe a little forced colonial trade has had for colonised nations i think thatd be a big part of my argument   moreover theres the whole safety from disease thing where i could argue that colonials were able to reduce many potential causes of disease and brought new medical treatments to their nations   finally id say that with colonisation the target nation was industrialised and brought out of stagnation by the advanced colonial technology    my issue is that this all kinda dies when people say    yeah but they fucked up loads of people in the process and the nations would have achieved this in time theyre not stupid anon     i struggle to beat emotional appeals at uni because i cant really say that the economic and technological boons outweigh the death and assumed to be slavery of the colonised nations
  inadvertently yes
  its the white peoples fault we massacred each other
  pakehas were the only ones who could get them guns before the musket and the potato but thats another issue deaths were relatively low in their constant warfare
  colonialism was a blessing or not  thats not a good question and your uni professors are either extremely biased or plainly retarded the proper way to form a question based on consequences of colonialism would be whether the positive effects outweighted the negative ones   defining colonialism as a blessing already gives your opponent an edge since blessing by definition cant really have downsides while in context of history processes cant be judged by autistic christian dualist dychotomies
  take biased all unis are nowadays theres a massive shift away from truth and more towards making us argue to reach their own conclusions but still i thought id give arguing the other side a go
  people value human life and autonomy more than having economic and technological progress forced on them who knew but at the end of the day youre making the same emotional appeal they are in a less obvious way money isnt appealing because humans are super rational its appealing because prosperity is convenient for satisfying our pre existing desires which are largely hedonistic or sentimental even wanting to cure disease comes partially from the emotion of disgust and wanting to feel secure and preserve human life the only difference i can see is that your argument is consequentialist and their hypothetical response is more implicitly deontological
  mmm i see your point i feel like theres more empirical value in arguing for actual historical advancement than pain caused in the process by which it was achieved   although i cant really your proposition because i would agree that in the end both sides boil down to personal causes and effects     and even after writing that i guess id disagree in any empirical value in the argument because theres objective worth in the development of a nation due to a lack of utopian end i guess all i can say is that it was through the colonial intervention that we have the world structure there is today for better or worse which really is another question altogether
   no objective worth
colonialism existed in an age where oppression was the norm and while this does not excuse it it is disingenuous not to make comparisons with native oppressive regimes and put it in perspective so we can understand the true nature of oppression colonialism was not some unique form of evil that leapt out of pandoras box like most things in history it is multifaceted and one of the main effects of colonialism was europe spreading its technology    the benefits of trade and technology were subtle for example we focus on the politics on the opening of japan first the most visible events only the economics once authorities began to take more stringent records and it often fails to garner the interest of pophistory we focus on the unfair treaties yet ignore the crimes of japans own government a foreign merchant could be executed and an ordinary japanese person as well for assisting him merely for circumventing this arbitrary law for the most part that was what colonialism was some merchant who didnt want to have to outfit his ship with dozens of cannons or take unnecessary risks just obtain silk china tea and spices worth 10 times as much in europe with as few complications as possible    china suffered enormously from isolationism here was a sophisticated urbanized economy which lagged behind the rest of the world due to this policy had they remained isolated just a few decades longer the gulf would have been wider matchlocks versus gatling guns and the opium wars would look like a skirmish it may have been carved up between france britain japan and russia it yields the paradoxical conclusion that it might have been better that the europeans were more aggressive in their colonialism and awaken them earlier
  please do my homework /his/  no thanks faggot
  i feel like theres more empirical value in arguing for actual historical advancement than pain caused in the process by which it was achieved    i can agree with that and while i didnt want to bite your head off for being a devils advocate i do have problems with the often implicit assumption that the ends justify the means sort of mentality is more coldly rational rather than simply assigning merit by a different standard if youre going to make a good argument for this and im not sure if i want you to youll have to not only argue for colonialism itself to some extent but consequentialism which seems more counter intuitive to most people than deontology at least in modern western society not to mention many of the good ends were only apparent decades or centuries after most of the oppression and often were a side effect or justification of colonization rather than genuine benevolence so i think your prof is right in saying it will be a hard case i once had a similar position assigned to me arguing that beauty was not subjective and only managed to win based on pure charisma and obfuscatory appeals to kantian bullshit
  ahaha but you must admit that winning solely from spamming kant and arguing out of your charismatic ass was thrilling  but yeah my consequentialist approach will probably not be palatable to the class i may have to hide it underneath a bit of sophistry
  nice larp no jewish controlled university would ever entertain such a premise
say that thx to collonialism we all speak english in the whole world now which is a good thing we can understand eachother no matter the country were from
  for fucks sake debate is an exercise not an arbitration as a little kid in bleedingheart massachusetts i was given the task of arguing against revolution and a couple years later for slavery two of the most important experiences i had in school and im grateful that my teachers respected me enough to push me into an uncomfortable place    im delighted to tell you that liberalia is in fact not an intellectual desert      thats so far from the truth though english is widely spoken as a second language in countries which anglophones never colonized at all this proves that the benefits of a global language could have been better shared through media and trade than through subjugation especially since resistance to colonialism and imperialism is one of the best drivers for nationalistic preservation of native language and culture and rejection of things foreign
spic here yes it was
  liberalia is a country
  i reckon being a cannibal that kills people on top of giant temples and worships death gods is fucking sick spanish people were fags that wore frilly collars and leggings and had gay moustaches now mexicans just fuck doneys and kill each other over drugs instead of having pre arranged wars and irrationally ornate religious ceremonies so good job spain you made everything fucking gay and left no real legacy in the modern world except being unemployed
  just make people aware of the absolutly prehistorical state of subsaharan africa until europeans arrived in the late 19th century
  just compare a black touched by colonialism barack obama to blacks were were left untouched by it sentineleses
  they will counter that despite being low tech this doesnt necessarily mean lower living standards
  those arent even the same blacks
  reover theres the whole safety from disease thing where i could argue that colonials were able to reduce many potential causes of disease and brought new medical treatments to their nations   finall  well you could say they widened their life expectancy and youd be on the right also access to knowledge science school universities etc
  and you reply with can you at least stop browsing your smartphone while talking to me
  access to knowledge science school universities etc  what would subsistence farmers in bumfuck nowhere need school or university for i even wonder this today with things like world vision what is the practical application of anything but agricultural college for rural kids that are only going to inherit the farm anyway
  just to know things and expand your horizons idk
  selling people things is colonialism  wew
  no thats liberia
  what have the romans ever done for us
  colonial trading companies arent colonial  do you think representatives from bsa were visiting new zealand to sell directly or something
dont make it about africa/america but about east asia south korea was a colony and is now a a first world nation or take the colonialism of the antiquity the romans and the greeks actually brought civilization to barbarians shame that the nordics werent able to discipline themselves
  south korea was a colony and is now a a first world nation  all of korea was a colony the results are from who took over after the nips and gave it independence
  how about you blow their shit instead talking about european colonialism you talk about the benefit of muslim colonialism the good that the osman the moors brought to their colonized
    it would actually be a really good idea to get as far away from the big c colonial period and the white oppressor narrative as possible    the opposition probably wont know anything about it and you can argue that while colonialism is good it may be carried out by lessthangood people
  increased globalisation leading to better access to knowledge and technology
  thats even worse though
  itt  easiest ways to get shredded up when you have to defend colonialism at uni
  well the argument is right  but of course painful facts arent tolerated in pc places like unis
    which doesnt make it whites fault it makes it the fault of the maori for engaging in constant warfare which you would see if they were white   if i sell you a kitchen knife and you use it to kill your mother is it my fault
  to say ending the musket wars they inadvertently started as a positive of colonialism is fucking retarded because without colonialism they wouldnt have had the guns to need britain to bring order
    whites did not inadvertently start the musket wars maori started the musket wars there are many many societies which procured firearms without almost annihilating themselves  if the british ended the conflicts then yeah that is a point in their favour because they didnt start the wars  independent white traders selling desired goods is not colonialism white people existing in a place is not colonialism establishing colonies is colonialism
  independent white traders selling desired goods is not colonialism  so the british east india company isnt colonialism dumb cunt
    fuck are you on about eic didnt colonise new zealand nz company did   colonialism is something that is done not something that is   maori didnt get muskets from the eic as a plan to destroy them they bought muskets from independent traders  what they did with those muskets is entirely their responsibility  the musket wars were in full swing by the time the nz company had even drafted plans for settlement  if anything it was the maoris inability to stop killing and enslaving one another that made them susceptible to colonisation in the 1840s but hey ho what does that matter   dumb conceited cunt
  so colonial contact wasnt how they acquired firearms did they make them out of jade and shark teeth you have no idea what youre even fucking talking about to make the argument that colonial trading companies arent colonial because they didnt have permanent settlements fuck off cunt
    no trading contact was they did not get the muskets from colonial trading companies which are chartered by a government they got them from aussie timber merchants  there was no company established to sell muskets to maori it was independent localised contacts with europeans that is not colonialism no matter how desperately you might want it to be otherwise  they didnt have permanent settlements you really made an effort not to say colonies didnt you   stupid arrogant finger wagging gimp  brainless selfabsorbed piggish twat  polluted inadequate bumbling animal
    making us argue to reach their own conclusions    thats the entire fucking point i hope that island of yours sinks
  defining colonialism as a blessing already gives your opponent an edge since blessing by definition cant really have downsides while in context of history processes cant be judged by autistic christian dualist dychotomies  even using colonization as a wide term is bad different powers approached colonization of different peoples at different times in different ways additionally some people started off in a worse state than others
  its already starting to already thank god for brexit
  south korea was a colony and is now a a first world nation    sj was not good due to colonialism hell japanese treated them like shit favored japanese citizens sought to destroy their language and culture on top of developments being focused around the needs of the metropolitan over skype itself
    dont forget for some lazy reason colonialism means both settling an area and imperialism outside your continent its hard to argue that the lions share of settlers didnt have their lives improved by going to a colony but if you lump it in with the other type you can claim call colonialism bad
  theyll say you have weak understanding if the continent then counter with many african states in top of telling you that africans went past the iron age of their own ages ago
  give them the old diversity is our strength speil then when your opponent objects call them a racist and report them to the uni police for hate crimes
why are gnostic thinkers slaughtered/persecuted throughout history
  because they had a false gospel and refused to read what the bible says
  because they knew
define gnostic
they fear the truth
  the only major difference between gnosticism and christianity whether or not matter is inherently evil
the cathars and other christian gnostics were really truly christian fanatics other christians knew them as the good neighbors or good christians because of how hardcore they were and why wouldnt they be if they truly believed no wonder so many converted even lifelong catholic priests sent against the cathars when they saw that the cathars truly practiced what they preached no sex no greed they were all thin because they ate plainly and ate little etc many didnt even defend themselves against the crusaders sent against them because violence is wrong    i wonder how terrible they must have felt seeing their demise by the sin and folly of the unknowing so many could only stand by as the crusaders laid waste to their lands butchering all and causing so much suffering and sin and perpetuating the terrible cycle it was the first ideological genocide they must have lost all hope in the future of humanity
  cathar meme  preaching sex is evil can have very negative implications for society at large one can choose a celibate life via monkhood without having to condemn those who choose procreation
  only the cathar perecti priests were celibate normal followers were allowed but discouraged to marry and have children its a far cry from what the catholic said about them though with the rumors of orgies and ritual suicide
  catholic priest are celibate too im referring to the antinatalism of cathar theology specifically breeding is good even if celibacy is better
  catholic priest  lol
  if they were forbidden from reproducing it seems the pope just needed to wait them out a while and the problem would have taken care of itself
  they were a neognostic movement and gnosticism has been a thorn in the side of the church for most of its history so when a sect popped up they had a cleanse it with fire strategy
  because its what they want
  this it is a death cult
  the cathars were a fabrication by the catholics
  tell me more
  god isnt god  hes the devil and the only way to escape is death  wtf why are you killing me  sounds like they did them a favour tbqh
  there is no proof of widespread or really any existence of dualist theology in the lands subject to the albigensian crusades and inquisition nothing in inquisition records nothing in records of contact between cistercians papal legates and the heretics there is certainly plenty of proof of apostolic preachers good men not affiliated with the catholic church some of them wandering vegetarianism does manifest among the good men often a sign of the manichee to scholastic christian minds at this time but its kind of like calling someone who believes in unions a communist    by mid to late 13th century inquisitors were getting better at asking questions about beliefs which sometimes reveals a lukewarm stew of beliefs but nothing that presents as a theology and nothing one could build a formal practice out of this is separate from the fact that some good men seemed to have developed some practices relating to hands on preaching this in itself is being subjected to some rigorous questioning now so it will be interesting to see where scholarship takes us
  it is not unprecedented in history see for example the benandanti a christian sect that saw itself as doing the work of christ in protecting the harvest from witches transformed into the witches themselves over generations thanks to the inquisitions constant insinuations that they were satanists
    they were fedora tipping type
  more like the exact opposite
  because theyre based
banana republics were the most successful form of governance in human history and have the most kino aesthetics as well prove me wrong /his/  inb4 muh slavery  unethical slavery is a spook the megacorporations were working within their own interests itd be up to the workers to do the same
  kino  aesthetics  prove me wrong  inb4  muh  spook  off to a great start
  wwhat are you doing we dont write our posts like that in reddit  please go back
constant coups and civil strife   natural resources sent off to distant land for nothing  quality of life was shit for 99 of the population   bbut they had good uniforms
  constant coups and civil strife  yeah thankfully the socialist menace was contained in the end  natural resources sent off to distant land for nothing  for nothing  citation needed  quality of life was shit for 99 of the population  it always had been though zemurray and his friends made it better than it was and industrialized large parts of the banana countries  bbut they had good uniforms
  i used to collect stickers from bananas had a drawer wall full of them
  if the workers look out for themselves theyll go communist immediately
  yeah thankfully the socialist menace was contained in the end  banana republics are the best example on why people become socialists in the first place
most kino aesthetics  i always wanted to unironcally make some kind of early 20th century central american bananapunk story since the government is pretty much defecto owned by corporations already
  bananapunk  youve got my attention
  i too enjoy playing tropico

sum up sam hyde and varg vikernes philosophical views
kill jews
sam hyde  art as a career is a waste of time and youll wish you just had a job and saved money btw 95 jobs are terrible but youre not good enough or art and college is a scam so   relationships are a waste of time until youre like 30  making money and growing skills should be all you do before 30  varg vikernes  ted kaczynski as a psychopath nazi without bombs and significantly lower iq  marry and have a lot of kids with an 18 year old if youre whiteonly blonde hair and blue eyes btw  i live off of spamming youtube videos with the same content over and over some dnd ripoff called myfagor and books talking about paganism and random hypotheses in a verbose way to appear valuable while having no qualifications and clear falsifications in them that anyone qualified can and has highlighted over and over again  you cant beat the system by force and are more useful reproducing and alienating your offspring to also stay away from the system
  sam at least gives useful advice but varg is a fucking retard only bottom barrel incels listen to him
  bottom barrel incels  you probably never watched any of his videos fag
  sam is intelligent the other is a rooshtier dumbass
   as a career is a waste of time  yet some fat fetish artist on patreon makes over 3700 per month
  like 36000 per year after taxes with no benefits and not reliable
  pagan
   are a waste of time until youre like 30   money and growing skills should be all you do before 30    that doesnt sound too unreasonable
  sam is depressed and wants it all to end  varg wants to burn churches
  talking about paganism and random hypotheses in a verbose way to appear valuable while having no qualifications and clear falsifications in them that anyone qualified can and has highlighted over and over again  based a lot of people focus too much on his racism and not enough on the fact that he just pulls random ideas out of his ass which imo is what really discredits him
  art as a career is a waste of time  checkmate
  hes a little crankish but im happy to have him out there experimenting
sam is a nihilist and varg is a christian fundamentalist that hates jesus
  varg is a christian fundamentalist that hates jesus  lmao
  sams ideas on self help books was also really accurate despite him being a big asshole retard he does give good advice for the sort of autistic weirdo 4chan types on how to better themselves from a place of experience since thats what he is varg is living in a fantasy land though and will only make them worse but i do admire him being a quasi survivalist while preaching that life despite all his we wuzing and volkish revisonism shit
  theyre both funny in different ways  
nazis destroy the most vibrant high culture and avantgarde scenes the western world has ever had  85 years later a bunch of incel neets jerk off to them as attempted saviours of western civilisation     reminder that the nazis basically killed european dominance of the arts and culture and shifted the centre of global culture to the fucking united states of plebs
  but muh a u s t h e t i c statues
everything that isnt a statue of naked men or some kind of appraisal of war is degenerate
  yeah everybody knows that zhdanovism saved european culture
  the nazis were awful people they were racist they were warmongers were comicbook villains they nearly destroyed europe    that doesnt mean the shit that was going in the weimar republic was healthy
  is that gordon ramsey
in fairness so did stalin throughout the 20s the avantgarde was on its stride in russia but towards the late 1920s and early 30s stalin clamped down on it all enforced realism and threw everyone involved into gulags   early soviet movies especially were so risque that they were banned across most of europe and the us  both stalin and hitler were massive fucking plebs the 30s 40s and 50s were an era of reaction
  when someone puts pineapple on pizza
  s destroy the most vibrant high culture and avantgarde scenes     wtf i love nazis now
    what more can you expect from the son of a petite bourgeoisie official and a literal peasant
    are these germans fresh or are they frozen
threadly reminder that the nazis captured no less than 4 four rothschilds 2 were let go 1 lived out the war in a detention camp and the other who married into the wine producing arm of the family died of disease shortly before the war ended after being held for four years
  idk about germs but the jews are fucking burnt
  died of disease shortly before the war ended after being held for four years  noice i knew they took one and asked for a ransom for him but didnt know about the other 3
  all of them in germany
  reports on the principles of public morality is a fun read
bump
simply a saint  he did nothing wrong they put all the blame on him after killing him
  i for one think he is nothing more than traitorious cocksucker
  arrogant little shit that enabled the terror well past any necessity creating a cycle of crisis and paranoia without goal or conclusion   danton flawed as he was should have been in his place and his prophecy of robespierre soon following his execution proved to be true
  autistic faggot
  he fulfills the role of the archetype of the tyrant in a republican context being in a sense the father of the nation he is psychologically necessary
  absolutley and unequivocally based
  did nothing wrong
  definitely not good
imagine robespierre somehow reaching bongland  imagine the carnage
    he was so ugly
    tragic figure did lots wrong in attempting to do right
gay and masonic
  this
  could use him in france right now
  kiss me like your anime girls anon
  woah
  well he didnt kill everyone on the planet so fucking not enough
  based/10      traitor to the republic/10
bump
  based and tricolorpilled
  tricolorpilled  redpilled  bluepilled  and whitepilled  kekd
  kind of a tragic figure that got scapegoated after his death and is made the ultimate villain of the revolution for simplicitys sake
m o n a r c h 
  funny to pull zizeks the big other concept with peterson pic
  friendly reminder robespierre argued for marie antoinette to be spared and sent back to austria with her children but was forced to withdraw his argument even still he condemned her execution
  tragic   
  classic example of what happens when you become an ideologue
this arab structure built by the french is the pinnacle of african architecture and engineering
rebuilt by the french    ten years before rené cailliés visit the fulani leader seku amadu had launched his jihad and conquered the town seku amadu appears to have disapproved of the existing mosque and allowed it to fall into disrepair this would have been the building that caillié saw seku amadu had also closed all the small neighbourhood mosques5 between 1834 and 1836 seku amadu built a new mosque to the east of the existing mosque on the site of the former palace the new mosque was a large low building lacking any towers or ornamentation6
the roman empire ended when they started growing beards
true beards exist to allow men to hide their weak chins this allows genetically inferior men to have power in society which ultimately destroys it its the main reason for roman superiority over greeks or european superiority over arabs its also why society has historically been so advanced in east asia  as asians generally lack good beard genes their chinlets have nowhere to hide and are excluded from power allowing society to flourish    beards are the surest sign of the decay of civilization as evidenced by the numale beards we see today
  low test men that cant grow beards calling anyone else genetically inferior
    this doesnt make any sense beards were an onandoff fashion thing all throughout the empires history
  the empires history  yes the first cunt in the empire that decided beards were cool killed it bet his great grandkids liked trousers too
itt neurotic bitchy men talk about what is masculine
  so numa pompilius then
      seemingly the cleanshaven look was introduced to roman public life by scipio african us
this was the end game
    not having a bear automatically means you cant grow one

  by pierre i assume youre alluding to war and peace and this prompts thoughts of other interpretations both contemporary to now my own guiding portrait was crystalized in patrick rambauds trilogy of napoleonic disasters of which picd is the first of the series also though only a focus indirectly tom pococks scattered glimpses are pretty convincing /lit/ reporting btw
122 years ago on this day in a dirt poor peasant family was born the greatest general and military leader in history
  thats not zhukov
not born in carthage not hannibal  not born in epirus not pyrrhus  not born in macedon not alexander the great  not born in corsica not napoleon  not born in the khentii mountains of mongolia not genghis khan   born in rome no caesar you get the point
  honestly an embarrassing post zhukov probably wouldnt make top 30
  yes in 1917 they took a picture of a random white army soldier that resembles zhukov      besides hannibal what makes any of these men a better military leader  zhukov was in charge of the biggest army in history in a war that was already lost up until he pushed germans out of moscow
  not even the best officer from ww2 ussr rokossovsky beats zhukov by miles
  lmao what
  be rokossovsky  plan kursk  be zhukov  steal credit
  also he planned bagration
  zhukov will never overthrow stalin and make worst commie fear of bonapartism come true  zhukov will never be socialist napoleon in 20th century
    stealing credits implies that he purposely made himself the mind behind these two battles  there is no reason to change a working plan besides no proof is made that it swas original rokossovsky doing    last zhukov is called marshal victory among commies for a reason he is just able to win any battle no matter how desperate it is  did he steal credit for leningrad and moscow    not only he was the one who wiped off berlins resistance but he had to stand against the bullshit stalin imposed on him and made chuikov be the sole victornot even konev    fuck off
  stealing credits implies that he purposely made himself the mind behind these two battles  what the fuck does this even mean  there is no reason to change a working plan besides no proof is made that it swas original rokossovsky doing  no no proof other than that hed worked on it for far longer and zhukov was essentially stopping by    last zhukov is called marshal victory among commies for a reason  because of soviet propaganda    he is just able to win any battle no matter how desperate it is  take credit for ive even heard that he wasnt the most senior officer for the battle against the japanese for which he eventually became known someone looked through the archives and it was someone else he of course spun that in his later career to his equivalent to arcole or something    zhukov was a fraud from the beginning fuck you fuck zhukov fuck your laughable claims that he even belongs in the top 30 and to return the favour fuck off
  zhukov was a fraud from the beginning fuck you fuck zhukov fuck your laughable claims that he even belongs in the top 30 and to return the favour fuck off  i was going to answer in a properly constructive form then i read this  suck my dick and go fuck yourself the only fraud in this whole war are eisenhower and de gaulle    also usa didnt win the war they slept by in bulges until soviets force german to pull out panzer army from west    lend lease is a myth
  cry me a river fuckhead the more you look into zhukov the more a web of lies myths and propaganda exposes itself hes a construction of the soviet state and when he ceased to become useful for propaganda they got rid of him    how dare you compare him to napoleon alexander caesar
  there is nothing to look for  he just coincidentally happens to be wherever soviets won and he steals credit thats your theory    fuck whatever piece of shit stalinist tries to spill these lies and fuck you
  also zhukov would undoubtedly beat napoleon or alexander the fag in any war    and which caesar would that be
  lmao all three would embarrass him
  zhukov was a good general but absolutely pantsonhead retarded in politics and his actions caused the dissolution of the ussr
  zhukov was a good general but absolutely pantsonhead retarded in politics      its fine thats what made him a dependable man his soldier loved and why none of the inner circle cunts could touch him     and his actions caused the dissolution of the ussr    why exactly
  in 1957 the politburo voted to remove nikita khrushchev but zhukov and khrushchev were working in close cooperation and zhukov used his influence among the military to launch a military coup and forced the politburo accept khrushchev and his reforms we know that khrushchevs revisionism eventually caused the dissolution of the ussr but it was zhukov that enabled him to hold power in the first place     what is ironic is that after khrushchev solidified his power he immediately forced zhukov out of the government since he realized the danger of what had happened and proving stalin right about bonapartism all along
why are farmers and sheep herders such good fighters when they are not even full time soldiers
fucking farm animals  high strength and stamina
  farmers arent historically good warriors but pastoralists live very rough lives and become hardy because of that farmers can make better soldiers though
america had thousands of french soldiers fighting for them and britain was only using 1 of its full power dumb thread
many battlefields are farm fields so they likely know the lay of the land even if its their firs time there
  the numbers werent that lopsided the us fielded 40k with 63k french and spanish allies against 48k redcoats 30k hessians and 25k loyalists
  farmers only became good fighters when guns came around and they were properly radicalized and organized  historically they were pretty shit pastoralists were always the good fighters since they ate shitloads of meat and lived hard lives exposed to the elements
losing to farmers when 99 of all armies are farm boys and poverty stricken scum  vs  losing to farmers when 100 of all modern armies are professionals volunteers with excellent training
  professionals volunteers
  volunteers  excellent training  vietnam
  american conscripts are neither professionals nor volunteers    some guy whos only qualifying trait was not running away to canada when he got his draft card who only wants to smoke dope and get home alive    vs    battle hardened professional nva and vc who are willing to accept millions of casualties to win their independence    hmm
  best kek ive had in a while
  we would have won if france had let cornwallis retreat into the ocean
  not to mention combined arms operations from the land and the air and south vietnamese soldiers as meat shields
  oh you are calling farmers farm animals and saying those fucking cunts
  farmers of back then are literally stronger than the athletes of today anon though that could be a symptom of our species getting weaker as a whole
    le continental army wuz farmers fighting like gorrilas against them dumb redcoats    why do you people insist on shitting on von steubens grave
farmers have some traits that predispose them toward success in military means such as knowledge of the land ability to hunt and forage on the move comfort with the elements and familiarity with firearms but they are generally very shitty at organization and morale until properly trained and lead    during the us revolution the militia were considered a fucking joke that could only pull off quick surprise raids and such you needed a baron von steuben type to come in and turn those farmers into regulars before they were any real use on the battlefield     now farmers are good enough to keep a war going indefinitely if they have the numbers but thats only a useful strategy against invaders an army of untrained farmers isnt going to be conquering anything without proper training    even with that considered its worth pointing out that rural guerilla fighters almost always take far more casualties than the professional armies they fight in vietnam is what like 10 vc/nva killed for every one american/arvn but it didnt matter because they were willing to make that sacrifice iraq is even more extreme like 201 a lot of farmers have to be sacrificed to keep the conflict going
  if the french army wasnt there he wouldnt have had to retreat
  pretty sure the uk was mostly farmers at the time of the american war of independence
    muh france  the french only fought in the us for a few months the war ended a few years later after they left why didnt britain just attack america again thats right they feared the big murican bvll
  farmers are rentiers in chief not tenants    read hammond  hammond ffs
  the merit gained through nepotism that you get when you are totolitarian abrahamists inherently produces weakness in your societys prestige classes
  tough farmer kids who grew up on the land and spent 90 of their life out in that wilderness and who used guns from the time they were kids to hunt and had to use shitty muskets to kill birds and this was their dinner so if they missed they didnt eat and who knew the wilderness like the back of their hands and who had experience fighting protoguerilla skirmishes against indians from their time in the militia are going to have an advantage to some kid who never left liverpool who was trained for a few weeks and had really good equipment
  losing to farmers when 100 of all modern armies are professionals volunteers with excellent training  so the irish war of independence then anglos still btfo
  so you all hang out on reddit too
  the english soldier had a similar background to his american counterpart in most regiments he too was a noob raised from a scratch built regiment raised in england or the colonies and trained for a few months to fight against american continental regiments of similar backgrounds    this is due to the fact that since the end of the english civil war the english had a pathological fear of standing armies used to enforce tyrannical rule so parliament reserved to itself the right to control the army an army composed of regiments raised by various nobles towns  private entities only to be cobbled together during wartime there were very few professional units in britain itself usually just a few regiments some cavalry formations and the grenadiers    in fact the only big professional army of britain at the time wasnt in britain nor in america it was the beics presidency armies in india whose activities there required a large permanent standing army it was manned by british veterans  officers of scratchbuilt regiments disbanded after wars in europe and america and left without a job various european mercenaries and local indian military castes
britain fighting spain and the french  at all like super power america losing     why can americans just not handle that they lost
  feelings based history is horrifying
  the british army was farm boys
  losing a significant part of your population and territory  the same as a place you had no cultural or historic ties to getting invaded by its commie half after you left  why cant british win wars without a dozen other allies doing the fighting for them
  because diplomacy and political maneuvering saves lives and enhances your power why on earth would any sanely run state choose to devote mass resources and the blood of its citizens for martial glory you think like a 12 year old
  because they have stuff they want to protect
  losing to professional volunteers with excellent morale when your armies are full of 60iq retards
  this is rational but youre still a faggot
  so in other words  iiits okay when we do it
  its okay for any state to do it i dont begrudge the us spain and france for allying their interests and defeating britain whatsoever if thats what youre referring to a perfectly logical thing to do taking advantage of the relative political isolation britain faced at the time
  why are farmers and sheep herders such good fighters when they are not even full time soldiers    knowing the terrain  not knowing the terrain  fighting to protect  fighting to conquer  absolute commitment to total war  making war based on politically bias theories and mostly irrelevant historical analogies  hard people of the land  paradeloving welfare queens    every animal is at its most dangerous when cornered
  in vietnam is what like 10 vc/nva killed for every one american/arvn    this may well be true but its impossible to get an accurate picture of the vc death toll because of the compounded effects of everyone slightly skewing their figures
  for much of history for much of western history farmers were dogshit at fighting in the medieval ages this was especially true as farmers have feudal lords and their men to run to to protect themselves meanwhile urbanites who have to fend for themselves being outside the feudal system as they were trained in city militias with some city states even making it law that service in the civic militia is required for citizens in a medieval commune or city state this state of affairs only changed with the demise of feudalism in europe but even then standing armies largely raised its cities dominated     the only other place where farmers consistently made good fighters was in china because there was no feudal system while garrisons can only police areas close to military concentrations ie cities so chink peasants often policed themselves forming militias n shit and fighting loads of bandit campaigns to the point that sometimes they were better than government soldiers
  they tend to live on marginal land usually at high altitude are used to living in rough if not wild conditions usually know their way around a rifle wolves cunts trying tk steal your sheep put that together with a defensive advantage and you got a good guerilla fighter
reminder that britain fought two wars against literal farmers boer means farmer losing the first and winning the second one only through the use of concentration camps and scorched earth tactics
bump
  america had thousands of french soldiers fighting for them  fair enough    and britain was only using 1 of its full power  now thats bullshit  britain was using its full power but thing is that britain wasnt really strong  the moment france and spain joined britain could no longer win
you think thats bad try the irish war of independence losing to mostly farmers with worse equipment and less men without a fucking ocean between you and them just
  fucking kek britain is an anime villain    nyuck nyuck nyuck   fooli was just playing with you  now its about toime i unleash 10 o me strength
  reminder that odds were against britain in tht war
why did britain agree to peace when it did after the battle of the saintes it had regained naval dominance and it had just decisively achieved victory in the biggest battle of the war in gibraltar costs war weariness
  
  the irish dont get to make fun of them given that it took fucking 800 years of constant rebellions to finally get one that worked
  implying spain and netherlands are relevant allies
  anglos supposedly btfo   the irish speak english as their first language   100 years later and still cant revive gaelic  how can fenians ever recover
  saintes and gibraltar both occurred after yorktown though those two victories put britain in a pretty decent position but it agreed to peace anyway
  thats how you win guerilla wars tho  britain went on to win its own vietnam war in malaysia using the same tactics as in the boer war concentration camps unironically are the solution
  south african here    boers are strong af because they are constantly under threat and work hard af
  because they know what theyre fighting for
  it helps when your opponent gives up without a real fight
those americans were descendants of your stock you anglo fucks
  nope they were mostly grmans iish and wops a true englishmen would conquer
britons dont particularly care because the loss of america led to a new attempt at imperial might and the subsequent amassing of historys greatest empire
  but they lost to france not to america
  some british politicians recognized very early the latent trade and commerce potential with an independent us and considered it not worth fighting a war which was not going at all well for them outside of europe
bump
  new model army
  is this the biggest cope og all time
  concentration camps are only as horrible as you make them and the nazis ruined them forever the only way to win a guerilla war is to put the population into camps and kill anyone who doesnt comply then release the cowards who surrendered to you  the war on terror would have been won in a year
  fufufufu  thats all ya got mate  now its me turn
  the single largest battle of the american revolution was the siege of gibraltar and spanish and dutch attacks in the carribean forced the diversion of troops from the north american theatre
christcucks hate incest so much but they are denying the most obvious thing   if we assume that everything in the bible is truth this leaves us with an entire world made out of inbreeding  lets start with adam and eve since god made eve from adams rib this can only mean one thing eve is basically adams clone but genderbend they are closer to each other than brother and sister would be genetically  and it doesnt stop there  since adam and eve were the first humans on earth how do you think their children has reproduced fucked a monkey a donkey a croc nope they fucked each other    this means everyone who believes in bible admits that he is production of inbreeding    have fun with that faggots    same applies to muslims and jews btw
  i think moabite is some kind of play on words in whatever language it is it implies inbreeding      you make assumptions of a book you did not seem to read it is also relevant what was not said we know the allegory of the creation of first man but we do not know what else cain was expelled from the garden of eden and found his wife elsewhere in the science of dna it is recognized that there is a mitochondrial eve i guess it looks like so far we all have the same maternal bloodline
i tried so hard   and got so far
why was he so handsome

  communists back you back  form first nazbol state  sounds like an epic win to me suharto was cuck
in this itt we post things pseuds say   the ussr did most of the work in ww2
the treaty of versailles was too harsh
  from a perspective of fairness no pragmatically yes
the ussr didnt do most of the work in ww2
  soviets get absolutely btfo in the first few months of barbarossa   need lend lease to get their army in semi functional order
  but thats true
  most lend lease arrives after stalingrad  at which point germany already lost the eastern front
  most pseud post itt
  subhumans grms whined about muh unfair treaty therefore it was pragmatically unfair   yeah no a grm will complain about anything these creatures have no dignity no morality no reason and no brains they would have complained about muh unfair treaty even if they had won and dictated the terms
  most of it went to uk and how is sending some assistance means doing most of the work
  in the same way prepping the bull does most the work getting a woman to orgasm    wait
  cant prove you wrong so ill insult you     how is taking on the ija almost singlehandedly doing most of the work
    imagine human beings who actually think the ussr could have turned the tide without allies choking any seafaring trade and their massive bombing campaign
  assblasted commie has a freudian slip over his nigger porn  lol
land lease won the eastern front
  when people say the roman empire theyre referring to a state which ceased to exist in 1453
  pseuds are only capable of talking about events that occurred between 1871 and 1945 and have a limited understanding of the topic because their knowledge on it is fueled entirely by memes from reddit     hurr epic winter snow haha  hurr italian tank joke xd  wtf is operation citadel  wtf is operation overlord  le epic french surrender cowards  hitler was big dumb dumb i couldawon if i was in charge  armenian genowhat  holodowhat  germany wouldve won if they took moscow  wtf theres a leningrad  germany wouldve won if they made more insert ridiculous shit here  wtf is operation bagration   epic based stalin  british epically beat up nazis   literally no knowledge about japan at all except for the fact that they were nuked twice  wtf is operation uranus   yeah finland epically rekt the ussr but the ussr won tho  haha epic soviet union anthem real funny  estoniwhat  lithuaniwhat  latviwhat  haha epic italy switch side joke xd  hitler wouldve won if he listened to his generals  edgy holocaust joke but fuck nazis  will start to take history seriously but will never know about the battles of rzhev
   no knowledge about japan at all except for the fact that they were nuked twice  lol i love this one  for some people the entirety of ww2 is either the us or ussr vs germany
hitler wouldve hitlerd if only he had hitlered but of course america americad and ussr land war winter asia churchill drinky drink but japan was never in any japan to japan russia so they americad instead and and thats how the war was won
  they sent slightly less so it didnt have any effect  german army was totally beaten after stalingrad
        yikes    read a book amerifatchan
historically speaking how long do dictator second in commands last before getting replaced
  generally as long as the dictator they serve
  a gain so much power that they begin to rival the dictator and the dictator has them killed before the second in command can give him a run for his money   b second in command is only there because of the dictator everyone hates this second in command and once the dictator dies the second in command is thus ganged up on and killed by the others in the top brass for being such a cunt beria might be an example here  c the second in command does their job keeps peace with the others in the top brass but still works behind the scenes to undercut them with the dictator ultimately they toe this line so well that they get the job when the dictator dies
  does rudolf hess example of being a retard and flying into enemy territory count also has any second in command ever just retired before the dictator if im not wrong stalin had a few before beria
  does rudolf hess example of being a retard and flying into enemy territory count  im not sure what this would fall under was hess second in command i knew he was loyal but did hitler actually see him as a successor   also has any second in command ever just retired before the dictator  again i dont have an answer off of the top of my head if i had to assume then id say yes there were definitely some second in commands that realized they didnt want this job anymore and probably tried to retire i say tried because at that point youre in so deep that youre either  a not going to want to relinquish that power after being in the game for so long and getting this far   b unable to peacefully retire because the others who would battle for your position are going to be so paranoid as to never believe youre truly out of it theyll see it as a farce and follow your every move and attempt to assassinate you out of the fear you were being disingenuous and retired with a plan to come back and take out the others once youre in youre never out
mathematics and logic exist as existential and causal forces humans just discovered them  how can things like pi be human constructs when they a can be used in predictions b cannot fully be comprehended by humans and yet c can still be consistently talked about and found by humans  please explain how logic and math arent real
  congratulations thats the worst dodecahedron and the worst icosahedron ive ever seen  couldnt they have just downloaded images from wikipedia like based on an actual 3d model
  the real world is real  humans are real  the human mind is real  the limitations of the human mind are real  the constructs that the human mind comes up with in order to understand the real world given the limitations of said human mind are not real
show me a number    if you just post 3 or something thats the equivalent of being asked to show a tree and responding by just writing the word tree
  the human mind is limited but humans are discovering something real when they discover mathematical entities just like you are discovering something real when you are looking at a physical object they clearly exist independent of the human mind by the reasoning i gave in the op  when a human looks at and thinks about a physical object they do not see it perfectly but rather construct a reflection of it however the thing being reflected still exists same with math and logic
  god invented the natural numbers all the rest is the work of man
  this is a ridiculous requirement as platonists know that numbers are abstract and thus cant be physically shown  numbers can however accurately predict real world events
  if i say trees or photons exist i can demonstrate this in some empirical manner this is the only way we have to reliably catagorize what is extant and what is not    i can accurately predict real world events using the calender is there some platonic form of april i use to predict when spring will arrive
  again where are these natural numbers as best as i can tell one and the like only exist insofar as they are used to describe a plurality of a given arbitrarily defined object
  the calendar is logically and mathematically consistent unlike every other human construct we cant imagine a world without logic even if we supposed things like the law of noncontradiction didnt exist then we can say that there can be two contradictory entities but that conclusion does not contradict our premise that the law of noncontradiction doesnt exist and so we are always using some framework of logic
  this is the only way we have to reliably catagorize what is extant and what is not  negation is the only reliable way you have to categorize what it is not let use your examples as proof that neither are empirical in the slightest  if i say trees or photons exist i can demonstrate this in some empirical manner   if you point to me an oak tree then ill point to you an acorn and call it an oak tree as well so which is it you have to negate one of them an acorn is not an oak tree empirically though both are indeed an oak tree why because an oak tree cannot exist period without the acorn you cannot make anything discrete without negation and you cant reify a negation      also there is no empirical evidence of a photon particle so ill avoid that example    please explain how logic and math arent real  math and logic are as real as unicorns and leprechaunsmeaning they are concepts ideas that humans use to simplify and reify things math is already imaginary the universe and reality we live in does not use math it cannot have the capacity to do so why because it is not a human being that understands human being language  math does not exist past the realm of imagination you can say that computers and electronics run off math but turning on and off at a high frequency is not math at all its a pressure mediation
  unlike every other human construct we cant imagine a world without logic  this is because we simply have no frame of reference for any other state of affairs everything we observe behaves in a logical manner how does it follow from this that there must be some abstract form of logic which literally exists and causing every object to behave in a manner sensible to humans does it not seem more likely that the reverse is true and that the behavior of objects makes up what we understand as logic  even if we supposed things like the law of noncontradiction didnt exist  youre wrong before youve even finished this sentence denying a platonic form of logic is not equivalent to denying the existence of the law of noncontradiction it exists as a description of the behavior of objects not as some prescription written down in the universal law book or some such nonsense
  negation is the only reliable way you have to categorize what it is not  youve missed my point entirely the point was that empirical observation is the only way to actually verify if an object exists or not you cant sit in an armchair and use pure logical reason to deduce an objects existence  empirically though both are indeed an oak tree  no thats stupid you can look at an acorn and look at a tree and label them according to their respective qualities objects which i empirically observe to have the qualities of being 8 foot tall and having leaves are trees objects which i empirically observe to fit in the palm of my hand and fall from trees are acorns  because an oak tree cannot exist period without the acorn  this has nothing to do with empiricism if you were to show a man who never had any experience with such objects an acorn and a tree he would naturally come to the conclusion that they are distinct objects he would not infer that they are the same thing because an a corn came from an oak tree    an oak tree cannot exist without the sun and yet i can group these into two distinct category without ever having to use negation simply using my sensory experience of the two objects  also there is no empirical evidence of a photon particle so ill avoid that example  perhaps photon was a belabored example perhaps i should have simply said light but photons do have a basis in empirical experience it is the smallest amount of light which we can observe in interactions
  he would not infer that they are the same thing because an a corn came from an oak tree  or vice versa in any case

  you cant sit in an armchair and use pure logical reason to deduce an objects existence    lol thats exactly what the ancient greeks did which is why many of them believed that reality wasnt real to begin with to even sweeten the deal it was elaborated further in the allegory of the cave where even those closer to the sun still cannot comprehend what it actually is    objects which i empirically observe to have the qualities of being 8 foot tall and having leaves are trees objects which i empirically observe to fit in the palm of my hand and fall from trees are acorns    objects which i empirically observe to fit in the palm of my hand and fall from trees are acorns  so leaves are now acorns see you can sit there and observe all you want but that doesnt mean an explanation is going to come out of the wood work to enlighten your deceitful observations saying a tree exists simply because you observe a tree doesnt validate its existence as something real it would be like me saying i saw the shadow of an object shadows must exist shadows are real no the shadow is the absence of light an absence cannot be reified as something  the acorn turns into a tree and the tree spawns acorns they are the exact same thing with a different quality and the fact that they must be differentiated by negation means that ultimately are not real but they certainly arent nothing
  lol thats exactly what the ancient greeks did  name one object which can be proven to exist without some appeal to empirical observation  so leaves are now acorns  youre being obtuse you can differentiate between the qualities acorns and leaves and give them two separate labels much in the same way as i demonstrated you can for trees and acorns  see you can sit there and observe all you want but that doesnt mean an explanation is going to come out of the wood work to enlighten your deceitful observations  yeah ive read the first meditation too the thing is you cant call something deceitful without presupposing some manner of normalcy or veridity by which you can judge an aberrant observation to be deceitful  saying a tree exists simply because you observe a tree doesnt validate its existence as something real  it at the very least means ive observed something which has given me the impression of a tree if i walk up the tree touch it smell it taste it and have a friend and several passerbys do the same until i am satisfied that this object i perceive has the ability to interact with other objects then what reason have i to doubt that i am observing a real object in what manner could such an object ever be usefully described as nonreal  it would be like me saying i saw the shadow of an object shadows must exist shadows are real no the shadow is the absence of light an absence cannot be reified as something  if i describe a shadow as a place i observe on the surface of an object which is hit with comparatively less light than the surrounding surface area then yes such things exist  they are the exact same thing with a different quality  if one object possesses a different quality with respect to another object those two objects are obviously not exactly the same what youve described is an object which has the potential to become another object not an object with the potential to become itself
  the fact that they must be differentiated by negation means that ultimately are not real  but they dont have to be differentiated by negation i dont apprehend the concept of an acorn by enumerating a list of everything an acorn is not
  name one object which can be proven to exist without some appeal to empirical observation  i think therefore i am a duality becoming and being ultimately though being controls becoming otherwise what would you be becoming to  you can differentiate between the qualities acorns and leaves and give them two separate labels much in the same way as i demonstrated you can for trees and acorns  yeahby negation what it is not still doesnt make it real because again you are not explaining what it is you cannot because you are not it you are in turn a negation to what you are describing you are not an acorn you cannot explain an acorn you can only describe it in terms that a human can understand  in what manner could such an object ever be usefully described as nonreal  descriptions are not explanations you can get tons of people with the same flawed viewpoints to groupthink and call it a tree but that doesnt make it real you have not reified it as a tree simply by stating its a tree you have no choice but to reify it by stating what it isnt what kind of tree how old of a tree how decayed of a tree you could list endless amounts of descriptions but you must use a negation it is not a bush it is not a fully grown tree it is a maplenegation/differentiation from other types of trees for stupid human understanding conception language and perception it can be simplified as a tree but that doesnt explain what the fuck the cause to a tree is  if i describe  descriptions are not explanations
  i dont apprehend the concept of an acorn by enumerating a list of everything an acorn is not  but that is how we have differentiated everything on earth to begin with not by simply stating that it is that would get you no where it is but so what everything is you have not differentiated it from anything else what is it not this is where you get the infinite amount of details from this is why we have different terms for different things to begin with human does not mean giraffe acorn does not mean tree without negation you would have no ability to tell me otherwise again this only means something in terms of human understanding     you can call it acorn and oak tree until it evolves into a new type of tree what will you call it then and how will you differentiate it from the original oak tree what came before the oak tree and what point did it turn into the oak tree we know today it is the same thing humans bring in the negations to differentiate the two
  i think therefore i am  you know you think because you experience your thoughts therefore there must be something thinking which you label i this is an emperical observation not a rote logical fact there is no logical law that necessitates an i what necessitates an i is your emperical observation of thought  yeahby negation  no it does not require any negation an acorn is an object with qualities x y z etc i am not describing what an acorn is not when i enumerate the empirical qualities of an acorn  still doesnt make it real  of course my describing an object does not make it real the object is real of its own accord however observing an object empirically is the only evidence one can have for the existence of that object  you are not explaining what it is  yes i am all an object is is a given set of empirically observable qualities   you cannot because you are not it  why do i have to be it to describe what it is  you are in turn a negation to what you are describing  this has no bearing on my labeling an object as existent or not  you are not an acorn you cannot explain an acorn  i can explain the empirical observations which lead me to infer that acorns exist  descriptions are not explanations  when you say explain what it is what form could that possibly take other than a description  you can get tons of people with the same flawed viewpoints to groupthink and call it a tree but that doesnt make it real  of course it doesnt make it real just to have a bunch of people say it is real i never said this my point was that there is no manner of going about verifying an objects existence besides observation if you observe an object this is evidence that it is real if you do not there is no evidence it is real  you have no choice but to reify it by stating what it isnt  again no i dont  what kind of tree  what species of tree it is has no bearing on whether or not it is a tree
  you could list endless amounts of descriptions but you must use a negation  no i dont  it is not a bush it is not a fully grown tree it is a maplenegation/differentiation from other types of trees  what greater explanatory power do i receive from saying that a tree is not a bush these all seem like more empirical observations  for stupid human understanding conception language and perception it can be simplified as a tree but that doesnt explain what the fuck the cause to a tree is  what does the cause have to do with whether or not it exists  descriptions are not explanations  in the context of a shadow yes it is if someone walks up to me and asks what is a shadow and i give that definition they will be satisfied likewise if someone were to ask do such things exist the only way to go about deciding if they do is to find such an object in observable reality    but that is how we have differentiated everything on earth to begin with not by simply stating that it is that would get you no where  of course we arent simply stating it is we are stating it is x where x is a quality we observe in a given object i do not observe what an object is not that is secondary to the procedure of observing an object only when i apprehend what something is can i go about apprehending what it is not
  this is an empirical observation not a rote logical fact  what necessitates an i is your emperical observation of thought  right but you are still a negation of others thoughts though you are only empirical from the standpoint of you  i am not describing what an acorn is not when i enumerate the empirical qualities of an acorn  lol that doesnt mean that its existence wasnt negated from other seeds you call it an acorn for the very reason you dont call it a whirl bird it was differentiated by negation at some point in its observation  however observing an object empirically is the only evidence one can have for the existence of that object  things are regardless of what a human labels it ultimately its all the same shit in a different form so once again the only way to distinguish these differences is by negation because that is inherently counterproductive everything is still of one thing the negation is not proof that the thing youre negating is of empirical validity the forms are no different you are no different than the acorn or tree other than the quality you express this is empirical negation and differentiating one thing is not it is one thing it has no negatives  yes i am all an object is is a given set of empirically observable qualities  where does it come from  why do i have to be it to describe what it is  i think therefore i am not i think therefore i am that other thing  this has no bearing on my labeling an object as existent or not  of course not the universe could give less of a shit about what a stupid human being calls real and not real the universe is one thing only the universe  when you say explain what it is what form could that possibly take other than a description  what is its cause reify it differentiate it from similar descriptions    1/2
  my point was that there is no manner of going about verifying an objects existence besides observation  and according to the pythagoreans and my point observations are inherently flawed   again no i dont  then everything is ultimately the same and your point is moot about differentiating them how do you intend to label thing different when you dont even have the means to differentiate to begin with if i gave you a banana and and apple and told you to explain how both are real you would eventually have to differentiate them to me otherwise you would end up stating that both are the same fucking thing  this is a banana it is yellow and curved  this is an apple it is red and roundish  thank you sir now may i please see a round red banana and a yellow curved apple   well uh no a banana is not red and round and an apple is not yellow and curved these are also certainly not the same thing  see whenever you are describing something different you are by definition using a negation whenever you say a noun that noun has already been processed with negation this is why when you say tree the distinction is made from the humans you talk to so that they dont think youre talking about a bush instead different objects have different names because they were negated from other objects otherwise youre just stating it is with no distinction well what the fuck is it youre talking about if its discrete then by definition it is negated from other things its the only reason youre able to sit here and tell me the difference between things  what species of tree it is has no bearing on whether or not it is a tree  well what a shit explanation for this type of tree then i guess all trees are just the same and should be used the same way/grown the same way
  to a hardcore skeptic youll never prove the existence of a world outside their mind you can show them brain scans and surgery to prove their mind is physical all day but they can easily doubt the existence of the brain scan saying that whatever proof you bring to the table is part of the illusion of the outside world there is no proof against this you just have to accept that the outside world exists this is at least one thing that empiricism will never solve    as for me and platonism is to easier to accept that there exists some kind of logical force than to accept that theres no reason other than human interpretation that everything in the universe happens the way it does even things that humans havent yet found or cant comprehend in their entirety such as digits of pi follow such a consistent pattern and can predict things happening the real world showing you an abstract concept is beyond what will satisfy the empiricist but im happy to make a claim that consistently explains the universe
  what greater explanatory power do i receive from saying that a tree is not a bush these all seem like more empirical observations  the word bush exists because a tree is negated from a bush to begin with that why the two completely different terms exist  what does the cause have to do with whether or not it exists  cause and effect google it  in the context of a shadow yes it is if someone walks up to me and asks what is a shadow and i give that definition they will be satisfied  doesnt mean it exists kind of like how i said here  are as real as unicorns and leprechaunsmeaning they are concepts ideas that humans use to simplify and reify things  is someone walks up to me and asks what is a leprechaun and i give that definition they may be satisfied but that doesnt mean leprechauns actually exist in reality    that is secondary to the procedure of observing an object   ahhh of observing an object when it comes to the actual being of the object it is the primary procedure of it having an existence that is different in the first place    it isyeah what is it from nothing comes nothing correct so what did it come from came from similar to what it came from but not the same it has some differentiation to it which is why it is different to begin with it is not what it came from it by definition cannot be what it comes from  a acorn what is it from nothing comes nothing where did the acorn come from it came from an oak tree similar to other oak trees but possessing a different quality different from other acorns this acorn is not the other acorns it will grow into an oak tree that is not other oak trees   obviously when you observe it the first thing that will come to your mind is it is that has absolutely nothing to do with why or how it is it is because it is not that/it is not the same thing as something else your observations are irrelevant to something else
what role did the shiites play during the lebanese civil war whom did they ally with
thread theme  
they were generally the poorest and most disenfranchised part of lebanese society they had their own movement amal and later they had hezbollah   ironically they are the only ones who actually fought for lebanon christians being faggots who wanted to build a cheap tourist resort for westerners sunnis being panarabists or dogs as usual and druze just tending to their own tribal interests
  so the shiites werent really allied with the sunnis and the war was mostly sunni vs christian

  kissinger  based    yikes do we really have to do this again lyndon larouche debunked that myth almost 40 years ago    kissinger the politics of faggotry    by lyndon h larouche jr    according to a variety of very authoritative sources henry a kissinger is not a jew but a faggot    i will not tolerate any denial of civil rights to a person who happens to be homosexual ordinarily a homosexual is like an ordinary person suffering the affliction of nasty boils one recognizes the distinction between the person and the affliction    the problem with kissinger is not simply that he has a homosexual personality the problem with kissinger is like that of that flaming fascistic faggot roy m cohn who is justly hated by most of the ordinary homosexuals of the united states and a number of those from other nations similarly henry a kissinger is no ordinary common gardenvariety of homosexual his heathen sexual inclinations are merely an integral part of a larger evil    one does not need to catch henry in flagrante in the carlyle hotel or with a roumanian waiter in acapulco whatever he does in particular hotelrooms or after meetings with roy m cohn at certain new york city restaurants or by arrangement of certain california acquaintances need not be reported here kissinger may wash one hopes and dress before leaving a hotelroom he does not and cannot change his personality    to a trained eye the evening television newsbroadcasts over the past ten years have provided all the evidence needed to recognize what kissinger is i recognize him in the same way and with the same accuracy i can tell by looking the difference between a cat and a dog psychologically henry is a distinct species he is of the species some psychopathologists prefer to describe as an extreme anal variety of sadomasochistic personality of the same pathological type as organized crimes roy m cohn     part 1 of 3
  put kissinger and cohn under similar circumstances of stress and each will behave on all crucial points of psychopathology like the other    take the case of roy m cohns physical assault on barbara dreyfuss or nancy kissingers the newark stranglers homocidal behaviour more recently normal public figures do not strangle every person who says something they do not like more lies have been told internationally about me for example than any living public figure of the past ten years i have never had an impulse to strike a journalist for such reason nor i am more or less certain does president ronald reagan or any other psychologically normal or reasonably normal person in public life we say of such public attacks it goes with the territory we have more important issues with which to concern ourselves not so in the case of narcissistic anal sadomasochists such as a kissinger or cohn    they are not psychologically normal they are something very very sick    most citizens have noticed about kissinger that he explodes into irrational rages very easily he exhibits a distinctly unmanly testiness sometimes before a classroom at harvard or in attempting to play confidenceman with a foreign head of government or diplomat kissinger pretends to be all charm as long as he believes he is being admired or admired for reasons of fear kissinger can be almost generous more or less seductive in the way some confidencemenof the sort who wear too much perfume and too much jewelryoften are with prospective suckers cross kissinger rip away his narcissistic anal selfdelusions and his impulses turn instantly homocidal  as pakistans bhutto recalled vividly before he died by kissingers decree    part 2 of 3
  call roy m cohn a nasty little faggot in public and cohn instantly finds himself seized by an uncontrollable grudgeurge to kill he will nurse that grudge over years he will be obsessed by it he will return again and again to projects intended to destroy the person against whom he holds that grudge it is not necessary to offend cohn directly to stir up such a grudgeobsession it is merely sufficient to be a person cohn believes to stand in the way of some petty ambition of his at the moment he doesnt mind being a faggot he objects to being viewed as unmanly as a nasty little anything    there are unfortunately too many persons who suffer the same mental disease as kissinger and cohn one pities them no human being however wretched should have to continue suffering the condition in which a kissinger and cohn exist the problem is that very foolish people worldwide have given power to such homocidal types    to understand the kind of faggot henry kissinger is what roy cohn is think back to the emperor nero and his court think of studio 54 then of neros court and then of studio 54 again think of roy cohns parties faithfully reported in exaggerated namedropping detail in the new york daily news think of nero and then of kissinger and then of nero and then of roy m cohn that is the kind of faggot henry kissinger is    that kind of faggotry destroyed rome will you permit it also to destroy the united states     part 3 of 3

kissinger is the reason why chile is the only first world nation in latin america  all chileans owe him their existence
    chile isnt first world the fact that its more prosperous relative to the rest of the continent makes a lot of socialists upset though    to this day i see faggots like chomsky describing chile as a disastrous economic experience so their anti neoliberal theories can make more sense he actually thought venezuela would become great under chavez as well i cant understand why people take him seriously or act as if hes some kind of authority on anything

  there definitely felt like there was some sort of mystic about him as the smartest man in the world that i remember when i was a left wing anti bush teenager but i think thats starting to fad and people are starting to see that hes just some asshole with his shitty opinions he should feel embarrassed that the only people who like his books are people like hugo chavez or osama bin laden

  they also dont like having someone shit on their dirty room and tell them to clean it up
      he sounds like hes describing most of 4chan here
  he is shady as fuck  yes he is a destroyer of libtards  but forgets the main target as an intellectual    i thought he might be afraid but he was not afraid enough to go and talk to these people in gatherings    is he gonna fck us all over for total control of humanity
  elaborate on both pls
are illyrians literally the most underestimated ancient people  alexanders mother was illyrian philipps mother too pyrrhos had illyrian ancestry as well illyrian women could lead armies in battle and trained to be fighters     the spartan generalbrasidaswho came to support the macedonians in their advance into the remote regions of lyncestis was abandoned by the macedonians but was able to extract his army of 4000 from illyrian encirclementthucydidesstated that the fear inspired by their warlike character made both greek armies think it best to retreat the young spartans were clearly shaken by the fearsome appearance of the illyrian forces
  alexanders mother was illyrian  flase she was an epirote greek  philipps mother too  false she was macedonian greek  pyrrhos had illyrian ancestry as well  false he was an epirote greek  id argue you stop stealing greek history like you steal greek wallets and try to achieve something in life shqit
  macedonians and epirotes werent greek though they were individual ethnicities
  they were fuck off back to whatever conspiracy theories they taught you in fyromian and albanian middle school
  i bet youre a swarthy greek reminder that you have absolutely no relation to based ancient greeks
wow i never imagined the chad spartans wouldve been cucked by illyrians
  reminder that you have absolutely no relation to based ancient greeks  more fake news     i dont like to repeat myself so just go to sleep youve got middle school homework to do tomorrow morning
  raped by countless populations since the romans conquered you  the trks alone rape you for 5 centuries  hurr we greek guise
  dude you are literally a fakr nation created as a buffer state by russia france and britain back in the 19th century you share no common ancestry with ancient greeks stop larping
  dna research is incorrect because /pol/ told me so   dont you have any sheep to rape instead of taking pride in other peoples history
  macedonians and epirotes werent greek though they were individual ethnicities  they were part of the hellenist family  and no im not greek im english
  t albanian shitskin    goddammit why do you have to shit up /his/ with your autistic fantasies
  yikes quoting strabo when the man was a schizo on macedon apparently also stating that it was inhabited by barbarians pausanias also omitted macedonia in his description of greece but from what i recall from the olympics macedonians were allowed to compete only after the kicked the greeks in the nuts in fact the romans also participated in the olympics iirc before the macedonians conquered greece only the argeads were allowed to compete as this was the focal problem of when herodotus describes an incident when alexander i of macedon was barred off from the olympics due to being a barbarian
macedonians are the strongest hellenes southern hellene cucks and barbarians should know there place
i smell albanians afoot
  be female  get raped
they were big guys
  for grks
care to explain why this roman painting of a macedonian looks like a modern albanian
  implying illyrians arent also swarthy meds
  athens was the core of greek civilization tho
  it might seem like that in retrospect but it wasnt as obvious back in the day   after the peloponnesian war corinth was hellbent on razing athens to the ground and it only didnt happen because sparta was against it
  macedonia  no such thing

  learned about some shit he probably thought was fantasy prior to the presidency
  dont listen to this guy
  genuinely based
  the last good republican president
  based republicans toppling successful democracies and doing the dirty work of the uk and france
  sure hes to blame for the mess that is iran and he could have done more civil rights but compared to every republican president that followed him nixon ford reagan bush bush ii and trump  eisenhower was a goddamn saint
  nixon was 100x the man that eisenhower was cleaned up most of eisenhowers messes as pres and was responsible for much of the domestic policy of eisenhower as vp ford was alright didnt last long enough to have an impact but would have been a solid moderate repub if he had the chance bush i did more than eisenhower as well
  he opposed the british/french/israeli invasion of egypt
  when the french fake genocided state since caesar mind you are so retarded ud take niggered america hefore frenched canada
  he fucked up suez crisis and iran but overall he was ok  if zhukov became leader of ussr and eisenhower was president at the time cold war wouldve been over
  he was president of the usa wasnt he he has an interesting face but his shoulders look like there were drawn with certain artistic license to appear more masculine
  between based and awesome
  but still supported the british overthrow of iran and the french suppression of anticolonial forces
  best president of the 20th century

  no keep your middle eastern culture in the middle east you have no right to bring it anywhere else the true god which is eternal and didnt choose to send one small tribe of the earth a book in arabic 1400 years ago will judge you for imposing your culture onto other peoples same for the christians you have already destroyed enough of the planet and its cultures do so more and reap further judgment
  varg pls
  islam doesnt destroy cultures though it only cleanses them of theur degenaracy
    muslims will never admit that they worship the words of mohamed and that the koran is their pagan idol
be varg  be some faggy musician in some edgelord scene  stab some other edgy fag  spend your best years getting plowed in prison  rebrand  get out move to france  all his kids will fuck moroccans  
  yours is the youngest religious culture on the planet you are the child among religions you should be learning from the ancient faiths that existed long before yours ever did rather than in your arrogance believing all truths to exist only in your cultures scriptures if islam says something true say about the djinn for example then it is true and i embrace it yet if my culture which is dharmic says something true then so should you accept it as well    but the abrahamics cannot do this     religion isnt spiritual for them its political no more no less dhsrmic faiths teach that the multiplicity of souls you see around you are but a single soul abrahamics on the other hand do not even see a person as being a soul until that soul has taken on the label of their religion muslim catholic etc thats all this really comes down to for you you have destroyed more cultures on earth than any other institution     god will judge all of you most definitely

  no it is based on whats been one of the earliest forms of worship if our primitive ancestors considered fire to be sacred maybe they were right
  if our primitive ancestors were eating each other and fucking their sisters maybe they were right
  i have a rational mind and am thus an atheist as far as im aware god doesnt exist
  oh im sorry i wrote our i thought you were also white didnt realize your ancestors were negroids please excuse my mistake
why allah make errors in quran
  my imaginary friend is best imaginary friend  grow up
  he didnt
  1 there are errors in the quran  2 god didnt make errors in the quran  you just admitted quran is not from god

  tips
  i have no interest in having a comparative religious debate just coming in order to remind my brother go ask somebody whos qualified for it in other places and im sure you can have more fruitful discussions than what you can find here its rare anyway to see a paleonativist believer debating against islam rather than just glassing us immediately on sight good luck
  fake spiritualism  yes the dharmic cultures which recorded of meditation the chakra system subtle bodies nondualism reincarnation/transmigration of soul and every other relevant spiritual science better than any other culture before or since are fake spiritualism they are also responsible for the least bloodshed of any other major worldfaiths    as opposed to praying five times a day in the direction of a literal cube in arabia of course very spiritual a culture which began in a bloodbath 1400 years ago that has not ceased for a day since is going to tell actually peaceful cultures the meaning of spirituality marrying a 6yearold and intercoursing her when she was 9  oh what spirituality    though muslims never ask themselves whether maybe theres something in the scriptures or history which correlate to such high levels of death    abrahamics only know how to be slaves to their rulesystems to put the books away and look within is a crime to them yet if only you would do this what a deal you would see    look into black cubes and saturn by the way and the crescentstar logo it may be possible that the zionists have used islam as their lapdogs from the beginning
  literal cube  whoa slow down there schizo and double check those dimensions
no  stop worshipping a false god    to be safe for all eternity  a admit that you are a sinner who violates the will of god and that you need a saviour  b believe that jesus christ son of god  messiah died for you sins and rose again as prophesied and recorded in the word of god trust in his finished work  c call on his name ask him to save you and confess that he is lord    some resources that may help  ttborg has a verse by verse bible study for download or daily listening  chuck misslers learn the bible in 24 hours   robert breakers bible study and topical sermons     the end is nigh tomorrow may be too late
  if you dont repent youll find out the hard way how wrong you are very soon
shut the fuck up lmao
  o you who have believed do not take the jews and the christians as allies they are in fact allies of one another and whoever is an ally to them among you  then indeed he is one of them indeed allah guides not the wrongdoing people    surah 551
  do i get to call allah daddy
    i want to go into an evangelical prayer circle now and do the normal prayer with a million fathers now except use daddy instead
  thats catholism bro
  symbol of sacrifice humility penance and resurrection is used as a symbol of oppression violence dogmatism and execution    you cant make this stuff up
  according to the quran they will both be saved and not saved  quran 262  those who believe in the quran and those who follow the jewish scriptures and the christians and the sabians any who believe in allah and the last day and work righteousness shall have their reward with their lord on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve  quran 319  truly the religion with allah is islam those who were given the scripture jews and christians did not differ except out of mutual jealousy after knowledge had come to them and whoever disbelieves in the ayah proofs evidences verses signs revelations etc of allah then surely allah is swift in calling to account  quran 385  if anyone desires a religion other than islam submission to allah never will it be accepted of him and in the hereafter he will be in the ranks of those who have lost all spiritual good  quran 569  those who believe in the quran those who follow the jewish scriptures and the sabians and the christians any who believe in allah and the last day and work righteousness on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve    of course the quran also says   quran 482  then do they not reflect upon the quran if it had been from any other than allah they would have found within it much contradiction    so as is frequently the case muslim scholars have had to perform mental gymnastics and contrive some explanation about general and specific rulings or how muhammad was only talking about uncorrupted christians and jews and magians or some rubbish
  islam destroys cultures by forcing other cultures to adopt 7th century arabian norms 
abrahamics are so fucking subhuman
   spiritualism is better than the truth    indeed fake spiritualism is not better than the truth but islam is not true  quran 675  and we have certainly beautified the nearest heaven with stars and have made from them what is thrown at the devils and have prepared for them the punishment of the blaze  quran 37610  indeed we have adorned the nearest heaven with an adornment of stars and as protection against every rebellious devil so they may not listen to the exalted assembly of angels and are pelted from every side repelled and for them is a constant punishment except one who snatches some words by theft but they are pursued by a burning flame piercing in brightness  quran 1516  and we have placed within the heaven great stars and have beautified it for the observers and we have protected it from every devil expelled from the mercy of allah  except one who steals a hearing and is pursued by a clear burning flame    sahih muslim 265538  abdullah ibn abbas reported  as we were sitting during the night with allahs messenger ﷺ a meteor shot gave a dazzling light allahs messenger ﷺ said what did you say in the preislamic days when there was such a shot of meteor in this process of transmission the jinn snatches what he manages to overhear and he carries it to his friends and when the angels see the jinn they attack them with meteors    so islam says that shooting stars are angels shooting heavenly fire at djinni  which we know is false since theyre just rocks floating through space that their movement is solely due to gravity and this model predicts their trajectories perfectly also their fire is simply the result of happening to pass through earths atmosphere and experience friction    believing in islam is as retarded as believing that lightening is caused by thor swinging his hammer
  when you go allah you will never go back
  when u go allah u neva go anutha
  thats just arabic for god you fucking retard
  so islam says that shooting stars are angels shooting heavenly fire at djinni     so the bible says stuff we know is false too such as involving creation in both cases it could be intended metaphorically or to illustrate a metaphysical/cosmic principle
  claim some atthetimeunknown natural phenomena has some cause  science proves it doesnt  its jjjjust a metaphor    lol desperate what blind faith the claims of your book of fairytales and witchdoctery get proven wrong and you refuse to accept that the book is wrong but instead tell yourself it means something different from what it clearly says
hypothetically if we lived in a dystopia where all the societal structures were the same as they are now except that there is a law that any male that grows beyond 5 is to be executed without shortcuts like cutting off limbs though underfeeding male children so they dont grow is ok and somehow this law was adhered to without any fuss what sort of social structure would emerge and how would the new gender dynamics work
  humans overall would get shorter now go back incel  
  but this is humanities related
  so any ideas guys
unlimited orgies with amazons    based manletarchy
to achieve the effect you want youd have to murder girls that grow below a certain height
  this desu once men lose their physical advantage and any ability to do stem from being low iq due to malnourishment theres really no justification for a 11 ratio between men and women given that one man can impregnate many women men probably wouldnt even be in control of their own harem since they have no physical or mental capacity to justify it sons would just be leased out as sperm donors by their mothers      dimorphism
  were you inspired to make this thread after seeing and saving my picture from the wut is consciousness thread
thinly veiled fetish thread  and im ok with it
we would see a real matriarchy emerge without a doubt think about it currently the patriarchy is supreme men are larger men are stronger men are smarter even in todays day and age smarts can only get you so far however the physically dominant would begin to rule by default    further assuming female sexuality was biologically unchanged at least at first we might actually begin to see women select mates by actually sharing common interests this is because chads will be by definition nonexistent so women will become sapiosexual in some way    finally i think we need to enact such a policy because i have a weird thing for busty mommytier amazons
  tfw 63 and 210lbs but still let my petite gf mommy me
  tfw 67 and no gf taller than me  well at least i can cuddle with 60 girls
    61 and 63 gf loves being big spoon  made it lads
    59 king of manlets reporting in if anything good came out of this predicament its the amazons which are in the 51162 range for me
  511
  honestly yes
  i just thought of another thing for this new society if males come from a rich family they could probably be given some kind of hormone therapy during childhood that severely limits growing so they dont have to starve to stay sub 5
  thanks based snyder
  but women are also genetically wired to be submissive but i guess with time that would change
  king of manlets  more like king of insecurity
  is this how we get a mini gts femdom utopia
  how new are you
  you still wouldnt get laid
  how would the new gender dynamics work    the same maybe some women will be more confident in hitting men but even short guys are stronger than most women
  not sub 5 men that ended up that way either through malnutrition as a child or hormone therapy lmao
  males would still dominate the weaker dimorph
  how
  stronger muscle mass nature or god knew what it was doing with its creation
whats funny is that people think manlets still arent much physically stronger than women
  this never forget 
    these arent manlets you tards manlet is like 55 this is the height of an elementary school child

whats the best version of the bible
  the one thats read without devotional bias
  the lord of the rings
i like the new international version the best
  im a king james man i know peeps can talk smack about english or king james being a fag and all but i think that shes was taken seriously by scholars at the time and they used as many original sources as they could and sought consensus among peers a lot of others are modern versions of this translation
  the space opera one
    if you care about accuracy and consensus among peers look at the douay rheims bible
why are there so many anyway
    burnt one
  translations and interpretations of words and meanings you know there are many different versions of the iliad    beyond the different books you have the different organizations/denominations that hold various interpretations and meanings     there is a huge debate amongst the commandment against graven images some have taken this so literal as to hold no art or pictures in their household amish because this can be seen as a graven image others have gone as far to include all christian art and symbolism
  nrsv      douay rheims is even worse than the kjv thats really saying something
  latin vulgate
    the dr is the nearly identical to the kj the asv is the final revision to the tradition started by william tyndale
    rsv is better
  nrsv    mah nigga
  hawaiian pidgin bar none
  that one time god sent two bears to maul children for making fun of elisha for being bald   2 kings 22325  23 then he went up from there to bethel and as he was going up by the way young lads came out from the city and mocked him and said to him go up you baldhead go up you baldhead 24 when he looked behind him and saw them he cursed them in the name of the lord then two female bears came out of the woods and tore up fortytwo lads of their number 25 and he went from there to mount carmel and from there he returned to samaria
  the rule 34 one
    this part  along with the one with judah thinking tamar was a whore are the most hilarious parts of the bible
translations like nab the jerusalem bible and the old great bible are probably less satisfactory for their dynamic approach many wouldnt argue for the dynamization of harry potter or tolkien the nrsv nasb and niv are probably less bad    but the rsv and all the old bibles are really top tier also consider modernized kj editions    if you fall for the literal translations meme id say the darby bible and rotherhams are the best    for other languages i find the reinavalera to be the best in spanish as no other translations really surpass it in terms of accuracy and instead opt to follow a more dynamic approach some similar to the great bible  in french it looks like the darby translation is serviceable    for english translations of other traditions theres the murdock translation for the syriac nt its pretty similar to the classical kj style rendition though   for the septuagint theres the older brenton translation the newer nets translation which is based on the nrsv and the orthodox study bible  the wycliffe bible was the most literal translation of the vulgate and is quite unique in that regard a version of it with modernized spelling is found on bible gateway
whats the best version of the bible    the satanic bible
  so the jerusalem bible in part translated by tolkien    also    the jerusalem or new jerusalem bible is the best from a literary perspective and pretty good from a translators perspective
any that doesnt use (((masoretic text))) for its ot basis and also isnt the new world translation      
  the quran
  came here to say this
  any that doesnt use (((masoretic text))) for its ot basis  basically none since revisions that presume to follow other texts still follow translations from the masoretic text for the most part
no one posted orthodox study  this is disappointing and my day is ruined
the original one
kjv is the most kino but isnt the most accurate
  le tip
ephesians 61  children behear your engenderers/parents in lord for this is righteous    rhomaians 128  and according as they did not approve to have god in acknowledgement/beknowing/recognition god gave them over to an unapproved mind to do the things not becoming    louc 128  and he came in toward her said rejoice graced one the lord with thee eulogized art thou among women    acts 1627  and the bondage guard having become awake and having seen open the doors of the ward having drawn his sword was about to do away with himself ruling/deeming the bound to have fled out    acts 2226  and the hundredleader having heard having proceeded to the thousandleader reported saying what art thou about to do for this man is rhomaian
  recommends nrsv  somehow comes to the conclusion that the dra is worse than the kjv  i am confused why you do something right but say something wrong
  you mean the translation which accurate gets a majority of the narrative correct and produces are more harsher tone for the book of job or the fact that the masoretics were much more sensible with translating passage which still contained archaic sayings and phrases which have helped scholars trace back the material this should not exclude the masoretic jews from bias but they were very much loyal and devoted to translating the message properly i have as much equal criticism of the masoretic as i have of the lxx
in gnosticism sophia is a feminine figure analogous to the human soul but also simultaneously one of the feminine aspects of god gnostics held that she was the syzygy female twin divine aeon of jesus ie the bride of christ and holy spirit of the trinity    you know this actually makes sense why would there be a father and son but no mother/wife
  you played too much jrpgs muhammad
even so did my mother the holy spirit take me by one of my hairs and carry me away on to the great mountain tabor  gospel of the hebrews
    my understanding is that sophia who indisputably exist and is officially acknowledged within christianity is different from the holy spirit the holy spirit is the spirit of god who is masculine thus it doesnt make sense that itd be feminine     i think a part of sophia incarnated as the virgin mary same as a part of god incarnated as christ this fulfills sophia as the bride of god via the virgin marys 3 fold relationship with god daughter of the father bride of the holy spirit and mother of christ
  maybe god is gender fluid
christian gnosticism is retarded either go pure gnostic or go back to praying your demiurge
  cathars had the right idea
  the best form of gnosticism is retarded   everything else is meme you have those gnostics in iraq who worship john the baptist and jewish gnostics the many varients of christian gnosticism are the best of the few     being a masculine force in a philosophical sense is not the same as having a gender masculinity  metaphysical fullness
  god is like a tranny or some shit like that
  ive found christian gnostics tend to take the bible flavor less seriously anyway compared to the dualism
  spirit is also feminine in semitic languages dont know about sophia being equated with it though ive read in some gnostic texts such as the first apocalypse/revelation of james that sophia was responsible for conceiving the demiurge or yaldabaoth
  ive always wondered do male christians masturbate thinking of these holy female figures
shakti cosmic energy is feminine in hinduism
  do you think about your mother when you do it
  now the demiurge didnt share in sophias wisdom she couldnt impart any of herself and she also couldnt duplicate any of gods other attributes but she could emulate them so the demiurge got similar characteristics to god but they were imperfect being an imperfect being the demiurge couldnt perceive god or his attributes even his own mother and so he thought he was alone in the universe to ease his loneliness he created the physical world unknown to him the only source of material to work with was god so the demiurge was taking parts of god and separating them from the whole with this divine essence he created earth and adam and eve the demiurge you see was yahweh the god of the old testament    in the revised version the demiurge is instead lucifer/satan who creates the world when given a second chance by the father after he is cast out of heaven he tricks angels into joining him and traps them in flesh bodies he created
  from the cathar bible    and i asked of the lord when satan fell in what place dwelt he and he answered me my father changed his appearance because of his pride and the light was taken from him and his face became like unto heated iron and his face became wholly like that of a man and he drew with his tail the third part of the angels of god and was cast out from the seat of god and from the stewardship of the heavens and satan came down into this firmament and he could find make no rest for himself nor for them that were with him and he asked the father saying have patience with me and i will pay thee all and the father had mercy on him and gave him rest and them that were with him as much as they would even unto seven days    and so sat he in the firmament and commanded the angel that was over the air and him that was over the waters and they raised the earth up and it appeared dry and he took the crown of the angel that was over the waters and of the half thereof he made the light of the moon and of the half the light of the stars and of the precious stones he made all the hosts of the stars    and he sent forth angels to be ministers over them and he commanded the earth to bring forth every beast for food fatling and every creeping thing and trees and herbs and he commanded the sea to bring forth fishes and the fowls of the heaven    and he devised furthermore and made man in his likeness and commanded the or an angel of the third heaven to enter into the body of clay and he took thereof and made another body in the form of a woman and commanded the or an angel of the second heaven to enter into the body of the woman but the angel lamented when they beheld a mortal shape upon them and that they were unlike in shape and he commanded them to do the deed of the flesh in the bodies of clay and they knew not how to commit sin
  sometimes
  why would there be a father and son but no mother/wife  the mother/wife is irrelevant outside of the household as outsiders we have no reason to interact with or know gods wife on a personal level
  cuck
  except the demiurge did perceive his mothers reflection enough for her to call him an ignoramus and for him to try to grab the reflection gnosticism is sad
  there is some confusion with language here in the romance languages at least an object is feminine because it ends in a it doesnt end in a because its feminine so a word in latin might very well be feminine but that doesnt mean it is feminine
fuck off freemason shabbos goy
i think one of the elements of the trinity is male the other female and the other genderless/both        if you dont hate women youre muuh freemason boogeymen  freemasons dont let women join
  true but the gospels also describe the spirit descending like a dove which is feminine in latin and greek but a common gender in aramaic its plausible that the spirit could become anthropomorphized as feminine because of this
  pretty sure fathers and sons are clearly masculine in most languages
  implying there arent any female subsects in freemasonry     
  having looked at the etymology of demiurge a moment ago i wonder if it couldnt be translated as folk worker    δημῐουργός  dēmiourgós m  from δήμῐος dḗmios public  ἔργον érgon labor work
  the demiurge first appeared in platonic thought as a benevolent but imperfect creator of the universe pretty sure the name meant craftsman or artisan even if thats not the direct translation its a translation of the idea behind the name     the platonic conception of the demiurge was that he created by god and modeled the physical universe after the heavenly one he wasnt bad or evil in fact he was praised by the platonics this was source of contention between neoplatonics and gnostics
  behold the demiurge truly πονηρός
  yeah i did read that maybe at least to the greek mind a craftsman or public laborer may appear as a folk worker though it was also applied to magistrates
  social worker
  precisely  god is not a cuck so why would you be hanging out with his wife until you actually accept invitation into gods household aka enter heaven gods hypothetical wife isnt going to be something you could ever hypothetically interact with making her irrelevant in a religious context god is the patriarchal head of the divine household and his son is the intermediary that gets sent out into the world for people to interact with    its like saudi arabia  does the king of saudi arabia have wives  yes  do they matter to the rest of the world outside of saudi arabia  no  just because god is god does not inherently grant any hypothetical spouses of his divine authority
i give my gpt and cities away to female leaders in civ just so i can jack off
    not what you linked that is for sure
  the cathars taught us god has two wives collam and colibam and from them he engendered  sons and daughters as do humans
    yes the point being that the son is the union of the father/mother but that could also mean just its continuation
  the father had two wives collam oholah and colibam oholiba  the two courtesans in ezekiel 234
  yeah and they were filthy sluts that came to a sticky end
  since you seem to take this stuff seriously i would like to remind you pretty much all sources about christian heretics such as cathars including gnostics are written by outsiders who considered them filthy heretics they are not reliable at all
  does god have other children besides jesus
  but anon gender is a social construct
  is there a heresy where jesus was female
howdy germanic servants

were the original turks mongoloid or caucasian
  original turks were mongoloid rape babies from caucasoid mothers
  what kind of a stupid question is this the proto turkic homeland is directly adjacent to mongolia proper caucasian peoples have been living in the caucasus mountains since the bronze age if you mean indo european or indo aryan rather than caucasian the turks are neither
  they are arabs or rapebabies of arabs
  mongoloid always caucasians didnt penetrate that deeply into eurasia in levels high enough to found another racial group
  im a turk and im caucasian half of my dna is from southern europe the other half is from the caucasus and eastern europe so yeah
i want /pol/ to leave
  they were 100 pure subsaharan african nignogs
  the turks were always a loose collection of turkic speaking peoples some turks were definitely mixed with europeans early on the tocharians were indoeuropean people who moved into central asia and mixed with the native turks to become the uyghur people of china     the turks of today definitely have central asian administure however they are the descendants of many different turkic peoples
  the tocharians were indoeuropean people who moved into central asia and mixed with the native turks to become the uyghur people of china   uh no the turks moved into the tarim basin and linguistically turkified the tocharians not the other way around
  alright the tocharians were still indoeuropean people that became turkified
  people from turkey / turkic peoples
    they were ane influenced siberian mongoloids close to modern tuvans and altaians    basically somewhere in between samoyeds and mongolians
prototurks were basically tuvinians    before they mixed with indoeuropeans and iranics before mixing with more iranics and sometimes uralics    the southern ones must have mixed with tibetoburmans since they have o3
yakutians

redpill me on emperor justinian effective leader overrated owes most of his success to his generals choosing theodora as a wife a bad idea
  effective leader  only in shortterm his roman restoration autism was cringe and cascaded the many future civil wars in the byzantine empire  overrated  absolutely  owes most of his success to his generals  errnot really he owes most of his success to his state administrators  choosing theodora as a wife a bad idea  yes she didnt produce a heir and kept meddling in state affairs
  only in shortterm   isnt that all any leader can do be effective in the short term
retarded who wasted the empires resources for pointless shit he shouldve went after persia instead
i find these questions hard to truly answer because when it comes to running an empire that is surrounded by foes and the people depend on the very structure that is in the state of complete collapse i dont see how anyone can relate  take justines generals for example it was concrete to belarus to recapture all of italy and ensured that it could be done however much of the attempts were often for lack of better phrase stale mates where you see cities in the italian peninsula captured by the grecoromans only to be recaptured by the invading forces again the following months if that even weeks the structural defenses of these cities were destroyed and rebuilt multiple times in this course of roughly 20 years and italy which was once a luminous region was suffering plague famine and chaos what advantage did the byzantines gain by recapturing rome and italy as a whole other than the spiritual influence that was arguably lost some couple hundred years ago   the right intention is in mind rome  power and the spiritual influence it has was surely felt once the cities of ravenna and rome were captured but the costs were so great that its nearly a stalemate in which there is no real gain if even calling it a loss in the long run isnt out of the question  the justine had many targets and opportunities to take in our world veiw that we get from nearly 1500 years of well documented information we see that protecting the firm borders that the byzantines had would have been the best circumstance but at the time persia was a force that could be relatively overlooked and instead a focus on reclaiming the mediterranean was more ideal im not simply saying that justine was good or bad rather that simple words such as the latter of good or bad or overrated/underrated are not proper ways of describing the entirety of this subject
he was literally a demon whose head would fly off and his wife was a whore
  he caught the plague and lived
gets fucked in all her holes at once   nothing personnel justy
  should had stopped his restoration plans after retaking africa but i cant really blame him for it
most of the criticism of the guy relies on hindsight being 20/20 in reality most of his actions made perfect sense at the time and many of them payed great dividends later on    also theodora best girl
  pissing off one of the largest christian sects that threatens to join the sassannid empire requires 20/20 hindsight  not understanding christian theories and basically calling yourself a nestorian despite renouncing them requires 20/20 hindsight
  how
  what the fuck are you talking about
  most of his actions made perfect sense at the time  persecuting the monophysites when they make up basically the largest christian sect in your empire does not make perfect sense  reconquering rome when you have barbarians raiding your empire all the way to greece and sassanids knocking at your door does not take 20/20 hindsight to realise its retarded  also seeing how you dont even know what the fuck was going in regards to religion i wont even bother explaining nestorianism to a brainlet like you
im sure they had them i just wonder what sort of laws programs etc they had for them
  nothing usually unless there were too many then they made them serfs
  fug them
  walked passed them
  the romans probably did
  homelessness wasnt a problem when nobody gave a fuck if you wanted to live a diogenes lifestyle obviously they wouldnt be allowed to just loiter and sleep in the streets depending on what village/town of course these people would instead live like hermets on the outskirts only coming to town in order to purchase goods with money earned from doing various handyman/farm labor nobody would fuck with a random invalid living in his own cobbled together shack in the middle of nowhere nowadays theres too much empirical nonsense and bureaucracy involved for someone to just live by their own means
  ancient cultures had slavery so hobos would be put to a useful purpose
  free slaves and solders
rome was basically seattle or los angeles they started giving out food to everyone so the homeless flocked there and made it a shit hole
  there were genuine reformers like the gracchi and ppl who tried to take advantage of their suffering like caesar
  caesar doesnt surprise me but who was gracchi and what did he do
  only because the plebs were made homeless by the same patricians who doled out the grain
  the gracchi brothers were tribunes of the plebs who vetoed a bunch of stuff to force the senate to pass their land reform acts
the destitute slept alongside paupers beggars and animals in the slums    if you went back in time to a preindustrial city one of the first things youd notice is the smell then youd notice how crowded it was 25000 people per km2 is considered high density for a city even in the undeveloped world yet ancient rome had at least 50000 per km2 perhaps as high as 70000 at its peak    in the poor quarter privacy didnt exist and since the multitudes were constantly milling around there were was a tolerance for trespassing on open areas near the street at least order was maintained by the community which was close knit with most people knowing their neighbors if you were a complete stranger you might have difficulty finding a room but if you had lived there all your life as was often the case you would likely not be bothered sleeping on the ground floor of your childhood friends insulae
  they failed in the end tho and were murdered
  the more i learn about rome the more i realize it was a massive shithole
  put them into barns and set the barns a blaze
  if you live in a old cobbled shack regardless of its quality youre not homeless
  rome had over a million people living there at its peak that was unheard of in renaissance times outside of china
  they basically shut the state down by vetoing everything and then became first politicians to get murdered by other politicians in the end they set two awful precedents that ended up dooming the republic
    someone like saint anthony was able to squat alone in an abandoned roman fort i guess there was room
  went to king  king gave you land to build a house with  you hand over half of your crops and anything else you make to the king    problem solved
  homelesness in ancient china had two versions rural and urban in the rural areas it was nearly impossible in ancient china since the familial system of clans and sworn friends would look out for you    vagrancy in rural areas was largely associated with taoist/buddhist hermits criminals and youxia wandering swordsmen generally people who intentionally looked to the homeless lifestyle    in the cities meanwhile there were homeless but their means of survival was to band together in underground semicriminal societies and cliques that looked out for each other a homeless guy would also be out for news on buddhist charities call to arms in wars or a government project hoping for employment
  cool info anon ancient china was based in alot of wayswhat happened

  fascist units will obviously be the most represented in this thread as they had to look good in order to make up for their performances or lack thereof on the battlefield
  initially the cossacks that folllowed the field ataman of the savoy which was established in 1942 as part of the 8th italian army  wore the traditional uniform of the don with a badge of the russian imperial army and a whitebluered chevron on the right sleeve  arrived to italy in summer of 1943 as part of the novara lancers regiment at this time probably they wore italian cavalry uniforms which kept after the capitulation of italy and being transferred to the wehrmacht  at this stage they also received german uniforms but retained his whitebluered chevron until the end of the war

why is modern art and architecture such crap
referring to art made in current time period as modern
  pampered middle class cunt describes himself  ok
  atheism
  implying producing purely objective artwork is in any way better than alternatives  let me guess you think nonfiction is literature
  sir roger scruton  whining about kids having a pampered life  ironicpalpatinejpg
the rise of the individual ego above all modern art isnt designed to please the eyes its intended to shock to look so horrific and devoid of beauty that you cant tear your eyes away from it its egotistical artwork where everyone is trying to scream for attention louder than their peers
  art that doesnt make you think is shit art a book that reads well but isnt at all deep is hardly a great work of art same thing for visual art

  modern art / contemporary art
  grug does not understand art  art bad
  nice picture fag
  why
that picture is bullshit otto dix very much a modern artist volunteered to fight in world war 1 took part in the somme and the spring offensive and earned the iron cross for his service
  because its used to launder money  you dont need a masterpiece for that the token of exchange itself can be worthless
  modern art is a superschool of art including for example expressionism cubism in a sense and futurism on the other hand contemporary art can be used broadly to describe art today much of which is actually postmodern art
  x plain how art is used to launder money please
its not good because it doesnt look like real life  heres a tip modern and especially contemporary art isnt trying to look like a real person or landscape its trying to express or invoke an emotion most modern and contemporary artists could easily paint a pretty picture of some trees but thats been done to death so they try something new
because you are a pleb
  buy doodle for 100  sell to anonymous collector from italy for 10000
  want to transfer large amount of  without questions from authorities  put art piece in auction  pay the amount anonymous  now have the  on a bank account with plausible origin    you can use that to wash dirty  or to directly pay for illegal business as well as moving  between countries without questions    if you are really interested read this 
  beckys menstrual blood painting   rajeets toilet roll castle  svens anal prolapse interactive portrait experience  fuck bro really thought provoking art
  its not modern art its post x inverted y ironic z art  everyone knows what op means hes being no more specific than necessary
  that cant be a real quote the modern period aligns with the francoprussian war to vietnam and all the conflict and turmoil between meanwhile scruton is an early boomer born at just the right time to reap the benefits of a peaceful postrationing britain in his early adulthood
  so they try something new  what theyre trying is dogshit and the facevalue populist reaction to it proves their messaging is weak some intellectual rationalizing away his first impressions in order to justify the idea that its somehow intellectually valid doesnt convince me otherwise it simply convinces me that the art world has its tongue squarely up its own arsehole    a crude shock to the senses will never produce the same admiration and sense of awe in a person that a sophisticated piece of artistic genius will this is why people admire portraits of great men by great artists the subject is to be admired the way hes been captured is elegant and shows great skill and thought on the part of the artist the sophistication of the painting itself is to be admired all the way through theres a level of sophistication and talent which inspires the viewer    without that its just masturbation
  art needs to be popular  aestheticlet
  most modern and contemporary artists could easily paint a pretty picture of some trees    idk anon i think you give them too much credit i bet you most artist havent even painted or drawn a picture of a tree in their life
  this
  youve missed the point of what i was saying so youre a brainlet im saying that popular awe in reaction to your work is a good barometer that its an intellectual and creative achievement they may not get the full depth of it though the public at large doesnt rationalize away flaws or give generous interpretations of works its ruthlessly critical of a weak first impression and honest in its praise critics whore themselves subsumed in an artistic culture that has long disappeared into its own anal vortex arent any kind of judge because theyre the first people to rationalize in favour of the newest trends or exaggerate the quality of worthless art in order to be the most trendy the most fashionable and the most obscure
  and thats unironically a good thing
  muh good times create weak men meem
  because its used to launder money  you dont need a masterpiece for that the token of exchange itself can be worthless  of course trading the work of literal whos at prices well above their market value is a fantastic way to draw attention from the authorities and that in reality all art movements are equally vulnerable to being used to launder money due to systemic problems within galleries and auction houses icky art you dont like is no more vulnerable to being used to launder money than the 19th century academic art that you hold dear crying money laundering is a cheap trick that doesnt hold up to scrutiny used by autists in lieu of finding a way to articulate why their personal preferences are actually somehow reflective of a nonexistant objective good taste
  imagine talking about the rise of the individual ego when shit like your post tended to be commissioned artwork by rich fucks to glorify themselves/select people
  do you mean contemporary
  because you are not interested in studying aesthetic philosophy and understanding the purpose and inspiration behind various pieces of abstract art as much as you are interested in beating your chest and weeping for the imagined death of the west
  funnily enough taking the time to study the reasoning behind it makes it impossible to ignore what a crock of shit it all is unless youre profoundly stupid or mentally ill
  why is this quote so stupid
  modern art arose during the modern period  artists from the pre and postgreat war  what a shit quote
  you dont seem to know shit about it
  possibly but i doubt op has studied it as a purely aesthetic matter and has understood why say romanticism  abstract expressionism in a way that isnt grounded in his uninformed political and social beliefs
  what do you actually know about modern art
  its your shitty taste baka
  im convinced modern art started out as a money laundering scheme  usually for laundering money they use real estate its effective the prices of houses are somewhat subjective and its large amounts of cash problem is that its easy to keep track of properties and price ranges in general cant be toyed with too much so its not that effective    art is subjective a drawing my sister made might be worth thousands to me but 0 to anybody else  entern modern art complete dogshit crap a toddler could make yet its worth millions    the first modern artists were involved in banking rothco and others and probably needed a way to launder money so they got involved with others      then you get the pretentious superiority complex faggots who see this as an oppurunity to feel elite over others  you just dont get it  then because its so extremely valueable art schools and teachers hop on the train to make a few bucks themselves     tada
  do you think that aesthetics should be the only consideration of what has artistic merit if so why
  because /pol/ told you to think that so you had no choice but to listen    because you are an npc
  it started with monet and impressionism fuck those french faggots
  deviant art is ironically better
  when it comes to paintings yes it should be about the art   if you care about someones life you value their story biography or maybe a portrait     not that one time they decided to vomit 3 colors of paint on a canvas     and for a lot of people it isnt even about the artists plenty of modern art graduates think the way rothco crudily painted 2 colors on a canvas resembles whatever deep meaning they want it to be  if that is the case then why do only those exact paintings have that deeper meaning while every other dual color canvas is seemingly worthless because theyre full of shit    it requires no talent and its an insult to actual artists to value these things so highly
  and architecture  because moderns were arrogant little shits who think they know better than ten thousand years of global independently developed knowledge so they remove all decoration in favor of their autistic simpleminded little constructs    and le corbusier might have been literally autistic    traditional architecture is harmonic fractal and organic  modern architecture is repetitive monoscale and mechanistic
  at least some of those try
  not all art is supposed to be pretty to look at its supposed to inspire or serve a message you can do more than just copy reality    neoclassical paintings are for postcards
  everyone knows what op means  really what did he mean then
  deviant art is ironically better  hahahahaha
  let me tell you why my porn is better than actual art
  some of it is of much higher quality yes
  i think 99 of the random porn you find on any given art site shows vastly more talent and effort in it than any piece of modern art yes that even includes a 14 year old furry doodles

/his/ teach me about the ancient mississippians i know nothing
  mississippi means father of rivers
  they built mounds
animalworshipping pagans and drug inhalers
  so like every culture before the spread of abrahamic faiths
  and many after
  my ancestor 
mississippian houses
  second only to the mighty ohioans
  post about them
  no
  they were giants desu
  honestly no one knows all that much about them were not even sure what they were called mississippian was a term made up after the fact and doesnt seem to be from the language they actually spoke we have some archeological remains of some of their larger settlements and their mounds and weve been able to glean some information from that but we know shockingly little about them on the whole a lot of what we know about their culture is based on the behavior of those living in the area at the time of contact for all we know the mississippians had a radically different culture
  the more i look at them the more im sure they are influenced by mesoamericans why wont american archeologists admit to this
  because it can be proven for sure some evidence of trade links have popped up but until some ground breaking discovery we cant be sure i dont know what to think but this gorget is something
  sorry about that i forgot to type out what that gorget is its an image of jaguar found is farfield missouri and said to be hopewell
    they worshipped the horned serpent which is seen from the maya region all the way to the pacificnorthwest   we know some names from hernando de soto and later people like coosa and cofitachequi many mississippians were ethnically creek choctaw natchez caddoan etc
chalcolithic savages who declined before first contact but whose dates are artificially extended to indicate a european origin of their downfall   also  ancient
  thats not the only repeating symbol  the feathered serpent normally thought of as an exclusively mesosmerican thing was also found in a mississippian artifact
  they ate corn squash and beans all native to central mexico they built mounds with temples on top i dont think they developed from mesoamerica but they sure wanted the organized society stuff
  we didnt commit genocide  we pride ourselves on conquering and genociding other races and our ancestors committed the most atrocious act of disregard for humanity in history around 3000 bce but we totally did not genocide the natives which is why we did not wage war on them displace them enslave them or give them small pox blankets
  is that pitiful moralizing supposed to do anything to me the europeans acted as any other did they just did it best   also  bce
  bbb motors
    looks almost norse tbqh
  t cletus
  smallpox blankets    implying germ theory existed    implying europeans arent smallpoxresistant    implying smallpox isnt carried by woolproducing sheep  why wont this meme fucking die
  you cant underestimate the effects of hernando de sotos expedition though the disease ridden pigs and several towns he destroyed along the way but especially the former took a heavy toll on them i think there was a previous expedition too which had affected some areas before de soto also i dont get whats the point of mentioning chalcolithic either
  their downfall  already happened its called the late period that european contact was just the final nail in the coffin where did you get that information from      the europeans acted as any other did they just did it best   hahaha
  because smallpox blankets were literally a thing in one or two instances  
you cant make a country from a bunch of different cultures who have been at war with each other for centur    why did nationhood work for the italian city states france spain united kingdom and germany why do eurosceptics think it wont work for the eu
  germany had a history of nationalism when it was established so did italy im not sure what you mean about france but france has had a more or less common history for like a millennium the united kingdom broke up when it asborbed ireland and the southern more populous part of scotland has a lot in common with england as opposed to the pastoralist gaelic north
  why did nationhood work for the italian city states france spain united kingdom and germany  easy theyre not a bunch of different cultures all differences within them are tiny compared to the differences outside  why do eurosceptics think it wont work for the eu  it could work if it were run by sane people people who dont want to import millions of arabs and africans but its not so it wont work
its a matter of benefits or necessity vs costs germans and italians had to unite to stop getting pushed around by others france im looking at you local people and cultures didnt necessarily like each other and sometimes they still dont but they liked each other more than the french    now as for the eu it could work and arguably does work in many ways but the benefits are not quite so obvious and the differences are bigger indeed mostly its just about trade and international law and such far less emotional a topic than foreign soldiers in your home
the eu isnt nationalist
    also different european states now have considerably different opinions on topics like immigration but thats not the main problem here note how britain is going head to head in the cuckolympics with germany and france but still doesnt want to be subject to german or french influence

hitler was a fed
  all of ww2 was realpolitik
hitler was a narc building up a case against morell
    you have to be really stupid not to conclude that in extension he was working for the government through the military you brainlets
  yeah i saw this in that one movie
hitler was a party member in the bavarian soviet republic probably where he got redpilled about them
hitler was an agent of the aog anglo occupation government
  was that not just called the british empire
  the anglo uses many disguises to mask their goal of global domination  the british empire the united states the anglo ruling caste cares not for country just their end goal of a universe enslaved and the teutonic race in the refineries

  theres a case for georgios papadopoulos the leader of greeces military junta from 1967 to 1974 being a cia agent since he received intelligence training in america and was supported by the cia during his coup
  hitlers rise to power could be interpreted as this the conservatives pushed him into the office of chancellor despite his electoral defeat because they thought hed be a useful puppet to push their agendas with unfortunately hitler had other ideas and used the reichstag fire which he may have been responsible for to enact emergency powers and purge the very people who put him in charge in the first place along with other undesirable elements of his own party eg ernst roehm
  almost everyone in the german post ww1 militias and extremist parties worked for the military/the government at least at one time or other that wasnt even seen as strange it was normal     in the us postvietnam working for the military has become less common and the result is any radical party automatically assumes you are a fed spy if you ever worked for the government and that none of your opinions a genuine you are just trying to entrap people thats probably not a bad assumption in the modern world but those assumptions are out of place in post ww1 germany     theres no evidence of hitler lacking belief in the hardcore volkish movement and pangermanism that was advocated by the groups he spied on just because he was hired to spy on those groups doesnt prove anything he may even have been inspired by them
  hitler was the most devoted undercover agent in history he stuck with it to the very end and got all the senior nazi leaders jailed or executed at nuremberg
at last the whole world is mine the first han emperor liu bang is said to have declared as he claimed the imperial throne  he despised learned confucians whom he readily identified by their distinctive peaked hats according to an incident recounted by a famous han historian sima qian when liu bang encountered one of these worthies he immediately snatches the hat from the visitors head and pisses in it   absolutely b a s e d
  confucius is studied worldwide even to this day and his thoughts shaped the east  the guy in your pic is nothing but a vague memory in the head of people interested in history of china  but lmao he pissed on a hat lol absolutely based am i right kek
literally who
  immediately  pisses in it  does he just have a full bladder at all times
reminder that this is the ancestor of sandalfag liubei cao cao did nothing wrong
literal sub human behavior its not like confucians are jews or muslims that level of vitriol isnt necessary
  he despised learned confucians  founds the first confucian dynasty  what did he mean by this
    nothing more than a vague memory of those interested in chinese history    founds the han dynasty still the namesake of the entire chinese ethnicity

  i like how almost nobody knows this
inb4 this turns into a jfk thread
  flp
is there a single valid argument against the great man theory
  all of them
  because most of the great men happened to just be given all the right cards and circumstances to make them who they were
  the only argument against the great man theory is that they depended on opportune circumstances to achieve what they did    this is a weak argument in my opinion as it doesnt negate the part that they played in history    its a bit like when progressives argue that social differences between racial demographics are entirely nurture and not at all nature  the two arent mutually exclusive both play a part
  gengis khan  tamerlane  napoleon  hannibal  ying zheng  they were all underdogs how do you explain what they achieved
  genghis khan  given all the right cards
  having been given all the right cards is a part of greatness
  gengis khan  tamerlane  ying zheng  literally all born nobles lets try starting from the bottom
  the times make the man op not the other way around
  genghis khan   noble
  it works both ways
    they were their exact circumstances in life including the hardships they endured shaped them into the people they became genghis khan would not being genghis khan if he lived a life of luxury when young
  great people are destined by fate
  tamerlane was a literal nobody he didnt have a drop of noble blood     gengis had a father who held together a minor tribe as soon as his father died the tribe left gengis his mother and brothers to fend for themselves they literally had to eat rats to stop from starving and had a handtomouth existence    ying zheng was noble but look at what he achieved look at how tiny qin is he managed to conquer and unify china from that who else but a great man could do something like that
  no im saying theyre lucky
my issue with the great man theory is its basically an excuse for us to have authoritarianism
  yes and its you the individual
  and if he was born in luxury you wouldve said that he couldnt have made it without those resources
  if he was born in luxury he wouldve turned out an entirely different person because he was shaped by completely different circumstances
  thats horrible
  timur was descended from the same mongol barlas tribe as genghis khan and shared a paternal ancestor with him even though he wasnt a descendant of genghis himself genghis khans family were khans of the khamag mongol state for four generations before him his great grandfather khabul khan pulled the beard of the jurchen jin emperor they were nobles
  there isnt because they all amount to if this great man didnt exist some other guy would just fill the same niche and history would play out in the same way and thats the kind of claim you can never really test since history only happens the one way it happens i guess if you had a really good artificial world simulator you could test out the consequences of replaying history with different famous historical figures removed from the equation but you would need to establish that simulator was producing the same results that would happen if these people were missing in the real world and if you think about it the way to prove that would be having it run ahead of our moment in time and then seeing if it predicted the future correctly and needing a machine like that to prove this argument which can only work if you design it so well that it can predict the future means proving this argument is effectively impossible we cant even handle predicting the exact local weather thatll happen a few days in advance let alone predict the ridiculously more convoluted mess of happenstances that will produce the future of social political and technological institutions
  still surprises me how stupid some people on this board are
  authoritarianism is based
  like that is something bad
  authoritarianism is bad
  he was given a eurasia ripe for conquest
all im seeing in this thread is some kind of pathetic bootleg proxy free will vs determinism argument
  great men are products of their time and merely catalyse ongoing events  individuals dont have a significant impact on history even the founders of great religions are merely appealing to the mood of the environment  the real forces of history are socioeconomic changes brought about by large complex institutions  history is the story of human trade and how to better it  it is a nice narrative and good to learn but you could remove any individual from history and guaranteed someone similar would take their place
  doesnt change the fact that when genghis father died he and his mother and brothers were completely abandoned and were forced to hunt to just stay alive and yet he managed to work his way up from nothing to create the largest contiguous land empire in history  the only reason the great man theory is so attacked nowadays is because the current zeitgeist hates the concept of strong independent men who can live outside of the system or create their own one thats why talking heads are always attacking bullshit terms like toxic masculinity  people like genghis khan or napoleon or mohammed had insane charisma and strength and foresight and used their traits in a way that had a decisive historical impact  if they were not alive sure someone else might have taken their place but the outcome would have been different we would not have islam but a different religion the mongols would have invaded different places at different times maybe focused more on western europe the french would have adopted a different style of government
  muh cultural marxist zeitgeist  or perhaps people are developing a better understanding of history
    coping this hard    you still have a chance to do something with your life man
  im not coping   im just spelling out the facts which by the way dont care about your feelings 
  not an argument
  what argument did you give
  stalin is the only example of the great man in history
why dont we have any great men anymore
  must suck not being able to read
  the king of qin started life in a court hostile to him his prime minister wanted to depose him and be king and was banging his mom who hated him for being linked to her hated husband the old king zhengs absentee dad in addition her mom had a big dicked lover  duke lao ai whom she wanted to install as king he was largely fucking alone    ying zhengs complete ruthlesness and paranoia stemmed from being born in such a fucked up family
  fate hasnt bothered since hitler broke its tropes from vagabond to leader to ushering the greatest war in history
  guns germs and steel
  in what sense was it ripe or more ripe for conquest compared to just about any prior period  inb4 it was ripe for conquest because genghis khan was able to conquer it
  literally nothing every time i see a proposed refutation its just that some brainlet has misunderstood the theory
  that doesnt mean that he wasnt talented and that those circumstances didnt go on to produce a great man who was then massively influential you couldnt simply put someone else someone less ambitious someone less clever in their place and expect history to develop in an equivalent fashion their unique characteristics are a huge forcemultiplier and they themselves become massively influential in history in a way other people wouldnt be
  huh yes of course
  see this is an actual argument against the great man theory and naturally its fucking dumb all the people saying that being born to nobility or privilege are points against the idea are in actual fact conceding the real substance which is that individuals drive history and not mystical forces of change or muh dialectics etc
  being this retard
  its not just the fact that you cant test that claim its also the fact that the claim doesnt even repute the great man theory    in essence nobody is asking why it is that masses of people under a given zeitgeist seem naturally compelled to find and get behind a leader who galvanizes them sure it doesnt necessarily matter to the great man theory who it is just that theres often an overarching desire to be led by and united under a single or a few identifiable people as figureheads    the great man theory cannot be refuted because it is easy to prove that this has repeatedly historically been the case  even in groups and movements who claim to adhere to some anarchic or cooperative principle with no centralised leadership a pecking order is naturally formed    to me the obvious answer for why there is veracity to the great man theory is  1 groups and populations of humans exceeding a few hundred maybe a few thousand people absolutely require some sort of hierarchy in order to maintain organisation and direct the function of that group to their desired goal  2 humans have an inborn tendency to want to personify practically everything you could say were homocentric on a base emotional level a cause with a leader as a figurehead a face even a cult of personality is going to grab peoples attention and motivate them to action in a way that stacks upon stacks of mere abstract sociopolitical theory never will especially when you talk about the common man who is hardly an intellectual genius they might not understand what words mean or be able to project ideas into the future but when they see firsthand the actions of a person and the immediate ramifications of those actions in the real world they intuitively understand it they feel it and they emulate it even if they dont understand it a leader sets an example whereby they dont feel they need to understand it for it to work mimesis
  didnt napoleon jump start the great man theory by btfo of europe
  he was the one who inspired hegel to write it so yeah
      it always sounds great until you get a mad king that needs to be deposed
    implying the capacity to enforce his rule was selfmade instead of a longperceived need to unite the various nomadic communities under a common khan which he largely incidentally was in the right place/right time for    i bet you think tengri guided him or some shit
  you havent spelled a single fact though    individuals dont have a significant impact on history even the founders of great religions are merely appealing to the mood of the environment    no they arent founders of great religions go against the mood of the environment which is hostile and resistant to their new religions    the real forces of history are socioeconomic changes brought about by large complex institutions  no they arent large complex institutions are toppled by great individuals all the time and great men build large institutions in replacement    history is the story of human trade and how to better it  pathetic vague platitude claim that means nothing    but you could remove any individual from history and guaranteed someone similar would take their place  no they wont this is pointless fallacy claim since you cant go back in time to falsify it    you have no facts

why do historical statues often depict benis but never bagina
i always wondered this myself same with paintings theres plenty of benis flopping around but the bagina area is always just drawn as a patch of skin i think it was considered obscene but i hope someone who knows more can come along and elaborate
  i think it was considered obscene  it still seems to be come to think of it films and tv shows with the appropriate age rating dont seem to have any qualms about portraying male genitals but whenever a females nude lowerhalf is shown they always make sure to film it at such an angle that nothing is actually visible beyond what you would see in those old statues i guess sensibilities when it comes to this still havent moved on since the days of ancient greece for some reason
because vaginas are disgusting but penises wonderful and magnificent no homo     t greeks who set the standard for western art
i wish i had a better idea of what a vagina looks like its not fair that girls are still allowed to be so mysterious
  it look like a sandwiche
  vaginas are hard to draw dude
  have you ever seen a penis and a vagina one is this great big throbbing stick the other is like a small line on the bottom of a womans torso they were depicted you just dont notice them as much because theyre harder to spot
  because artists are either gay or virgins
create a gentlemans club that is not reactionary  its literally that simple why has nobody done it i know that there are things like the knights of colombus and the freemasons but those are for religious old farts why is there no organization for lower class young men with a positive outlook and a productive motto something like an adult boyscouts
  proud boys
well freemasonry
  what youre describing is basically a socialist vanguard libshits are too pacifist and think bullshit like the market of ideas actually determines political outcomes instead of media propaganda and conflict between opposing blocs i am not condoning aggression but if the working class is to defend itself from tyranny the centre left must accept that the proles should be armed and organized the gentleman bullshit is just an idealization of the upper class
  men having a male space is opressive to females dont you know
  a private group thats open to change and outsiders without making people conform will just be irrevocably changed or dissolved it has to be conservative in its ways to exist
  it is called a gay bar theyre everywhere
how would a group of unarmed faggots overthrow a fascist government when the public isnt in their favor no really
  t angry university student    also    how do you know that your ideas have merit of youve never had them seriously challenged
  he wants to recreate the freemasons to fight fascism  he thinks creating exclusive clubs which are explicitly not reaction thus philosemitic and open to socialism will not intensify nascent fascism among gen z and millenials  he doesnt realize that nazis and reactionaries have always used secret clubs and fraternities as recruiting tools and boogeymen to consolidate their own authority as truly organic countercurrents to the constructed political environment their supporters tend to be instinctively disgusted with
  cant do that anymore anon  an all female space is a safe space but an all male space is a patriarchal mancave of oppression  and you gotta let in transmen or else you are a bigot
  lower class young men  gentlemans club  lower class  gentlemen  good luck with that
  how to defeat fascism  create a gentlemans club that is not reactionary  fascists arent reactionary theyre revolutionary  why is there no organization for lower class young men with a positive outlook and a productive motto  sounds like a fascist organisation although it doesnt have to be
  hmmmmm /pol/
  inherently political i think the best approach would have to be apolitical the constant of the member should be virtue and morality not political alliance    yeah but for young men     not at all that would just divide and polarize the nation    yes ideally it would be formed around virtues and morality kind of like a secular religion a philosophy of life    its not about overthrowing anyone its about giving young men a better alternative to join rather than fascism    it does not have to be exclusive other than just being male only     dont give a shit about what feminists think feminists are like 15 of the population maybe even most women arent feminists    but that is exactly the problem that it would be solving it would be good nurturing and mentorship for disadvantaged youth
  the white working class is going to listen to a bunch of undergrad marxists who simultaniously shame them for their sex race and believes    the proletariat has lost any sort of positive feelings towards socialism with the exception of perhaps some moderate form of national syndicalism
  gentlemans club  lower class    hahahahahahahahaha
  not exactly impressed by the real gentlemen its all about maintaining the image and saving face its all very fake
  dont give a shit about what feminists think feminists are like 15 of the population maybe even most women arent feminists  and yet they can still get your club shut down
  apolitical
  robert conquests three laws of politics  1 everyone is conservative about what he knows best  2 any organization not explicitly rightwing sooner or later becomes leftwing  3 the simplest way to explain the behavior of any bureaucratic organization is to assume that it is controlled by a cabal of its enemies
  freemasonry is still very much alive stop believing in /pol/ memes
  sounds likes absolute horseshite
  all humanities are at the end of the day
  undergrad marxists  make up whatever bullshit strawman you want the poor vote more left than right in america and were well represented in unions  shame them for their sex race and believes  marxists are not liberals we oppose racism but the fundamental type of oppression that enables all others is class society oprah and obama are as complicit in the neoliberal system as bezos  the proletariat has lost any sort of positive feelings towards socialism with the exception of perhaps some moderate form of national syndicalism  the average person has no idea what national syndicalism is but neocons overusing the word socialism has ironically made a convenient gateway thats reduced the stigma of the word and made more people open to our ideas well only grow in popularity as reactionaries grow and the liberal status quo fades income inequality is at a recent historical high ecological threats are rising and austerity threatens the poor much more than it did 60 years ago
  how to defeat fascism in one simple step  what fascism what country are you from
  the poor vote more left than right in america and were well represented in unions  if by left you mean the democratic party and by poor you mean certain racial lines and if by unions you mean literally who i guess
  not at all that would just divide and polarize the nation  the nation is already divided between the rich and the poor the former are now being directly elected to cabinets instead if their washington shills its the same in every other country and the gap is only going to widen with globalism and automation as we slowly drift from liberal capitalism towards corporate soft tyrannies in some ways even the reactionaries recognize these same problems but they misdiagnose it as a scheme by jews alone and ignore that the upper crust of all nations are together in steering this nightmare reality
  we need a new civilian conservation corps and massive revival of labor unions
  fraternities
  no fraternities is exactly what i would not want to create a cultish hierarchal environment meant to indoctrinate and break men until they submit yikes
  by poor you mean certain racial lines  even among whites lower income correlates with left wing views to a greater degree than higher income brackets especially when you control for education and age
  its been done welcome to 4chan
  among whites lower income correlates with left wing views  lol what
  whats wrong with fascism
  well yeah poorly educated people in america almost exclusively vote democrat
  depends in the south poorly educated people tend to vote republican
  wrong
  how about creating a one nation with direct elections for every decision that should be made
  wouldnt the chinese win every decision
  create a gentlemans club that is not reactionary  the very idea of a gentlemans club is reactionary as in order for it to be a gentlemans club it would require the rejection of female members you compare your idea to an adult boy scouts but even that simple comparison should show you the fruitlessness of your endeavor as the boy scouts in 2018 now admit girls
  boy female scouts
  in some ways even the reactionaries recognize these same problems but they misdiagnose it as a scheme by jews alone and ignore that the upper crust of all nations are together in steering this nightmare reality  what a gross generalisation /pol/ is not an accurate representation of the right wing
  marxists are not liberals    find me a single modern western marxist organization that isnt also liberal even trotskyists have become muslim apologists even /leftypol/ is rife with liberalism
  how to defeat fascism in one simple step  stop assuming that anyone whos not a whiny faggot numale is a fascist
  liberalism  capitalism and parliamentary democracy  socialism  not capitalism and not parliamentary democracy
  i dont use this definition for me liberalism while it encompasses what you mention also includes idpol as a focus such as feminism or support for immigration
  why are americans so fucking stupid
  well you claimed that western marxists were liberal so if you accept that liberalism is capitalism and parliamentary democracy whether are not they are also feminist then by definition no marxist organization is liberal since marxism is explicitly the critique of capitalism
    90 of black people vote democrat  ah yes i am sure they are all are highly educated gentlemen    seems a bit stupid that only white people get the education breakdown but i guess white americans hate their own race so much they dont really think twice  any excuse to shit on poor white people despite grandstanding so much about caring for people in poverty
  proud boys was created for the exact reason you just said gavin made it as a joke bc one of the tech guys that worked on his show was a really nerdy jewish kid who never got laid or partied and spent his time listening to show tunes gavin would mock him on his show by playing random showtunes and played a song called proud of your boy from an disneys aladdin musical    this song became the go to joke and gavin eventually created a small mens club like the shiners that was just about going to bars and doing guy stuff so this nerdy kid would learn how to be a man    then separate from this gavin kept getting attacked by antifa since they thought he was a fascist and in response some of the proud boys who were all these tough blue collar guys would go to his events to act as security they got into fights with antifa then the media went batshit and started labeling them as a fascist nazi group and fear mongered them into being this big scary brownshirt group    tldrthe left wing ruined your idea
  pic related its the jewish virgin who is responsible for the creation of the nazi brownshirts the msm keeps telling you about
it is a well known fact that the amerimutt meme was a funded divide and conquer tactic by soros and the government have there been any other proved dc tactics by subversive agents in our history  bonus points for any in the 50s id imagine there would be lots then with the commie threat
dowsing rod spectrography and crystal ball electromagnetic field detection has confirmed that soros is the reincarnation of karl marx reports the department of the commission of the national association for the federation    please fuck off back to your containment board you autistic faggot
  why cant americans take the banter
remember kids plato absolutly wanted the state to absolutly cuck you guys    it is necessary that the best kind of people have as much and the worst kind of people as little sex as possible and that only the children of these talented and intelligent people are raised if we want our herd to have the best qualities further more we want that only the state knows about the course of events regarding reproduction too prevent that it will result in conflict in the community
  wasnt he himself fat and ugly though
fascists and monarchists are closeted cucks
  no he was an ancient olympic wrestler although he never won the prize
    actually i just doublechecked it wasnt the ancient olympics it was the isthmian games still he was an athlete when he was younger
  so he was fat and ugly
  he was a genius a sexy man with a beard we should consider him to be a true alpha male by our own standards
wheres the lie
  he stated that the state should prevent the less intelligent to reproduce    he suggest that the state should use a system by drawing lots if you were lucky you would get to marry someone little do you know the state controls it they do this so the people dont get mad at the state but blame fate
this was the most controversial part of the republic   i dont think he advocated the same position in the laws        ummm tho he wath fat and ugly     no woman who has ever lived would choose to spend time with you over platon
  turns out to be a 50 manlet   ancient people were pretty ugly by modern standards
  the state should prevent the less intelligent from reproducing    the ideal situation would be something like enslaving the bottom half of men and having the top half of men being polygamous with two women
  the whole part about stealing peoples baby isnt that nice either if youdd ask me
  thats fucked up though i mean im a tankie of sorts but even i would say that the state should serve the individual and not the other way round
  im a tankie but i believe in the social contract  thats gonna be a yikes from me
  didnt mention the social contract not sure what youre talking about
  the state should serve the individual  totalitarian in the sense of the system being total in many aspects communism does literally the opposite
  well he says that men who proved them selfs in war should be able to have as many sexsual partners as possible
  im arguing my position not platos    i think people who are a standard deviation below the mean in iq nonverbal test and general health markers like height drug addiction genetic disease carriers committing premeditated violence or theft should not be allowed to reproduce
  not really
    well i think you are wrong people should be allowed to be unhealthy when born  there are enough short males who have proved themself to be very usefull an what about drug addiction what counts by your strandards as a drug addiction        but i think you are right in the second part crimminals should not reproduce
  a system which is total in some aspect means there is no dissent allowed    by definition you cannot have a system like that that serves the infinitely divergent interests of invidiuals
  allowing weak genes to reproduce has additive effects that permanently pollute the genepool dysgenics for the sake of liberty infringes on the liberty of generations of future people to be free of the problems of their ancestors
  none of that bullshit makes any sense thats the sort of pseudo scientific crap that makes mediocre men like you believe they are alphas in reality you are nothing more than the man beside you irrespective of whatever arbitrary trait you decided to use to claim that you are superior
  the sociological research twin studies clearly show genetics have a dominant roll in someones intelligence in developed countries
  you dont get to determine what the weak genes are
  and so what
  whoever controls the government does
  libertine reproduction policy is dysgenic
    you cannot base policy on statistics an then apply it to individuals that would be grossly unjust  look statistically if you are on 4chan you are a pedo weeb so you should be gas chambered
  nobody does because nobody has a right to do such things    tell that to jeff bezos
  or putin
  you cannot base policy on statistics an then apply it to individuals  any modern policy does exactly this  look statistically if you are on 4chan you are a pedo weeb so you should be gas chambered  irrelevant i still think its correct
  nobody does because nobody has a right to do such things  rights are government guarantees and do not exist outside the capacity for an authority to enforce them  tell that to jeff bezos  i am fine with the timeline in which bezos was never born
platos beliefs in a rigidly enforced caste system sort of contradict his beliefs in eugenics it doesnt make that much of a difference if your blacksmith has 100 iq or 115 iq and theres a lot more dumb jobs than smart jobs especially 2500 years ago realistically what ends up happening in the sort of extremostatist society that plato advocated for is that the government uses its power to target and destroy people with high potential that they perceive as being in competition with their family/associates/tribe for the smart jobs even his suggestion that children should be raised by the state so they can pick the brightest to be philosopher kings is directly contradicted by his own belief that children should have the same job as their parents     his whole ideology is based around stroking the egos of the rich and powerful by not only convincing them that theyre truly superior to everyone else and therefore deserve their wealth and power but also that they should go even further in controlling and dominating those less fortunate than them    people who are already rich should be allowed to use the assets of the state to give their kids the best possible education for when they take over as administrators but well craft a narrative that pretends they took that position because of their worthiness rather than the circumstances of their birth to try to convince the blacksmith that his kid had the same chance of being chosen if only hed been brighter    tplato
  it is really shocking how oligarchic and essentially mouthpieces for the powerful he the entire socratic crew was  they always disregarded the common athenian no wonder they were hated
  does of matter does life get better of we prohibit people from maling children i dont tink so
  socrates deserved his fait
  does of matter does life get better of we prohibit people from maling children i dont tink so  yes it does there are people who absolutely make society worse for all other people
read bnw you need a docile unintelligent underclass to have people on the top if unintelligent people stop reproducing then the bottom of the intelligent people would become the new unintelligent and so on
  thats the reason why europe was able to create the modern world in the first place midevil europe had a defacto eugenics policy
  because marriage norms were so strict and based entirely on family politics there was no thought left to actual genetic fitness so you cannot be more wrong on that one
  1 capital punishment was handed out for most crimes including some crimes we now consider misdemeanors  2 marrying someone who was a 6th cousin or closer was prohibited by the church  3 there was downward social mobility in nearly all marriages because the higher in the class structure the more children you had that survived to adulthood this only changed after a few decades into the industrial revolution where birthrates became dysgenic wwi also greatly helped this along because officers suffered casualties at far higher rates than general infantry
  the ideal situation would be something like enslaving the bottom half of men and having the top half of men being polygamous with two women  amuse me and say that you believe that youd be in the upper half
  higher classes were mostly hereditary retard and they were inbred as hell    see hapsburgs and the one family in england with hemophilia
    tall genes have been rendered weak and inferior in the modern era   a state that genetically modifies its population to all be around 5 feet tall as compared to one where everyone is like 62 will be able to support a far larger population for the same amount of resources while also having higher military economic and scientific output  genemodding will not make people large the future ubermensch is a gnome not a giant
  rights are government guarantees and do not exist outside the capacity for an authority to enforce them  this is so baffeling opposite how the fuck can any retard believe this  actions can only be restricted not granted all humans are born with all rights and then the state restricts some actions it does not give you the right to do anything you buffoon
  deciding not to do something is still a decision    a right in a legal context is that certain procedures will be followed and if they are not institutional forces will correct it in the absence of a guarantee from the state people violate each others rights constantly
  i already clarified that i dont think it matters where i would be it only matters what is correct
  why do you want more people
  stay mad bronzelet
  people are not objects
  doesnt matter
  drug addiction genetic disease carriers committing premeditated violence or theft     these are all primarily sociological issues but since youre a stormtard that obviously doesnt matter to you
  t (((statist cuckold)))
  i am not a fascist but policy is either eugenic or dysgenic and by definition one is better than the other    t libertarian that has never considered whether his natural rights theory ever mapped to reality
  nigger goes in every field  slave reference
  yes some people are evil but remember everybody who lives right now has family who murderd raped etc there woud be no people right now if all killers and criminals in history woud have not been able to reproduce    besides that do you really want a goverment which is so big that they have enough power to enforce policies regarding love sex and such   maybe in the beginning it is fine but of the goverment officials change their targets wil change aswell     maybe you would not resist but most people would which resulst in an awefull society in which there wil be massive class warfare    also people will riot if they are denied the right to reproduce and some individuals wil go rogue because of this and just start killing    also the ruling class could prohibit its opposition to reproduce
  we wil get more people if you want it or not
  they do this so the people dont get mad at the state but blame fate  thats the stupidest shit i read
  he could 100 beat the shit out of you kid
  similar policies were in force during the middle ages which is the period in history where the state had the least power    you live now in a society where libertine behavior is subsidized and the state has the most authority its ever had
  nah m8 theyre pretty open about it
  minimal state action was able to halve the birthrates of a billion people on our own lifetime
  1 and 3 apply to virtually every civilization and 2 was not persistent across all of europe from region to region a 4th degree of blood separation was prevalent before and after that decree
  the only sustainable existence for humanity in the future unless we abandon industrial society entirely is a malthusian ecostalinist world government that deliberately slows economic growth and kills swathes of people
  remember kids aristotle strongly disagreed with plato
  well i would argue that isnt true the state was weak but that was just because the local leaders had power the samen people benefiting because of these laws     local leaders where the first to have sex with girls before they married for example    the state didnt have much power but locale leaders and the church had
  why people lacking intelligence are still needed for a variety of jobs intelligence isnt the endall beall of personality traits its not like removing criminal genes from society that is a complete net positive
  it doesnt make that much of a difference if your blacksmith has 100 iq or 115 iq  except it does  the quality of the worker increases with the iq
  not when we have robots    also if every clerk and worker was significantly more intelligent we would have higher quality goods and services
  the quality of your burger want increase division of labor makes jobs mindless

we keep hearing about how kursk was the end of the axis on the eastern front but wasnt operation bagration the final true nail in the coffin
  because kursk was a german offensive while bagration was a soviet offensive kursk was the last major german offensive in the east which has significance
germany lost at moscow and never recovered eveything after moscow was damage control falling back and desperation
teutoberg
  but wasnt operation bagration the final true nail in the coffin
  we
  there was no coffin for germany soviets just kept hammering
  because kursk was their last attempt to control the initiative on the eastern front and they flopped it was clear from then on that even when germans were the attackers it was in response to something the allies were doing they became a purely reactive force and therefore could not win
  and rokossovsky is responsible for both
  literally who oh wait one of those great soviet generals who figured out the exact ratio of russian bodies to german bullets he needed for the halfrifled humam waves    thats a weird way to speel roosevelt and general motors
  is this bait its not easy to plan complete encirclements and destructions of the german army you realize this yes
  nah its actually extremely easy when their defeatist generals are always retreating and the allied air forces have bombed germam communcations to the stone age    all the soviets had to was attack and sometimes they couldnt even do that right kharkov seelow heights proforovka
  thats a weird way to speel roosevelt and general motors  ultra cringe weak bait
  defeatist generals are always retreating  what the fuck are you talking about some of the biggest disasters came precisely as a result of hitler disagreeing with manstein and refusing to retreat and utilise the backhand blow not that the war would ultimately have ever turned out better due to lack of resources
so what were the europeans doing while the iraqis chinese and indians were inventing civilisation why are they so useless and unimportant until alexander

  oh shït
  why does no one care
why does no one care about his penis anymore
how can a girl be interesting when they lack the body part that would make someone exciting to be around
  thats how guys get away with being so gd boring talking about the same old shït all the time especially sports ffs
womens lack of a penis has forced us to have to create new illusions over the past millions of years that we are fun exciting and interesting in spite of what we lack down there
  
thats why ftm trannies are so angry we still lack a penis and were never wired for the drudgery of life in a work uniform identical to everyone else
  luckily i dont wear one we also often come into it unprepared for the dark drab colors in the mens department
for me its the british east india company
what for you
meritocracy includes the following  a world in which every child gets an equal chance to succeed in life  the abolishment of party politics  only those with a relevant education and work experience should be allowed to vote rather than just anyone who has reached the age of 18 or 21  the introduction of 100 inheritance tax so that the superrich can no longer pass on their wealth to a select few their privileged children this would mean the end of the elite dynasties and hereditary monarchy  a radically reformed educational system based on the mbti personality types and insights from radical innovators such as rudolf steiner and maria montessori  to replace free market capitalism with social capitalism and to replace democracy with a fully transparent meritocratic republic under a meritocratic constitution  the end of nepotism cronyism discrimination privilege and unequal chances    what if we applied this to country of approximately 80 million consenting individuals who agree with it  what would be the issues and benefits
  its an interesting idea bit have you ever tried taking an mbti test twice you get different results
  okay then use another personality test or take mbti 20 times and take the average
anything can work if  you apply it globally  you make the idea sellable  avoid hypocrisy    the issue would be efficiency and butthurt relatives    needs about 3 generations to completely transform public thinking
  a radically reformed educational system based on the mbti personality types  no mbti is used by corporations to get a general gist of an employees mindset and where it would be suitable
  a radically reformed educational system based on the mbti personality types  sell me on this how are you going to educate or integrate the mbti types that are the least interested in partaking in society
  mbti  no way anon im intp but dont want to be forced to spend my days churning out code in a smelly room with unwashed autists
  who said you could leave the code mines anon
unfortunately that inheritance tax thingy goes pretty strongly against basic human nature so youd need to do quite a lot of social engineering to make people accept it  also how do you think itll affect the society that there is no longer an incentive to gain wealth for their offspring wouldnt it just make people blow their money on whores and crack before death beibg able to show love to your offspring aint something you wanna mess with too much this shit is the damn bible a good man leaves a good inheritance for his sons
  nobody likes having weak kids who cant make their own wealth who piss away their inheritance in 3 generations anyway
  make social interaction not necessary fixes everything intp issues are only social interaction
  what about infp
  same thing just more feminine would do well in autistic but feminine roles
  meritocracy  every child gets an equal chance to succeed in life  hearty kek anon
  the abolishment of party politics  yeah so the cliques can take over
  party politics is a low level ethics shitshow for laymen
we will just force them lol  high iq thread
  not if they consent
  why do people with merit have any reason to look out for the best interests of the country  you are giving them all the power so they have no reason to respect the interests of the masses they will look out for themselves
aurelian was on his way to persia for a massive military campaign until he was assassinated in thrace under very tragic and unnecessary circumstances many roman emperors had campaigned in mesopotamia both before and after this period but were largely unable to achieve much aurelian was undoubtably one of the greatest commanders of his time and the sassanids were at the time ruled by bahrām ii who had just succeeded his father and was initially very unpopular and proved somewhat ineffective at fighting carus during his invasion of 282 if aurelian hadnt been killed could he have won a decisive victory over the sassanids
yes    s o l i n v i c t u s
maybe if he had made it there before the sassanids could mount a defence remember ciceros campaign in parthia and how well that went
  he almost certainly would have  however it should be noted that even a crushing victory over the sassanids would have only resulted in some relatively minor border changes in the far east of the empire rather then the total annexation of persia that i have seem some suggest   i think the far more important and lasting result of a victory over the sassanids would not be the territorial changes but rather the freedom for aurelian to finally focus on fixing the frankly broken imperial government and solidifying the primacy of sol invictus      this
  i suppose thats what i was getting at a roman annexation of mesopotamia let alone iran proper would be totally implausible    if the defeat was severe enough it could more or less break the power of the sassanid dynasty and result in civil wars and political instability much like the situation in the 7th century immediately after nisibis that alone could have huge implications
  crassus mate
    rome had other parthian campaigns some successful some not why do people only mention crassus
  so what would sol invictus religion be like  will it be just polytheistic hellenic religion just with sol invictus as main god something like hinduism or would it be like zoroastrianism
  /his/  pop history  humanities
  aurelian was undoubtably one of the greatest commanders of his time
  most pontifex of sol invictus were also priests of other gods so its a first among equals situation at best
  tgallienus
  initially he would be chief of the gods but it would probably shift towards a form of monotheism over time  i think aurelians cult of sol invictus already promoted the idea that other deities were simply different aspects of sol
  so yeah something like ahura mazda  brahman
  i could actually see a roman mesopotamia being viable in the wake a of persian civil war and the resulting disintegration of power in the west  it would probably be quite the cultural and economic boon to the empire also      it is impossible to say what aurelians vision for religious reform would have been had he had the chance   but we do have a pretty good idea of what a sol invictus centred hellenic religion would have looked like to julian who ruled just under a century later     without going into the broader late neoplatonism that influenced much of julians conception of a reformed hellenic religion   sol invictus would have been seen as the only true god   all of the other gods would still have been accepted as real however they would have been seen as autonomous semiindependent manifestations of sol invictus rather then the polytheistic conception of them being fully independent beings  basically an interesting and unique religion that would have been straddling the lines between henotheism monotheism and polytheism    from what we can tell this religion would not have been dualistic   hence it is only really similar to zoroastrianism in the regard of it being a revised form of a formerly polytheistic religion that demotes almost all of the previous polytheistic pantheon down to some lesser level without denying their existence
  tfw we were denied a pagan monotheistic rome    christcucks must pay
  zoroastrianesque neoplatonic religion that dominates feudal europe    my dick can only get so hard
  semiindependent manifestations of sol invictus rather then the polytheistic conception of them being fully independent beings  this is somewhat like hinduism and zoroastrianism in hinduism there is only one god brahman and he is the universe that manifests in diffirent gods like vishnu brahma and krishna etc in zoroastrianism is pretty similar ahura mazda is the main god and has semi divine gods/angelic manifestations called yazata like mithra ameretat haurvatat etc  it wouldve made so much sense if aurelian/constantine/julian reformed hellenism this way since both of these religion share common indoeuropean root if they ever were succesfull they would inspired other european reliigon to reform same way like germanics and slavic pagans  personally i can add that they couldve used a phophet like figure like zoroster/jesus and it couldve been legendary grecoroman figrure like apollonius of tyna
        graecoroman neoplatonic monotheism
  200 rome  no   ally ptolomic   give up anything south and easy of sicily that isnt a grain supply company  all in germania magna  ur still gonna fall in the balkans  but yeah
    hinduism is less of a singular religion and more like a spectrum several branches including the most common are monotheistic but it isnt universal
    sol invictus as deus/father  mytha as spirit  appolonius as son/prophet  pantheon as manifestation of sol invictus  just fucking imagine it christians must pay
    all monotheism monism and nondualism logically entail satanism and the blurring of good and evil radical dualism is the only path towards the truth ahura mazda never created ahriman unlike the abrahamic god or neoplatonic one light and darkness are not two sides of the same coin and the light exists to banish the darkness you are a daeva and spread ahrimanic lies
  why must a theoretical a monotheistic god need to be perfectly good instead of just perfectly correct
  do you at least agree the distinction between good and evil is absolute check image if not then i dont even want to bother talking to you
  light and darkness are not two sides of the same coin  darkness is simply the absence of light absence of light is created by ignorance once ignorance is shed only light remains evil has no intrinsic quality
  pagan neoplatonic imperial cult with heavy focus on the sun god and martial virtues   mfw    shame we got shit like christianity and islam dominating the world instead
siiiighwhat could have been
  could have had a fully romanized and imperial monotheistic solar religion spread across europe and the mediterranean world  instead we got a knockoff judaism    fucking hell
  like others said it would have started as as centered around the sun as a chiefgod and slowly evolving into something more monoteistic the society was full of neoplatonist ideas so christianity or not classical polytheism was doomed    but i suppose the rise of the solar cult in europe could also had dire conseguences in the eastern half the greekcultural zones and africa were by aurelian times christianity was already the dominating religion
   we got a knockoff judaism
  its possible that continued imperial support of the solar cult would in that instance lead to a situation where aspects of christianity were incorporated into the canon of the state religion  things to attract slave and lower class support such as promise of salvation and eternal life in order to ease the transition from christianity to the worship of sol invictus in those regions where christians were in large numbers christianity was much the same in incorporating features of roman paganism to aid conversion
  both light and darkness have irreconcilable intrinsic qualities
  dude wtf why your knocking on my door  dude weed lmao  interpretation is everything
  interpretation is everything  again take your moral nihilist bullshit and shove it up your ass i have little to no patience to debate you imbeciles anymore
  indeed julian planned pagan church was basically a copypaste of the christian bishopship so having some sort of merging like this would have been viable    i would even say it was probably the initial plan of costantine but later probably after the radical conversion of his childrens and the influence of his mother he scrapped the plan to incorporating christianity within the solar cult and choose to do the opposite
  the best move would be the enslavement and genocide of everything within 100 miles of ctesiphon and demolishing every brick of every building salt the earth    that would remove the sssanid threat for a while
  stfu you arb or trk
  a better solution would be establishing a mesopotamian clientkingdom which they could have taxed and used as a buffer state against anything east of the zagros mountains
is this the largest empire with the fewest written sources that is a seriously impressive amount of land for this time period no one ever remembers the gokturks
  for this time period  whats the difference to genghiss time period same horsenog shit
  it was 700 years before there had never been a turkic khaganate this vast before
eurasian steppe high reuptake due to fluidity of geography easily conquered easily retaken same formula until russian train tracks chained it down
  yeah but its not like there was any significant development in the steppe societies in that 700 years  its impressive of course same as the later mongol empire was but the time period doesnt really make a difference afaik
the diary of christopher columbus was written by christopher columbus because it has his name on it
    there is a russian tv show where the soviet union never fell and continued to exist is this what the ussr would look like today /his/
  did the us collapse in this show also the music is annoying vremya should use the time forward music much nicer
  i want to be a commie now
if the ussr had gone under successful reforms it would probably be a farless shitty version of china   at best guess it would probably look quite similar to modern scandinavia but all private enterprise would still be under the thumb of the party like in current china or vietnam the soviet leadership in the 80s though saw canada as what they wanted their country to look like
  russian tv show where the ussr doesnt collapse  russia is now far more clean and technologically advanced      but but the everyone in russia hated the ussr and yearned for capitalist freedom yeltsin is praised as a national hero in russia
  i really like how cynical it is about putin being in power no matter what kind of government
  canada tremendously different from america  i doubt it except if they are talking about the similarities of their natural terrain and weather
american president george h w bush with syrian president hafez alassad
  a syrian army soldier with his rifle participating in operation desert shield against saddams iraq
  same syrian army soldier during operation desert shield against saddams iraq syrian president hafez alassad committed the syrian army to the coalition in operation desert shield in the 1991 gulf war to drive saddam out of kuwait
      they only did that because iraq was considered to be a threat even though both sides were baathists similar to the sinosoviet split one of saddams reasons that led him to the 79 purge that led him to take power in iraq until his death was about the iraqi president making treaties that couldve led to a syrianiraqi union under hafez syria thus making iraq look like a puppet state
  this is after the lockheed explosion and beirut  this is next level diplomacy
  what lockheed explosion and beirut
  the rivalry between the syrian and iraqi branches of the baath party is insane it makes eastern bloc autism look like reasoned pragmatism arab unity my ass
  it had something to do with saddam and his sons being mentally ill megalomaniacs and hafez and his sons being normal
  mentally ill megalomaniacs and hafez and his sons being normal  
  meant lockerbie whoops        
  thats normal special forces training in mena egyptian lebanese and sudanese special forces all have to eat live snakes dogs and chickens you can see yourself on youtube hafez didnt start this
  lebanese only do the snakes but other mena countries include chickens and dogs
  saddam had a broken childhood and early life hafez had a stable family with a strict father and a normal career path
  iraqis and americans use rabbits
  yeah and its pretty much useless unless youre gonna eat the damn thing alive  its clearly a test of courage more than anything
  iiim stiilll in a dreeeeam
  it worked syrian special forces destroyed isis and killed nusra
  implying they didnt eat russian rations
    muh normal  hafez gets easy normie treatment  saddam becomes public enemy 1 for daring to be different  neurotypical tyranny is a disease saddam could have reformed neoneobabylon and saved the me if not for the eternal plebeians hatred for all that is rare in man
  hafez  neurotypical    lmao the dude lived in a giant bunker
  fuck off cunt this isnt 
  thats autism a very common affliction nowadays might as well consider it as bland and regular as depression  saddam was cruel a larger than life narcissist idealist and megalomaniac those are traits the eternal normie seek to suppress more then anything
why did people stash their cash in their houses after the great depression again i forgot please tell me why
  because the bank gave their money to other people
  the banks loaned out more money than existed
  
  just think for a bit apu come on
should probably still keep a stash
  known as ava her bones were found in a grave cut into solid bedrock at achavanich in caithness in 1987  new ancient dna research has shown that she was descended from european migrants who arrived in britain a few generations before she was born  the analysis also suggested that she likely had brown eyes and black hair and that she was lactose intolerant  the research led by archaeologist maya hoole has shed new light on previous ideas on avas appearance she was found to be from an earlier date than previously thought
the process the artist followed included photographing and taking measurements of avas skull and teeth using information from a database of modern european tissue depths that correlated with avas age sex and ancestry and drawing the shape of the womans head and facial features  mr morrison said when i received the results of the dna testing from maya which showed that ava had straight dark hair brown eyes and a lessfair complexion i was presented with the opportunity to revise the first facial reconstruction  whilst the overall shape of avas face and facial features remained as they were previously darkening her eyes her skin tone and giving her totally new hair made her look very different to what i initially imagined when i received the dna results  he added i did not feel that she looked typical of what a person from bronze age britain would have looked like but perhaps that of a person from a more southern part of europe
  so is she bell beaker sperg seems to think she was med but do we actually have reason to think this was the case
  since cheddar man was black how come this girl was white are british people mulattoes
  go away amerifat/leftypol
  but gender is a social construct why are these bigoted archeologists allowed to assume her identity
  sardinians are darkhaired and can tan well
  lactose intolerant     wasnt literally everybody
    most british people have dark hair all the fair hair and gingers came from scandinavia
  would smash
  not everyone would have been lactose tolerance is a fairly common mutation in humans and some people would have been able to stomach it despite not eating dairy into adulthood the indoeuros were largely lactose tolerant because dairy was a big part of their diets this provided them an advantage because it allowed them to get more caloric value out of an animal than simply slaughtering them would allow and the dairy made them strong
so the ancient black men of britain also fucked ancient white bitches based the reign of bbc never fell and is eternal
  straight hair    this is the part i find interesting desu most europeans dont have particularly straight hair
  lay off the video games and porn
  this provided them an advantage because it allowed them to get more caloric value out of an animal than simply slaughtering them would allow and the dairy made them strong    i keep telling people this is dominant factor in ie conquests but most want to believe they were a bunch of ubermensch warriors who rode in on horseback and fucked everybody up in reality they rode in on big clunky wagons and sipped milk
  well the milk is what made them the supermen they were and they did have horses
  brainlet    neolithic people were already drinking milk lbkdescended funnelbeakers had lactose tolerance while corded ware didnt
  yes but the horses pulled them on wagons they would have been too small to ride on they also used oxen for this
  id cum on that face all day
  she died recently most lactose intolerance is due to chlorine in water
  so are scandinavians they tan orange
this is a beaker woman she wasnt a farmer brainlets imagined that indoeuropeans were those blueeyed blond warriors but this was obviously not the case   lactose tolerance and typical north european traits werent yet common in early and middle bronze age   the oldest individual with lactose tolerance weve found so far is from russian srubna culture from around 1900 bc so no yamna cwc and bell beakers were still mostly lactose intolerant
  bell beakers were heavily farmer and so are their west euro descendants
  this is fairly old news i saw a lecture maya gave back in my second year
  most europeans dont have particularly straight hair    south european swrthoid detected
  incel nordicist poleshit detected
  my sister also has dark hair and eyes yet she is still northern european exceptions to the rules exist
  cheddar man had dark skin but he wasnt black besides hes much older compared to that woman who was around well after the depigmentation of europe
  the oldest individual with lactose tolerance weve found so far  is from the funnelbeaker neolithic culture
  he oldest individual with lactose tolerance weve found so far is from russian srubna culture from around 1900 bc    complete bullshit
  funnelbeakers enjoyed onions milk
  sorry but your father got keked
  my dad also has brown hair and eyes and she looks more like him than me
  pottery
  am i french since i have brown hair
  i invented a device that wraps around my dick and vibrates  am i a norman
  normans werent french and henry looks central european
  is she supposed to be a yamna rapebaby cuz the previous inhabitants shg  enf mutts were blonde haired blue eyed fair skinned lactose tolerant and fairly short with their men being 55 and their qt women being 50 tall    holy shit the farmer  sshg mutts were literally the closest thing to elves
/his/torical bantz thread
whats the best execution method in your opinion what are most painful and what are less
  inert gas asphyxiation
the kind of surgical anaesthesia that puts someone out cold for hours followed by 
  braaaapp
    orgasm induced cardiacarrest
  gun to center mass cheap body remains intact reliable   all of them vary in risk of failure and humanely treating both the condemned and executioner but public perception is a factor as well  even    have been botched via human error a bad injection will be tortuous and can last 2 hours   the balance of efficiency and keeping it clean is difficult a firing squad is pretty hard to mess up but carries militaristic undertones on top of asking several men to spend the rest of their lives wondering if their bullet did   the science of hanging would be easy to cater to each individual with modern tech and avoid the gruesome failures from the past but even a successful one of it offends modern sensibility   with all the massive ethical debates surrounding it so long as its legal the best compromise might be to offer the condemned a variety of choices
  imo firing squad is the best one
  make a machine do it and it would be ideal
  
  we have a variety of options catered to your mortality preferences
  just shoot them anything is is weird and creepy
  if the government offers exactly one option and it goes south its squarely on their shoulders the condemned choosing his end helps shield from public outcry on cruelty since his wish is being honored
  guillotine firing squad hanging and lethal injection in no particular order i think throwint people into volcanoes is amusing but obviously a bit ostentatious and religuous for most peoples taste it would be good to force judicial authorities to have to hike up a small mountain to kill nigs though wouldnt it being realistic a cold hearted bullet to the back of the hear would be more than what most criminals deserve and extremely efficient i have no idea why this isnt the preferred method since its what the fascists and commies preferred for no nonsense trialless executions during war time
  which method is the best for the executioner one of the main problems with the death penalty that someone has to look into the eye of the condemned and bear the guilt of being a murderer which method can has the executioner most removed from the action making him feel the least guilty
  death by snu snu
the guillotine was probably on of the most effective ones imo
  i agree on that aswell
  i have no idea why this isnt the preferred method since its what the fascists and commies preferred  you answered your own question they did that because they were executing lines of people
stoning it brings the community together
  so why cant we do this to rapists and gang members just line them up and have some empty eyed 90 iq man bust caps in the backs of their heads and call it a day why do we even pretend they deserve dignity with a firing squad if che can shoot 18 year olds point blank with a revolver then we can get some farmboy to do it for above minimum wage and a nice pension
there isnt a perfect way  the guillotine hanging just beating them to death shooting gas chambers lethal injection electric chairs all do not quarantee a humane execution and never eliminates the horror of waking up and feeling of i die today  just lock them up for the rest of their lives until they naturally die of old age / whatever you eliminate the problem of everyone in the nation having to be part of a collective killing of a person and the possibility of innocents being killed since there is no way to make up for it
  why do we even pretend they deserve dignity with a firing squad  just because these people violated the rights of others does not mean we should violate theirs
  which method can has the executioner most removed from the action making him feel the least guilty  in the late 19th century an automated gallows was invented that was triggered by sensing the weight of the condemned standing on the apparatus after a sufficient time delay to put the noose around his neck it yanked him upwards with sufficient speed to snap the neck
  because were not a police state each individual death sentence goes through years sometimes over a decade of appeals so its already absurd to envision group execution but the bottom line is the us government does not want to set that precedent
  but then you have to maintain prisoners with tax money for decades in decades with an effective execution method you could get rid of that burden
  this
  decapitation
  i prefer the treatment the kikes got in the death factories so its a combination of things    raped by dogs masturbation machine mengele changes their eye colour by inserting a needle with blue colour into them and then picks out their eyes and puts them on his massive eye wall and then a bear mauls the victim gas is then pumped into rectum until the person looks like a balloon and then they are put in a rollercoaster that goes 200km/h until it stops infront of a wall that opens and has a massive electric furnace behind it and the cart stops instantly so the person is thrown from the cart straight into the oven where he explodes from all the gasses inside him
  just lock them up for the rest of their lives    arguably even more inhumane than an execution unless you of course consider driving a person into utter insanity with no escape to be fairer to that persons dignity as a human being     indeed what is the difference but a matter of timescale letting someone die of natural course by locking them up yet at the same not meeting their psychological and social needs amounts to nothing more than an expensive drawn out torture which can be even more objectionable to a quick guaranteed death as for responsibility who are you kidding the responsibility is still collective irrespective of whether its one person pulling a trigger state ordained or tax payers money
  the little bits and pieces of meat is then turned into soap which will be used to wash aryan babies with
  just lock them up for the rest of their lives until they naturally die of old age  the idea of lifetime imprisonment has always struck me as far more cruel than execution    prison is for temporarily holding inmates until they are reformed any other goal and it just becomes punitive torture if a person is condemned to die in prison they should be killed immediately rather than subjected to a lingering sentence and if we arent confident enough in the guilt of the accused to be willing execute them we should be equally unwilling to lock them up indefinitely
  inhumane a serial killer hanging you with your daughters intestines deserves humane treatment
  well sure they can commit suicide if they want to but the main problem is that when a nation commits a crime if it is considered a democratic country all the people in the nation have to share the burden of it even if they do not want to do it  sure you can argue about the timescale being worse but it will keep the people from the possibility of killing innocents and making in a sense all of the nation responsible for murder which could be punished with the same thing they committed it is a paradoxal thing but the best way to punish the worst of the worst criminals is by still locking them up
  we lose part of our humanity when we start thinking that a man does not deserve humane treatment or having their rights represented  it dehumanizes us
  the main problem is that when a nation commits a crime if it is considered a democratic country all the people in the nation have to share the burden of it  sure but if an innocent person is punished the fact that they were wrongfully put in prison rather than wrongfully executed in no way relieves the nation of that guilt    if an inmate is found to be innocent after 20 years in prison you can hardly say that the nation hasnt harmed him unjustly releasing the prisoner doesnt undo the punishment any more than an execution could be undone and if you believe that the nation bears a collective guilt in punishing an innocent man then they are still guilty in the case of a wrongfully jailed person    youre basically arguing against all forms of punitive justice which isnt necessarily an unreasonable position to take but it doesnt apply especially to capital punishment
  wasting money and time on the wishes of rapists and subhuman psychopaths  human rights   ok anon its much more humane to let them rape other prisoners and sell drugs inside prison walls while slow making them psychotic or traumatizing some poor saps with the mystery killshot firing squad than it is to let a sociopath put one behind the ear    rapists and gang members deserve appeals  no
  the best and least painful remains the good old french mandolin
  it is always bad to punish an innocent but the thing with death penalty as opposed to life in prison is that at least life in prison it is not straight up absolute you might spend 35 years in prison but we can still admit to your face that we were wrong with death penalty that is impossible      if they do something like what you define in prison keep them away from the other prisoners sure you can say humane rights might be naive or being altuiristic for the scumbags nobody wants to get killed raped or tortured by somebody and neither do i but i do not want to be part of a collective decision by the nation to commit a killing if they are not directly threatening anyone in the nation  and wasting money sure you can argue about that but what is the price of a human life
  you secretly tranquilize the guy when he lets his guard down and then you hang him

  clan wars in china is a pretty fun topic theyre basically private wars by feuding peasant clans over assorted reasons such squabble over farmland territory insults to family honor or arguing over mine rights as they werent rebellions they flew under the radar of imperial authorities unless the conflict snowballed into a provincial level shitfight    there are two well known clan wars in china the yiwu county miners who defended their mines from competing clan villages with a ferocity that qi jiguang offered to make them all professional soldiers with lucrative military ranks for his pirate war promising to protect their mine    the other one was the most infamous the puntihakka feud which started as a squabble over ancestral lands eventually the feud got absorbed into the taiping rebellion but the feud alone left 1 million dead    tldr chinese versions of hatfields  mccoys were full blown wars in their own right

texas and oklahoma nearly had an armed conflict regarding a couple bridges on the red river

  your picture is not from that war since those rifles are from atleast 194243    but another unknown war or rather battle from the same area in the first world war that is very obscure is the battle of jarrab        the british backed the fledgeling saudi arabia at the time called emirate of nejd and hasa or emirate of riyadh))) against the ottoman client state the emirate of jabalshammar the british advisor to the emir died in this battle so continued close relations kinda stopped after this some speculate that the arab revolt might had happened with the saudis if he hadnt died instead of switching to supporting hejaz    after this battle this area was quiet with riyadh and jabal shammer basically just acting as deterents against the opposite ottoman/british side some small skirmishes stuff took place but not much more the hejaz and the riyadh did not trust eachother and tried to stay away from eachother they even had some battles against eachother in 1918 despite being on the same side    not so much info online but some books have a few more details
can we all admit that we are secretly fascinated by hitler and his ideas do you think creating a super race to rule and unify the world would have worked out what are some neitzche passages that hitler liked
  i might agree with you if it was the past but honestly just am just 100 bored of hitler in every aspect    same with ww2 however not all of ww2 im so tired of the eastern or western front and i just want threads about africa or the chinese front
  we all admit that we are secretly fascinated by hitler and his ideas  but i never was
  he was a capicuck
  wtf capitalism makes a good society wtf
so how do you get nearly 1000 people in a fucking cult to go on an island with you and convince most of them to drink fucking koolaid im not buying that dangerously charming shit
  it wasnt an island it was a forest in guyana
    excellent source part 3 has recording s of the actual kool aid event it will answer your
  he wasnt treated as a lunatic by local officials at the time its important to remember that politicians like dianne feinstein and harvey milk gave this lunatic a gloss of legitimacy in the san francisco area
  thats because his cult was structured like a help group they built homes for the homeless and tried to help the poor they didnt parade the kooky shit around in public
    wasnt treated as a lunatic / 1000 niggers in a cult
  politicians like dianne feinstein and harvey milk gave this lunatic a gloss of legitimacy in the san francisco area  he was popular among blacks for his progressive social views
  and the island/forest in guyana
jim jones was a highly manipulative highly intelligent amoral glib charismatic sociopath with friends in high places and years of experience selling monkeys doortodoor
    start as a group that genuinely helps people with their problems  get addicts off drugs send poor kids to university  preach racial equality and left wing politics at a time when this is both controversial and trendy  build up a group of people who owe their success and in many cases very lives to you  start laying the groundwork that the government hates you and is coming for you all the while  eventually defectors tell newspapers about your private violent behaviour and financial fraud  flee to guyana where youve been building a small community for years  community is far too small for the number of people who have suddenly arrived  everyone is in each others way and there isnt much to eat or do  jones gets increasingly paranoid and drugged up  congressman arrives to look around  finds nothing particullary wrong thanks to rehearsed statements and quick you dying and repainting  defector is seen passing him a note asking for help leaving  control freak jones has them killed   arranges for everyone to kill themselves as left wing martyrs
    it was meant to be a self sustained village where theyd all go and live far away from the oppressive us government it was nowhere near finished when the mass exodus arrived
    you dying    should be tidying up    also forgot to mention they did drills and rehearsals for mass suicide multiple times going back years before jonestown jones also faked assassination attempts and even a government attack on jonestown to whip people into hysterics
blacks arent intelligent
the cia helps you do it
      okay this clears a lot
    last podcast on the left did a good multipart series going into quite some detail about jim jones and jonestown if you want to get more into it
he preached marxist revolution in private and had his followers talk about murdering their estranged families and also did suicide drills all the time
  because jim jones actually fucking helped people
  dig deeper into the story he didnt convince a lot of them so a lot of higherlevel goons decided to go around killing many
is it true that all civilizations in the old world were founded by whites ultimately

  this all other posts in this thread are brainlet tier
     anonymous 12/02/18sun191710 no5751344    this all other posts in this thread are brainlet tier  if you mean caucasoid and the old world yeah if you mean globally no mongoloids in the americas did their thing pretty well too nords literally had zero civilization until the romans and later germanics gifted it to them     theyre called western semites as opposed to levantines you can just say that

have you forgotten
   aleksandr solzhenitsyns account of his eightyear ordeal in the gulag should be read by all modern marxists says the provocative thinker jordan peterson    but modern marxists already did they even wrote a comprehensive critique of the book back in the 70s     the gulag archipelago testifies to a threefold tragedy first the tragedy of the stalinist purges that struck at millions of soviet citizens among them the majority of the old cadres of the bolshevik party who were innocent of the crimes they were charged with second the tragedy of a presentday generation of rebel intellectuals in the soviet union whose experience of stalinism has led them to reject leninism and marxism and who are thus incapable of understanding the causes of stalinist repression the present reality of the soviet union or the solutions required by the crisis of soviet society third the personal tragedy of a writer of exceptional talent who because of his inability to understand the origins and character of the evil he is confronted with has come to reactionary conclusions that to some extent even adopt the theories with which stalin and his executioners justified their crimes in the past  the same theories that are used to justify the repression that is once again striking political oppositionists in the ussr    
  its the antisemitic quote guy based peterson /ourguy/
  marxist apologetics  disgusting
  you know that quote is backed by historians right
  fucking hell im no marxist but peterson is a house of cards every single time someone with knowledge on one of the topics he espouses speaks up you find out he either misrepresents them or is plain wrong
  fucking hell im no marxist    he said reading text from marxistsorg and agreeing with it
  fuck off pinko you outed yoursekf
  you would have to be a marxist to think that that is a good critique
  if i preface my horrible left wing damage control point by saying im not a marxist then everyone will believe me    you faggots are worse than stormfags
  have you read it or are you just saying that because it came from a marxist source not him btw
  are you a jew yourself or a leftist moron
  t (((cuckold)))
  why dont you actually read the gulag archipelago instead of desperately searching for reasons not to though
so is marxism bad or not wtf
  the green text was enough to dismiss it
  it has never worked always resulted is misery and murder and only social rejected weirdos try to defend and play damage control for it mostly by lying and literally behaving like holocaust deniers
reminder that the left wing meme that solzhenitsyn made it all up and his wife exposed him was a soviet lie that was exposed by vasili mitrokhin a kgb archivist who defected to the west with a whole treasure trove of files
  im a centrist and i just wanted to say you need to fuck off if you unironically post from an iphone
  that its actually made by solženitsyn i agreed with these historians until i found out it isnt the picture of the quote was circulating freely on post 2014 imageboards and nobody called it out    your gay or gay kek
  retard just because it was said before 2014 doesnt make it invalid
  but was it said before 2017
        centrist deviates from narrative  gets accused of being a marxist
  quote its the antisemitic quote guy based peterson /ourguy/ unquote  dan carlin
  im a centrist but stormfrontcom has proven the holocaust never happened  this is what youre doing
   aleksandr solzhenitsyns account of his eightyear ordeal in the gulag should be read by all modern marxists says the provocative thinker jordan peterson    all marxists are stalinists
  using sources to base your argument is bad
  stalinism is just applied marxism
ive read the gulag archipelago 5 times and probably think about some aspect of it every day
  stormfrontcom  its org mate
  maybe you should read game of thrones instead bro
  the part where he talks about how close he was to becoming a nkvd agent talks about the number of russians who fought for the reich because they were so dissatisfied with the ussr and just the cavaliers boring beurcratic manner people were sent away where they would just go up to people out of the blue in day light and politely ask them to get into the black marias really stood out to me im not done with it though
    all great parts and they really build on each other throughout the books
    literally a fiction book
  stalin dindu nuffin
  criticize stalin all you want but dont think the gulag archipelago is at all evidence of his crimes that would make you look like a brainlet since solzhenitsyn himself admits the gulag archipelago is fiction
    no one cares what memes you spout for attention anon please leave now
  not an argument
  has led them to reject leninism   muh lenin gud boi dindu nuffin  i swear on my mum i hate trots and leninists more than stalinists
  you never presented one in the first place
  i dont think that is evidence of all his crimes i think it is a single piece of evidence that helps demonstrate why the soviet system is absolute garbage
  i presented the argument that the gulag archipelago is a work of fiction and thus the points it makes arent profound enough to warrant thinking about them every day
  its not a piece of evidence for anything you may as well cite game of thrones or the lord of the rings for criticisms of feudalism
  i swear on my mum i hate trots and leninists more than stalinists  goddamn this at least stalinists dont try and pretend like communism isnt an inherently murderous system
  first hand accounts are in fact historical evidence you absolute fucking brainlet
  not when the author of these accounts admits that they are fabricated
  show me where solzhenitsyn admits they were fabricated
  its not a work of fiction youre just some silly shitposter who larps as a commie spouting bullshit and you know it you wont provide any actual proof for your claimsince there is none and will just impotently shitposting for the rest of the thread
  
    literally open the book and read the authors introduction you boxheads
  /his/  reading a book  the vast majority of /his/ reads wikipedia articles watches youtube videos or listens to podcasts
  authors notein this book there are no fictitious persons nor fictitious events people and places are named with their own names if they are identified by initials instead of names it is for personal considerations if they are not named at all it is only because human memory has failed to preserve their names but it all took place just as it is here described    it explicitly says the opposite im waiting anon where does he say he fabricated it      you apparently dont read either faggot
    awesome now fuck off back to your containment board
  when theres revolution there are deaths
original archipelago fag here i know better than to argue with trolls  
  nah i prefer infographs instead
  murder is a feature not a bug
  how do you feel now that your only argument has been debunked
  more like consequence and a necessity of any revolution
  you just took what i said and replaced it with more ideologically appealing vocabulary
    dont you get it the introduction is part of the fiction so when he says its nonfiction that part is also fiction its like how in the hobbit bilbo is writing a real book in his universe
    i honestly pity you for being unable to enjoy the book
hurr gulags bad
  yeah because you deviate to the left faggot
  i just realised one thing peterson is an excellent mediocre thinker peterson is kind of ok at best if you consider mediocre shallow thinkers peterson just rocks it coincides with the idea of vox day that petersons rules are about being mediocre   i am libertarian btw
and yet the us has more people incarcerated than the fucking soviet union did and they do forced labor too this is not whataboutism i agree that the soviets were bad but they shouldnt have competition from the contemporary united states
  cringe
  yeah i just elaborated on it to give a better understanding
  based
whats the big deal dude was a proud monarchist who wanted to bring back the czar of course he was gulagd
commies have the strange ability of making me so angry it feels like im talking to patrick star like the meme
  marxists  lol theyre not marxists theyre socdoms and leftcoms the real marxist response to solzhenitsyn is to point out his book is about as factual as harry potter and ask why these gulags were supposedly these horrible bloodworks where thousands were killed everyday for stalins amusement but for reason they decided to cure his cancer    solzhenitsyn is a fucking liar and an antisemite as well
they always ignore the anti semitism and fascist sympathizing
  
  lefties and jews are like the boy who cried wolf about fascists and anti semitists people stop giving a fuck when they cry about it for the billionth time someone disagrees with them
  they cry about it for the billionth time someone disagrees with them  if they hate jews and sympathize with fascists then yeah people are gonna disagree with them and called them that
  you can read sasha while being ignorant about his antisemitic tendencies tbeh even jews excuse this aspect of him
  excellent level of debate on this site
  the issue and my point is that we are at the point where standing up for freedom of speech not liking mass immigration or thinking the israelis should maybe chill with the levelling gaza or lebanon every now and then or being wary of the large number of jews in the american elite who repeatedly find themselves involved in the shady shit the us does will get you called a fascist or anti semitist
this is why i cannot take this charlatan seriously this is such bullshit people didnt follow him because of his political opinions so for him to make this turn into politics feels incredibly dishonest and manipulative i wouldnt be surprised if it turns out that hes on steve bannons payroll
  thinking the israelis should maybe chill with the levelling gaza or lebanon every now and then  liking mass immigration    those are pretty close to being exclusive if you are leftwing you stand against israeli racists bernie sanders being the only american example i can remember and if you are rightwing you are zionist shill like the current us president since trump is president its ok to hate on mass immigration but its not ok to hate on israel its simple
  im not equating one group with the other i am simply stating that elements of both groups apply terms like fascist and anti semitist rather liberally
  that we are at the point where standing up for freedom of speech  people who bring up freedom of speech all the time are usually hiding behind it because theyre too afraid or stupid to defend their original statements its as much as a dead horse as people calling others fascist or antisemetic  the same people tend to defend private establishments to the death until those establishments censor them on their own property  they also tend to stick their heads in the grounds whenever their statements do start attracting actual racist fascists etc and refuse to sit and think about why that may be the case  or thinking the israelis should maybe chill with the levelling gaza or lebanon every now and then  the only people who would call you antisemetic for criticizing israel are actual overly sensitive israelis   its a pretty popular sentiment to criticize israel and the only time normal people will question you is when you start attacking jewish people in general like your average /pol/yp might do
  i fucking despise that charlatan why is he still respected
  he is a virulent ukrainophobe
  get put in the gulag for planning seditious activities against the state during a time of war  reeeeeeee gulags bad   everyone believes everything he says as fact  why do people uncritically accept every word of a man who has such strong personal bias oh right because anticommunists dont care about facts they just care what makes the best propaganda
  charlatan  what exactly is solzhenitsyn dishonest about
  say something critical of leader in private letter  prison 20 years  edgy
  plan a right wing antigovernment organization during the same war where tens of thousands of your countrymen willingly fought for fascists against the state bent on the annihilation of the slavic race  get the same prison term you might get in america for dealing some coke  sounds fair to me
  if you want niggers to stop getting locked up tell them to stop doing bad things
  if you want reactionaries to stop getting locked up tell them to stop doing bad things  also reminder that about 95 of people in the gulag were there for nonpolitical offenses aka normal crime
  anti semitism  nothing wrong with that  fascist sympathizing  bullshit
  plan a right wing antigovernment organization during the same war where tens of thousands of your countrymen willingly fought for fascists against the state bent on the annihilation of the slavic race  youre talking about something that was fabricated in your mind not reality
  antisemite  stalin was
  solzhenitsyn is a fucking liar  what did he lie about
  so what you can be a centrist and acknowledge some points made by both sides
  the soviet state doesnt make any good points nor do brainlet marxist useful idiots
  thats not true at all eu is literally built on the soviet experiment and eu is the best thing we have today
  eu is the best thing we have today  lmao why is that
  there he goes
  you dont take him seriously bc youre some basic bitch democratic socialist goober who hates him because he is very critical of your childish worldview and you have no defense of it
  both sides    its so easy to keep sheep contained in false dichotomies
  wow great argument faggot im convinced
  okay solzhenitsyn did not plan a right wing antigovernment organization during the same war where tens of thousands of your countrymen willingly fought for fascists against the state bent on the annihilation of the slavic race   your turn
    he clearly wrote that the ukraine should be given independence
  how much money do you donate to juden peterson every month
    thats why he was thrown in prison anon why do you think you know better than the soviet justice system hes certainly proved his antisemitic and reactionary sympathies in his later career im not sure we should take solzhenitsyns word that he was innocent every con claims he was set up
  source
  just because an information platform is modern doesnt mean it is of lesser quality disparaging wikipedia makes you sound like an underpaid high school history teacher telling his minority filled class that they cant copy and paste an entire entry and pass it off as their own essay
  how would he plan a coup while on the front lines plus his letters simply said that stalin perversed the teachings of lenin doesnt sound like a coup planning to me as he did not provide a clear alternative
  ps according to the soviet commissar of justice nikolai krylenko soviet court is the most perfect weapon shame he got accused of being fascist alpinist and shot but how else to prove the point about weapon
  t kautskyite revisionist trash  the bolshevik revolution was based if lenin hadnt had two strokes and died before reforming the political system to fight the emerging bureaucracy and/or if the german revolution had succeeded then it would have worked
  hoax
  doctors plot for one
  dude just listen to the soviet court system they would never lie lol
marxismleninism is more humane than neoliberal capitalism and flawed democracy ask anyone with a brain living in a postcommie country   i dont mean to excuse their mistakes and crimes or flaws of the system i dont think we should repeat it but this is painfully obvious
i could respect solzhenitsyn for opposing stalinlike he did before getting arrested but since he became orthodog monarshit in gulag i have 0 respect for him  one day ill travel to vladivostok just to vandalize his monument fuck this prowstern cuckold
  gets destroyed by zyzek  proceed to posting antimarxist memery on twitter  lmao  this damage control
  sneeze  pulls shirt free from between his fat folds  nervously looks for a better position on the chair  compulsively fiddles with his nose  chlomunishlm ish ghodl
  you just described hell basically all of europe under red shit instead of just the eastern part imagine western europe as bleak and delapitated as eastern europe good god we were lucky
could you guys recommend me some good documentaries about the pacific theatre of ww2
  90 of wwii documentaries suck  read a book like max hastings nemesis
  ok cool  from what i can gather that is about the end near japan are there any good books about the island hopping phase or any earlier battles on the small pacific island nations  i heard that some australian and new zealand soldiers would sometimes train the local tribes in guerilla warfare and use them as fighters but te tribes would also keep their tradition of being headhunters so they would behead the japanese i thought that was pretty interesting do you know of any books about that
      while i cant recommend any documentaries you should give these books a try i listened to them all on audible    morning star midnight sun the early guadalcanalsolomons campaign of world war ii august  october 1942  by jeffrey r cox    the fleet at flood tide america at total war in the pacific 19441945  by james d hornfischer    carrier pilot  by norman hanson memoires of flying a british naval fighter pilot stationed on the hms illustrious    pacific crucible war at sea in the pacific 19411942  by ian w toll    the conquering tide volume ii of the pacific war trilogy  by ian w toll sequel to the prior book    i dont think the third part is out yet    all four are excellent books    also recommend    japanese destroyed captain  a memoire by tameichi hara    and    helmet for my pillow  by robert leckie set during the battle of guadalcanal
  thanks man i will definitely check them out
try with the old breed
were/are the marines the more elite force than the us army
  le epic oorah men
  define elite force
  elite at what    
that would be the all american airborne
marines 13 weeks of basic training  army10 weeks    marines rifle qualifictaion starting at 200 yards ending at 500 yards  army 5 meters to 300 meters    marine pft pullups chrunches 3mile run  army pft pushups situps 2mile run    the basic qualification for marines are more elite than the basic qualifications for army ive served in both branches so i can break it down further if you need to
  do the marines focus more on infiltration or is there no difference between the two
  i think infiltration is more of a marine recon sort of thing the main difference in tactics ive noticed between the two is that marines have a greater emphasis on small unit tactics meanwhile in the army they wouldnt trust an e3 to do jack shit
  is jarhead a good movie
  i liked it most marines i know hated it because it didnt glorify the marine corps
  is there any way in which army basic training is more strenuous or involved than marine basic training
  since i came from the marine corps first i didnt have to go through army basic but considering that the marines dont have to go through army basic if they switch to army but army has to go to marine boot camp if they switch to marines id say marine recruit training is likely more difficult
  why switch though
  they got their crayons surgically removed from their brain
  being a marine is a pain in the fucking ass everything is so much more chill in the army except these fuckers salute in their pt gear that shit is fuckin retarded

  why is t b h  desu  why is s o y g o y  basedgoy
  anyone who doesnt subscribe to my ideology is an ideologue  this guy needs some of that slovenian cocaine
  hiro dabbing on 4chan by doing autofilters of our meme phrases
  heres your you
so all those people calling me a basedboy beta cuck are actually basedboy beta cucks whoa
    why are you a newfaggot
  its the sites wordfilter the joke is the confusion it causes like it did with you
  literally what is wrong with him
  of our time    what are the limits of our time
  he throws a fit over other people throwing a fit its actually pretty funny
    sargon slaw sounds delicious
  all that matters is the individual
  whenever an ideologue makes a character judgment about someone they are debating with that character judgment is true about themselves  so basedgoy of applebees is a white nigger
do any of you actually have advanced degrees/jobs in the fields related to this board history archaeology humanities etcor are you all just uneducated shitposters if you are actually educated whats your major and/or job
  im a neet shitposter with no education beyond high school i read books that interest me thats about it
  i am giorgio tsoukalos
we dont do majors minors i studied history and have a ba in it  the avarage poster here never ever read a book about any of the subjects they talk about
  history major  found a book from 1915 in the liberry once
i have a ba in economics and a ba in history work as an assistant economist for a restaurant group as my first full time postgraduation job pays surprisingly really well
  ive read 30 books and various articles and webpages on one subject and only post when its relevant diving deep into one subject has made me realize how shallow my understanding of everything else is and to be honest im just as confused as i was when started i really dont know what caused the obsession its not related to my life at all
  care to tell us about the subject
  i studied maritime management and economics history is only a hobby but it doesnt mean i dont take it seriously if i had studied in humanities id die unemployed
  im educated but have no job
  join the club
      im job but have no educated
  larpers
  i majored in it college for 2 years but then switched over to cs     history is a meme degree and ba in history is pretty much useless
  if he answer your question it would be like revealing his identity in this board
  history is a meme degree and ba in history is pretty much useless    coming from a computer science major that means very little enjoy your oversaturated market and being inevitably replaced by a pajeet that will do your job for a fraction of the pay
  hehehe enjoy your oversaturated market myth retard unlike history majors only a matter of time till you get outsourced to pajeet no one does that because the quality is shit
  if you are actually educated whats your major and/or job  ba in /his/ but im an av tech at a nightclub because i dont want to waste money on a graduate degree just to not get hired in archiving like i wanted when i was working on the degree
  the avarage poster here never ever read a book  avarage  neither have you from the looks of things
  meanwhile you can look forward to getting a phd just to get a 40k a year job
  i have a degree in stem and work in stem  i come here for fun and also to learn something about history i look for book recomendations videos etc mostly
      off to injecting hrt into your bodies and making shitty desktop threads while you complain about being replaced by real women in the workforce lmao
  you can be mad at my spelling worthless neet anglosaxon but i am better than you in every possible way
  ba poli sci and economics checking in
  the amount of arrogance from that post reeks of frog annales school a shit and you should feel bad
  clearly not at spelling
  anyone who seriously studies history at an univesrity is either rich or stupid history is to me a hobby nothing more or less
  im not french you little inferiority complex ridden rosbif
  must have hit a nerve definitely french
  and im sure you are brimming full of original historical insights with your extensive hobbyist knowledge of the subject
  implying the average history major has any original historical insight
  i am writing a postgraduate in archaeology neolithic norway atm i lurk
  tfw required to write a thesis for my ba  tfw it could have been published in a journal according to my professors and advisor  tfw even a professor at another uni which helped me with it said it should be published  it wasnt that original more putting two and two together but it wasnt written down anywhere else because its such a niche subject
  the ones that seriously study it at a university sometimes do yes the mass of people in any major are mediocre history is no different thats why the most intelligent in any field cultivate their knowledge and skills in the pursuit of more advanced degrees in their fields of choice
you have to fall for the uni scam to be considered educated     reading primary sources and studying certain philosophical branches is enough whoever needs to go to uni and get told how to think and what to do must be braindead not to say npc
    although i have to admit out of my graduating class of 7 only 2 of us wrote anything resembling originality three of them wrote blatant sjw puff pieces one wrote about ibm and the holocaust one of them did weird shit regarding literature and kruschevs secret speech and the last wrote about jews in colonial mexico and had original thoughts about it
  only reason to go to uni is to get your shit published
  yeah thats about it although op made it sound that whoever doesnt go to uni is uneducated
  its safe to assume he meant formally educated but realistically the vast majority of people that post on this board are pop /his/ retards with no semblance of historiography or knowledge that primary sources even exist

  steppe trash  oh god its even worse than anyone could have imagined
  your dead mother will be rotting trash after im done with her i will fucking gut you personally
  your dead mother will be rotting trash after im done with her i will fucking gut you personally  man you guys really havent changed since you first invaded the continent have you
  patrician field my dude
  kek theres way more sjw types in history then in cs
  its just banter nigel dont take it to the heart
i allready got a ba in fine art why would i want another worthless degree even if i love the subject  but anon you can become a history teacher
  political science master race reporting in    historians might have the knowledge but they lack the context and the right perspective
  lack the context and the right perspective  thinks a arts degree is required for this
  but they lack the context  full context is only available in hindsight almost like its only found in history or something
  dunno why they call it liberal arts in the anglo world the rest of the world just calls it political science     its the science that gives you a meta worldview of how things have worked work and will potentially work in the future         studying history by itself doesnt give you anything other than an autistic understanding of a particular event if youre trying to give history context then you might as well enter polisci because thats what it does as a field
  meta worldview  given
    also what do you mean by full     a historian will certainly not know or grasp a socioeconomic aspect of what hes studying be it in the same time frame hes studying it nor in present time unless he is given a theoretical framework from polisci because again thats what it mostly does as a science
  polisci is a fucking joke  you make your own thesis then you use this pseudoquantitative methodologies in order make it seem credible even though its just a fucking selfconfirmation with no insights at all  like for example you want to prove that tribal mentalities in village x influences their electoral decisions in last year election no fucking shit kiddo everybody knows that    the majority is either that or neomarxist shit what a joke discipline
    yes only poli sci majors understand socioeconomics literally no one else you fucking loafer and cardigan wearing my daddy will sue you for scuffing my gucci belt future law school drop out
all these faggots actually made their hobby a profession   im willing to sacrifice being talked down to by retards on a chinese basket weaving board if it means i have a healthy income that allows me to pursue my hobbies without starving
i have the equivalent of a bachelors degree and im working on a masters degree i make a living tutoring high schoolers which is actually surprisingly well paid once you have a degree 20/30 eurobux/hour is nothing to scoff at in my countryj
  unless you live in eastern/south europe thats nothing   and even still you have to deal with ungrateful brats that only care about getting in each others pants on a daily basis
  youre better off writing a thesis as a polisci on literally any subject you want from humanities using your own perspective and defend it successfully without needing to use the perspectives of what some old faggot wrote some centuries before you    the majority is either that or neomarxist shit    nah its mostly neoliberal
  where does one intern with a useless major in humanities
  its not that we understand socioeconomics better we just understand the context behind them better and use our own to give it new context and meaning
  nothing  its average money even in the us i have no interest in wasting my life doing something i hate chasing an empty dream of 300k starting and i actually enjoy teaching
  we understand the context better without the full context  no the fuck you do not poli sci only focuses on the immediate context and very little beyond if any i took multiple poli sci courses at uni while pursuing my history degree and theyre a fucking joke like another anon said you only use data that fits your hypothesis and it doesnt matter what your answer is theres a reason poli sci isnt taken seriously by anyone that isnt in poli sci its sociology tier
  i took some courses     then you know about polisci as much as i know about my 1 year course of economics except i dont claim economics are a joke when in reality if you break things down economics dont deal or resolve shit either and are based on interpreting some data based on huge assumptions related to their theoretical model it might as well be sociology tier too according to you but its well established as a legitimate field     like another anon said you only use data that fits your hypothesis and it doesnt matter what your answer is    you can say that about literally any other subject in the humanities kek     i think youre just salty that historians are the people that do the actual hard work of researching the hard data while theres someone above you that makes it more popular and well known but giving it his own theoretical frame of understanding     political science is literally just philosophy of history with multiple other facts included stay mad historian pleb
  so you admit its a joke  using your own perspective and defend it successfully  you mean normative bullshit  assumptions assumptions assumptions  not your own perspective by the way  and its not only successful because of the low standards of polsci departments
  not only  only
  then you know about polisci as much as i know about my 1 year course of economics  i took 200 and 300 level courses so i think i know    it might as well be sociology tier too according to you but its well established as a legitimate field  so is outdoor recreation and half a dozen other basket weaving tier majors     you can say that about literally any other subject in the humanities kek   history journal articles and books get ripped to shreds over it so no you cant the era of postmodern history in publishing is pretty well over youve already admitted that you can make up your answer if you can defend it no matter how retarded your defense is you cant do that in history    political science is literally just philosophy of history  no it isnt thats called historiography
  political science will be considered a joke pretty much when any other nontechnical fields of higher learning will be considered a joke political science was the main occupation of the ancient greeks and its literally the foundation of western thought so quite frankly you gotta get used to it pal        you cant do that in history    its pretty much undisputed fact that hitler wanted only the greater good and well being of his fellow countrymen he was also a vegetarian and an animal lover be so kind as to enlighten us why hitler is considered evil today then and not a champion mister historian
  be so kind as to enlighten us why hitler is considered evil today then and not a champion mister historian  probably because its an undisputed fact his actions directly to the death of millions nice red herring btw
  its an undisputed fact his actions directly to the death of millions    why arent the allies considered evil as well then its also pretty well established they were the ones who started wwii with the treaty of versailles another historical document and undisputed fact    hurr durr muh objective historical facts    theres one thing about facts then theres interpreting facts and putting them in context which is much more important     you mentioned that being historiography but even that takes place within a well established environment which only political science studies historians are too autistic to reflect on the implications of their own field
  its pretty much a fact he did not care one bit about of his fellow countrymen  he believe in germanic supremacy and when the german volk failed to prove it he cursed them and sentenced them extinction it was his total war that was his whole point    he didnt love no germans he couldnt care less about his ppl he was chasing his retarded uneducated believes that no common sense could support and when faced by reality he wanted every german to sacrifice itself for it and burn germany down to not make the victors have anything    thats your greater good you stupid pol monkey fucking die
  its also pretty well established they were the ones who started wwii  yeah no unless you think the allies fired the first shot in poland they didnt    but even that takes place within a well established environment which only political science studies  thats fucking wrong too unless you think leopold von ranke was a political scientist or richard evans for that matter for what its worth they arent you are fucking retarded
  its pretty much undisputed fact that hitler wanted only the greater good and well being of his fellow countrymen he was also a vegetarian and an animal lover be so kind as to enlighten us why hitler is considered evil today then and not a champion mister historian  thats not even a serious question for academic tier history evil is not a useful concept
  you can say that about literally any other subject in the humanities kek   kek so much projections  political science is literally just philosophy of  you fucking wish  how many of you actually know political philosophy again some schmuck didnt even read john rawls because hes too full of himself and he only cited some liberal ir textbooks before pulling off numbers out of some dumb survey  cant do abstract philosophical shit  cant do empirical shit properly either  its sociology tier anon except the govt pays you to shill for them so they gotta make the department looks a bit credible than sociology amirite      political science was the main occupation of the ancient greeks and its literally the foundation of western thought so quite frankly you gotta get used to it pal  so youre larping as thucydides now wow very inspiring
      missing the point so hard    well would you look at that one historical perspective being confronted by 3 other perspectives that do not resemble each other at all how come there is no singular agreement between the perspectives of the same historical fact     if it is objective fact why cant everyone agree on a singular interpretation why is one being taunted while the other is not why is one good and the others are not how does that fact related to the present and what implications does this have to our present every day understanding of things    yeah im pretty much done historians are a bunch of autists who rely on other people to interpret their data and give it actual meaning because they cant do it by their own    welcome to political science i hope you enjoy your stay
  you have no education and all you do is question facts by saying well its not a fact because i say so    lets do an ancient fact test  i throw you into a cauldron of boiling water  if you survive you are right and facts just our facts
    good and evil arent objective concepts at all professional historians arent in the business of listing who the goodies and baddies of history are ww2 is not a marvel film
  taking john rawls seriously     taking utilitarians or antiutilitarians seriously    taking anglo political science seriously     kek
  one historical perspective being confronted by 3 other perspectives  actually two separate perspectives were not just confronted but completely countered individually by perspectives rooted in reality you drawing a dividing line between them in an intellectually dishonest way is doing more to prove us correct
 this is an example of the material i will use
  soil archaeology  your shit
  it all comes down to methodology you need different sorces that tel the same story my thesis focuses on the adaption of archiculture and sorces sutch as pollen analysis carbon dates are importatnt but typology is also needed this is archeology and a base in material culture is needed
  how much does that sickle tell you about class relations
  class relations  what are you postmodern
  of course not try eo wright for postmodernism
    but tu answer your querstion we cant know    we should not equate material culture with technology we can not dig up a social system or ideology binford 1962 p 218
i got an associates of applied science in administration of justice just so i could make sergeant quicker
  do any of you actually have advanced degrees/jobs in the fields related to this board history archaeology humanities etc  why would you waste your money in a carreer dead end
  if its what interests you and your planned career either coincides with it requires literally any degree or doesnt require one at all why should it matter life is about more than money this is why im convinced stemfags have autism if it isnt quantifiable it isnt good
  good boy never suggest otherwise in your papers leave the relations of social reproduction to historians
  degree business studies  job key accounts manager for a pharmaceutical company    absolutely nothing to do with this board i spent my entire degree wishing i was doing economics or history and politics i wouldnt have got my job if i did the latter but i probably would with the former and i would have enjoyed the study more
  job prospects are hardly the best for history and humanities majors im self taught and have had a historical and political interest since i learned to read while i would want to work with it fulltime the question is how the fuck do you even do it politician yeah id really like lying for a living not to mention the internal intrigues by people wanting to further their careers rather than society in general youd also be a public figure and im too much of an introvert to deal with that teacher pay is utter garbage barely livable and schools are chaos nowadays author cant write more than shortstories so cs it is because i need to make a living
  my university sponsored everything free for me studies housing etc even got a scholarship just because they thought i identified as the same ethnicity as they were lol
  
  not all of us are sharters 
  snap your death kiddo the ct will be recording your growing cancer
  but life is sure hella lot more enjoybale when you can buy whatever you want and take vacations to maldives and french polynesia than sitting in crappy apartments eating ramen noodles and writing your doctoral dissertation about transsexual voices in 10th trika shaivism doesnt it
  prole here    wish i could afford ramen
  the irony is that you dont need money to vacation in extravagant places penniless hippies do it all the time even the ones without sellout parents
  no anon not really
  now you can sit in a mid tier apartment eat bertolli noodles and write code while taking two weeks a year to be sad about your similarly miserable life abroad instead because life isnt about possessions 
phd in critical theory  300k starting salary  any job i want    try not to be too jealous
i study math but i love history
  im an attorney but ill freely admit i post about far more than what i actually know professionally ie american law and history subjects relating to american law
  trading your time for money isnt a wise choice
  alleged phd  doesnt know the difference between jealousy and envy  i know its bait and im giving you a free you but please try harder next time
i wash dishes in hotel
i worked in a restored and fully functional 18th century mill before i had to take indefinite sick leave pay was shit but i enjoyed it
  its better to be miserable at bora bora than say carbondale or other similar college town though   being welloff or rich and miserable is better being poor and miserable    trading for what cutthroat academic publishing underpaid work with zero stability and barely enough pay for a decent life academic politics where you have to lick everyone ass and watch your back for fear of being stabbed constant mobility all just to have the title phd and pretend to contribute to human knowledge
  be miserable in a foreign place where you know no one and its hot and sticky  or  be miserable and surrounded by friends  truth be told its not even misery and theres a reason that the suicide rate in the west is higher among the more affluent
  sorry meant to write critical race theory
  move to america
doing a masters of information in a program that lets me be an accredited librarian in north america/some other countries  never read a book in my life though
  i did chinese studies but didnt learn much other than that china is a westernising dying culture
i deferred but will probably drop out of a bsc to work in museums off the back of some palaeo volunteering i like field work but the thought of doing the anatomical research almost required to make it in palaeontology doesnt thrill me so im seriously considering taking up archaeology with an apprenticeship early 2020
          do any of you actually have advanced degrees/jobs in the fields related to this board history archaeology humanities etcor are you all just uneducated shitposters if you are actually educated whats your major and/or job    i am king of kings son of chaos like alexander the great or jesus or khufu    
i have ba in history and i make beer now
  why do people say this as if its a bad thing if someone doesnt enjoy researching for their phd why did you even become a history major in the first place  40k/yr job  im kinda fine with that 2bh i mean id prefer to make more but my lifestyle isnt remotely expensive in the first place
  i studied archaeology and classics and im an archaeologist
  youll be happier in the long run doing something you love than work in a high paying miserable job    of course one must be pragmatic but ive encountred and worked with too many people doing it for the pay and winding up compensating by spending their paycheck on lavish things
  true   i majored history for three semesters and also quit for cs
  i have a masters degree in law
neet shitposter undergrad history degree from boston university no jobs in the field so i didnt bother with grad school although i probably had the grades and interest
  degree in psychology myself although with enough interest effort and reading id argue anyone can reach a high enough level to discuss history and philosophy to a competent extent
  i love history but i also love having a job i therefore study business administration and read history on the side including books articles documentaries i also did ib history which is a pretty good history class for high school imo
      im the guy who wrote that i was just being realistic i maintained friendships with 2 people i started undergrad both got their masters in history and then went back for another masters within a decade because you cant get married and start a family on 40k a year unless you live in bumblefuck nowhere    i earn 100k a year and while i dont love tech i enjoy solving tech related problems enough that im happy and find my job fulfilling i still enjoy history and research things i find interesting i dont live a lavish lifestyle but having money does make your life a lot easier
  nice meme degree
  i therefore study business administration  oh no
  do you enjoy being an attorney i know so many people who would have made the perfect lawyers  driven kind smart passionate about helping people  but all of them quit the job and are doing something else now
  where are you based and how are you finding it
  scotland its alright pay isnt great but im in a trainee position with a company not known for generous pay    theres enough jobs around because of hs2 that i can leave pretty easily when my contracts up
  do you know why they quit if they were passionate
  do you live on neetbux
  i decided to get a major that actually pays even if its not my favorite i got a minor in history at least it turns out you can study history without a school quite easily i always felt like college level history courses were a little disappointing like you could read more from reading a book or two
  im kinda fine with that 2bh  good luck having a family or maintaining a healthy lifestyle after your youth
i have trade certs and treat history as my passionate hobby rather than an actual career
studying history as a major   not going for a major that can actually make you money and getting a masters on history after you establish a stable source of income
  i enjoy every aspect of it except dealing with clients unfortunately that is frequently necessary so a 5050 sort of thing
  /thread
americans  you were not asked please leave this board thanks
  does geology count thats earth history
  thanks thinking about doing geophysics for flexibility but if i do that will i be stuck just doing geophys

thinking about studying philosophy in university   is it worth it or will it be impossible to get a job
  the job markets basically nonexistent unless youre willing to teach highschool history and philology

  get back to work susan you still have to publish another three papers this year to keep your job those thousand first year scripts wont make themselves
  well only speaking for myself i did about 6 months interning with a defense attorney back in school and it was awful highlights of that were    being woken up at 3 in the morning to go visit a jail because of a parole violation and boss attorney was called and he wants you to assist  a case in which the da lost the dna lab test and wanted another sample  having to listen through a clients calls when in prison since the police tap those it was about 18 hours of shit including multiple times when client called his girlfriend to phone sex with her  same client also having another wiretap before he went to prison in which he realized he was being tapped but still decided to agree to sell drugs  speaking to a mad bomber who decided that the best way to protest the police pulling over his son was to blow up a library and try to blow up a train station  watch a da insist with a perfectly straight face that even though the defendant was only convicted of selling a relatively small amount of drugs he still thinks the defendant really did sell a much larger amount and the judge should sentence based on that  two wannabe clients openly wondering how much blue magic they need to sell to raise the attorney fees in the office    civil is a hundred times better the worst you get is that civil case clients are much less desperate and therefore far more inclined to bring up something they saw on tv or what their cousin/friend/whatever told them about how the legal system works and a surprising number of them wont believe you when you tell them that no they cannot do whatever stupid idea they have    1/2
  based annaleshating anglo im going to throw spatial history under the bus too
    also at least where i did my internship chicago because the prisons were so overcrowded they couldnt keep everyone locked up even when convicted which in turn means that they only tended to prosecute the real slam dunk cases and let the ones that were less obviously guilty go that in turn means as a defender youre essentially either trying to advise a plea bargain assuming your client is smart enough to plea which is a crapshoot or looking for some evidence of police misconduct you can use to get things dropped dont get me wrong i abhor police misconduct and its frighteningly common the very last case i worked on there involved literally lying to a judge to get a warrant which found the evidence but the system we have essentially treats that as a get out of jail free card for the defendant and the policemen in question are very rarely actually punished    civil also tends to be a bit more legal theory heavy and call me an autist but i actually enjoy legal theory and parsing out fact patterns into appropriate causes of action or dealing with issues like choice of law or venue criminal law when its not about police misconduct is almost always about fact patterns and application everyone knows what the local statutes requirement for things like burglary or arson or drug dealing are and its very rare that you actually make theory heavy arguments instead of fact heavy arguments
  ba in philosophy  political science currently 1 year into a jurisdoctorate
  makes two of us    i undersign emails with llm at the end i think i will eventually write my doctoral thesis just to put driur there
  holy shit i wish id done this this guys cracked the code undergrad history isnt pointless but its a far cry from the ma and there are more useful bas you can use to get into an ma program with id even be in a better position if id stuck with philosophy just because now i could go for either phd
  sounds like working at the er

  are you a neet
im an anthropology student i rarely post tho
  if youre in the us unless you want to work outside of your field it isnt really worth it unless youre going for a teaching license or a masters a ba in history is schrodingers degree you are equally overqualified and underqualified for a job in your field    t ba in history
  kek im a europoor though    but its probably the same
working on my masters in economics i mostly lurk around though i sometimes post on threads pertaining to economics i really wished /biz/ actually talked more about economic theory and not just about damn crypto
  i studied archaeology and classics  i have majors in the same but from years ago genetics have radically changed the field of archaeology so i barely have a grasp of it at this point    i focused much more on classics anyways  did a ton of graduatelevel independent studies in historical and comparative linguistics studied sanskrit and mandarin in addition to anc greeks and latin    then i shat it all away and went to law school and became an npc
  ba in economics but im just a wageslave cuck in food industry because i did no networking in college have no good references and since my only job history is food service i will never be able to compete with everyone else seeking jobs with better resumes contacts and degrees im effectively at a dead end and wasted my life so im just wasting time shitposting here about my only intellectual hobby byzantine history until i die of alcohol poisoning
  im sorry anon

how many kings tried to take advantage of the pope and got away with it too
  if it werent for those meddling kids
spanish kings were the heads of the church in their colonies they got the privilige for beating the muslims out of europe
many i was really surprised by just how weak popes have been throughout history
  you cant be serious i thought le high spiritual authority/gods representative on earth couldnt be messed with
  what gods representative on earth meant varied throughout time at times it just meant the voice of faith that advised other leaders but didnt have too much power on his own and at others it meant i should literally rule europe and have everyone listen to my every command
  how many kings tried to take advantage of the pope and got away with it too
  lmao  i feel like im the only one who got your reference perfect come back

  the qin were pretty autistic all around
  julian
  essentially every guy that mastered something in any particular era aspies and hopeless auties have ruled the world since the beginning
  the qins autism was the only thing that could have unified china
  you cant kill an idea
not even as a joke carolus rex was volcel was extremely fascinated and intuitively adept at military strategy picked up mathematics and physics like it was nothing when he was on exile vacation and was a hardcore moral absolutist
  checked qin confirmed for autistic

hitler did far more damage mussolini only gave europe a scratch hitler fucked knocked us out for a good 50 years
nicholas ii
    this nicholas ii and hitler left their countries and places well beyond their countries far worse off than they had found them direct from their own actions mussolini fucked up badly for sure but he didnt leave italy crippled and traumatized like the other two did
  napoleon iii
  soviet union was worse than russian empire  hot take unfortunately unsubstantiated
commodus
hitler the retard who tried to annex russia
constantine for forever dooming western civilization
  pretty sure russia could have been developed without a civil war and multiple subsequent bloodbaths lad nicholas ii had loads of opportunities and squandered it all in any event when he died the country was in the midst of a civil war and had ceded loads of land to the germans pretty sure that is far worse off than how he found it the outcome of things was far from certain at that point anyways
  0 charles de gaulle  1 james buchanan  2 andrew johnson  3 ronald reagan  4 donald trump
  there was a second napoleon
  he didnt tho
  ah at the time of his death i see makes sense
  that would be enrico dandolo
  hot take  t chaponigger
  napoleons son however the empire was dissolved and napoleon ii died in his teens without issue     napoleon iii is the grand nephew of napoleon i and his son died fighting the zulu under the british suspiciously so the current pretenders to the house of boneparte arent decedents of either napoleon i or iii

higher intellectual capacity  lower social ability    true or false
  false if youre smart youll be better at socialising but id hazard a guess youd probably want to slightly less because youd find it difficult to relate to people that dont share your broad imagination itd be difficult to want to talk about a number of topics a lot and having no one to talk about them with
social ability  intelligence  motivation  intelligence  motivation
  emotional intelligence and intellectual capacity are positively correlated
  higher intellectual capacity  higher social ability    lower intellectual capacity  lower social ability    social ability  ability to maintain a healthy society
  pure cope
  personality and iq have little correlation newton had no friends but no one would call him stupid
ubermenschen are good at boath pleb
  this correlation disappears after a certain point and if you just mean wont crime thats not particularly interesting to anyone who isnt a subhuman
  if were talking about individuals there is no correlation individuals who were highly gifted were often and mainly been socially isolated or awkward at the very least    if its society then highly intellectual societies are ones that are social in nature see almost all great civilizations even europe in certain cases after they were taught civilization    if the collective intellectual powers are low you get societies that dont hold together africa/south americas are prime example
  if height correlates with iq i must be twelve feet tall
  false     but both require practice to develop and its generally hard to practice both at once
  height correlates with iq  then why do ashkenazi jews who are short on average have the highest iq scores is this just a case of malnourished people tending to have their growth stunted both intellectually and physically
  135 iq here can confirm turns out i was asocial because of porn two month of nofap and now i play normies like a fiddle
  same 135iq but not antisocial because of porn antisocial because i have more time to myself if im alone
  if youre smart youll be better at socialising  a massive assumption to make ignorance is bliss is a platitude for a reason one can argue that the ability to detect bullshit when you hear it makes it harder to connect with people who are dumber then you or espouse ideas that are dumb
  now i play normies like a fiddle  stuff that didnt happen n1721
  then you  than
high iq does not imply that youre good at any single skill at all  matter of fact you could be a 130 retard who cannot socialize create anything do math philosophize or pretty much any skill you might related to being intelligent     also the true redpill is realizing talent isnt a real thing and if it is its worthless without practice to let it out  autists aside ofc    t 135 retard here but i can play a few instruments and speak a few languages
  similar range iq antisocial because of being an introvert and high functioning autism
  source your ass
  you are not alone also 135ish i can tell you how to fix your car and im pretty good in a fight other than that i am a complete retard i do not like social interaction but i know how to do it
  false
every millenial has an iq of 135
  yes
  135 is 1 in 100 people finding 50 of them on /his/ really isnt strange
thread is about intellectual capacity  ends up about iq
  the opposite is true retard lmao higher intellect means you should have higher social ability if you think you have a higher intellectual capacity but are socially retarded youre not as smart as you think
me  white  143 iq  73 eq  her  asian  136 iq  129 eq    higher intellectual capacityhigher social ability    its about supply and demand as in regards to social ability its an economical question not the mismatch between propagator and receiver to short urself to bring up an underling is a compromise you make based on the spatiotemporal returns you need compared to taking a longer position and letting the lower die off so what is objectively more condusive overall hard answer but always the right one the long position higher intellectual capacityhigher social ability it all comes down to the timelyness of money when do you value the dollar today or tomorrow     long positions  greeks  romans    short positions  ottomans  neofiatsocialism    this is all ive been advised to discern and even it more then is ever wanted

its the swedes again euiv makes ottomans retard stronk i jihadd entire europe with them before 1700 just because i could when people see strong horse they select that horse

  historically accurate  eu4  tons of oversimplified historical elements mechanichs
how do koreans feel about the lands that used to be part of goguryeo the first king of joseon was a general tasked to conquer the liaodong peninsula before he turned his back and made a coup detat was this a missed opportunity considering there is a sizable korean minority in china is there any form of korean irredentism
there used to be a meme i remember about a korean empire that expanded until poland
  its not a meme you faggot its the actual historical facts that those intellectuals in the west want to suppress to preserve their legacy the autism super weapon of the we wuz nation propelled humanity into the dark ages and they think that theyre pyramids can you believe such a thing
  how were they able to fend off sui and tang    tang had to ally with another state to finally get rid of them
  meme  the hwan empire is legitimate and welldocumented historical fact  dont believe the finnomongol lies
  i guess it has something to do with the north being full of mountains and thus easy to defend

  how do koreans feel about the lands that used to be part of goguryeo   even while part of goguryeo jilin province and even modern day northern korea north of the taedong river were populated by tungusic heishui mohe and sumo mohe who became the jurchens and manchus balhae was founded by a mohe general of goguryeo and jurchen clans claimed descent from families of balhae after the collapse of goguryeo and balhae jilin and the korean peninsula north of the taedong river were filled with jurchens not koreans the koreans in goryeo and joseon had to fight against the jurchen and force assimilate them until joseon reached the tumen river balhae people existed as a distinct ethnic category in the liao jin and yuan dynasties until they assimilated into other groups and were no longer found in the ming dynasty and the balhae people im talking about are the nonmohe balhae the mohe ones became jurchen if they spoke koreanic i dont care but they were listed as a separate ethnicity from goryeo people in the yuan  the first king of joseon was a general tasked to conquer the liaodong peninsula before he turned his back and made a coup detat was this a missed opportunity   thats because chinese red turban rebels from liaodong kept attacking korea and the koreans wanted to stop it liaodong was majority chinese at that time already  considering there is a sizable korean minority in china is there any form of korean irredentism  koreans in china now are descendants of 19th century famine refugees who fled the korean peninsula in joseon to the qing jilin province they are not descendants of the people who lived in jilin during goguryeo and balhae they are simply north korean migrants jilin is manchu land
  goguryeo had liaodong the entire north korea buyei and filled it with fortresses in the sui and tang the chinese cao wei and xianbei murong former yan defeated goguryeo and destroyed the capital hwando in 244 and 341 cao wei and former yan were also far smaller than the sui dynasty and tang dynasty in size and population goguryeo did not control liaodong or the western strip of north korea or buyeo during cao wei and former yan liaodong and the western strip of north korea were under cao wei rule and liaodong was under former yan rule buyeo was its own kingdom
  goguryeo only took over all of north korea in 313 so cao wei had a better geographic position in 244
  complaining about past history is a national pastime for us because it feeds into our inferiority complex korea is a small country and has always been a vassal of china and other big countries in history were okay with some overlords like the ming dynasty which is we appreciate even today for helping against japanese invasions and the high culture but in general fact of smallness is still something we dont like us taking control of manchurias large amount of land and strategic resources is like a grand dream it would at least triple the population and territory and make us a lot stronger   since the korean peninsula is quite small the conditions that were needed to seriously expand north is very narrow it would need stable domestic situation weak japan and weak china before even trying to conquer the manchurians i think the last opportunity a korean state had to do this was during the collapse of the ming there were earlier attempts by the joseon dynasty to expand influence into manchuria by vassalizing manchurian tribes but the ming stopped that from happening because it also really wanted control the northern people first hideyoshis invasions need to be repelled immediately before they start devastating the land second nurhaci needs to be defeated third the ming dynasty needs to collapse like it did in real life and prolong the fight between ming remnants li zicheng zhang xianzhong etc if all these things were done properly joseon still needs to placate the whatever unified chinese power that arises to avoid being ruined by invasions but it would be a lot more independent than before  so i think 이성계 the first joseon king taejo was right to not invade china the whole expedition was a suicide mission designed as an excuse by the previous goryeo dynasty to get rid of him anyways the hongwu emperor was far too strong and militarily aggressive to allow us to take control of liaodong
  nice larp type that in korean now
  im not him but joseon korea tried to vassalize the jianzhou jurchens led by aisin gioro mengtemu but were stopped by the ming who vassalized them liaodong was already majority han in the late yuan while jilin and hamgyong were filled with jurchens koreans had to clear out hamgyong before even thinking of colonizing jilin the only opportunity was goryeo annexing balhae before the khitan
  for irredentism for us south koreans i dont know about what north koreans feel about this exactly there is some grievance but it is mostly in the background right now korea is not even united at this point so how can one talk about expansion furthermore china has been modernizing to an immense degree for several decades so they are militarily powerful and our economy has become totally intertwined with theirs its impossible for korea to survive a direct invasion of manchuria even if we overcome this impossibility to take manchuria we would need to do a genocide bigger than hitlers to koreanize it so no thank you i would rather have friendly relations with china and have a peaceful commercial and cultural exchange we should have taken it when we had the chance but the window of opportunity was gone a long time ago so i think we should focus on internal development into a harmonious powerhouse that can reach the world through soft power
  there was a revolt against joseon in 18th century pyongyang by forcibly koreanized jurchens deported there earlier from hamgyong they would have to deal with that a hundred times over in jilin

did the confederacy have a point in ideological terms if you subtract slavery from the equation
  no not really virtually everything kept circling back to slavery
yes but rules autism over leaving or not leaving a federation is no way to make a global empire happen
  a mix of puritanism expansionism into latin america and foreign trade with the european powers
no it all comes down to slavery as the root cause
  not really theyve maintained their other values largely to this day
  the innovations they did with their constitution seem near
  not really the cornerstone speech speaks clearly about the goal and the intention of the confederacy it was about slavery their god given right to own slaves and the superiority of white men
yes they had a moral right to secede from a country that itself was founded on secession    which was actually what the war was about by the way they seceded because of slavery but war broke out because of their secession they could have seceded over the right to legally fuck their cousins and a war still would have happened
  if you subtract slavery than you lose the reason to rebel in the first place
  nope because the entire problem was founded on the basis of indentured servitude take that away and theres no impetus for a civil war at all
  why do you think the south was so anxious to expand there and not west thats right because it was more hospitable to founding plantations worked by slaves
  they were anxious to spread in both directions and even fought a few pathetic battles in the southwest during the civil war democrats continued to promote expansion into latin america even after the civil war they almost convinced grant to annex the dominican republic but failed by one vote
subtracting slavery from the equation  why would you and how would you whats the point anyway    puritanism  south  no
  nobody disputes the existence of a southern culture just that the secession wasnt because of slavery  i wish people would stop being so afraid of this simple truth im not even anticsa or even strongly antislavery
      no  yes why do you think eugenics had its weakest support in the south despite the obvious hatred towards blacks there why do you think creationism was such a big deal in the south why do you think the term southern baptist exists    im not disputing that secession was over slavery at all im just saying that there was more to southern culture and ideology than slavery alone
  yes read federal papers
  puritanism isnt some catch all phrase for religiosity it was a specific religious movement that has nothing to do with the south but everything to do with new england its a very northern thing southerners particularly opposed puritanism you should also know that before the 20th century and somewhat into it the north was the more religious part of the country prone to zealotry with things like abolitionism and prohibition thats right its actually puritanism from which antislavery sprung   why do you think the term southern baptist exists  because they arent puritans or descendants of people that were puritans lol  im just saying that there was more to southern culture and ideology than slavery alone  k well nobody claimed otherwise
  they banned federal spending on internal improvement if they built too many long roads and bridges and shit it would make it easier for slaves to escape other changes like a presidential term and letting cabinet members deal with congress were done in passing and werent in themselves reasons for seceding
  puritanism in that sense is a catch all phrase of any reformed protestant sect with strict moral guidelines so stfu you cuckold
  no it isnt faggot thats wrong get the fuck off this board normie bitch
  they banned federal spending on internal improvement if they built too many long roads and bridges and shit it would make it easier for slaves to escape  going to need a source on this
  this you can ignore the rest of the thread to be honest
  ok my bad on using puritanism too broadly but my general point still stands the south was far more fundamentalist than elsewhere  k well nobody claimed otherwise  the op was asking the question
  the south was far more fundamentalist than elsewhere  i dont know if thats true desu compared to where everyone was religious back then and whats it have to do with the csa when the north was definitely more religious and fundamentalist i think its just a bad claim desu
not really    decentralized autonomous states are nice and all at least if you can somehow avoid being invaded by stronger centralized states but the confederacy didnt even allow that the confederacy was just as if not more centralized than the union for example you werent legally allowed to secede from the confederacy at the state level     there was no state regional or community based autonomy in the confederacy as there had been in say the holy roman empire or even in the old northern and middle colonies in fact the south had less of a tradition of local autonomy than the north
  support for prohibition was strongest in the south first states to ratify the 18th were mostly southern scopes trial took place in tennessee and to this day the biggest resistance to evolution/biggest support for intelligent design are in the south
the better question of course is whether the south had any path to victory at all
  based retard
  how can you say you are not strongly anti slavery do human rights mean anything to you i dont understand truly how anyone can posit themselves as anything but strongly anti slavery like what
  yes /thread
  i dont know why it matters that they seceded because of slavery because they didnt start the war the north did over their secession     hurrr muh sumter  sumter was an eviction of foreign military personnel with zero casualties and zero prisoners taken if it didnt happen the north would have eventually attacked anyway on some other excuse the second the south started acting like they were really their own country and not just larping bull run was the first true battle of the war    the north invaded the south because they seceded end of story it didnt matter they they seceded for a reason that wasnt noble enough they never would have been allowed to secede for any reason
  its another civil war was about slavery thread
how can you argue slavery wasnt a central tenet of this war southern economic and political interests were completely controlled by the plantation owners even more than the north was controlled by industrialists every event that happened in washington that led to the civil war dredd scott bleeding kansas missouri compromiseetc all had to do either with expanding slavery into new states or protecting slavery the south became singleissue voters      this doesnt mean every confederate soldier was a nigger hating slave whipping villain either both sides were controlled by moneyed elites and the soldiers were the uneducated impoverished masses used to fight their battles
  being strongly antislavery is the correct default position
  the masondixon line meant that only countries to the south or west of the northern boundary of modern day oklahoma could become slave states thus in the souths eyes they had to expand and quickly to equal the number of free states in the union so that would still have some political power     historically they didnt manage to do this and so the republicans were elected to office with the promise of banning slavery which would have essentially disenfranchised the south in the short term    the south obviously wasnt going to let that happen so they seceded
  this jefferson kind lf fucked up by not allowing sumter to be resupplied though imo without any provocation the north would have had to actually proclaim that they were taking steps to crush this rebellion and with a nonbelligierent south and a people not stoked by revenge i dont know how high support for the war would be in the north whereas it would be much higher in the south since they would be the ones under attack for no real reason might have even been time for guarantees of independence from foreign powers
  do human rights mean anything to you   no they dont
  yes  the union was akin to the british empire and the csa were akin to the colonies  the csas ideological terms were keeping american culture intact and also opposing tyranny and lincoln violated a plethora of rights and laws
  oof   lets hope you or your family are never enslaved thatd serve to change your views fast
  primarily the interests of the wealthy land and planation owners of the southern aristocracy it just so happened that those interests were largely over slavery    the csa didnt exist long enough to determine the strategic directions it would take
  confederate leadership was mostly high church episcopalians or presbyterian southern baptists were mostly the lower classes in the south and wouldve had nowhere near the amount of influence over the south it does now
literally state openly that the main reason they are separating is the issue of slavery  several states do this in legal documents  many leaders do this in public and in private  entrench slavery in their constitution     nuhuhuh they wuz fightin for souf and state ritez ughhh    fucking retards
  the confederate states were fighting for the right to govern themselves its pretty simple actually nobody was fighting for the rights of negroes they were fighting to protect the constitution if the union or confederacy were told that they are fighting for the right of the negro they would all immediately desert
  the north was fighting to keep the country together and the south were fighting for their rights to slaves read nearly any one of the secession declarations
  trying this hard to justify what was otherwise a totally illegal war  slavery was also legal in union states so why didnt they invade themselves likewise
  slavery was banned in the union states and the illegal war is on the south since states cant secede
so let us suppose that slavery is only a small part of confederate society their principals and philosophy all led to abject failure in every front they couldnt print money or tax their subject or enforce a draft they had no sovereignty they were a loose confederation of rural slave market economies doomed to failure if the union hadnt conquered them they would have been destroyed by mexico or become a european client state    the states rights argument is as stupid as slavery
i firmly believe the only thing this man did wrong was not kill more southern dogs    lee and davis should have been hanged
    read this
    theyre waiting for you sherman in the gas chamber
  
  nonburger here do you mean the federalist papers werent those written like 80 years before the confederacy seceded
  pragerjew
  slavery was banned in the union states  what is maryland kentucky missouri etc  lol  illegal war is on the south since states cant secede  it was started basically on lincolns behalf not under the law states in the confederacy could not abolish slavery even if they wanted to as it was unconstitutional the confederacy did not want a conflict however the union fought to keep the financial benefits and authority over the south the confederacy left the union without knowing the union would take military action
  literally refuted in the video that was just sent 
  devoted to exposing the global elite and deciphering the lies we are feed every day there is a much darker side to the establishment that rarely sees the light of day until now this is humanitys stand for its true freedom together we shall be victorious   ok anon
  are you like 15 just because you dont want something to happen doesnt mean its universally morally wrong i dont want to be conscripted does that make it wrong its not that simple
  hes just resorting to esoteric states rights arguments
  the video disproves the myth that the war was fought for the main and or only purpose of freeing or keeping slaves which has no facts to back it up it does not however argue that people in the south or the north were not fine with slavery if you watched the video before making this under educated comment you would know this you sound like a real considerate person as well with your well wishes this is what happens when you swallow the propaganda like you are dying of thirst
  kant is goat m8
  this pretty much    because the was over restoration of union not freeing the slaves which had no popular support in the north very very few people had bleeding hearts over the negro question    slavery was banned in the union states  wow outright fucking wrongwhy do people answer questions with pure guesses
  read this  links a video  what did he mean by this
  slavery was the soul cause for the war states rights as espoused by calhoun functioned as an argument in favor of preserving slavery that essentially became the soil on which confederate ideology was built   the confederate rebellion was seen by southerners as a conservative counterrevolution against the puritanical north which was believed to have been corrupted by unamerican ideals from europe many confederate leaders wished that it had been northern states that rebelled against the union so they could fight as representatives of the american establishment  many southerners also believed that the confederacy was fighting to preserve the dominance of the white man in the south and that a union victory would unleash the blacks and lower the quality of civilization the white background of the stainless banner was initially proposed to symbolize the supremacy of the white race this doesnt mean that the cause of the union was one of antiracism as modern shitlibs like to frame it  there was divisions within the csa as to whether the basis of the new nation was southern identity or the states rights ideology those believing in the latter were open to the idea of northern states excluding new england being allowed to join the csa    many southerners also drew parallels between their cause and the original american revolution citing that washington was a virginian and would have fought on their side if be was born at a different time some people believed that the confederate states should have been named the republic of washington instead
  lolxd raycists triggered epic style
  south  puritanism
  kys retard
  if you think william t sherman was some sort of antiracist paragon youre one dishing out the cavedinhead wojack takes here pal sherman was a white supremacist lincoln was a white supremacist the union was a white supremacist country before during and after the civil war  youre just like those people who post bomber harris memes ignorant of the fact that he was a rhodesian who might have regretted the part he played in history had he lived long enough to see its consequences  you put on this kind of fake patriotism for the union not because you sympathize with their real motives whatsoever but merely because they happened to defeat a faction you hate more
  waaah someone is being prowhite on the internet
no not at all the southern cause for war was muh state rights which was literally about slavery all the issues of culture economics politics etc was based around slavery the southern economy was weaker because of an agrarian slave economy the politics were built around slavery the southern antebellum culture was built around plantations and slave owners the south also complained about taxation but most of their population were slaves that couldnt pay taxes the south was full of retards who literally fought for slavery whether that was they said or not
  many southerners also believed that the confederacy was fighting to preserve the dominance of the white man in the south and that a union victory would unleash the blacks and lower the quality of civilization  well they werent exactly wrong
  keep half your population in literal chains forcing them to work for no pay they cant own assets they cant develop capital they cant move up in society or get an education  surprised when your land becomes a shithole when all those people are made citizens    this wasnt that long ago ww1 was only 100 years ago and we still see the impact it has in the middle east in our daily lives an uneducated society mostly illiterate takes decades to fix especially when institutions were in place keeping them down and inhibiting them at every point for decades after
  the confederacy left the union without knowing the union would take military action  either the officials of the confederacy were retards or simply forgot but im sure they would have recalled when andrew jackson was going to militarily intervene if sc didnt stop nullifying federal law and threatening secession back in the 1830s
the average csa soldier was just fighting for their state and home more than any ideology    usa was more like modern day eu they just thought they were pulling an early form of brexit
  southern blacks were very quickly put back on a leash that lasted from the time reconstruction ended to the civil rights era so there was kind of a 100 year delay to that prediction coming true
  the confederacy didnt leave without knowing they left with the assumption that britain and france would come to their aid because of cotton and it failed miserably
slavery was defiantly the main driving point in the csa leaving the union but it wasnt just that it was also about state representation for the csas entire existence they denounced the us government calling it tyrannical and that the south will not submit to tyrants which they used abraham lincoln a lot for the example however when we really look at reality the us for its entire existence has been very democratic it was just extreme fierce political and economic opposition that lead to the civil war so on its own the csa doesnt have much to stand for if it took slavery out of the equation
  wouldnt have failed if not for gettysburg  the one time lee really fucked the pooch
  the average csa soldier initially joined out of anger that the union army was invading the south and sometimes out of vengeance when the union army plundered southern farms even then though it likely depended on your political views at the time how you viewed the war former whigs usually were the southern unionist who saw the union army as liberators who were putting the southern aristocracy back in their place dixiecrats on the other hand wouldve been more sympathetic to the secession
  civil war was just a fight between southern bourgeois  plantation owners and northern bourgeois industrialists and small business owners to establish supremacy any ideology like muh state rights or muh tyranny was just attempts to market the war to the proles
  ww1 was only 100 years ago and we still see the impact it has in the middle east in our daily lives  not really
  northern industrialists especially new england textile industry didnt have any incentive to abolish slavery as that would hurt cotton output which was used in their factories i can see them not wanting the south to be a separate country because tariffs
  the borders of the middle east were literally decided after the war the league of nations was literally the predecessor to the united nations national self determination is literally the reason arbitrary lines were drawn globally to divide countries up
  northern industrialists especially new england textile industry didnt have any incentive to abolish slavery  they had because slavery is inefficient they were more then willing to release the slaves and enroll them back on wage slavery the war was also about establishing supremacy northern industrialists wanted their cotton and their cotton only not the incessant whining from the plantation owners
  slavery is literally the dumbest thing ever like you said a wage slave is much better they pay taxes they buy property well loans to buy property they support local businesses and you can still force them to produce the same output as a slave
  the borders of the middle east were literally decided after the war   so  national self determination  arbitrary  pick one
  national self determination is completely arbitrary when the idea of a nationality or a country never even existed for most people and the borders they are based on are roughly based on the land some king conquered hundreds of years prior
  wrong
  the meaning of this word is how i want it to be rather than the actual definition because im a dumb retard
  as other anons have said  just read the 16 or so documents of secession they are all about slavery    but ive also heard a compelling argument that the states did have the right to seceded from the union of they wished to that the states would have never have joined the union i the first place if they knew they would never be allowed to exit if they so wished
  yes my friend it was your minority stake in greater return perpetuitized
  no its actually about economics   what kind of economics   slave economics
  he doesnt know the tariffs of 1846 and 1857 were both authored by southern democrats    you are now aware that infographic is hilariously wrong at the time of secession the export tariffs on cotton were the lowest theyd been in 50 years
  isnt that a bit undermined by the fact that not all the states were required to consent to the consitution in order to be part of the union in the first place

  it was over slavery and it was also a 100 justified reaction to a hostile government trying to steal legally bought property and infringe on state rights    literally cant argue against that unless youre a butthurt redditor who cares about muh feels

  just give me one scenario where theyre right please
  did he already do gay sex for frat hazing
  how dare you tax my soda im leaving this union  you cant just have states leaving whenever they please america would fall apart that way
  not really one of the reasons the constitution replaced the articles of confederation was to prevent revolutions from destroying the country     furthermore during the nullification crisis andrew jackson appealed to congress and received authorization to use military force against south carolina if necessary    the only compelling argument is from historically illiterate dixiefags who think the confederate states secession is the exact same thing as the american revolution
  many southerners also drew parallels between their cause and the original american revolution citing that washington was a virginian  which probably isnt far away from the truth considering be was a genocidal white straight male and a slaveowner
  north didnt fight to free slaves but south absolutely fought to preserve slavery this is so obvious and welldocumented that its downright pointless to argue they literally stated it openly in their legal documents including constitution
  its a redditor on /his/ episode  its a repeat propaganda shoved down your throat in 9th grade episode  its a bragging about being too stupid to understand historical nuance episode
        that video is russian propaganda tier
the south has political dominance for decades  uses federal power to enforce the fugitive slave act on northern states and repeated attempts to force northern states to allow slavery    loses one election  secedes now lets create a government even bigger then the union one that bans leaving and leaves less power to the states     muh states rights instantly proves the person saying it is a retard with zero understanding of history
  independent citizenry i know its bullshit and the south was a pseudoaristocracy where free white men called rich guys master  but the concept is that even dirt poor starving white guys owned their own land and were technically independent body and mind whereas in the north mechanized commercial farming even though a boost in general created lots of people who lived in debt to keep up and buy new equipment and even people loosing their farms     as the southern planters adopted expansionist ideology simply to get poor whites on their side with the promise of land for them     again its all bullshit but the independent man was a big narrative for confederates
  they almost convinced grant to annex the dominican republic but failed by one vote  grant didnt exactly need persuading man had a hankering for more clay    god sumner was a faggot
  south was far more fundamentalist than elsewhere  did you read the rest of the post no it wasnt you dumb bitch
the confederates failed because they failed to realize that they were cavaliers lord only knows what they would have done if they had but it would have been quite a bit more drastic this was not quite a realization available to the 19thcentury southern intellectualnot even to the most extreme such as the fascinating george fitzhugh star of what louis hartz called the reactionary enlightenment and author of the amazing and mischievous proslavery tract cannibals all even fitzhugh was not quite ready to restore the stuarts and he was probably more talked about in the north than read in the south it was just the wrong century for that sort of a thing    the confederacy in particular failed first and foremost because it seceded way too late it should have done the deed in 1850 at the latest and probably earlier it was not necessary to wait for abraham lincoln john brown and the secret six for the south to know that the north was after its blood it should have been clear by the 1830s that the marriage with puritan revolutionary democracy was not a winner
why was balance of powers a meme in the postroman west   did china have a similar meme before unification did anyone    
you aint got a leg to stand on black people certainly you aint standing on the moral high ground    black people  have owned slaves since prehistory though the life of a fellow negro was worth old pots and pans rotgut whisky turpentine gin nails mildewed broadcloth and rusty obselete muskets never cared enough to try and free the slaves still the region with the worlds most slaves and the law just doesnt give a fuck    white people  banned slavery long ago only to revive it when it comes to foreigners and heathens manage to realise this is wrong within 300 years and begin to put a stop to it fight wars 5 years long costing millions in treasure and literally about a million lives revolutionizing warfare forever all to free slaves that arnt even of their own race or people put naval squadrons in all the oceans of the world with the express job of catching and stopping slavers even end the arab slave trade which they had fuck all to do with now the regio with the least slaves nearly all slaves in white countries owned by non white immigrants its completely illegal and the law is enforced thoroughly     so what you holding a grudge against whitey for over this black anon you want to find the worlds most prolific slaver you go look in a damn mirror
  blacks are tribal savages they look for any excuse to hate on non black people thats why african refugees attack white people in europe despite them having never been slaves or under any colonialism either
  white people institute slavery and then ban it later so theyre the heroes  okay there anon
      whites sold each other into slavery to muslims vikings sold western european christians and pagan slavs western european christians sold pagan slavs
  blacks institute slavery and never bother to ban it but because some of them were slaves they are somehow morally entitle to harangue white people about it in perpetuity  okay there faggot
  youre missing the part where they stop doing that and then ban it youre doing it deliberately because if you dont they moral high ground the white world now stands on is blindingly obvious
  i mean ffs just look at haiti
  black north korea  confirmed for waegukin capitalist propaganda
plenty of african ethnic groups prohibited slavery    it wasnt a black thing
  but it is today seriously look at haiti blackest country in the caribbean has the most slavery despite being a nation of self freed slaves meanwhile on the other side of the island the spaniard mutts are doing just fine
  nope most forced labor occurs in the middle east
  firstly mena aint white so whites still got the moral highground secondlythen is why is the only country on that map thats gotten 50100 percent eritrea
  and ill add to that i didnt mean that haiti has the most slaves in the world i meant they have the most in the carribeans despite being a nation of self freed slaves who you thought might put some kind of value on freedom they are also entirely black
  more cannonballs in the mainmast and jib than in the ship itself  telltale sign of australian guncrews as they are used to aiming upside down

   literally the entire planet practices slavery   only in europe is slavery ended   literally the entire planet continues to practice slavery   europeans start up again but only with stone age cave men   literally the entire planet continues to practice slavery   europeans end slavery   literally the entire planet continues to practice slavery   europeans finally put an end global slavery   but but europeans were evil slavers1    okay there anon

i have a hitler action figure that i got of amazon and i like to make scenarios where i place him with other historical figures and pose them like theyre talking ill make up the conversation and write it out sometimes even read the back in forth out loud alone sometimes i like to dress him up in funny outfits ill even sometimes have him fighting anime figures i have like hitler vs funny valentine sometimes i like putting him in this chair i have and have him next to me while i play wargames with my friends for good like i insert myself as hitler leading my forces into battle i think it would be cool to make hitler figures and sell them on line im pretty good at painting figures so i think i could make some decent money id like to make whole variants of hitlers like vietnam hitler business casual hitler golf hitler beach hitler 70s hitler van hitler w/ frankenstein guitar im very attached to this figure i play it off as a meme to people but i really would be devastated if anything happened to it im not even a fascist or racist i just have this strange affinity for hitler its like this mysticism almost taboo appeal kind of like having a darth vader action figure but cooler does this count as a hobby

  how did greece not leave nato after this
  america would sponsor a coup
  if greece went communist in their civil war instead of nato things would have been different
  speaking of which what was the aim of all the american backed coups in turkey as far as im aware all of the turkish civilian governments which got couped were right wing and anticommunist so why did america support the military coups against them
  tfw no conflict ethnic were i can take advantage of adolescent girls
  native cypriots already look like the caricature in your pic

    whats up with diaspora greeks and islam
  henry kissinger supported the indonesian genocide and mass rape of east timorese
  would international community let this occupation slide if indonesians werent such savages
  the international community only intervened after australia and americas puppet dictator suharto was overthrown in indonesia
  indonesians are doing worse stuff in west papua and no one gives a shit
  what are they doing there
  basically unrestricted total colonization of the country indonesian government set up mining and logging industry there since the 70s after holding a frankly dubious referendum that officially relinquished sovereignty of west papua to indonesia the government then sponsored agricultural immigration to the lowland regions and started taking land for mining and logging various reports came in of indonesian military killing natives who resisted after talks for some sort of autonomy failed most proindependence natives fled into the countryside to fight a guerrilla war although with most of these rebels disorganized and few in number compared to the indonesian militaryalong with the thousands of immigrants the indonesian government has had no problem continuing immigration and exploitation of resources with no international backlash manifestdestiny style until the whole of west papua is 1 nativepapuan      
  pretense for warization
jacob prai was previously the head of the senate of west papua provisional government proclaimed in great waris border area between papua new guinea and west papua prais homeland1    prai was granted asylum in sweden with dr john otto ondawame and currently leading the free papua movement international office in malmö sweden    swedes sure are thirsty for terrorists

  whats with the oecusse exclave on the western indonesian side of the timor island
    nsfw pictures graphic violence and nudity by indonesian soldiers sexually torturing an east timorese woman during the genocide                                    
the first president of east timor went by xanana which came from the band sha na na
india takes goa from portugal  nobody cares  indonesia takes east timor from portugal  everyone loses it
  indonesia invaded an independent east timor which won independence from portugal on 28 november 1975 after an armed and political struggle by fretilin against portuguese rule goans supported indias annexation because goans are simply a subgroup of maharashtran indians east timorese fretilin fought against both portuguese and indonesian rule east timorese have papuan mixture and some speak papuan languages
  america australia uk and japan supported indonesias invasion of east timor australia helped indonesia blockade east timor to stop weapons supply to the east timorese    gaddafis libya opposed the invasion and supported east timorese with weapons and training
  there were no sore commie losers in goa
  no big deal because not communists
  paki
  india was prosoviet
  portugal actually had the whole timor island and flores but sold or lost the western half of timor and the other islands to the dutch so some people there are catholic too they had the moluccas before the dutch and some catholics are there
  most east timorese were animist even under portuguese rule but the war against indonesia caused them to adopt catholicism as a sign of defiance against indonesian muslims
  they probably would have stayed animist if indonesia didnt invade them after independence
  warization
  where are the butthurt indogs  theyre just an aussie puppet shouldve stayed with us  theyre so fucking poor shouldve stayed with us  papuans will end up as an aussie puppet just like them if they go independent  were building infrastructure in papua  there are too many of us who were born and raised there would you kick out whites from the us  nuke those fucking civilian killing opm monkeys    indongnesians are just a bunch of brown muslim chinks desu they see these territories and their people as theirs instead of one of them

are there any interesting stories/conflicts/people of note about the russian conquest of siberia and the far east who exactly lived beyond the urals and did they put up a fight against the russians any interesting written records of the conquest
its funny how most of siberian explorers were poles
  best explorers  not most of them
  who exactly lived beyond the urals and did they put up a fight against the russians   turkic mongolic yeniseian samoyedic tungusic peoples the turkic and mongols were in advanced tribal and state societies were pastoral nomads had writing had iron and were buddhist shamanist or muslim the other groups were primitives and died fast in battle
  flashman at the charge is a pretty funny fictional account of the russian conquest of central asia it has copious resource behind it and i recommend it for anyone who can take a pause from herodotus for something a bit more lighthearted and fun but still educational especially in a subject matter where not much has been released in english    sources are even in the back of the book if you want to read more its honestly great
  yeah ive heard about this book series should give it a read some time i guess
  from what ive read the russians ruled there like the brits did in india so they let local rulers rule but the local rulers were told what to do by the tsar
  thats southern central asia like bukhara and khiva

  russians first began contacting the chukchi when they reached the kolyma river 1643 and the anadyr river 1649 the route from nizhnekolymsk to the fort at anadyrsk along the southwest of the main chukchi area became a major trade route the overland journey from yakutsk to anadyrsk took about six months  the chukchi were generally ignored for the next 50 years because they were warlike and had few furs fighting flared up around 1700 when the russians began operating in the kamchatka peninsula and needed to protect their communications from the chukchi and koryak the first attempt to conquer them was made in 1701 other expeditions were sent out in 1708 1709 and 1711 with considerable bloodshed but little success war was renewed in 1729 when the chukchi defeated an expedition from okhotsk and killed its commander command passed to major dmitry pavlutsky who adopted very destructive tactics burning killing driving off reindeer and capturing women and children in 1742 the government at saint petersburg ordered another war in which the chukchi and koryak were to be totally extirpated the war 17447 was conducted with similar brutality and ended when pavlutsky was killed in march 1747 it is said that the chukchi kept his head as a trophy for a number of years the russians waged war again in the 1750s  and an anon here said the chukchi were annexed by russia and didnt even realise it then came the missionaries to convert them i guess the russians feared the sealeating warrior
  whats interesting is the conquest was similar to the european conquest of the americas  many of the far eastern peoples died from plague introduced by the european peoples expanding eastward

the view of siberia that in the early nineteenth century was probably shared most widely by russians west of the urals may be termed the colonial or even better imperial image this was a picture of siberia as a mercantile colony of the russian state for all intents and purposes a foreign territorial possession useful exclusively by virtue of the natural resources available there for exploitation the colonial image derived naturally from the traditional relationship between russia and siberia which from its inception was that of a metropolis to  a colony in a manner resembling that of the iberian empires in the new world the russians who crossed the urals to conquer and then occupy siberia did so in quest of an easily obtained and highly lucrative mercantile commodity fur which presented an alternative nearly as attractive as the precious metals of the new world on domestic and foreign markets the luscious pelts of the siberian taiga were as precious as gold and silver a fact underscored by the common russian reference to them as soft gold over the centuries furs from siberia provided a steady and critically important source of income for medieval russia during its heyday the fiscal significance of the fur trade can hardly be overstated one wellinformed observer the seventeenthcentury official grigorii kotoshikhin estimated that fully onethird of the total state revenues in the 1640s derived from siberian pelts    inventing siberia visions of the russian east in the early nineteenth century by mark bassin södertörn university the american historical review  june 1991

  chukchi mostly subsist off of reindeer moreso than seals
  thatd be kino i wonder how they managed to beat them again and again did they have guns or did they just huck seal skulls at them on reindeer and that was sufficient
  i love how even today most of that is wilderness devoid of humanity in all but the most sparse degree and is an effective wasteland it drops to 90 below zero during the day in parts of sakha due to the east siberian plateus elevation and latitude its like another world desu
  ywn be a fur trapper living in the remote wilderness of siberia  man if that isnt a /k/ fantasy i dont know what is
  i dont know man thats why it gave me deja vu
  nah man those hairy paleosiberian hags cant get any from their husbands and are desperate for the slavic cock
  slavic cock  oxymoron
  dont wait theyre brilliant
  i read about one of the early russian explorers and his group of cossacks who got lost in the wilderness of siberia for many years they turned into a band of cannibals preying on native tribes eventually they reached the pacific ocean and found an abandoned settlement founded by an earlier expedition but couldnt turn back because they had made enemies with every tribe behind them eventually they got enslaved by buryats for some more years until being sold back to the russian tsar the tsar quickly had him executed after buying him back i cannot the name however
  1st phase  guerilla warfare in a place the chukchi know very well  win and steal equipment  all other phases  same thing but with guns  steal more equipment  i guess thats how it went    ywn herd reindeer and/or hunt seals and whales
hurr durr ukraine no such thing    why do poolacks do this    
cossacks were polishturkish mischlings
cossacks  ukrainians  nikita
the internet is full of russian paid trolls and ordinary russian brainwashed idiots you cant have any discussion about ukraine or russia or ussr or anything
    ukraine  no such thing
  you cant have any discussion about russia or russia or russia or anything
ukraine is more legitimate than belgium
  they were ruthenians moron      thats literally what ukraine was initially  lands of cossacks    but its fucking poolacks
  ukrainians arent the same as ruthenians and neither are cossacks both of those terms predate the concept of ukrainian people by many centuries
  russian territory
river vikings
  ruthenians  ergo russians  ukraine  never was will never be
  its literally the same fucking thing in the western ukraine people called themselves ruthenians till the beginning of 20th century and there are still people in carpathians calling themselves like that   ukrainian is just a new ethnonym but people are literally the same
    russians are culture bandits they are not even slavs

every human ideology leads to death  why
  because we die
  jews
  past ideologies were often made by low iq people in order to appeal to their low iq comrades hence it often endures inside the minds of these morons it goes without saying that these monkeys wont get that far with their grand elaborate plans
basic human nature since the beginning of time a group of people assambled to take what a other group of people had because they wanted it or they needed to survive democracy pretty well because everyone has the illusion of having their little shitty area and personal comforts

  transhumanist  ideology  i never understood that meme transhumanism is obviously limited by technology not ideologu
  mortality and the shortsightedness that comes with it
  based
every nonnormal death results in a value judgement based on the respective ideology  this value judgement itself is an ideology
because man think to much and the education is the result of mass death genocide hatred and ideology/politics    the most based life is a life with the soil and the family in harmony with nature and tradition all the rest are shit thing who corrupted us

  ideology itself is ruinous  liberals fascists and communists are the slow death of all humanity and everything thats good in the world
  these statements are so retarted prehistoric humans didnt have education but still bashed eachothers head in with stones
  he didnt say that people wouldnt kill each other only that there would be less mass death genocide hatred and ideology/politics
  not the neotlithic europeans no
  whats your first language
we use ideology to justify atrocities and mask our socially unacceptable motivations from ourselves and others  eg jews are evil greedy kikes that want to exterminate white people  what that really means jews are powerful and rich and i envy them if i cant beat them under capitalism ill beat them with violence
  death is part of being human and living as one you dimwit
  transhumanism proposes that we should use technology to go beyond human capability its less political than other ideas but it is still an ideology because it wants to radically change society it advocates for support in those areas as well as widespread use of it thats basically it
  whats the difference
  my form of ideology is perfect and has never been tried before
  with civilisation millions of people live lives dependent on technology for five decades until the lack of access to nature / spirit / god causes them to turn on each other in a mass calamity causes millions of them to die flee be raped persecuted and tortured before geopolitical balance is restored and millions more get born repeating the cycle    with no civilisation you fuck about for 99 of your life in harmony with nature / spirit / god until your brother sleeps with a rival clans girl and you have kill a couple of them or be killed and if you survive you then have to marry your daughter to the other clans chief to restore harmony before you die an old man and return to the earth    neither are really better or worse it just depends what your prefence is

  he said generals
  do strategists count as generals    if yes then sima yi every other answer is a meme
  sima yi was actually a military general the le intellectual nemesis to zhuge liang is a romance of the 3 kingdoms meme
  cao cao doesnt count as a general
    you both fell for the strict categorization of people meme
  in han dynasty china there was a distinction between civil and military officials sure people cross that line all the time when military officials displayed civic talent cao cao or when civil officials displayed military acumen zhuge liang who was shus prime minister    as it is sima yi held a military rank
  in han dynasty china    missing the point of the whole three kingdoms shit
  general jin xia chang zheng yi chu shao dung
  the succeeding dynasties largely carried over the government systems you dip    not to mention it only officially began with the overthrow of the last han emperor by cao pi and the foundation of wei cao cao died as a prime minister of the han dynasty and was only posthumously emperor of wei made so by his son
  not understanding that civil wars make every systems blurry and fluid  marking the end of the han dynasty after the end of the puppet emperors reign
  getting his history from the romance of the three kingdoms  we literally have no idea of cao cao was an ebil man wanted to be eventually betray the emperor and found himself a new dynasty he never even did so in his long service    cao pi meanwhile did exactly that as far as telling the han emperor he didnt have mandate anymore
  how many taels of gold did the cao clan pay you    be honest

  real answer probably someone like zhou yu lu meng or cao ren
this narrative is good example of the axiom history is written by the winners however the two most wellknown instances where religion and science were supposedly at odds would have to be the galileo affair and scopesmonkey trial both of these had nothing to do with the science itself but had to do with who controls the output of information     in the case of the galileo affair it was an issue of whether or not new metaphysical theories should be allowed to be propagated to the masses before being investigated and approached by the clergy galileo was pretty much accepted by the clergy and just told to keep his theories within the abstract field of academia for the time being but he instead went around insulting proponents of geocentrism anyway      in the scopesmonkey trial the american parents werent advocating to ban evolution theory from the country or to kill anyone who believes in it they merely were protesting the idea of the public schools teaching their children a theory they didnt agree with scopesmonkey trial was all about whether parents control their childrens curriculum or the state does     the martyrs of science against le reactionary religion might be a good narrative for scientist to wank themselves as heroes but it doesnt hold up to reality     2bh the one case i can think of science and religion might contradict is when certain religions choose not to cure their children of disease due to opposition to the treatment but this is hardly to the scale which is commonly accepted just a small group of obscure people
  christians believe an iron age god impregnated a woman and gave birth to a hippie carpenter who could walk on water and rose from the dead genesis is a creation myth that is wrong from front to back its fundamentally anti science learning about science as a teenager was the main thing that made me an atheist
  just told to keep his theories within the abstract field of academia for the time  how is that not antiscience telling a scientist not to talk about the science he discovered
  keep you science in science and dont extrapolate metaphysical viewpoints from it  somehow antiscience    implying the bible is meant to be interpreted literally
  they merely were protesting the idea of the public schools teaching their children  again how is saying schools the one place specifically designed to teach things should not be allowed to teach science not antiscience
  anon if you think its all a metaphor then youre a fucking atheist christians actually believe jesus was the son of a god and was resurrected
   the bible is meant to be interpreted literally  so its just a metaphor like son of god
  yeah but the creation myth isnt literally true and most christian havent believed that for a long time
  and most christian havent believed that for a long time  because science was slowly replaced religion in that space despite the churhcs best efforts
  how is it that you decide part of it is a metaphor and part of it literally happened where in the bible does it claim genesis bid a metaphor
  scopesmonkey trial was all about whether parents control their childrens curriculum or the state does  conveniently ignoring the fact that those parents specifically chose not to believe the facts of evolution because of their religious teachings so even if you boil it down to parents rights vs the state its still an example of religion vs science
  what best efforts science and religion arent contradictory and religious institutions including the church have at time hastened the development of science like for the big bang theory
  ncluding the church have at time hastened the development of science  a broken clock is correct twice a day anon
man my distaste for christians and their idiocy peaked and subsided in college but posters here have re ignited it you people are genuinely as stupid as the worse sjws
  parents specifically chose not to believe the facts of evolution because of their religious teachings  or maybe they sincerely believed it was wrong you arent in a position to say why they didnt believe in evolution as if without their brand of protestantism they would have accepted it at face value i am in a position to say that never advocated for banning evolution from the country or persecuting people who believed in evolution however since they never did it really was about whether they had control of what their children are taught in public school
  science vs religion dichotomy  heh the rcc fostered sciences from its foundation to the present
  science is based in reality religion is superstitious nonsense
  advocating to not teach science to kids because your religion says science is not true is anti science even if they dont literally try and murder people who believe in science
  religion only ever became a thing to explain things we didnt yet have enough science to explain its no surprise that religiosity has been constantly decreasing since the enlightenment as what is explained by science has grown tremendously
  advocating to not teach science  how does not wanting to teach one theory which hadnt even been widely accepted translate to not teaching science
  humans have always used science to begin walking apes through trial and error figured out how to sharpen rocks into weapons they passed down the procedure orally
  religion only ever became a thing to explain things we didnt yet have enough science to explain  no religion concerns itself with metaphysics and spirituality theres a reason the bible isnt filled with math equations or geometric theories but is filled with stories concerning the nature of god the human condition and reality
  and here we get to the crux of the problem christians dont understand science even the most basic parts of it evolution is the foundation of biology and is provable through every avenue
  which hadnt even been widely accepted  evolution was very widely accepted by scientists then it was only religion challenging it trying to handcuff what science teachers are allowed to say on the whims of local superstitions is antiscience religious fanatic parents trying to tell scientists or science teacher what is or isnt science is in fact antiscience
  metaphysics  would be even more complex than regular physics not some nonsensical we are all energy n shiet bullcrap you theist go on about
  metaphysics and spirituality are not real things
  evolution is the foundation of biology  natural philosophy goes back to prehistory but evolution was only formulated in the mid19th century biologys foundations goes back to aristotles observations of nature and early medicine not to evolution
  nature of reality  where in the bible does it describe reality
  bnye
the bible doesnt describe god as we have no idea what this entity looks like
  i think you are confusing the history of science with science biology is largely based on the biochemistry of genetics when people speak of how something works scientifically they are speaking of the science of how it works not the history of our understanding of how it works before modern science
  look idiot science has taught us existence is not simple a spiritual layer of reality would have new physics that cant be generalized
  philosophy is a joke and has no place in modern education or our understanding of the world the very fact that it is explained with religion should be a red flag its just a bunch of made up stuff
  philosophy was how ancient geniuses tried to define reality without math equations its pointless now due to those math equations
  yeah i am specifically referring to postenlightenment philosophy before the enlightenment philosophy was just protoscience with almost nothing to do with modern philosophy
  lol okay early christians claimed that jesus literally ascended vertically upwards into / through the atmosphere and into gods realm heaven because they literally believed as did pretty much all jews and pagans that gods realm was up beyond the sky in the highest heaven they literally thought god was a heavenly father it wasnt some metaphor yhwh / elohim started as a standard patriarchal high god / dyeus pitar figure like zeus or jupiter
  how is modern philosophy explained with religion most modern philosophy is atheist outside of odd outliers like marion sloterdijk or macintyre
  high  higher degrees of reality not physically higher see how he peers through the sky not up into the sky
  early scientists thought the earth orbited the sun more recent scientists thought the universe was static science bitches are wrong all the time
  more that religion is just a type of philosophy just a bunch of made up shit note how it came up in this thread saying religion isnt opposed to science but rather just a way to explain metaphysics and spirituality as though metaphysics and spirituality are real things and not just philosophical bullshit
  what the fuck is a degree of reality
  modern religious people still think the world is 6000 years old
  they are the outliers most modern religious people even christians know the world is older and the big bang itself was invented by a catholic priest
  philosophy isnt just made up dude you can logically critique it just because it doesnt rely on the scientific method doesnt mean its not real
  you dont throw out centuries of church tradition like an autist
  because they are only nominally religious most modern christians do not have the conviction of real chrristians from every previous generation
  no thats exactly why it is not real its just bullshit to argue about none of it means anything
  heres the first problem how do you know the exact age of this rock with no measurements a book said its 6000 years old did the author witness the creation of this rock does the author know there are other continents no thus the bible is bullshit
  and the big bang itself was invented by a catholic priest  the big bang wasnt invented it either happened or it didnt just because the guy that coined the term happened to belong to a religion doesnt mean religion is pro science
  awareness of the cave
  i am not claiming you can figure out the age of the earth without recourse to science and very few modern christians would claim that the earliest argument against evolution by christians was based on the geological data regarding the age of the earth    even the christians of previous generations did not believe the bible should be interpreted 100 literally the catholic church has always maintained that the bible cannot be interpreted accurately in itself and needs to be illuminated by outside sources as  points out    not being science doesnt mean it doesnt mean anything art and literature arent science but they means stuff  many scientific fields today come out of philosophy sociology linguistics and economics all started out from philosophy even science itself used to be natural philosophy
  christfags believe in static universe theory but refuse to explain how this static universe works    in religion people handwave shit with gods or spirits yet dont go indepth about these gods and spirits so they explain nothing x goddess made the forest ok but how did she do it how is zeus cobtrolling the weather how the fuck does nyx exist everywhere at night time
  but it does mean religion isnt antiscience if the popes personal scientists was the one who showed that the world wasnt 6000 years old
  art and literature arent science but they means stuff  art and literature are real coherent things spirituality is not
  dude sciencefags believed in the static universe while religious people didnt in the late 1800s and early 1900s einstein specifically doctored his equations to show that the universe was static
  religious authority used to impose itself compulsively upon all families and children why is it any surprise the same mechanics are play with a secular state
  just because the pope has employed some smart people over the years does not suggest religions are not constantly attacking science in all sorts of spaces
  and philosophy is not spirituality ethics is a legitimate thing to investigate and you have no need for the scientific method to do ethics for example what the right thing to do in a certain situation is is not a scientific question
  they are but that is an aspect specific to a certain segment of religious people and is almost specifically an american phenomenon today
  then there are more questions like  what are spirits made of  how do they influence the world  why do they exist
  i dont really thin ethics is what most people think when they are discussing philosophy
  dude sciencefags believed in the static universe while religious people didnt  the fuck are you talking about
  ethics is one of the most important parts of philosophy and always has been what disciplines of philosophy do you consider to be beyond logic and criticism
  what i proceeded to say is what i was talking about
  is there any evidence that religious people were trying to tell scientists that the universe was expanding but scientists refused to acknowledge the evidence that seems incredibly unlikely
  metaphysics and spirituality
  stop being such a brainlet and go study presocratics rational and religious ways of thinking are fundamentally opposed
  father georges lemaître claimed the universe was expanding while einstein was trying to make his equations show that is was not
  in the scopesmonkey trial the american parents werent advocating to ban evolution theory from the country or to kill anyone who believes in  which they didnt believe because their religion was opposed to it  are you fucking stupid
  spirituality is hardly a mainstay of modern philosophy and metaphysics is pretty rare after phenomenology deleuze is probably one of the few household names in philosophy who actually wrote about metaphysics
  father georges lemaître claimed the universe was expanding  why did he believe this  while einstein was trying to make his equations show that is was not  note scientists often had to make assumptions when the evidence was insufficient the key to science is that as they collect that evidence those assumptions are revisited if einstein had claimed the universe was definitively static you could have an argument but just using that assumption is a very different thing
  i like how your argument went from religious people in the 1800s believed this thing scientists refused to recognize to a single guy who was also a member of the church in the 1900s discovered something that contradicted one of einsteins equations
  why did he believe this  initially for some theological reason he made some observations that corroborated the theory and basically from then on it was science  note scientists often had to make assumptions when the evidence was insufficient the key to science is that as they collect that evidence those assumptions are revisited if einstein had claimed the universe was definitively static you could have an argument but just using that assumption is a very different thing  i claim that religious people do the same thing
  what advancements have come from philosophy science the scientific revolution seems its all just arguing about semantics
  initially for some theological reason  can you elaborate he decided this to be true because of the bible was it just him or was it the churchs official stance before he made the observations and made it science
  i claimed that it applied in the late 1800s to the early 1900s i wasnt exactly sure when lemaitre lived i didnt claim it was some mass phenomenon i claimed that religion isnt necessarily antiscience and i pointed out a case where a religious guy the popes scientist figured something out about the universe that atheistic scientists did not
  i claim that religious people do the same thing  the whole point of religion is that it is faith based not based in evidence and experimentation not set to be revisted as better information became available    do you think if we discovered something archeologically that proved jesus did not exist historically that the church would incorporate that into their beliefs
  but you tried to pass the ideas of an individual as the ideas of religious people in general you specifically said sciencefags believed in the static universe while religious people didnt in the late 1800s and early 1900s
  well basically the standard scientific view at the time was that the universe always was and always will be which conflicted with the religious idea that there was a specific point in time where the universe was created so lemaître set out to show that the religious view was actually scientific as well in this case it took a while for his specific formulation of the beginning of time to be accepted as not conflicting with religious dogma but in 1951 it was declared by the pope as religiously acceptable
  that atheistic scientists did not  the beauty of science is that it does not matter what religion the person who made the observations chose to belong to you cant blame old timey people for not being atheists in a society where almost everyone was raised ton be religious by default likewise you cannot attribute discoveries made then to the church
  religious people at the time believed the universe had been created scientists did not
  so you mean they were somewhat right in a very strained sense
  i think that would be an impossible archeological proof but yes as a theoretical the church has historically revised many of its ideas in light of science including accepting heliocentrism evolution and modern physics
  as opposed to the scientists in this case being flat out wrong yes
  in the case i am referencing the old timey person is a priest and is devoutly religious with his religion informing how he conducts science and the person he disagrees with is in fact an atheist my point is that religion doesnt impact your ability to do science
  you really need to differentiate between scientific speculation and theory many people who were scientists may have believed the universe to be static but that was just a realm where science was unable to collect sufficient evidence
  my point is that religion doesnt impact your ability to do science  thats a stretch being religious does not entirely preclude you from being able to do science but it pretty clearly doesnt help historically
  science is always unable to collect sufficient evidence what makes science is that it is based on the available observations by your measure that nothing is science until all the data is gathered there can never be science because science itself presupposes that there could always be conflicting data
  believes in miracles  believes in global flood  believes in supernatural creatures  believes in prayer  yeah very scientific
  i dont think that religion and science are in conflict fundamentally
  global flood is a metaphor
  believes that moses parted the sea  believes in angels and demons  believes jesus rose from dead  believes in god men    or is it all metaphor
  religion specifically is based on faith it traditionally and still widely discourages inquiry and curiosity
  ok but thats not what religion says
  comparing some gnostic newage painting with orthodox antiquity religious worldviews   comparing judeochristianity with platonic soulsurvival / antimatter escapism
  basically yeah
  faith and science are separate domains which do not infringe on each other
  how can you say that faith is specifically saying do not worry about science just believe curiosity is the death of faith
  it literally is the catholic church does not claim that there was a historical flood that literally wiped out all of humanity they provide for accepting the contemporary view that it was probably based on an ancient river flood that wiped out villages and its main significance is as a prefiguring for christian baptism
  there are some things which are totally beyond science and one of those things is the domain of faith ethics for example is not a scientific inquiry and so has historically been dominated by religion
  the catholic church is basically the least religious and most liberal and scientific of churches these days hardly typical they are just equivocating on their traditions in order to not alienate educated people to quickly
  religious faith has never limited itself only to things that are inherently unverifiable
  jesus didnt literally rise from the dead  thats certainly a minority opinion among christians
  metaphor for what
  they are the largest christian denomination and can trace their lineage back to the time of jesus christ im pretty sure the orthodox church believes the same things and they account for another significant section of the christian population im not sure how you could say its not typical when it alone would be the second largest religion on the planet i am not saying religion inherently supports science i am saying they are not inherently in conflict and i think that the biggest religious institutions in the world adapting their interpretation of the sacred texts in the light of science shows that they do not suppress science to fit their dogma
  you cant just cherrypick whichever sect of christianity best fits your argument remember we are talking about religion in general not just liberal forms of christianity are we just gonna sit here and exclude protestants/mormons hindus and muslims
  in the light of science shows that they do not suppress science to fit their dogma  i would definitely say that is a trend of a few modern religious sects trying to stay relevant in a more scientifically literate world but its hardly applicable to religion in general especially historically
  but it can change its claims with regards to things that are verifiable like science    parting the seas is probably some metaphor about baptism but im not that into exegesis there are a number of interpretations some of which are literal others may be moral symbolic or whatever for different parts of the text
  i dont think that all religions embrace science but my claim is that religion specifically christianity here i suppose is not founded on rejecting science it has its own foundation in the bible and uses science to illuminate the meaning contained in that text    how is it cherrypicking i selected the two largest denominations of the largest religious group
science now shout heretical at those who question the scientific dogma same as it ever was control of the masses by thought policing
  science now shout heretical at those who question the scientific dogma  like what
  global warming that an example that should ruffle some feathers the existence of gravity the quantum slit experiment string theory seems pretty dumb like scientists are just coming up with some new magic parallel universes seems like bs but i guess its possible i think sienc and religion should find a way to get along
  the existence of gravity the quantum slit experiment string theory seems pretty dumb like scientists are just coming up with some new magic parallel universes seems like bs but i guess its possible  what does any of this have to do with science now shout heretical at those who question the scientific dogma  i can see it to an extent with global warming but note that evidence is not the same as dogma there are definitely some dogmatic things about global warming being said but that it primarily politicians and activists not scientists saying those things
  going against the status quo will always get you shit on this has never changed
  in true science there is no status quo
  the existence of gravity the quantum slit experiment  what are you saying that we dont have sufficient evidence for gravity and diffraction or
  its not a matter of there being significant evidence its about their being no evidence against science doesnt validate it falsifies
  before the evidence is clear perhaps but once the evidence is there it doesnt matter what people assumed before
  it does both brainlet theory makes predictions which can either be validated or invalidated how is gravity an example of dogma
  agreed but it is the case that we find the guy who was wrong was right all along and religion/science advances while some stay behind with there traditions it is static vs dynamic quality as it has always been
  calling others a brainlet  he still believing the verification principle  lmao
  no argument  nice job demonstrating you dont actually know what youre talking about
  im not arguing that gravity is a dogma you retard
    quit fucking shit up i thought we might get somewhere but then the inevitable happened
  like what dogma  global warmingthe existence of gravity  clarify what you are arguing then
  that wasnt me you fuck
  is intended for  
woah man you guys are all so mad
  still not the anon believe what you want about gravity
  reality is more than just math equations dude math can say nothing of human motivations beauty emotions the will etc      philosophy is a joke and has no place in modern education or our understanding of the world  that in itself is a philosophical statement which needs to be defended with philosophical arguments
  that in itself is a philosophical statement  you can say that about anything philosophy is just a study of pedantic semantics   which needs to be defended with philosophical arguments  you do not need an education in the formal conceptions of modern philosophy to argue things you can surely argue that a lot of things are technically a form of philosophy but this is a separate thing than modern philosophy and philosophy education being a thing that matters
  as a teenager was the main thing that made me an atheist
  what are spirits made of  spirit aka consciousness awareness intelligence  how do they influence the world  through physical vessels   why do they exist  the same reason we exists just cause
sciencetards lack fundamental understanding of abstraction it concerns the understanding of ethics knowledge abstract physics concepts and human preference    it is fundamentally rooted in psychology education politics science and virtually every other discipline in this world the scientific method is built upon philosophical concepts and is the result of philosophy that it is an effective tool for understanding    in other words neglecting the raw power of philosophy makes you an absolute dumbass regardless of your understanding of the sciences
this is ae grade a revisionism
  true cringe at redditors who think science wouldnt exist without them
reddit btfo
  your saying that like religion was just one monolithic static set of mores while there were hundreds of sects with varying levels of fundementalism
  im pretty sure metaphysics is pretty big in philosophy seeing how ethics is at least in part based off of it
  why is galileo on this list when the church disputed his claims and persecuted him for insulting the pope for his stance against heliocentrism
  he was still religious like martin feces theses luther
  ive been to a pentecostal church and your statement is a lie
  based
  alileo was pretty much accepted by the clergy and just told to keep his theories within the abstract field of academia for the time being but he instead went around insulting proponents of geocentrism anyway  thats not exactly what happened they told him to prove it and the pope even told him to write a book to back up his claims the issue was the counter to his arguments in his book were issued by a fictitious learning disabled person called simplicio who often quoted the pope calling the pope a retard in italy is just asking for it desu
  no religion concerns itself with metaphysics and spirituality  except when it doesnt
  agreed   science isnt come magical force opposed the to the magic of god its simply the systems of the world we understand if god exists theres a science to him too we just dont know it and might never
  i agree with this not sure where i fit in the agreement spectrum of the op but very proud to see an anon recognize that it there is a god science should be able to explain it when provided enough data and if there is a god it/he/she will follow laws of physics
  never seen one like you in real life
  meanwhile we just need to act as if god exist as if jesus resurrected as if miracles happened all that while tolerating political meddling and hate mongering by the institutions new and old that base their power on those ifs just accept their authority mate because we might never understand otherwise you are just and edgy fedora
  not the anon but why do we need to act as if god exists i dont get it we can be respectful of other people but are you saying that we should fear them
  facts of evolution   still a loose theory but ok
  evolution is definitely not a loose theory it is a very well understood process
how come his redpills on the grmanoid menace are still ignored after all these decades later its almost like )))they((( dont want you to know the truth    he literally proved that wwi was germanys fault using german documents and showed that germany intended to turn the countries they conquered into vassal states literally the phrase used in the documents subordinate to germany     for some reason its controversial to say that wwi was germanyastriahungerys fault and that the versailles treaty stipulations/reparations were justified responses to goyman villainy
  no one enjoys burgers anglos and frogs being better and youll never lionize them effectively enough to circumvent the instinctive repulsion anyone with taste expresses when imagining what could have been had the germans won either war
4chan is full of illiterate retards who would rather believe in simple liesstab in the back myth than believe that their ancestors did something wrong
  when imagining what could have been had the germans won either war  given that germany controls the eu and how theyve crushed greece beneath their heel i cant see how anyone can look wistfully at what mightve been given that both the kaiserreich and the third reich were far more ferocious than germany today
  wwi was both totally inevitable and completely preventable trying to assign blame is fairly pointless over 100 years later
  no its not because then you learn nothing   ww1 was the fault of german leadership they did everything they could to cause a conflict when the opportunity arose
  if your only interest is in assigning blame youre not going to learn anything either youre ignoring the possibility of rational motivations on the part of imperial germany and the hapsburgs which there were if i were to play the blame game i would largely come to the same conclusion in assigning the majority of it to them as well but i dont find that to be particulalry insightful i suppose its good fodder for shitposts though
  youre right but i believe its important to be honest about history   a lot of germans still harbor these bullshit ideasof course they dont dare say it openly but its obvious   both about ww1 and ww2
  naive historical determinism
  are you trying to establish some kind of witch hunts against them or what  its their fault but wait a minute we need to establish some kind of kangaroo trials to make it convincing and all thatthen well come into conclusion that its really their fault  whats the point
  i agree and like i said im not procentral powers when it comes to this but when you look at the fact that this great war had been being predicted for a generation and what the germans thought it would look like if it were delayed for much longer combined with what happened in sarajevo its easy to understand why they would be the primary aggressors in that situation     idk that im a fullscale determinist but im certainly pretty close once you get to the point of large nation states and extremely complicated economic and geopolitical phenomena it becomes pretty hard to argue against
how can you fully acknowledge the fact that every action you will ever take and every thought you will ever have has been predetermined yet still feel good and bad about the things you do    what are some other cases where pure objectivity is best completely forgotten
  how can you fully acknowledge the fact that every action you will ever take and every thought you will ever have has been predetermined yet still feel good and bad about the things you do    because im predetermined to feel guilt or pleasure when i see the results of my actions    not even taking determinism to its logical conclusion
by cherrypicking shit from various mystic religions and spiritual traditions and slowly becoming mentally ill
  how can the amount that i value my previous life experiences over my innate preferences be measured if my innate preferences for one choice over another are stronger than those that were programmed into me then i have some degree of free will  determinism is only a belief in that tabula rasa is everything
  being born doesnt somehow break the chain of consequence our personality is based on genetic factors and life experiences you cant really claim free will without denying that too
  by acknowledging it but not caring
  our personality is based on genetic factors  how much  how do you know that its not perhaps 45 genetics 45 life and 10 magic
  its actually  10 luck  20 skill  15 concentrated power of will  5 pleasure  50 pain    comes out to 100 reason to remember the name
  thats what im saying only way to disprove determinism is bring out the allmighty omnipotent being or factor which is out of human comprehension which disproves every theory that can possibly exist  the magic cant just change 10 since that would still be not free will the magic would need to create free will on the spot
  to its logical conclusion  all philosophies become retarded when you do this desu
  the argument youre implying is  p1 all your thoughts and actions are predetermined  p2 if theyre predetermined you shouldnt feel good or bad about any of them  c you shouldnt feel good or bad about any of your thoughts or actions  but even if we accept p1 why accept p2   i dont see what positive reason there is in favour of it  and i see some reasons that are actively against it predetermination presumably doesnt mean your thoughts and actions cant be good or bad and presumably you should feel good about them if theyre good and bad if theyre bad
  fact  determinism was falsified in 1925
  please elaborate    this is gonna be good
  only way to disprove determinism is bring out the allmighty omnipotent being or factor which is out of human comprehension   completely untrue theres an indefinite number of arguments against determinism   one is that determinism is incoherent   if everything is determined/necessary then is determinism itself a necessary truth if not determinism is false because at least one truth is not necessary but if it is then why what necessitated determinism it cant be determinism itself because that is incoherently circular but if something else necessitated determinism then that something else could not have been necessitated by determinism again on pain of circularity and therefore that something else could have failed to be necessitated meaning it is not necessarily necessary meaning it is not ultimately necessary the only option left is that nothing necessitated determinism the necessity of determinism is a brute fact but then there is no reason determinism could not have failed to be necessary meaning determinism is contingent not necessary  so determinism is logically impossible
whats your favorite bible story anons    mine is samson i think he was cool too bad he died cuz some roastie made him spill his secret whats yours anon
  mine is when rehoboam is advised to deal with some tax protestors by boasting about the size of his dick
  elijah    tell everyone its not gonna rain anymore  yeah sure crazy old man  stops raining  hide in wilderness eating bugs and chilling by a brook  come out and mock and btfo satan worshippers  run off again and ask god to kill you
  
  woah what a chad     elijah was living the dream
anything without jesus is filler prove me wrong
i like the part in the book of john where jesus chases the jews away
ecclesiastes john and revelation are pure kino
  when jesus move the merchant out of the temple
when christ whips the merchants out of the temple
  what about the old testament     revelations should be made into a movie
  what verses
  1 kings 1210
  when david collected the philistines foreskins so he can marry sauls daughter saul probably told david that in the same way as people uses the idiom when pigs fly but david probably took it too literal
  i always thought of it as one of those  ill send the young prince/hero off on a quest that he cant possibly succeed at and get him killed  sort of things
  the david arc
  abraham kicking the crap out of hammurabis army
that time god killed a guy for pulling out  when onan had sex with tamar he withdrew before his orgasm4 and spilled his seed or semen on the ground since any child born would not legally be considered his heir the next statement in the bible says that onan did evil and that god killed him
  the one that god turns that mans wife into salt who the fuck does that and if it was just that his power is such that if you see it you are suddenly salt  then what the fuck is the logic behind that why salt
  how is this boasting about his dick    whereas my father laid upon you a heavy yoke so shall i add tenfold thereto whereas my father chastised tortured you with whips so shall i chastise you with scorpions for my littlest finger is thicker than my fathers loins and your backs which bent like reeds at my fathers touch shall break like straws at my own touch
  she wuz a salty bihh
  youre dealing with a bad translation look at the actual hebrew     וידברו אליו הילדים אשר גדלו אתו לאמר כהתאמר לעם הזה אשר דברו אליך לאמר אביך הכביד אתעלנו ואתה הקל מעלינו כה תדבר אליהם קטני עבה ממתני אבי    you know what word you dont see אצבע finger    hes not saying my smallest finger is thicker than my fathers loins another bowlderization hes saying my smallness is thicker than my fathers loins ie im bigger than he is when im soft and hes hard he is most definitely boasting about his dick
how come that the old stories in the bible are so relatable and the characters so based what happened that that changed
  jesus took over
be paul  be circumcised  see uncircumcised gentiles  dont throw a tantrum because of some repressed foreskin envy and identity complex  basically just go nah its cool man its the inside that counts  based af how can nonpaulinians ever recover from this
  he caused a lot of christians to die so he learned to chill
  have you read his justification of this in romans 4 its fucking nonsense  13 for the promise to abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith 14 for if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs faith is null and the promise is void 15 for the law brings wrath but where there is no law there is no transgression    16 that is why it depends on faith in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspringnot only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of abraham who is the father of us all 17 as it is written i have made you the father of many nationsin the presence of the god in whom he believed who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist  he interprets where god literally promises to make abraham the father of many nations israelites edomites arabs medianites to the fucking greeks being the metaphorical children of abraham
  cope talmudist no jews nor gentiles
    yeah one really needs to want to believe this its pretty clear paul was just following a jewish agenda and wanted to judaize the gentiles look at things like this    for if the gentiles have shared in the jews spiritual blessings they owe it to the jews to share with them their material blessings  romans 1527        this is your brain on christcuckoldry needs to repeal your supposed jewish theological opponents because you are the true jews amirite
he killed millions
to save billions
to destroy britbongs
  yeah but he looked good doing it
  to destroy krauts     fixed
  haha what a faggot
  fuck i love his stockings 3
    totally worth it imo
  to conquer alsace
  he did the lords work
  as do we all
  to build a nice house
  brits werent involved in the 30 years war     this is correct he killed germans    tough to tell as it gave prussia the power to form he killed a bunch of germans though which took a while to recover so it could be argued that he delayed it
  30 years war  louis da 14    u wot mate
another worthless francoid intent on devastating europe and causing millions of deaths because of delusions of grandeur thankfully a great englishman stood in his path and protected all europa with skill and grace
  huh but prince eugene was from austria
  its a known fact that 3 years old louis the 14 bathed in german blood his first sentence in fact was starve the krauts european war now
what does this board believe is there a grand narrative in history    does each civilization have its own unique history that operates in parallel with other civilizations generationbygeneration with each ultimately experiencing a rise and decline as spengler or toynbee claim    is the progress of different civilization dependent on the resources and geography that they find themselves in as guns germs and steel claim    is history a march forward of economic systems whose relations of production determine the culture religion and society of the epochs of the economic system    is there some other grand narrative that synthesizes history to tell us how it works or is /his/ a postmodern board that accepts that each civilization is entirely unique with its own systems of thought that dont allow us to connect them in any fundamental way
  guns germs and steel  a literal meme book
no there is no grand narrative to history every discovered narrative is posthappening rationalization cyclic nature of history is one that seems more solid metanarrative than others because we can see rise and fall and restart of nations/empires/civillisations again anda gain restart is only prevented should entire civilization be wiped out china and india as massively populated nearimpossible to wipe out completely are excellent cases for cyclicity its just that rise fall rise fall rise fall rise fall over and over again
  ive drank a bit tonight and i cant be bothered to recap the reading list i have for you so here go read for yourself    arnold j toynbee  a study of history  originally 12 volumes has been abridged into 2  good starting point for metahistory introduces some core principles and backs them up with real world examples  doesnt make any particularly bold claims it cant substantiate    oswald spengler  the decline of the west  man and technics  prussian socialism and other essays  the hour of decision  i havent read this one so i dont know much about it  spengler had a different view of the development of cultures and civilizations than the other authors on this list whereas the others on this list viewed the petrification and deterioration of a culture as resulting from the loss of élan or creative power of the ruling minority spengler didnt focus so much on strata within a culture as between cultures and subcultures  and had an organic view of the development of cultures very much informed by goethe he made a lot of claims about the qualities of different cultures that you could see as harder to substantiate than toynbees work comparing the two spengler is typically more continental less rational    julius evola  revolt against the modern world  maybe some of his other works if youre interested not hugely important to what youre asking here  evola is going off the deep end hed make a lot of bold unsubstantiated assertions and didnt care at all for any material empiricism  having said that its interesting to see how much of his thought lines up with that of toynbee essentially describing the same phenomena but seeing completely polar opposite underpinnings to them    theres other stuff like the pamphlet the fate of empires and search for survival by sir john bagot glubb but honestly its really cursory basic as fuck compared to the aforementioned works
dialectical materialism
  fuck me sideways i didnt even bother reading the op before dropping my recs and you literally namedropped spengler and toynbee  far out man im gonna fuck off for another beer
  so where does the cyclic theory of history fall short of being a truly accurate descriptor for history why cant we apply it as a narrative for our civilization and imagine what will happen to our civilization on the basis of that    toynbee and spengler both present some solid analyses in the duration of different civilization and the characteristics that exemplify the downfalls of those civilizations while we can argue over whether donald trump is the caesar of the west for example we could probably figure it out eventually i mean the fact that the civilizations they look at which seem to be all civilizations last a similar amount of time and show similar patterns at different stages seems like decent evidence that history requires for whatever reason these time lengths and patterns in civilizations    or is it all posthoc justification and we could equally have found caesars at every stage of civilization and great founding fathers at every stage etc
once upon a time in some out of the way corner of that universe which is dispersed into numberless twinkling solar systems there was a star upon which clever beasts invented knowing that was the most arrogant and mendacious minute of world history but nevertheless it was only a minute after nature had drawn a few breaths the star cooled and congealed and the clever beasts had to die    one might invent such a fable and yet he still would not have adequately illustrated how miserable how shadowy and transient how aimless and arbitrary the human intellect looks within nature there were eternities during which it did not exist and when it is all over with the human intellect nothing will have happened for this intellect has no additional mission which would lead it beyond human life rather it is human and only its possessor and begetter takes it so solemnly  as though the worlds axis turned within it but if we could communicate with a gnat we would learn that he likewise flies through the air with the same solemnity that he feels the flying center of the universe within himself there is nothing so reprehensible and unimportant in nature that it would not immediately swell up like a balloon at the slightest puff of this power of knowing and just as every porter wants to have an admirer so even the proudest of men the philosopher supposes that he sees on all sides the eyes of the universe telescopically focused upon his action and thought
  would you mind elaborating why also im not too brushed up on dialectics so what elaborating on how dialectical materialism explains history beyond obviously just making it all a product of class conflict
  what i would say is that toynbee and evola werent actually all that fatalistic  they based their assertions on retrospective observations and drew conclusions as to say if a culture develops in such a way the result will be such and such  if thats the operative word there was a lot of room for indeterminism and for things to not quite fit  toynbee and evolas view was that a culture deteriorates with the loss of creative power élan or some spirituality there was no inherent expectation that they had to lose those qualities in fact toynbee writing after wwi even held out in hope that we would be able to be the civilization to take the next step and make the next breakthrough in a direction that prior civilizations have become abortive and failed to reach  spengler on the other had a reputation for being a bit more fatalistic in fact glubb also presupposed in his amateurish way that each culture or civilization has a life cycle underpinned by some generational progression of time  i would say this latter view is a bit less realistic
  yeah ive read a bit of toynbee and thought he was super interesting was wondering what other people thought of him or where he fell short in addition to the other theories i presented and any others i may not have known
  white pride world wide  cringe
  where he fell short  if only it were fresh in my mind i vaguely remember seeing a few minor but untenable leaps in logic in his work  on the whole though the stuff ive remembered of his which has stuck are those principles that seem to hold quite a bit of veracity to them
  history is the story of people on the planet coping with their situation  as history progresses these people are more involved with each other and cope better
  so where does the cyclic theory of history fall short of being a truly accurate descriptor for history  you cant make predictions off it so its not valid just like none of the other narratives can merit of cyclic history is just that its based on observation that holds true more often than not but unmerit is that its commonsense obvious when things go to shitters they tend to get better some day    or is it all posthoc justification and we could equally have found caesars at every stage of civilization and great founding fathers at every stage etc  yes just like all historical narratives     asimovs foundation series was based on premise of so accurate historical analysis that it could be used to predict precise future events with few hours accuracy thousands of years forward sciencegrade history
  i mean toynbee does make a few generalizations across civilizations maybe not fatalistically but he does seem somewhat of a determinist he presents certain characteristics and roles associated with groups across history internal and external proletariat marchmen warbands etc and presents some states of affairs supposedly common across all civilizations like the universal state a central religion and whatnot although i guess he does recognize some deviations in the abortive civilizations so maybe im reading him too much in the light of spengler
  in my opinion great man history is more of an interesting narrative as opposed to a significant one  even truly great men are merely catalysts for naturally ocurring events they slightly alter outcome but they arent a significant driving force  contrary to what many romanticists would have you believe complex institutions and systems account for the most of the march of history  specifically trade people do better cooperating and the most beneficial cooperation is trade
  i mean many of the cyclic guys point to certain signs of the decline of a civilization so maybe you cant recognize it at the beginning but 50 years in you could probably make a prediction that your civilization is about to be over no although i guess this is pretty commonsense too    asimovs foundation series was based on premise of so accurate historical analysis that it could be used to predict precise future events with few hours accuracy thousands of years forward sciencegrade history    oh a man can dream
  i think every civilization has a chance at one golden age and after that is over they cant get it back as far as i know there never has been a civilization that had more than one golden age
i think governments and authorities become overconfident over time and that is what causes the demise were seeing it now with government spending and debt levels its unsustainable and it keeps growing and what is the solution theyre proposing to double down and go to negative interest rates
  you could argue that great men themselves are often catalyzed or determined by naturally occurring events too products of their time caesar was almost bound to happen even if it wasnt caesar the roman republic probably would have collapsed because of a military general launching a coop    bonaparte kind of functions similarly too methinks
  the romans kind of has a couple golden ages under the republic when they beat carthage under augustus and under the five good emperors
    china and india probably had a few ages that could be characterized as golden as well
    i still believe that certain social cultural and environmental decisions tend to precede certain developments  i dont agree that a caesar could appear at any point in a cultures development the motives behind caesar the social climate which both necessitated and enabled his career required prerequisites which simply werent there during the first generations following the founding of rome it took time and a certain sequence of developments to bring about the conditions which enabled a man like caesar to do what he did    however and as per toynbee he maintained that cultures have tended to develop only so far before hitting a ceiling because they subsequently fail to produce peoples who can repeatedly meet the challenges they are faced with creatively yet the biggest leaps in human development are those exceptions where this has happened and when a given social or environmental challenge is first successfully met
  my view is simply that if a given culture manages to repeatedly successfully rise to new challenges that face it then it will always be identifiable as having this coherent continuity which connects it through each successive challenge the only real issue is that successful answers to challenge can only ever prolong a culture not reverse the movement to return to a previous age simply because that previous age did not arise out of the conditions that have subsequently become apparent to imagine we could go back to the social structure of the 18th century for example having grown up and lived with the products of industrialisation and the age of information isnt feasible simply because the social structure of the 18th century did not arise out of the conditions now present  when a culture fails to meet a challenge and further deteriorates it will deteriorate to a point where to reach a new golden age a people will have to return a creative solution to the challenges theyre faced with on such a momentous scale as to break continuity this again feeds into the ideas of spengler spengler saw cultures as characterised by a prime symbol in response to a fear of death you could draw parallels with spenglers prime symbol and toynbees creative solution to a challenge facing a budding culture
  is there anything that determines when that ceiling is hit or is it just a matter of time before eventually there is no one left who can really solve the problems society faces creatively
  the thing is china is easily identifiable geographically was historically fairly isolated from other cultures its easier for them to retrospectively view a continuity through their various ages but i think that is as untenable as northern europeans claiming continuity from the grecoromans it should be blatantly obvious that the continuity isnt there  look at how different our cultures were likewise in china its easy to imagine that perhaps the qin dynasty or the tang dynasty were all periods in a single unbroken history of one nation with multiple golden ages but each of those golden ages was defined by very different principles based on different responses to different challenges  and the life and culture in each of these dynasties would have been markedly different
  yeah that makes sense im pretty sure toynbee actually makes the distinction between a few different chinese and indian civilization in the same way he distinguishes the west from the hellenic civilization im not sure spengler is as careful
  based trips has spoken
  is there anything that determines when that ceiling is hit  not as far as my understanding of toynbee is concerned  i think theres this its essentially fermis great filter  thats essentially what toynbee was describing just in more narrow cultural terms  that the development of life and of culture and technology is an uphill almost sisyphian struggle and that one can expect that most of the time a peoples or a lifeform will fail to progress but that every now and then environmental conditions align to create an opportune moment for the next great leap  if that makes sense  so the ceiling is essentially the default    im pretty sure toynbee actually makes the distinction between a few different chinese and indian civilization in the same way he distinguishes the west from the hellenic civilization im not sure spengler is as careful  spengler was absolutely adamant that the renaissance neoclassicism all of that was a daydream that the faustian culture had of its erstwhile aspirations to the greatness of the hellenic civilization which preceded it i think he may have even gone as far as to point to it as one of his examples of pseudomorphosis of a culture trying to adopt something inherently foreign to it  so yes he was careful enough to make that distinction  however im not exactly sure he had the same care when distinguishing between the characters of different cultures in the near/middle east im still a bit fluffy on the extent of his magian cultural term
  i fucked up my reply to you here  
  foundation psychohistory is fictional gold standard right now we have two main narratives going on in west  mythical march of progress and right side of history narrative  mythical cyclical view of history narrative    error in both is assumption that they just kinda happen in sad effort to shoehorn them into some kind of constant law of history in vanity effort to lift history up there with natural sciences which have laws of nature in reality you can actually name names of who is causing events and could easily shoot the fuckers to end either or both narratives iran and china for two examples ended narrative one like that you cant shoot hard atomic force forever from all of universe like that at best this narrative bullshit is counterproductive
  im not sure i understand who could you shoot to fundamentally change the course of say chinese or roman history
  okay that makes sense    should have been more clear i meant that he doesnt seem to distinguish different chinese civilizations from one another to the same degree as toynbee likewise for the different indian civilizations
  then learn to read
  spengler was very much focused on europe eurocentric as theyd say nowadays  and within that he was one of many writers of his time who were invested in the underlying cultural differences between the germans and the english and which would win out for the latter development of faustian civilization  less than a decade after his death that question was conclusively answered in favour of the english way of thinking    as well as spenglers preußentum und sozialismus theres werner sombarts händler und helden and johann plenges 1789 und 1914
  i see thanks anon
bump
was the sun kings reign beneficial or detrimental to france he improved infrastructure and the economy i guess but he established an absolute monarchy and depleted the treasury waging long wars with little territorial gain
a few months ago i was reading an article that was talking about how europeans inherited light skin 7000 years ago and somehow the cheddar man who is 9000 years old was a very dark complexioned man today i have stumbled around a facial reconstruction of a 9000 year old greek female this facial reconstruction depicts her as light skin does this contradict scientists seems like a paradox to me
  reminder that the cheddar man never was proven to be dark skinned he just lacked the gene that makes skin white
  you got them anon science is disproven now
the facial reconstruction is going off her bone structure so how the heck would they know what her actual complexion was it is just some random colour they thought appropriate to use  also looks like one of the freaking simpsons thats not a human complexion
    this allowed him to flesh out avgis face muscle by muscle while some of her features are based on skull measurements others like skin and eye color are inferred based on general population traits in the region
     aye i was about to say that
even the features themselves arent much better than an educated guess
  a finding and reconstruction made by scientists disproves scientists  whats with brainlets referring to the scientists or the science as some kind of band or monolithic entities
why are they so warmongering and genocidal is it genes or culture
just islander things
  everyone is like that its just that some people have less opportunity to act like that than others    to prove you that it has nothing to do with culture or genetics i suggest you go to saint helena saint helena is a paradise with almost 0 murders according to the nso
  anglos are most scummy people in the world
    he types in english
  explain how saint helena is the most peaceful place on heart then faggot
prove stalin was bad without using logical fallacies    hard mode you are not allowed to use fiction novels solzhenitsyns writings as a source    hell mode prove stalin was bad without using cold war era propaganda as your primary source
  cringe thread  bad for who lol  get a girlfriend/ lose virginity
  prove stalin was bad without using cold war era propaganda as your primary source  okay      but little is known about the concentration camps  where conditions are so gruesome as to be almost unbelievable  many people find it difficult to realize that this state  of affairs can exist in the twentieth century

  the irony is you dont realize who is actually projecting crimes onto whom protip youve been trained from birth not to accept the obvious conclusion here
  he killed people in situations where the people did not need to be killed

    solar general  the most controversial censored and forbidden web site in the world    other articles  a history of jewish disinformation and deception  why zog hates privacy and hates encryption  the racial war of black against white

  should have said prove stalin was bad without using cold war era propaganda or neo nazi fringe conspiracy websites as your primary source
  do you even believe in objective morality if so which i highly doubt please specify which system of normative ethics you use to define bad
gulags  numerous political and military purges  show trials  forcing collectivization of farms that exacerbated a famine  invading multiple peaceful sovereign nations  using your military postwwii to create puppetsatellite nations in eastern europe rather than letting those peoples decide their own fates  murder of foreign intelligentsia katyn as a prominent example of this  inhumane treatment of pows   deportation of millions of germans westwards  deportation of crimean tatars  mass lootings and rapes committed by red army often overlooked by authorities responsible for overseeing such crimes
  gulags  rehabilitative system of labor camps which prohibited solitary confinement allowed inmates to live with their spouses and granted inmates the right to complete university level education during their sentence the maximum jail sentence was 10 years as it was considered inhumane to jail someone for longer than that    numerous political and military purges  do you honestly think nobody in the government or army had any plans to overthrow stalin and install themselves all the top bolsheviks were very driven and ambitious people all of them wanted the top position and the ability to implement their vision of socialism    forcing collectivization of farms that exacerbated a famine  collectivization was necessary because individual small farms were not producing enough to feed the growing population mistakes made by activists on the ground did exacerbate the famine but without collectivization the ussr would have never been able to produce enough food to feed its people ensuring even more famine in the future    invading multiple peaceful sovereign nations  give an example    using your military postwwii to create puppetsatellite nations in eastern europe rather than letting those peoples decide their own fates  there were free elections and left/socialist/communists won in most of them eastern europe only lost its sovereignty later on under khrushchev    murder of foreign intelligentsia katyn as a prominent example of this  its possible katyn was a nazi false flag as grover furr concludes on the basis of his research but even if it wasnt most of the polish elite killed there were ferociously rightwing and anticommunist they would have resisted by any means necessary any social reforms in poland     inhumane treatment of pows   far more humane than german treatment of soviets or allied treatment of germans give an example of the inhumanity
  cont    deportation of millions of germans westwards  how is this a bad thing the poles and czechs were very glad to see them gone     deportation of crimean tatars  a disproportionate number of crimean tatars joined the nazis in addition to preventing guerilla warfare against the state the deportations saved the tatars from retribution by angry ukrainians russians and others    mass lootings and rapes committed by red army often overlooked by authorities responsible for overseeing such crimes  hard to feel sympathy for german civilians considering the vast majority of them supported hitlers war of aggression against the rest of the world which killed tens of millions regardless red army atrocities in germany pale in comparison to what the germans did in the ussr
  sucking stalins dick this hard  inb4 thats not evidence   clearly you made this thread with no intention to take anything suggested seriously
  about as distorted a response i expected from a tankie
    not an argument also logical fallacy you havent disproved anything in that post
  make post mocking tankie while pointing out that the statement has no evidence  tankie still responds in anger at muh logical fallacy  fucking kek
  since the thread is titled prove stalin was bad the onus is on antistalinists to provide evidence and sources not the op
  neo nazi  you mean nazi it was written in 1937 using primary source evidence why are you arguing against the site and not the source itself if you bothered to read the first three pages you wouldve gotten to the part where it discusses substance but instead youll defend soviet atrocities because you think youre defending projewish biaswhich itself outs you as a radical disinformation agent
  prove stalin was bad  stalin proved stalin was bad the challenge is flawed from the inception by means of framing
  i laughed harder than i should have at this
  except most people outside the wst have very positive views about stalin especially in georgia and other former soviet states    
  hitler outlined his plans to invade the ussr in mein kampf published in the 20s everything published by the nazi government was an attempt to justify that invasion makes about as much sense to take them at their word as it is to believe g bush about iraq
  he wasnt killed more leftists than the fascists did also more fascists than the westcucks did make russia a superpower and stuck it to the jew     verdict based
  he was so evil and paranoid that people were scared shitless to walk into his room after he died incase he was alive and they would disturb him    he said himself after his wife died that the last love in his heart died aswell    didnt he like personally write down close to 100000 names on his kill list    gulags    political opposition sent to gulag    around 5 million soviets starved to death
  hard to feel sympathy for german civilians considering the vast majority of them supported hitlers war of aggression against the rest of the world which killed tens of millions regardless red army atrocities in germany pale in comparison to what the germans did in the ussr  ah yes compounding the problem by doing the same thing they did to you
  he was so evil and paranoid that people were scared shitless to walk into his room after he died incase he was alive and they would disturb him  only source for this claim is khrshchev who is proven to have been a liar by grover furrs research    he said himself after his wife died that the last love in his heart died aswell  losing someone you love very much makes it hard to love thats true doesnt make you a bad person    gulags  see     political opposition sent to gulag  whats bad about this    around 5 million soviets starved to death  real number is around 12 million would have been 10 million without collectivization
  peasants from starvation  maybe trotsky
  trotsky would have killed stalin if he came to power
  bukharin   zinoviev   kamenev  radek
prove stalin was good without stalinist propaganda
  stalin is loved by the vast majority of people who either lived under stalin or are the descendants of people who lived under stalin      bukharin  preferred investing in light industry over heavy industry which would have left the ussr defenseless against invasion allied with trotsky zinoviev and kamenev against stalin    zinoviev  allied with trotsky helped to assassinated kirov    kamenev  see above    radek  see above
  they love him because his public image was cultivated to be a father of the nation saviour like figure in other words propaganda
  i heard he was a poof
  with that logic then mussolini did nothing wrong either since we still have people in italy who love him
  a small minority in italy like mussolini a very large majority in the former ussr like stalin and a very large majority of chinese like mao
  assassinated kirov  epic
  a very large majority  sauce
  the mods will not delete this but they will delete this thread         it seems that the mods are communists and biased hopefully my thread was archived on desuarchive and i have the proof that they deleted it by pure procommunist bias how is talking about historical opinions from historical figures of communism while making references to historical events offtopic on a history board it isnt and the mods are the one who should be banned for their bias and undiscipline
  all of these people were guilty of the crimes for which they were convicted and this was commonly accepted by western observers until 1956
  guilty of being opposition to stalins dictatorship  with that kind of logic republican party should kill all democrats and vice versa
  invading multiple peaceful sovereign nations     georgia  china  finland  poland    inb4 somehow all those nations were the aggressors
  pland  threatens to invade lithuania  peaceful  invades czechoslovakia
  no shots fired  somehow not peaceful  not threatening you or your allies  somehow the aggressor
  theres no evidence that stalin was a dictator though the soviet union was by all measures a democracy until the khrushchevite military coup
  well still waiting for that sauce
was the 1960 election stolen from nixon
why would you think that
  he got old and lost his youthful charisma
  yes he didnt challenge it as he knew it was a waste of time and it would have hindered his chances when he ran again he didnt want the sore loser cloud hanging over him    and he came back and he won
  and then the democratic congress got rid of him
  nixon rose from a dirt poor back ground he got where he was through hard work not nepotism like kennedy  co    he was a hero we didnt deserve and so they hated him

why is chinese history so boring and uninteresting
why is european history so boring and uninteresting
  do you really think god likes it when you lie anon
  why is history in quotations its still real history even if its boring     inb4 newfag
tell me good books about yuan china
  read books by david m robinson morris rosabi frederick w mote cambridge history
  what makes it boring anon is it the gratuitous amounts of back stabbing or coup detat was it the summerautumn wars warring states era or even the warlord era perhaps defending against the northern tribes mongols japanese and even the europeans that made it boring tell us anon what makes it boring so we can understand you
  the names and how repetitive it is  there was famine so bing chong revolted  20 million died  its all the same and the numbers are all inflated
  t man who has never read chinese history
  cause it got overshadowed by western history
  its just lazy bait like see    he doesnt know shit but does wish others were as ignorant and miserable as he is
  compared to european names everyone is a louis or a charles also its pretty repetitive too  monarch is mad and goes to war over religon  half of europe joins one monarch and half the other
  power struggles between nations isnt the same as revolts
  where
  its not the same but jeez european history gets repetitive its just sooo boring anon
  its only boring if youre a brainlet chink history on the otherhand is fucking dry
  not memeing most of medival european history actually is incredibly boring until around the 1200s crusades are aight i guess
  actually being too stupid to put out even halfway decent bait  i feel bad for your parents
  warlord fong hongzhang rebels against the lang dynasty over an increase in taces causing the binting rebellion this results in millions of deaths and while the lang dynasty remains in power they were severely weakened which led to the rise of the bong dynasty   every chinese history event ever
  the opium wars
    i think what is interesting is entirely subjective if you want to read about a massive country so big that it dominated all of its neighbours for almost all of its history and how it was able to do so and manage itself internally chinese history may be for you  if you want maps constantly changing and a bunch of people clamoring for territory european history may be more up your alley  im not saying that these are necessarily 100 true just trying to point out that different interests will lead to different histories being interesting i dont think you could objectively say that any history is objectively boring which is why there are historians for every period of every country
  idk desu i admit that the chinese have a great culture or at least one worthy of some degree of admiration that said i could appreciate that great culture more if their names were more memorable   tang of shang zi lü 子湯 16001300 bce tiān yǐ 天乙 tàizu 太祖  bu bing zi shèng 子勝 wài bǐng 外丙   zhong ren zi yōng 子庸 zhòng rén 仲壬   tai jia zi zhì 子至 tài jiǎ 太甲 tàizōng 太宗  wo ding zi xuàn 子絢 wò dīng 沃丁   tai geng zi biàn 子辯 tài gēng 太庚   xiao jia zi gāo 子高 xiǎo jiǎ 小甲   yong ji zi zhòu 子伷 yōng jǐ 雍己   tai wu zi mì 子密 tài wù 太戊   zhong ding zi zhuāng 子莊 zhòng dīng 仲丁   wai ren zi fā 子發 wài rén 外壬   he dan jia zi zhěng 子整 jiān jiǎ 戔甲   zu yi zi téng 子滕 zǔ yǐ 祖乙 zhōngzōng 中宗  zu xin zi dàn 子旦 zǔ xīn 祖辛   wo jia zi yú 子踰 wò jiǎ 沃甲   zu ding zi xīn 子新 zǔ dīng 祖丁   nan geng    bu bing nan geng zu ding wo jia wai ren from a nonchinese perspective they are monotonously disyllabic   vs roman emperor names  augustus otho galba vespasian tiberius titus domitian     that being said i admit that names alone being an entry barrier is a very brainlet but the names are hoenstly very alien sometimes
the late qing dynasty to the cultural revolution is genuinely interesting before that is fucking boring as fuck
  yeah i imagine thats a language barrier more than anything though  from a western perspective sure the structure seems dull but if youre chinese and thats the same structure as everyones name its probably no duller than european names if you study history or the chinese language it gets a bit less dull
  nah qing conquest of china is kino
  ming officials literally letting machu fucks in  nah
  shit took nearly an entire century it was more than just that
  most of the fighting after 1650 took place along the literal edges of the china along the fujian coast the guangdong coastal cities yunnan gansu for decades the fighting was limited along the borders and southern provinces in a northern city like taiyuan there would be barely any fighting for the entire century
  i still think its pretty kino desu was interesting to see them put down lasting roots i will admit i am massively biased b/c i find the qing dynasty to be super interesting
  gaius julius caesar augustus germanicus  tiberius claudius caesar augustus germanicus  nero claudius caesar augustus germanicus  servius sulpicius galba caesar augustus  marcus salvius otho caesar augustus  aulus vitellius germanicus augustus  aulus histrius sclavonicus augustus  titus flavius vespasianus  titus flavius caesar vespasianus augustus  titus flavius caesar domitianus augustus  marcus cocceius nerva caesar augustus  imperator caesar nerva traianus divi nervae filius augustus  titus aelius hadrianus antoninus augustus pius  now without cheating which of these emperors is made up
  caesar augustus germanicus  fake the real caesar wasnt necessarily emperor either depending on your pov im pretty sure that he wasnt given the title augustus either considering that was his adopted son octavian   tiberius claudius  i know tiberius and claudius were related to each other i know there were campaigns in germania by tiberius relative  was germanicus his brother  for which he received the honorific germanicus so that seems correct  nero  seems about right  otho   correct  galba  correct  vitellius  hard to say there was definitely an emperor vitellius but i dont recall his family name emperor vitellius exists  the vitellius whose name you wrote down idk  sclavonicus  definitely fake  titus vespasianus  definitely real but idk why caesar is coming before vespasian i thought caesar augustus was a title always placed after the 3 names is this the original titus who i think was father of vespasian granddad of domitian im going to say real  vespasianus augustus  son of titus real   domitian  domitian is definitely real but again im not sure if the caesar augustus is properly placed  nerva  sounds correct and nerva definitely existed  trajan  soudns correct he was the adopted son of nerva iirc so that also checks out  antoninus pius  the ordering of the various titles and names is also confusing and im not sure what his family name was but i would have to say that this is correct
  this has happened about twice    roman history would be a better comparison
  i dont think that it is at all look at something like the chinese civil war from 19461949 the nationalists had an army of over 3 million men and billions of dollars in military aid from the us yet they lost to the communists who had less than 1 million soldiers almost half of which were irregulars no benefactor anywhere near comparable to the us no navy no air force no modern logistics network and didnt control a single major city yet despite all the odds the communists were able to not merely survive off in the hills somewhere but conquer the entire country    does that not make you want to know how that could have happened
  motes imperial china has a very good section on it
  mao was on the jewish bankroll stupid
  chinkshill  is unoriginal  what a surprise
  what
  because youre shitposting/baiting again also probably because youre an ignorant antichinese shill or sexualfluid whitoid supremacist who is paranoid about china topple down your imaginary supremacy hence you have to chimp out 24/7 against chinese as compensation this shitholes is filled with your kinds

be german  bomb london  get bombed in return  fucking perfidious anglo you why are you so jewish  
  this is why germans and nords never won wars they cant think ahead and have an inability to consider consequences
  bomb london a few times on accident mainly targetting military offices  your entire civilian population is roasted alive day and night for 4 years  revisionists will claim this isnt a war crime
  birmingham liverpool manchester nottingham were bombed by accident too right
  were not denying war crimes committed against the axis were celebrating them
  they were at war anon all those cities contained magor command and control centers for the allied militaries    meanwhile a city like dresden only had its residential sectors targetted by firebombs
  why do germans never think about the consequences of war theyre stuck in this teenage boys fantasy where its all badass and youre gonna be like rambo and get tons of puss afterwards  or they understand war in a strategy game mentality like youre playing risk or civilization and you need to tactically outthink your opponent  but they dont stop to think what its really going to be like even when they were taught they had to be taught twice
  thats revisionist bullshit dresden was an important railroad junction for both northsouth and eastwest rail routes as well as a miltiray industrial center
  in total war there are no civilians
  on accident  why fucking retarded are this
  die in a fire faggot
  your post makes no sense and yet i completely understood it
  and yet according to david irvings book the destruction of dresden the rail marshaling yards were only attacked by 40 american bombers and receiverd minimal damage that was repaired while the rest of the hundreds of anglo bombers targetted housing
  and yet according to david irvings book
  just like people in dresden did lmao
    be german master race   bomb civilians in poland spain england and netherlands  you get a taste of your own medicine  scream war crimes and that all the dead civilians your bombs killed were accidents
  nice argument
  this start shit get hit
  irvings reputation as a historian was discreditednote 2 when in the course of an unsuccessful libel case he filed against the american historian deborah lipstadt and penguin books he was shown to have deliberately misrepresented historical evidence to promote holocaust denialnote 3 the english court found that irving was an active holocaust denier antisemite and racist5 who for his own ideological reasons persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence56 in addition the court found that irvings books had distorted the history of hitlers role in the holocaust to depict hitler in a favourable light
  doesnt this assume egalitarianism a priori
  and yet according to david irvings book  yikes    irving was ripped a new hole by richard evans irving lied in his entire book and the court found irving to be a liar and an anti semite
  use airpower to prove muh superior german war machine  purposely target innocent civilians in the invasion of poland  get assblasted when muh muttmericans turn your 1000 year riech into rubble from the air
  david irving  k  lmao
coventry was devastated by firebombing in november 1940 the germans described any city they fucked up as coventrated like how the brits used the term blitzkrieg in a similar way
  england was the first to target civilians as you probably know you dishonest liar
  so they incinerated the living fuck out of it like ten times over for good measure
  how many civilian casualties in london
  please explain how britain targeted civilians before they entered the war because gemrany literally opened up their attack on poland with civilian bombings    bonus question are you yourself a deliberate liar or just massively ignorant
  88  germany just started a geopolitical war that had specific goals that doesnt mean they started targeting civilians just for the heck of it
hamburg was the center of german uboat manufacturingit commissioned the highest number of boats with 393 more than any other town with a uboat shipyard in germany    
  germany actually targeted civilians first in spain poland took the worst of it though as german pilots were targeting refugees and any fort or city that the retreating polish army would pass   as for that other guy 5 he will say england started bombing civilians and will ignore that england avoided any target that might inflict civilian casualties until germany started bombing english civilians in accidents
  
  dont cut yourself on that edge kiddo
the anglos did that first
  on accident  hahahaha
  the very first bomb dropped was from one lone luftwaffe pilot who accidently bombed london churchill used this as an excuse to bomb berlin which then both the germans and english started bombing each others cities
  do you think one bomb was dropped on london before berlin was bombed are you fucking ignorant
  i wasnt counting spain because that was in a separate war than ww2 proper otherwise youd have him claiming it started with the bombings in ww1 blah de blah
so how does it feel to get absolutely btfod
  
  how did strafing evacuating civilians serve these specific geopolitical goals to cause chaos and confusion
  it was totally an accident guise  so did spain poland and the netherlands escalate german bombings as well  did england start targeting german cities or was it the opposite  do you people not always claim that it was churchill that was a warmonger not brits so why kill brits to the point where youre willing to lose the war to kill them  did you ever consider the possibility that they were testing the water defences like they did a million times before
  andrew roberts  totally unbiased source
    when you have no evidence and just talk out of your ass
  at least a lot of normies died
  wow so edgy    you cant be even 56 you are probably in the 1 digit zone     does it hurt to breathe for you
  but german crimes against humanity are ok right
  no
  spain poland and netherlands are well documented you waste of space
  its jewish propaganda you cuck
  it triggered the lefties epic style
  be op  pretend to be retarded  get treated like a retard  wtf guys im not retarded pls
  outing yourself as a brainlet this early    back to your containment board
    read that
  daily reminder that germany targeted civilians centers during both world wars just to cause terror krautoids in their destructive autism even built several massive cannons which sole objective was to shell paris and cause civilian deaths  germans are the kind of people who can sabotage their own war effort by taking resources away from it just to murder more innocent people how people are still defending their deeds after all these years is beyond me
  according to david irving
  in conclusion both guys are bad
be a brit  establish world spanning empire  get butthurt when japan and italy does the same thing
  get butthurt britain responds when italy and japan seek to accomplish this goal through wanton destruction of commonwealth citizens and property and in the nips case genocide    why are /pol/ such pussies
  and yet according to david irvings book

    japan and italy declared war on britain numbnuts
if germany desperately needed oil during ww2 why didnt they get it from frances african territories
  shipping it across the mediterranean how exactly    now stop posting ww2 threads
  if germany needed massive quick access to a resource why didnt they just spend a few years building oil wells and refineries
  wouldnt they have had to do the same with the oil in eastern europe
blocks you path  what do /his/
that outfit is fly as hell i tried to find a picture of franz ferdinand wearing his ancestral armour to contribute to the thread but i could not find it
show him this
challenge him to a duell
  why would you show him a pic of a dead mongoloid

  you could even say hes a big guy
      
  for you
  wut
  i kiss him he is handsome
  some claimed that he was a homosexual there was also rumor that he and his wife took a vow of celibacy and lived like brother and sister
does /his/ belief in afterlife or anything at all after death
no because i do not want to delude myself
i believe that atheists are fucking retarded because they think something can come from nothing for no reason they just say big bang or i believe in science truth is my religion since they deny the afterlife i shall put my faith in it
yeah its what you leave behind as your actions are concrete in the spatiotemporal record and these impactdifferences extrapolate on continuebeyond
theres no way to know and i dont understand why people care youll find out or not when you die
  pretty sure reincarnation is legit    die  ego and conscientiousness dies  you reassemble with the oneness of the universe like a rock or the sun  the ego had always separated you  all those billions of consciousnesses are apart of the oneness of the universe  become conscious again but lose the oneness of the universe in its entirety because the egos perception is limited to one body  cycle continues
  meaning and reason is a byproduct of human existence it is entirely synthetic in my belief   ha it ever crossed your mind that we were the gods of this plane of existence all along   for what is god without his creations
i didnt but now im a zurvanite
  i dont there just isnt any evidence to suggest that such a thing is true
  for what is god without his creations  god

why did europeans enslave south east asians or native americans why was it only blacks
  native americans  they did this is pretty common known    south east asians  japs already owned and sold
  south east asians  hard to get and the pope banned it early into the colonial era   but we did get some that mostly went to europe  t portugoose
  why did europeans enslave south east asians or native americans    but they did     they didnt tend to bring sea slaves to america and native slaves didnt last too long as they lacked immunity to european diseases
  those are transsexuals
  we enslaved some nips too the pope didnt like it and some shogun banned it because it was disgracing and was getting out of hand or something along these lines
  europeans didnt enslave africans they bought allready enslaved africans from other africans    as to why they didnt enslave asians wel if you try to enslave people who are subjects of the chinese emperor what do you think the emperor will do
  lacked immunity to european diseases  wasnt there a document somewhere that says spaniards also got infected with diseases in sea
  or native americans    i dont know about asia but when the spaniards discovered america the queen of spain forbade everyone to enslave indians  her grandson who was also king of spain even stop the conquista until the moral delimas were solved     after that every king of spain followed the same path and enslavement of indians was forbidden forever since then     i do not know about england
1000 eoy
  for a good while the portunuggers enslaved japs off of christian lords the women were often used as sex slaves on ships often as the slaves of slaves iberians are the most degenerate people on earth and if it exists theyve enslaved it
  they did it wasnt until a hundred or so years later that they outsourced it
theres literally a book on seasian slaves    1500s1600s slaves in the spanish empire came from both asia and africa the socalled chinos who werent chinese most of them are filipinos and malays and negros  why because filipino princes allied to spain and african states sold slaves filipino chieftains and kings and allies of the spaniards were selling victims of their wars usually other filipinos and people from borneo and mindanao captured in raids along with a few unlucky chinese and japanese peeps  problem the philippines was increasingly becoming spanish territory by the late 1600s   lots of flips were converting and swearing fealty to the spanish king  spanish law no subject of the king could ever be enslaved no indio under spanish rule could be enslaved  add to this the hassles of keeping a chino slave they were intelligent kept on escaping knew enough spanish to pass as local native americans formed protection societies in mexico and married local mexican women becoming protected indios in the process  add to this atlantic slave traders the ones who sold negros saw filipino chieftainslavers as competition and asked the king to get the flips to stop their shit  so slavery was stopped in the philippines and told the local elites shit to stop selling slaves  consequences 1 asian slave trade stopped filipinos say ok we wont sell people anymore  consequence 2 africans werent under spanish rule and werent catholic so they were fair game lmao    tldr filipinos were responsible for niggers
  they did but the numbers werent there and most asian countries werent ok with an economy growing around their people being enslaved by foreigners     as for amerindians the werr just dying off too fast for it to work economically    africa was perfect for relishing slaves
  there are historical documents detailing that native americans cannot be tamed blacks were easy east aisians had things to trade
  nigs make the best slaves because of their genetic traits
alexander stephens cornerstone speech which nobody ever reads beyond that one paragraph actually makes mention of this  he says something along the lines of indians cannot be tamed and will accept extinction before they accept servitude but the negro is servile by nature
  probably because western africa is closer to the americas and the whole point was to bring slaves there
  europeans didnt enslave africans    they did though how is it hard to understand
  and most asian countries werent ok with an economy growing around their people being enslaved by foreigners    there wwas a ton of slavery in asia as well as a slave trade
  this  its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth these products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions and by an imperious law of nature none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun these products have become necessities of the world and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization   
  so they let the children of slaves go free right fucking revisionist brainlet
  i do not know about england  we tried the forced labor route but they kept dying from diseases
  based spics  eternal anglo
they tried to enslave indians especially the spanish and portuguese in south america they were too weak and lazy to work properly and refused to breed in captivity so blacks were brought in
  oioi
  based
  blacks sold each others to europeans other races didnt simple as  the belief that whites went in the jungle to capture blacks themselves is bullshit
  it was tried with american indians but it didnt work well they were too free spirited didnt do well in captivity
holy shit is everyone ugly or what
  transsexuals
  this
  it was way easier to collect african slaves in west coast africa and bring them to the americas than anything else or just let the ottomans collect them and purchase them there the portuguese did take some sea chinese japanese and indian slaves to brazil and lots of roma as well   as for native americans many were enslaved though places like britain and france began to see them as more useful for navigators and hunters
  he looks really fucking wierd like possibly retarded
  looks like my highschool bully
dont remember which year but spanish priests demonstrated natives had souls or something like that and banned their enslavement blacks continued to be enslaved and i dont know how spanish threaded filipinos
  revisionism
why does no one ever making distinctions on which african tribe sold which
hey anon if you can give me the correct answer i might reward you   what is the best system of government
  the one where im in charge forever and ever
  dickocracy it is well known that poor policy is almost always an attempt by poorly endowed men to feel well endowed or by women attempting to compensate for their complete lack of a penis by putting the government in the hands of the men with the largest cocks perfect policy will be enacted
physiocracy rule of the physically strong
  i see make sense

      militias were nonexistent post 1815
  0 state power 100 individual power
  no government
  mussolini
  there is no best system of government but the least worst is representative democracy because it puts the most checks on arbitrary use of power and a government that is serving its people poorly can be removed peacefully and relatively quickly
  was extremely corrupt and ran a police state that made life miserable for many he started a blatant war of aggression against ethiopia which was most certainly not benign and then joined an unwinnable war that destroyed the country and cost him his life

not choosing monarchy
  well what sort of environment are we talking about if youre talking about in general id suggest a feudal monarchy to so at least theres some stability and you can slowly shape it into something thatll best fit the situation
  there is anarchoprimitivism
  physiocrats and physiocracy is already a thing look it up
  why would there be slavery
  i want to f
  all the state constitutions within the csa name slavery as something worthy of upholding
  sounds really dumb i prefer my version
    caliphate

  thank you burger boy
  constitutional monarchy  cool king dude as a stable nonpolitical representative of your country  still have democracy      this one is pretty cool tho     dictatorship is only cool under the condition that i can be the dictator
  i think he means that every single thing would be decided through online polls problem is how youd get a somewhat coherent policy out of that though for social issues like legalizing weed or gay marriage that dont cost any money its fine to use referendums though

  what happens when the one good one dies
  das right
  how do you suppose the leaders are chosen i think i agree but youd have to hope for some intelligent ambitious people to come along at the right times for that to work well
one in which all decisions are made democratically by a council of civic monks the civic monks live in poverty they are not allowed to live in private housing or own any luxury items other than books and computers but live and work communally anyone can join the council after a test of basic legal knowledge and literacy but it is a 10year commitment and desertion is punishable with prison time     a second branch of government operates under the same system as jury duty in the usa a random selection of citizens are called upon to act as guardians of the integrity of the council they can vote to veto any action of the council and any time that the council votes for a resolution to either a decrease the commitment time for the council or b allow council members any greater luxuries or ability to profit from their position the second branch can will vote to have the council member who put the resolution forward be stripped of their position
  also theres a true market economy with no minimum wage but there is a maximum wage of 1 million usd/year     and inheritance isnt allowed any money you die with gets confiscated by the government and is distributed evenly to the next generation

  the goddamn wife is making potatoes again  potatoes are a side
  constitutional monarchy with representative democracy based on british modern liberty hobbes instead of republican liberty locke and rousseau the problem with republican liberty is that the people in the republic are like the crown in a monarchy the legal fiction through which power is conferred on to those who hold it since the people are an entity constructed by the rulers usually based on a small group of supporters like robespierres parisian mobs it becomes very easy for rulers to persecute those he constructs as enemies of the people since respecting the will of the people is most important in a republican system there are few checks on power to prevent atrocities in the name of the people whereas in a system based on british modern liberty especially a constitutional monarchy power is not derived from the people and there are far more checks and balances preventing persecution by the government
i can tell you that democracy is the worst why do you think jews are controlling every democratic country they engineered revolution to topple kings and replace them with a parliament from there all they have to do is fund the one that serves their best interests not the interests of the people as bad as a king could ben he would never sell out his country for some tribe of greasy parasites in the long run every citizen benifitted now happy merchant get puppet president to do their bidding and ruin every country they settled in
  yikes
  hows it going with russia and shit
  the elders council everything the elders decide gets done they know better from all the elders in the nation the elders have to choose 1233 representatives they will together decide on all the issues in the nation its based on the wisdom of the elders and the maximum respect to your elders if the elders live right everyone else does
  pretty good russia is too scared to take any more they fear the pussies in the west plus theyd never be able to win a guerilla war against ukraine soon theyll collapse and well take back crimea and theyll be forced to give us rostov astrakhan and krasnodar

were there any attempts of making russia join the european union after the fall of the soviet union it could have prevented many problems we are facing today
  none seriously no the window for that basically slammed shut by the mid 90s as neither party really took the idea seriously russia saw it as basically downgrading itself and the eu saw russia as so far from its own values that it thought why bother nevermind that including russia would radically change the eu as a whole it would look entirely different than how it looks today

whats wrong with being evil everyone deep down knows there is no god why shouldnt i do what i want
go ahead do whatever you want but remember play stupid games win stupid prizes
  you stupid fucking mong    yet another why do i need to follow morals thread    morals is a spook/structure that societies created for their best benefit laws and values evolving in a darwinian sense    hollistic goals  personal goals    if you want proof just kill someone and get fucked up
  im not gonna kill people at least not directly    im gonna work for the defense industry raking it in while tens of thousands of middle eastern children starve to death without god theres literally no reason not to do this
    arguably only evil if you consider them more valuable than the financial stability and progress of the west
  you seem to value gods pretty highly considering you are implying if he did exist you would do as he commanded in any case why do you even believe in evil if you dont believe a god
  youre implying that the west doesnt have the capacity to reduce poverty in these regions
  thats right tyler
  how did that end up for bush    again youre not only spooking yourself by being evil as a moral goal but its gamble
  i hope that somewhere out there a mother has actually had this conversation with her five year old son
moral relativists   theres a reason we have morals youll cry out for divinity when your bones snap under the wheel
  based tyler
  i bet at least half the people in the defense industry are christians
  lol you say that as if there arent hundreds of thousands of devout christian men in the united states armed forces there are even these disgusting christian military academies high schools that raise children to become soldiers its all very disgusting but it all exist
  military school with christianity the religion of the western world  that isnt out of the ordinary youre a dumb guy
  reminder psychopaths logically understand the purpose of morals however they are such subhuman pieces of shit they dont care about that
  they have a brain disorder that makes them unable to empathize or feel remorse not surprised they say no to moral behavior when convenient sounds the average leftist when you think about it
  if you live in a first world country your lifestyle is made off the blood of the third world already so you are indirectly responsible for death lol
  i think morals are a spook but i still follow them why    1 because its is most beneficial for me see my post     2 because it makes me feel good as it is natural to feel good when helping people    psychopaths since they dont feel good from helping others may hurt others as a moral goal but thats fundamentally illogical because youre going against your own biological interests and no im not a naturalist
  sounds the average leftist when you think about it  chillax on the edge there bro
  i dont care about morals and im not a psychopath the screaming gets to me as does the unwavering irrational hate of the perp
  a goddamn machine can understand the purpose of morals but not emotionally get them a robot can be programmed into thinking killing stealing and lying is destructive behavior in humans where as a human psychopath already knows their savagery is destruction to other humans yet play dumb as though they dont think they are doing anything wrong at all most animals on this planet are psychopaths because they have no empathy yet its only the psychos in our species that are purely destructive to their own species
it kinda horrifies me that most christfags would literally rape and murder people if they didnt think a supernatural being would hurt them    i feel guilty for even not holding the door for people
  pretty sure leftists are leftists precisely because they can empathize more not less
  its fucked up to mix the two only americans would think otherwise
  they wouldnt as christfags are controlled by their morality not some nonexistent sky jew human leaders figured out they could create hyper morality in people by tricking them into thinking moral laws are divine codes placed in by gods in our modern world we maintain morality via our natural empathy and the threat of being raped in prison this doesnt stop psychos however
  not all psychopaths kill some normies kill in short so what
  people wont like you theyll find clever ways to make your life harder youll end up alone    not being evil isnt good for the people around you as much as its good for you
  preventing you from having a girlfriend  lol  
  i blame hollywood for pushing the le evil genius psychopath meme the great majority of psychopaths are just that sketchy guy at the gas station who just needs a dollar mang
  leftists the ones who want equality have no empathy it is only the right the ones who want to fuck over everyone who isnt them who are capable of empathizing with others
  morality is a combination of genetic and social programming  everyone already does what they want within the constraints of their personal morality and usually the law people vary in their morality but more importantly they vary in their empathy those with virtually no empathy are psychopaths and sometimes they commit crimes
  even if what you were saying is true clearly they still have good intentions which means they arent psychopaths
      equality under all circumstances is not inherently moral it is not analogous with justice or fairness it just interjects them    wanting absolute equality  arbitrary distribution and unnatural compulsive hierarchies despite several complex reasons why it is impractical destructive and harmful only for an autistic personal whim is psychopathy at its finest
  when we normies kill we get ptsd from the murders we commit while you subhumans can sleep like babies after bludgeoning people slowly
  yes anon you must kill them for they are weak ironically you rationalize like someone with anti personality disorder
  animals still have primtive feelings of love and friendship pyschopaths can literally not empathize or feel care for another human being at all
  thats actually not a bad idea to make some money
  how did that end up for bush  hes enjoying his retirement painting flowers cowboys and shit
    you do realise that youre following morals deeply ingrained in your psyche by preceding religious societies that embedded these morals into social fabric
  based
    as a christian i see no problem with that god would be proud of you killing indirectly muslims thats totally ok
  nice spooks nerd
  morals exist so society can advance to the point where we dont need to rely on lower forms of sentient interaction   acting evil for the sake of it demonstrates a lower ability for sentient interaction through not recognizing the inevitable consequences and lack of longterm benefits if you persist without trying to better yourself and others directly or indirectly theres either no real progress or negative progress acting evil would either be for your personal status or just because you want to appealing to lower emotions interacting with reasoning capability downwards  the wisest people act in a neutral fashion because through this you can do the most good holds you back through having to rely on everyone elses progression while evil holds you back through having to depend on everyone elses progression people with a neutral mindset towards morals can do whatever they want with or without others through relying on themselves
  and if you didnt feel guilty youd rape and murder while the christfag would not
  another le im such an evil sociopath boohooo thread just fuck off
its kinda funny that this myth of the genius hannibal lecter sociopath exists almost solely due to hollywood when most psychopaths are in fact borderline retards with low iq and lower impulse control the kind of people who end up in jail for over a decade because they robbed a store at gunpoint for fifty bucks
  i was telling that anon how hes following christfag spooks

is it a fish diet with cities that are on the coast or close  or more argiculture  or something else  and how much does weather influence it  are there other majoc factors
  selective breeding
historicallyspeaking without the modern bra large breasts were frowned on because they went saggy first over smaller ones     thats why ancient artists always depicted smallbreasted women as whats beautiful    it doesnt seem like people perferred big racks until howard hughes invented the torpedo bra for jane russell     i know it doesnt relate to your question but i threw that little factoid out there anyway
  is this protoanime
  nice fact but no not the answer what im looking for
  ye but i mean some places like russia or germany average breast are higher than other places why is that
  its genetic lineage really big breasts survive the eons because plenty of men fucked bigtittied women     and like every other genetic attribute it probably originated with one small group that through darwins natural selection had that gene pool that had big titties grow over the ages
  it originates from a male population having a big tit fetish
  but there arent other factors that causes this then genetic lineage like i said in the description certain places with different diets
  complacency    hello girls if you are big breasts you have no excuse you must be lean
  maybe the groups where it originated produced fatter babies that needed more of the breast milk so womens breasts within that genetic group grew as a response    its all speculation because i dont think any scientist went to a university ask for grant money to launch an investigation as to where big tits come from and why
  big breasts are probably a polygenic trait not originating in one specific population but having great variance within groups and between groups genetics is not as simple as there being one gene for everything
  
  thats some nice sculpted tits
  im pretty sure boob size has nothing to do with milk gland size
  this means nothing compared to iff there is cannabis in the milk and during pregnancy
  historicallyspeaking without the modern bra large breasts were frowned on because they went saggy first over smaller ones   this is not remotely true  the op image alone proves you wrong and your logic flawed because the minoan civilization and its art depicts large busts supported by a marvelous invention  the bodice what we are now likely to call a corset which waned in and out of popularity for the past 3000 years there are numerous historical attestations to the superiority of large tits both as objects of desire and envy such as when empress theodora of the ere who in her youth was a prostitute complained that her cleavage was not prodigious enough to give titfucks to her patrons
  this is a myth and i have no idea why people accept it bras cause the connective tissue and muscles supporting the breasts to atrophy leading to greater sagging
  empress theodora of the ere who in her youth was a prostitute complained that her cleavage was not prodigious enough to give titfucks to her patrons  hahaha source
  procopius secret history which to be fair is a highly biased source written by a guy who hated the administration of justinian and theodora largely because he was a paid shill who had to perform damage control for them its basically a tellall tabloid and should not be taken at face value but it speaks volumes on the cultural mores of the time that its author wrote theodora regretted that god had given her but three orifices for pleasure and nature had not unlocked the fruits of her bosom to take a fourth lover
  my mistake i was quoting from memory in fact the text goes like this  and though she flung wide three gates to the ambassadors of cupid she lamented that nature had not similarly unlocked the straits of her bosom that she might there have contrived a further welcome to his emissaries  which conveys the same message but with more attractive syllabic meter  
  holy shit and here i thought id never read a blatant reference to tittyfucking from late antiquity let alone from the same author who made the first known reference to slavs in history
  procopius justinian was the demon from exorcist and also he literally killed a trillion people
  those tits  thicc thighs  slightly plump  holy moly
  its basically a historical reeee roasties are toasties beta uprising when the screed     the chad justinian and stacey theodora vs the virgin procopius
so uh who had the biggest tits in all of history
  probably the current world record holder  there is no way someone in the olden days could possibly compete in size with modern plastic surgery
papayas
  plastic surgery  alright  how about biggest natural tits in all of history
  probably still today considering youd have to have copious amounts of fat to get tits so huge and there are many more fat people today
    largest in history with implants is apparently a woman named beshine with a cup size of 32 z    largest currently with natural breasts is a woman named annie hawkins with a cup size of 48 v  i dont see it possible for someone to achieve this size before the modern age it would be almost impossible to support such large breasts on the diets people had back then
  selective breeding
  i think probably diet in thinking about modern women and how they have bigger assesnot counting plastic surgery than they used to so i think it was preference mixed with diet
  i wonder if indoeuropeans and their cow and thus milk culture contributed to this
  im not saying it should be used as a historical narrative but it does offer a useful historical insight visàvis this thread topic by showing that procopius considered theodora part of the ittybittytitty comittee
what is the best translation available of sapphos poetry
what do greeks think about byzantine empire
  they cant afford internet so we may never know
   i would like to see an acknowledgement of how the theme of the optimatoi was both cruel and inept in its administration
  probably the same way italians do about the roman
traditionally it meant more to them than the ancient greek culture which was mainly championed by enlightenment/nationalists
  thats because the greeks of today are degraded reduced specimens compared to the ancients and are ashamed of how ugly they are
  its more that prior to the nationalist sentiment of the 19th and twentieth centuries most greeks knew themselves as romaioi not greeks a peasant might have never heard of plato but everyone knew saint constantine
hellasbyzantium    if you disagree you are wrong and probably an descendant
hellasbyzantium    if you disagree you are wrong and probably an armenian/anatolian/slavic descendant
  slav here  we dont give a fuck about you
  i was not refering to you rather than to greeks who descend from slavs and were made orthodox
all of you are retarded    t greek
  greeks   think  seriously though id be more interested in what they think about ottoman empire     is it just occupation or do they acknowledge part of their history they were part of this  how were greeks treated in ot emp
  those are jews not greeks op
    i once talked to a cypriot about it to him byzantium was his motherland of which cyprus was a rightful part
generally were more focused on the ancient bits because education focuses mostly on them probably a remnant of the whole philhellenism deal after 1820s  though theres still the whole constantinople thing   most we learn of culture from those times at school is the digenis akritas poem iirc byzantine timeline is taught somewhat   for some reason we use byzantine when referring to it most of the time  were probably most familiar with constantine 1 theodosius 1 justinian basil 2 and michael and konstantinos palaiologos
  fpbp
  what made the optimatoi theme worse than all the other themes
  no love for /ourguy/ alexios komnenos
  it was an empire of antolia
  nobody cares what greeks think  everyone in europe is descended from ancient greeks  nobody cares about greeks
  descended from that guy  feels good man
  cypriot here its true we are much more connected to our medieval heritage than mainland greeks because we didnt have an aggressive archaic revival in fact we always have apostolic/christian names unlike mainland greeks who have professional names or nicknames we also had a lot more religious freedom than greece as we had various rulers namely venetians genoese franks and brits who brought a little more progress with them aside from the ottomans that identity was very important to us because it distinguished us from all the cultural influence diffusing into everyday life a lot of the time youll find that even irreligious people are intimidated and humbled by it
  thoughts on northern cyprus
  like the people or the land well my dad was from northern cyprus he was involved in peacekeeping and translation as he was serving as a medic in the british colonial army i think im not being unfair when i say the discplacement of 300000 native majority was inexcusable under any circumstances however my family tree never had any personal issues with the few turkish cypriots in their village and neither did they i believe the core of the problem is regional imperialism and geopolitics as cypriots wanted control of their own state while two great powersbritain and turkey also wanted direct access to the east med proximity to iran and gulf arabsoil for their comically indiscreet secret operations with u2 spy planes and more recently the airstrikes in syria that were launched from the bases the turks managed to establish the military base they needed and brought in thousands of anatolian turks to resettle the empty homes and sometimes they dont get along with turkish cypriots today theres a lot of fanaticism from first and second generation immigrants who didnt even live on the island before the invasion so you frequently heat about the grey wolvesturkish nationalists vandalising or attacking antierdogan newspapers or generally just leftists personally what makes me sad is the vandalism of historical monuments and family graves by them wanting to erase reality to make themselves feel at home and the northern state giving them voting rights which end up distancing us from each other as much as possible i just want to see the island reunited but its not going to happen turkish cypriots dont exactly have much say turkey does
  we slavs except for macadonians dont give a fuck about you  fify
did afroasiatic and indoeuropean come from the same language
  no afroasiatic is thousands of years older than ie protoafroasiatic was likely spoken around 10000 bce whereas pie was likely spoken around 3000 bce
  but before that
  is this your attempt at linking ancient egyptians with europeans op
  no we wuznt kangz its about whether or not pie and paa used to be the same language if they they diverged a long time before that
  borealean hypothesis or bust
  the idea that language developed once in homo sapien population is not crazy
  language is a very tricky thing because understanding language makes you very vulnerable to being lied to so its probably that human language evolved only once
  protoafroasiatic is 300k old and was spoken by the djebel irhoud man
  no i think this is a caucasoid solidarity thread which would be nice since really its just congoids that are the problem
  so hausa are white
  you might be interested in the nostratic language family then its a hypothetical superfamily that includes afroasiatic indoeuropean and a few others     plus islam but a caucasoid racial identity is interesting because it has an actual basis in genetics but not much in culture
  they probably are not caucasoid no there are speakers of turkic languages that arent turkic and there are speakers of ie that are hardly ie at all like italians and portuguese also not white but caucasoid as in not from subsaharan africa or east asia
  caucasoid north africans are really just mulattos pure 95 europids/caucasoids/west eurasian/whatever people are restricted to europe and the northern parts of west asia the rest of the caucasoids are mixed with ssa australoids or east asians
  hausa arent north africans like berbers egyptians and were more talking about ancient ethnicities far before there was significant gene flow from sub saharan africa     caucasoids are a legitimate racial category but as you can see  autistics like this person would never accept this regardless of how many genetics studies or skulls you spam at them
  europeans are hapa rapebabies 20 mongoloid and all their r1 ydna is mongoloid pure caucasoids are only found in middle east
  are you saying that if someones ancestry is say 50 caucasoid and 50 noncaucasoid but they have a caucasoid skull then they are a caucasoid and not a halfhalf if so then thats a decent point anon    even then anon ane admixture is heavy in places like iran and the caucasus   by the time you go south enough to lose the ane you start to see the ssa   no pure caucasians im afraid only in sardinia maybe
  mongoloid  yamna isnt mongoloid
  yamna are 50 ane the only body found in association with an ane culture was confirmed as phenotypically mongoloid
  europeans are hapas north africans are pure archaic humans mixed with a a few eurohapa slaves
  north africans are pure archaic humans mixed with a a few eurohapa slaves  then pure archaic humans are literal niggers
  africans are better than cumskins cumskins are inferior beings unable to reproduce such subhumans are naturally wiped out by mother nature
  nope because ssa admixture is insignificant even in the gulf middle east is 90 caucasoid the origin of caucasoids and have caucasoid ydna meanwhile europe is 70 caucasoid not the homeland of caucasoids and has mainly mongoloid ydna meaning europeans are hapa mongrels
  new study just came out
  ane is not a valid way of determining ancestry as malta 1 was a mixed hapa we know now that nganasan admixture is the pure mongoloid ancestry and we use that as a reference point    anyone still using ane is dumb as a rock
  the european caucasoids aka scandinavians are haplogroup i
  yoruba still appears as pure despite the 12 ancient north african admixture and the 8 archaic hominin admixture   hadza not being pure   new study     this is like 2015 all over again
  check it out 6 days old        had to archive since 4chan marks it as spam    also this image might be controversial
  no uralic and ie have the highest genetic linguistic relationship
  19th century race categories are irrelevant when youre looking at protohumans ane doesnt split off of modern east asians by any stretch of the imagination the fact that they had blonde hair clearly indicates we are not dealing with modern mongoloids
  why does naganasan show up in the modern european samples but not in any of the ancient ones where did it come from
  it did its what they used to call siberian but switched it to nganasan people as they are the purest out of all the tribes that live in siberia
  people with ehg admixture  tall big dicks robust and aggressive  all traits that are not found in modern mongoloid admixed populations    its absolutely silly to push that angle and makes you look like an angry asian american manlet who has a chip on his shoulder
  i mean in that specific image theres no purple in any of the ancient european samples but then suddenly theres some in all of the modern ones
  because its a proxy for something similar living further in the west naganasan people didnt actually have any contacts with europeans other than russians
  son the purest caucasoid are bedouinb and europeans are siberianshifted hapas makes sense
  but blonde hair is not unknown to mongoloids infact the mongoloids with blonde hair inhabit near to where the malta culture was
  ehg are heavily siberian admixed blue  pure whg dark green  chg light green  siberian
  big dicks  and what is your source for this information
  mongoloid as a term is irrelevant if theres no clear lines drawn anywhere where it begins and where it ends    nenets are a west eurasianadmixed population so obviously they are going to have a few lighter looking individuals there    dont post children by the way they dont retain their hair color post adults
  i agree fully indouralic is real ehg and corded ware were uralics pie is from the ehg women married to chg men but there were too many ehg women and they passed their language to their children and created a creolelanguage uralics and indoeuropeans were once the same group but southern group got cucked by churkas a warrior race of caucasus mountainniggers who unfortunately started the steppenigger trend which plagued the world for millennia the original shitskin pies steppe pies are ehg conquered by chg but uralics are pure ehg who kept their language and culture fully
  ehg were hapa mongoloids themselves
  yes i know
  siberian doesnt mean what you imply it means youre trying to impose your idea of the word on everyone else through rhetoric    in reality none of the people who have made up genetic populations of siberia historically have been east asian mongoloids so its a pointless argument    look chink when your hands are smaller than a white mans when your wrists are thinner than ours when your body is softer and less testosteroneous than ours among every other thing except for your flat oversized head then naturally the penis is also going to be bigger height correlates with penis size    penis size interacts with body shape and height to influence male attractiveness  compelling evidence from many animal taxa indicates that male genitalia are often under postcopulatory sexual selection for characteristics that increase a males relative fertilization success there could however also be direct precopulatory female mate choice based on male genital traits before clothing the nonretractable human penis would have been conspicuous to potential mates this observation has generated suggestions that human penis size partly evolved because of female choice here we show based upon female assessment of digitally projected lifesize computergenerated images that penis size interacts with body shape and height to determine male sexual attractiveness  
    didnt know you were that emotionally invested in this that you would samefag
  what do you mean anon siberian means nganasan people which date back to the paleolithic
  
  how pathetic what can you expect from dumb slavshits
  which geneticist or linguist would argue that nganasan are an ancient population are you aware that their language roots lie in the south
  british people are shorter than slavs and scandinavians because they dont have aryan ehg admixture dont be sad if youre smaller and physically less dominant
  mongoloids  big dicks  
  slavs are tall though
  british and scandinavian average heights are far taller than manlet slavshits western europeans are taller than americans americans are taller than slavshits  sweden 184 cm  britain 182 cm  germany 180cm  usa 178cm  russia 176cm
  source my lying manlet anglo ass
  so actually latinos are not mestizos because they have overwhelmingly european ydna come on mate for example egyptians are 15 ssa thats actually quite a lot over onesixth
  
  ehg possesses traits diametrically opposed to modern mongoloid trait at a quick glance a brown manlet neolithic farmer would appear more similar to a chink than an aryan
  what the fuck does this have to do with anything brainlet were talking about afroasiatic
  corded ware  uralic  spotted the finn
  russia 176cm  funny you chose russia as your example why not baltics which is the purest source of the baltoslavic component
  russians are 176 cm 5 ft 9 in  source 
  why are americans so short fuck must be all the central americans
  so why did they classify ehg as an uraloid woman
  spotted the slavshit posting studies that dont have anything to do with the thread
  lithuanians are 176 cm according to their conscripts height
  uraloid  sorry i dont speak unscientific retardo rhetoric
  we both know youre full of shit mr bean
  corded ware was most likely uralic
  the russian scientists who for example drew these  classified the karelia hg with r1a as a lapponoid woman
  nonhispanic white american height is around 5910
  no it wasnt
  its from a study subhuman slavshit go back to your german silesian larping you brainlet
  it wasnt it was proto baltoslavic baltic bronze age people genomes pretty much prove it
  anglos arent taller than slavs
  meanwhile in reality ehg were mongoloid  morphological affinities are demonstrated between the yuzhny oleni ostrov mesolithic group and to a lesser extent the ukrainian mesolithic group and siberias neolithic groups as well as with some of the modern asians
  if you want to play that card you can sell khoisan people as mongoloids as well so that makes no actual sense
  now look at the group that doesnt include 70 year old grandpas     then look at which nation has the tallest women
  post muh nordic long headed aryan skulls every day  ddont go that route bro
  baltic lateneolithic corded ware culture  bronze  no nganasan    scandinavian lateneolithic funnel beaker  bronze age  no nganasan      based
  nope ehg have mongoloid genetics as well ehg even have mongoloid c n o r1 q ydna
  you forgot j
  dont be sad if youre smaller and physically less dominant  cringe why are incels so attracted to genetics and race science
  you dont get to use that card on me seeing as you completely ignored what the other posters said
  i dont care about outdated forms of pseudoscience     so no fingol input just as gods intended     a form of escapism if they larp as muh stronk aryan god warrior rapists they forget about their pathetic existence for a moment a brief moment but still enough to keep on living you can see that mostly among finnic posters
  the j guy was a part of the caucasoid ruling class who forced their indosemitic language upon your ancestors defenseless mongoloid
  speaking of pseudoscience the word finnr is of scandinavian origin and only ever used in around and northern europe protofinnics like you will soon see in estonian tarand grave studies show no saami admixture
  mostly among finkic posters    nice try slavoid but the most notorious larper here is obviously the silesian pole also the slavshitcthat lives in australia youre probably one of them yourself seeing how gleeful youre about the lack of nganasan in cwc     are slavs even human you seem to lack all introspection
  then you woke up in your moms basement like all 30 year old mediterranean males
  i agree about silesian and australian add gallomorrocan to the list his interracial fetish is unhealthy seeing as he has pretty pale skin himselffor being an enf francoid of course    cwc not being uralic  was known to everyone even before the recent studies uraloid fantasies were mostly pushed by that autist carlos and he was proven wrong once again whats next in the uralic list yamna
  the j guy was from a very early split of j and has no modern descendants how did that happen
  carlos is not finnic hes one of yours
  dont forget about the chgneolithic iran kurd here
  he shills for finns so that makes him one of yours
  whats next in the uralic list  probably the same as always gather evidence from where language contacts happened
  no he shills for r1b how can you not see that the whole r1auralic is s push to make r1b the only ie ydna being a latino he most likely is r1b too its so obvious had you not been blinded by your irrational fear of finns
  based and redpilled
  whoa big if true
  its funny how in some peoples minds its a plausible scenario that 200 eskimos on the arctic coastline dominated thousands of farmer/hunters across russia then wind up going extinct like yukaghirs and saamis today    thats the kind of ridiculous conclusion you have to come to in order to further your slavic steppe supremacist ideas
piotr calling me a larper  wtf
  j and i are caucasoid ydna so i didnt include them in the mongoloid ydna ehg women opened their pussies for every foreign man who came passing by
  what about haplogroup h from hijk        
  caucasoid  caucasians have ane admixture dear christoph meiners
  no one but idiots call ancestors of finns some eskimos i only see slavs do that when finns try to meddle with corded ware swedes on the other hand constantly try to prove that finns were always dumb chinks with megabrachy heads and got civilized by muh germanic aryan nordic swede hand
mon ami je pense que nous parlons avec des débiles
its going to be so funny when they find the negroid connection between basal eurasian and natufian well have the largest number of people going on suicide watch simultaneously in history     where else do you think you got your curly thick hair from
  share with us your wisdom please
  ydna h is caucasoid and the earliest remains from the middle east are fully caucasoid
  black men fucked white women thats his wisdom
  the indosemitic ruling class was so racist that they would rather go extinct go extinct than mix with inferior mongoloid people a very noble sacrifice       i woke up in my bed with a cute slavic hapa like all meds
  i woke up in my bed with a cute slavic hapa like all meds  yeah after your french mother had a morrocan train ran on her youre selfconscious about your shitskin admixture only mixing with east euros could possibly fix that
  look up r/hapas the most common complaint there is that they get confused for spanish syrian or something the groups which are the most racially ambiguous    nobody can pass for a nordic without close to true nordic genes
  filename  image  cringe
  indosemitic ruling class  what society is this referring to
  every indo european society
  actually the hapas are complaining that they get confused with slavs and mexicans
  ies werent scandinavian     enf farmers in scandinavia get raped by corded ware eastern europeans both from denmark and baltic states  they mix with locals  that newly formed culture gets raped by bell beakers in the end forming protogermanics
  yeah because slavs and mexicans look alike just a reminder that pic related is you
  no he is a caucasoid getting slavic hapa mongoloid women definitely superior to the incel slav men who love getting their women bred by foreigners particularly westerners
  heres eurasiantiger from his deleted account    he even made videos on youtube where he constantly said the word syrian constantly so many hapa redpills that youtube deleted the channel
  do you legitimately masturbate to the thought of eastern europeans raping enfs and germanics it honestly sounds like it
  its the mongoloid component in both slavs and mexicans that make them look alike i am not the frenchman btw
  corded ware were farmeroids themselves
  to the incel slav men who love getting their women bred by foreigners particularly westerners  and yet somehow slavic countries are 98 ethnic meanwhile countries like france are a fucking disaster that dont resemble their true state anymore you bend to shitskins
  no but since everyone here uses that terminology why not go with that as well     which mongoloid component    hardly
  those countries are shitholes so no one wants to live or immigrate there even ssa angola is doing economically better than slavshits and it doesnt have a nonexistent birthrate slavic women are always leaving their country to get bred by foreign men they dont even care which because slavic women know any foreign man is better than the slav   men   they have
  hardly  corded ware were 30 farmer
  even asians know that nordics look more different from asians than muditerraneans
  15   1/6
  no one ever mistook them for anything but asian theyre only saying what they themselves think but no one mistook any of them for mediterranean also because they are a making a point that hapas look nonwhite but afwm are racists anyway you are an incel polack so disgusted of his slave roots you were larping as silesian because you know germanics and nordics are far superior to slaves and you hate mediterraneans because even they are better than slavs
  frenchmen are just going to mix into syrians in the future and then become indistinguishable from swarthy hapas
  you dont speak for hapas who have to constantly deal with race questions in america and europe by nordiclooking whites they are the ones saying they get confused for arabs or spanish
  nope they never stated that anywhere that they were getting confused for spanish or arabs they only said they personally thought that hapas look like meds but no ever actually mistook them for anything but asian dumb polish incel
  1/66 then
  citation needed  modern russians are 34 scandinavians 36 germans probably 38/40
  not to mention balts that range from 25 to 28
  many do look at sardinians they look like hapas with chinky eyes too
   they never stated that anywhere  lmao its filled to the brim with comments like that i can spam this entire thread with comments saying they look like a swarthy latino/arab/mediterranean hardly anyone says they look like a real slav let alone nordic if they imply someone looks russian thats because they are talking about a mixed russian like the kids this couple is going to have if they dont luck out on the light hair
  im glad you realized no one actually mistook them for meds but meds dont have small eyes thatd be northern europeans
  lmao its filled to the brim with comments like that  its not no one ever mistook them for anything but asian i know you dont know english well but at no point in any of your images do they say that anyone thought they were med they are saying that they think themselves med
  disgusting
  scandinavian average is 35 slavic average is 40 and uralics and finnish have the least of all 27
  a high number of hapas westerneuropeanchinese/jap/korean have big bulging bug eyes even eurasiantiger
  she is a slavic woman and she preferred to marry chinese slav men are pathetic
  pls anon fuck our hivridden women   no thanks polish sluts belong to mongolia  t you      nordic are icarriers they are unrelated to rcarrying siberian hapas
  and when that boy grows up and his upper eyelids mature hes going to look like an italian shitskin
  even that is more on par with northern european eyes very small meds have large eyes unlike hapas and northern europeans
  northern europeans are so distinct that nobody mistakes mixed people for them you cant mix to be blonde they mistake them for swarthy people like meds
  that kid could easily pass as arab or sicilian
  norwegians have more enf than russians and poles
  huh    if lbk  100 farmer see    and yamnaya is 70 farmer see    then the norwegian for example would be around 70 farmer in total
  not with those small eyes and straight hair maybe a russian though
  then pure archaic humans are literal niggers  not actually true
  ryssians are mostly blonde or light haired with blueceyes youre talking about ethnic minorities like tatsr livin in russia they are as russisn as latinos are med
  russians are hapas and the ones east of moscow are almost entirely mongoloid
  eastern europeans are merely depigmented chinks
  sorry son but you cant have it both ways either nords have narrow hunter eyes or they have bulging eyes on average most of the times hapas have a lot of upper eye lid exposure and almost never mid or back hoods
    cope of a middle easterner
  nobody would mistake putin for a hapa though nice try    nuce cope i guess that means meds are niggs
  what you are a complete idiot or maybe it is your lack of knowledge of english since you are running this through english  polish i have only claimed that meds have large eyes meanwhile eastern europeans and hapas both have tiny eyes
    cope of a mongolian
  nobody would mistake putin for a hapa though  not him but putin looks 100 like a saami
  i cant see the difference between an average ethnic french and syrians except syrians tend to have brighter skin there is no mongoloid admixture in ethnic slavs and even going by that route cuman or avar would be still whiter than a western european
  putin is a good example of massive upper eyelid exposure of hapas and mediterraneans/arabs/indians
  looks saami  saami dont look like they used to anymore some of them look more germanic than swedes or germans themselves
  i cant see the difference between a siberian and a pole they are all just mongoloids to regular people
  what i said is true though french are one of the swarthiest europeans even spaniards are paler
  another webm from your incel forum polack easy to tell you are a newfag native to incel forums
  cope harder western han       is your shit eyesight caused by your slantedeyes hapanon     putin has clear mongoloid features like all slavs such as a lack of body hair a brachy head a soulless body a yellowish skin tone and slantedeyes
  im running in circles around you because you dont have a clue of what these hooded and exposure terms mean go read lookism or something and come back to me when you can communicate on the same level
  saami dont look like they used to anymore  im talking about the modern ones    some of them look more germanic than swedes or germans themselves  not even close
  i accept your concession bug eyes
  im not an incel like you who spent so long larping as a superior german shitting on slaves meanwhile you are a slav maybe you should go back to your incel forums
  emma would fit more in slavic and scandi countries than into france      brachy  france is more brachycephalic than any north slavic country
  no he doesnt nobody would mistake him for a hapa hapas dont have light haur theyre mixed up with meds since both are swarthy and short nobody would mistake emma stone for s hapa either
  okay can you stop now youre ruining the thread with your insecurity gosh
  modern saami are less asian than moden arabs are negroid
did afroasiatic and indoeuropean come from the same language  search nostratic  1 result  meanwhile the thread argues about hapas  what happened to you /his/
  your french iq is too low to use mental gymnastics your morrocan paternal dna lowered it even further
  i am youre literally the one trying to tell me that the most distinct looking european subpopulation gets mistajen for swarthy hapas instead of swarthy meds
  what are you talking about they are 25 nganasan admixed look at the chart 
the poolak is the larper who sucks nordic cock even though he is the furthest thing to nordic he is an incel and every single image and webm he posts is straight from incel forums for people like him
  no i am not the guy you were talking to
  silesian isnt even in this thread you fucking moron i see no shilling for nordcucks lookism guy is not a pole im the only pole itt you gallomorrocan subhuman trash
  im not an incel i just like to talk about eye shapes and phenotypes but not actually know anything about it if someone corrects me on those things then i call him an incel lol never mind thats what i do all day
  the saami kola are ancient samples not modern saami there arent even kola sami these days around the sami swe are modern
  whatever you say theyre both 24
  blattes cant deal with the fact they are all part of the same race to nords
based swede
  the polak who larps as silesian is most definitely an incel the larper only posts images and webms from incel forums its been outing the slav as an incel for a long time now everything is traceable and its clear the nordicist pole was an incel pua forum frequenter before coming to 4chan
  germans are mostly borreby and alpinid subhumans though
  no theyre not actual sami are around 11 less than arabs have negro
  low iq slav gets btfo by the post beneath silesian is in the thread you dumbshit
  actual finnush sami have lower than nonsami north norwegians    pseudo map has deceived you again
  youre soo fucking boring that i will just hide your posts from now on at least australian puts some effort into his shitposting youre just an insecure mutt little twat     heres my post you can all go to hell for all i care
  youve flung shit at everybody are you ready to divulge your own ethnicity yet
  too bad you low iq poleshit you made your moron claim got absolutely btfo by me and this is another one of your tantrums im not even the frenchman you retard
  i already said it you bloody fucking blind nit 
  its because it only counts finns and mongols in the original map    
  
  hes poolish
  ill have to take it slow because of your low iq      here you said there was no shilling for nords but there was from the poleshit this thread you said the lookism guy is not a pole when he in fact was a pole and silesian larper     here you started crying because you were wrong and the nordicist poleshit was in fact the incel look guy you also claimed im the frenchman when i am very clearly not    you are an idiot just like your poleshit compatriot
  combined with the map over eastern europe    
  this guy is the silesian he has bipolar disorder most likely caused by his tatar father raping his mother his first personality is a childlike  r1asomething silesian while his second personality is an extremely aggressive r1bu106 polish when you trigger too much the silesian the r1bu106 polack comes out
  funny how everything you projected as my behaviour fits your posts perfectly there is not much to say here maybe except change your tampon and then come back here
  yes i claimed this because i noticed the same posting style and incelouting hints he is mentally deficient and just a write off
  imagine being so defeated to actually resort to this type of idiocy i expect an interracial polish women folder dump next
  wait is the guy claiming there is no silesian in here actually the silesian top kek
can we return to the discussion now
  defeated   i am not the person youre arguing with silesianon i am one of the poster shitposting about hapas
  about what swedish albanian and gallomorrocan already ruined the thread with their insecurities there is not much to do here
  wrong again mongoloid poleshit i am not the frenchman or swede either
  i am not the frenchman or swede either  well neither are they
  threads over and the ehg man marches on
  citizenship though do you live on poland or are you a leech in the uk
  that guy can thank his farmer admixture for having a decent face
  decent face  looks like a rat
  why would anybody want to thank the undesirable qualities of enf farmers all the good phenotypes come from whg ultimately
  that guy is pretty ugly those eyes are almost nonexistent
  modern enf are mbuti   the ancient enf looked like germanic peoples
  t australian    farmers were horsefaced and looked like your typical nerd from american movies better yet like try guys but with swarthy skin and souless eyes     baltic whg    western euro version looked like subhumans
  enf mixed with whg along the way and got the good look genes from them you still find a lot of phenotypes which are clearly middle eastern though
  another incel rant from the nordicist
  nordicist  dont insult me you little cunt
    i said that he was decent looking not that he was good looking or attractive but the fact remains that pure ehgs would have looked like abominations compared to him caucasians are the most beautiful people because farmer admixture not siberiagrel admixture
  true enough ehg were the ugly creaturas of their day
  is that why eastern european and scandinavian women are considered the most beautiful on the planet must be siberianmong genes
  no farmers would have looked like the ideals used in propaganda works the try guys are just the result of a combination of general ugliness and low testosterone
  eastern european men arent considered particularly attractive though
  women want tallfaced nordic elves not babyfaced orcish incels
  its still wrong sami dont live that south
  eastern european men are universally considered ugly potatoids only their women go abroad and are considered traditional not beautiful they are thirdrate replacements for western women
  heres a pic of russians in siberia
  only by cherrypicking and longtime germanic propaganda either way im not gay to care about men you agree about   then    there he goes again
the eastern euro mongoloids fear the superior funnelbeaker nordic man
  east europeans are crazy overrepresented as models
    okay okay we all know all germans and germanics look like propaganda poster boys meanwhile in reality
  nonsense ehg is the beautification cocktail you only get true upper class looks if you have the steppe admixture to elevate your mediocre shitskins genes    thats how it works for the better looking turks greeks brits central asians indians etc
  i beg you dont hurt me my pimpled skinny nordic master for i am only a dirt beneath your aryan feet
  1535181181899jpg  seems like you really like that particular pic for some reason
  my phone is weird like that
  you agree then  to a degree but discussing women is pointless if you dont discuss men as well
  ehg mutts  la creatura el monstruo siberio
  its funny because ötzi looked like a hapa
  those are germans who are superior to slav mongoloids but not true nordics who are the best of them all
  associating ehg with beauty is questionable enough but associating ehg with upper class looks is laughable the ehg look is more of the eastern european thug look if anything
  only in that trash recent reconstruction
  better than basal that is negroid
  posting about slavic men is pointless because soon youll get a swarm of people with some grudge against slavs and it will be nothing more than potato ugly inbred etc shitflinging even though potato face is a german borreby phenotype meanwhile east euro models both men and women are popular even in scandinavian countries     those arent germans
  ehg were inbetween uralics and east asians i guess its eastern european looking
  there isnt a better example of the superiority of steppe admix than india itself southerners  la creatura northerners  lord over the rest of them like kings    everybody always admires the whiter looking pakistanis too and pays no mind to the uglier shitskin pakis
  those are descendants of anglo and slavic thralls
  that still doesnt change the fact that slavic men arent considered particularly attractive
  funny you mention that because sintasha were more neolithic farmer than ane
  so westerners dictate what is hip and trendy ffs niggers and arabs are considered peak humanity right now
wow i posted this thread because i wanted some serious discussion on the issue but its blown up and is filled with muh aryan race bickering
  sintashta is close to modern russians and poles except they had less enf and whg than modern slavs do that makes them even less shitskin
  that sounds like cope
  yes of a westerner i have nothing to prove all those ski surnames among models do it for me
  sintashta is close to modern russians and poles      you again they werent they were outside modern population variation ive seen you post this lie at least 10 times now youve got some deep insecurities pole and in case you sperg out again im not the guy you were replying to earlier
  anglos werent taken as thralls only celtshits
  the whole aryan supremacy theory was originally based on the fact that southern and central european countries had lighter pigmented individuals in charge of them    meanwhile enfs committed crimes ie sicilians or farmed potatoes    these riddles are clear that there was a difference in physiognomy between the indigenous britons wealisc and saxons the former are called are described as swarthy swearte and dark haired wonfeax in her work women in anglosaxon england 1984 25 christine e fell has noted references to wealisc women are usually to slaves and an ethnic class distinction is suggested in the riddles of the exeter book between the blonde hwitlocced daughter of an anglosaxon nobleman and the darkhaired wonfeax welsh slave according to day 2001 dark colouring in the exeter book characterizes as low status especially for the british servants riddle 49 and 52 both describe swarthy/dark haired britons while riddle 72 describes a lower class dark welsh herdsman sweartum hyrde the anglosaxons in sharp contrast are described as blonde hwitlocced and elsewhere as pale hwit
  southern and central european countries had lighter pigmented individuals in charge of them  what time period are you referring to here
  except they were check andronovo genomes like rise505 for yourself they were less enf and whg than modern populations but still pretty close
  right anglosaxons were slaves and peasants of the norse though
  more slavshit wewuzzing  how pathetic
  we were talking about sintashta not andronovo why are you moving goalposts poleling and look at pca yourself all andronovo genomes are also outside modern population variation not one sample overlaps with modern populations which are marked in grey
  doesnt matter most thralls were slavic
  just like your life
  slavic and baltic pirates raided scandinavia wendish pirates massacred and genocided danes     you ignored rest of my post i have no reason to argue with you you debil cuck
  literally false they were subjugated for some period of time and thats all the anglo has never been enslaved
  still that makes no sense you retarded slavshit ape by your definition of close half of europe could be considered close why are you so prone to wewuzzing and dragging balts into your shitshow you disgusting ape i dont think they want to be associated with such subhuman people like poles
  i bet you call cnuts empire a north sea empire to cope with the fact that anglos were norse peasants same with normans
  you shouldnt be posting on your period you estrogen elevated axewound
  not an argument you wewuzing retard
  im right youre wrong
  scandinavians invaded and destroyed slavs they took millions of slavic and baltic women as slaves nordics even destroyed eastern europe and created their own state the nordic rus varangians because slavs are inferior and must bow to their superior scandinavian masters
  those are the ideas where europe and particularly northern europe was thought of as a kind of eternal backwater where people sometimes go to but never from and where culture innovations never really came from and were received later than where they were invented     this all arises naturally out of presenting a sequence of out of africa the recolonization of europe from glacial refugia the birth of agriculture presented by cavallisforza as a theoretically beautiful simply inevitable demographic expansion and the ideas of the first civilizations the movement is always from outside europeeurope or southnorth and that was the presentation certainly when i became interested in this stuff in the 2000s    i suspect this was a bit comforting to some people whose backgrounds were not european or sometimes from south europe and perhaps often were both invested in national pride and a bit conscious of the present day balances of power and development between nations in particular it allows them to reframe the modern age as a kind of odd inexplicable aberration between times when the near east or asia or africa and to a lesser extent south europe have always been the important or natural centres of human culture    so for people who were invested in that its a bit of a shock to find ancient dna that appears to confirm that movements of culture and peoples from north to south from europe to elsewhere or from northern europe to southern europe did happen and that europe and northern europe was not the eternal backwater they had become quite comfortable with thinking of it in the long view as destined in the 21st century to return to its norm
  been that way ever since the population pyramid turned upside down and steppe admixed populations could grow larger populations relative to the south    thats when southern europeans worst nightmare came true and they couldnt compete anymore or i should say again because we already had that happen in the neolithic
  nope you clearly have some mental and eyesight issues
  whatever i have a norse surname anyway so i dont care 
  nice projection slavshit but im not the one living in a third world country with a huge inferiority complex constant wewuzzing and worst of all being born inferior slavic that would be you
  and then you woke up in a shitted up bed because you lack proper alcohol tolerance     yeah right     bobby cucksson
  you lack proper education which makes you even worse you behave like a woman whats the point speaking to someone like you piss off
  the only uneducated one is you to make up such lies and the only one who behaves like a tantrumthrowing woman is you hence why you are projecting so hard right now
  perun is a slav though
those are the ideas where europe and particularly northern europe was thought of as a kind of eternal backwater where people sometimes go to but never from and where culture innovations never really came from and were received later than where they were invented     this all arises naturally out of presenting a sequence of out of africa the recolonization of europe from glacial refugia the birth of agriculture presented by cavallisforza as a theoretically beautiful simply inevitable demographic expansion and the ideas of the first civilizations the movement is always from outside europeeurope or southnorth and that was the presentation certainly when i became interested in this stuff in the 2000s    i suspect this was a bit comforting to some people whose backgrounds were not european or sometimes from south europe and perhaps often were both invested in national pride and a bit conscious of the present day balances of power and development between nations in particular it allows them to reframe the modern age as a kind of odd inexplicable aberration between times when the near east or asia or africa and to a lesser extent south europe have always been the important or natural centres of human culture    so for people who were invested in that its a bit of a shock to find ancient dna that appears to confirm that movements of culture and peoples from north to south from europe to elsewhere or from northern europe to southern europe did happen and that europe and northern europe was not the eternal backwater they had become quite comfortable with thinking of it in the long view as destined in the 21st century to return to its norm
  half of the thread is calling you out for being retarded and moving goalposts yet you still act like a deranged slavtard
  thats fine i regard all northeastern europeans the same when globalism grows large enough having light hair and eyes are going to be the biggest indicator of true european traits
  cringe
  cope i am a direct descendant of the ancient germanofunnelbeaker i1 nobility meanwhile you probably dont even have a noble ski surname lmao
  south europe is the origin of civilization in europe and has been the important center of europe for most of its history ancient dna has proven that all the relevant cultures and civilizations in europe were mediterranean northern europe will be taken over by blacks and arabs anyway
  scandinavians are natural lords of slavs and always breed slav women like everyone else
  i suspect this was a bit comforting to some people whose backgrounds were not european or sometimes from south europe and perhaps often were both invested in national pride and a bit conscious of the present day balances of power and development between nations in particular it allows them to reframe the modern age as a kind of odd inexplicable aberration between times when the near east or asia or africa and to a lesser extent south europe have always been the important or natural centres of human culture    funny how spot on this was swarthlets are asspained that northern europe is so much more prosperous and developed than med or me countries
slavic women prefer any men over their own even chinese
asian men are taking all the slavic women
  thats how it already works in america     the asians hapas there much to your dismay would rather ally with blacks/arabs/medoids than nerdics despite whatever you think about your nganasan boogeymen    no amount of medoid coping of 30000 year old siberian sample is chinese is going to change the course of this developing dynamic
  tfw swarthlets middle easterners are whiter than polgoloids       
  thats how it already works in america  america  lol most americans are western europeans not eastern europeans
  most eastern europeans werent even allowed to enter the us until recently
  height correlates with penis size    the drc has an average of 7 inches and theyre manlets with actual pygmies in the mix too
polish women will cuck their boys and are huge sluts for the bbc
    slav countries are 9899 white and poised to stay that way most amwf mixing happens in america canada australia regardless of the bad odds because they have the largest numbers of asian males
  your country has the highest number of amwf and 10x the number of wmaf     modern chinese dna with all the bad qualities of short height mini dick and ugly features are spreading like wildfire in the population at large while slavs arent getting any dna damage
  do you realize that corded ware was a retardtier stone age culture which relied on clubbing natives with rudimentary stone axes they raped so many neolithic women they managed to become sintashta with some fairly advanced tech and settlements but poland was still retardtier and got raped by bell beakers
  those pictures are of couples in russia or in china most amwf happens in russia with both native asians and chinese men looking for wives able to marry millions of slavic women
  23andme and other comnercial labs uses modern populations arabs with the typical 10 negroid can show 0 ssa
  so this blond haired blue eyed pale skinned arab girl is 10 negroid i dont believe you
  no credible measurenents of penis size across countries has ever been done your 7 inches is from fucking questionaires how accurate do you think asking a man for his dick size is
  english / anglosaxons germanics made up the majority of the early settlers and none of them identify with muditerraneans so stop overreaching    and once they did they did it better than germans poles and russians became americans record fast unlike krauts    
  slav countries are 9899 white and poised to stay that way most amwf mixing happens in america canada australia regardless of the bad odds because they have the largest numbers of asian males
  hold up dont tell me you think shes anatyral blonde look at her roots you retard you probably think scarlett johanssen is blonde too
  poles and russians became americans record fast unlike krauts  of course poles and russians have nothing to be proud of so they wanted to become americans but germans had their pride and traditions to keep
  did she use contacts as well what a cunning semite
  some syrians like assad have blue eyes from steppe migrations and the crusaders means nothing she has a huge semite nose
  hardly ie at all like italians
  by retarded soviet anthropologists  ma1 has no genetic affinity towards east asians stop repeating this disinfo you faggot
  they are in very good company then with african americans
  chg had blue eyes too
  ma1 was 24 from the ena node stop your white supremacist bullshit he was partly asiatic
  this
  1/2 of mexicans are as west eurasian as ma1 and mexicans are legally white in the united states
  legally but not scientifically and the fact that they changed the legal definition should tell you as much
  he was western eurasian deal with it
  protip asia refers to anatolia    ane is not a branch off of the chinese/japanese/korean/mongolian no matter how you spin it     i know what youre trying to reach here but itll never be a thing because we are talking about an ancient population of protohumans that predate moronic skull theories from the 18th century
first analysis shows ane malta 1 as 60 mongoloid
second analysis shows ane malta 1 as around 25 mongoloid
  30
    ma1 probably isnt the real ane but anssouth asianchg ans is a cleaner mix of onge and kostenki
  it also shows ma1 as being amerind  but he wasnt rather amerinds are related to him
    mongoloid caucasoid are not terms modern population geneticists need to worry about because they can get the scientifically and mathematically complete picture with ancient dna samples    none of the graphs you use even use those terms so the argument is entirely selfinserted
  protip ena mean eastern nonafrican aka the stuff east asians are made of
  not a branch but it had admixture from the ena node pulling it towars east asia relative to say whg
  mexicans are white    jajajajja
  not only east asians obviously since ma1 isnt east asian    but australian aboriginals papuans various pacific islander peoples  so on too    so really you dont have a point
  its from the east asian side not the papuan as it lacks denisovan admix
    with these remains of a young kid were all sorts of cultural items one of which was a venus figurine lead researcher eske willerslev from the university of copenhagen told the nature podcast    these venus figurines are found all the way west of this area into europe    the researchers estimate that 1438 of the ancestry of native americans traces to a population like the one living at malta 24000 years ago    but the most puzzling part of this finding was that the boy showed no clear affinities with east asian populations such as the chinese koreans or japanese    todays native americans are most closely related to east asians so the scientists had to work out how the malta boy could be related to indigenous americans but not to east asians    native americans are composed of the meeting of two populations  an east asian group and these malta west eurasian populations said dr willerslev however it remains unclear where this mixing took place    the research could help explain some longstanding anomalies in the study of native american origins    for example some early american skeletons  such as the 9000yearold kennewick man from washington state  bear physical features that according to some are typical of europeans and unlike those of modern native american groups or east asians
  why are white supremacists so afraid of having mongoloid heritage theyre even ready to be abbos as long as theyre not mongolid
  the new paper on native americans already cruahed all hope for kennewick man to be anything but a typical native american
  otherwise good but then you started selfinserting manipulative rhetoric to it     eastern nonafrican literally means what the name implies  anything eastern nonafricans just like west eurasian makes no attempt at distinguishing whg from enf
  why are antiwhite faggots so desperate to mischaracterize the evidence    ena isnt exclusive to east asians cope harder       um sweetie that bbc article already makes it clear why western eurasian features are to be expected in some typical native americans
  in our model k14 fits well as unadmixed aside from archaic introgression but ma1 receives in addition to its archaic admixture a component of eastern eurasian ancestry the latter gene flow explains the preliminary residual f4 ma1 k14 ami ustishim which is of a similar form to several other relatively poorly fitting statistics from our initial graph for example f 4 ma1 k14 ami new guinea  200 fitted 008 z  268 and f 4 ma1 ustishim ami new guinea  173 fitted 008 z  249 we added this admixture into our model with its bestfitting source position near the root of the east asian lineage and mixture proportion 174 east asianrelated ancestry 95 ci 77274    boom wn incel status btfo
  the ena ma1 had was see 
  paleolithic humans are always very interesting arent they but ultimately irrelevant unless youre a time traveler with archaic dna
  why is suggesting that ma1 was partly east asian rather than part abbo antiwhite again youd think mongoloids would be a better pop to wuz over than papuans
  there is no imaginary east asian or papuan side ma1 is from preeast asian protohumans
  what do you mean archaic samples can make modern population relatedness a lit easier to discern they are very much central to modern population genetics later on with more and better quality genomes it will even be possible to estimate say the prevalence of harmful mutations in populations
  youre the one here with an abnormal need to push an agenda the fact that you use racist skull category terms and call us racist makes it obvious    back to r/aznidentity with you wumao
  of course there are see   the fits were significantly worse with papuans or new guineans as reference    we added this admixture into our model with its bestfitting source position near the root of the east asian lineage and mixture proportion 174 east asianrelated ancestry 95 ci 77274
  i use what i feel will make white supremacists most unconfortable if you want scientific names read this 
  i meant it in regards to the racial nature of extremely archaic genomes who dont have any apparent modern relatives today like ma1     things like that outside of individual genes like you mentioned have no relevancy today for the already formed races and identities
ustishim man is drawn more to dai chinese than to europeans
  related is not saying anything new here its not distinguishing it in any way its an eastern protohuman obviously based on its age     you dont even like population genetics otherwise you wouldnt have such an attitude problem genuinely curious people dont have an attitude problem
ustishim man haplogroup k2 is the ancestor of malta 1 haplogroup r
  where does it say it draws dai chinese dai chinese are there as a proxy for something they arent anywhere near the same age as ustishim not even close    ustishim was so ambiguous from a racial point of view from the getgo that its hilarious you can somehow make a straw man argument out of this against white supremacist in reality you just hate genuinely curious people like me who is interested in population genetics and in turn make yourself the biased supremacist    there is absolutely nothing wrong with archaic humans being archaic humans and not european
  its from close to the east asian root youre happy to call ma1 west eurasian but reject me actually providing f3 stats to prove that they are partly east asian remember the argument was about ma1 being pure west eurasian which it isnt its clearly you who has a problem with being partly east asian most likely because youre a white supremacist who believes in racial purity
  i am not the guy you were talking to you mongoloid
  ma1 had extra relatedness with east asians when compared with ust ishim if you actually understood genetics you could have gotten that info from this post already 
  who cares not like it makes my post any less true
  they have extra extra extra relatedness to whoever they actually descent from if you find their actual relatives then dai chinese will look nothing more than a silly proxy    it goes without saying that a modern population cannot be the ancestor of tens of thousands of years old protohumans
    174 east asianrelated   hmmm see below    these signals in fact appear to reflect shared drift between a subset of western eurasian huntergatherers including ma1 and mesolithic europeans such as loschbour and east asians    ma1 is predominantly western eurasian but has minor bidirectional eastern eurasian admixture  wow white supremacy btfo    we note that a recent study lazaridis et al 2016 found a cline of ma1relatedness among a large number of presentday eastern eurasian populations and argued for admixture from west to east instead while the present analysis supports the other direction an important subject for future work will be to reconcile these results    its funny that youre just going to ignore this  to draw a more precise analogy we repeated the modelfitting without k14 in the graph so that ma1 was the only western eurasian population present in the same way that ustishim is the only representative of its lineage    overall our model supports a rapid radiation of eurasian populations following an outofafrica dispersal in line with results from uniparental markers karmin et al 2015 posth et al 2016 here this pattern is reflected in the near trifurcations among the main eastern and western eurasian clades plus ustishim with oase 1 splitting very close as well and at the base of the eastern clade among andamanese australasians and east asians    andamanese australasians and east asians  andamanese australasians and east asians          denisova to ma1     12   05   06    we find suggestive new evidence for denisovarelated ancestry  in ma1    you were saying ma1 does actually have denisova admixture so the likelyhood of his ena being melanesoid in derivation increases dramatically which is fitting    btfo
  you might think so but papuans have blondism so its a more parsimonious explanation
  the argument was about ma1 being pure west eurasian  lol no  youd just like it to be so you can call people nazis
  youre happy to call ma1 west eurasian  i never called it that in the entire time i was in this thread you have nothing more than straw men as your argument r/aznidentity
  can you read subhuman they tried adding papuans and new guineans as outgroups but got significantly worse fits its from the east asian side accept it    it took a long time to get you admit even to the bidirectional flow youre very fucking clearly a race purist
a few weeks back they found haplogroup p1 from 19th century andaman islanders  this is pretty huge since previously its been detected only in luzon aboriginals but now its pansundaland  ane is definitely nondenisovan admixed sundalandcentral asian outgroup to paleolithic europeans i wonder if some of the haplogroup c in siberia is actually west eurasian by origin since thats the connection to paleolithic europe
  why the fuck do you push yourself into arguments youre nit s part of without making it clear youre not the same anon the one i was arguing with argued for ma1 being west eurasian
  its two people in the entire thread  what a simpleton meanwhile the poster count says 21    ill leave you whit this link since youre so butthurt    adult asian men also have smaller testicles than european and hispanic men average testicle weight is about 33 lower in asians than in caucasians estimated daily sperm production in chinese men is also less than half of that estimated for hispanic and caucasian men according to the same study    
  dude they say right here  that their particular results are contradicted by lazaridis et al the issue isnt settled    by all means continue to attack my character / motivations  it makes you look very thirsty and is rhetorically ineffective    you will continue to ignore the fact that ma1 is western eurasian because it triggers your autist ocd or something idk
  ane is definitely nondenisovan admixed  bbut ma1 had denisovan admixture    its pansundaland  awesome
  complains about pseudiscience terms like mongoloid  turns to muhh dikkk when gets btfo    see i told you you were a white supremacist incel trying to muh whyte dikk this couldnt be better proof the best thing here is that im not even asian i just hate white supremacists    see this is where the argument began  not my fault you jump into things youre not a part of
  the issue of the asian admixture being east asian and not papuanlike is conclusively proven with the f3 analysis i posted that was never under question even in the study
  ma1 is western eurasian and east eurasian mutt cope more
  ongelike specifically
      interestingly the ma1 individual shows little to no genetic affinity to modern populations from the region from where he originated  south siberia    the genome of ma1 indicates that prehistoric populations related to modern western eurasians occupied a wider geographical range into northeast eurasia than they do today    this genetic affinity between ma1 and native americans is mediated by a gene flow event from ma1 into the first americans which can explain between 1438 of the ancestry of modern native americans with the remainder of the ancestry being derived from east asians        similarly we find autosomal evidence that ma1 is basal to modernday western eurasians and genetically closely related to modernday native americans      with  no   close   affinity   to   east   asians    this suggests that populations related to contemporary western eurasians had a more northeasterly distribution 24000 years ago than commonly thought    gene flow from the ma1 lineage into native american ancestors could explain why several crania from the first americans have been reported as bearing morphological characteristics that do not resemble those of east asians213     our findings reveal that western eurasian genetic signatures in modernday native americans derive not only from postcolumbian admixture as commonly thought but also from a mixed ancestry of the first americans
  thats an older outdated study try again
  its the study
  the direction is the opposite in this ma1 didnt contribute to modern east asians but was a mixture of west and east eurasian itself
  you will continue to ignore the fact that ma1 is western eurasian    but you literally denied this a few minutes ago you backtracking pos 
  its the earliest study from 2013 what i quoted is from 2017 nice try
  thats not me you schizo
  trying to muh whyte dikk this couldnt be better proof  next time try having a civil discussion then maybe we wont fight fire with fire chang the reddit sub which you come from is clearly asian supremacist in the closet anyway funny you always try to deny it
  again if youre gonma jump into an argument make it known this is an anonymous board after all how can i argue with two distinct people with different theories youre just gonna take turns and if the other one gets btfo he goes silent while the other tries and so on so fucking tiring
  go to bed
  i have been nothing but on point i never went into muh dikkisms or even suggested that east asian ancestry is all that great you just got instantly triggered because you hate asians thats why you even go through some asian incel reddits because they are the other side of the coin for white supremacist incels like you     its kind of how nazis are obsessed with jews because jews ate most like they would want to be ethnocentric intelligent rich succesful and have a great history to fall back on everything nazis desire from whites
  how about this you stick to replying to whatever you are said instead of trying to second guess whos behind which anonymous poster    ive been called silesian this and moroccan that a million times and its never accurate stop wasting your time
  look what i said already happened the other anon fell silent hoping you would save the discussion no doubt he will return when the direction of the argument looks favorable to him
  sorry to break it to you but the inability to understand social cues is said to be by doctors a sign of autism    its not me saying this its doctors    nobody here likes pushy people shoving things in their face aggressively without any intention of playing nice    in situations like that there tends to be push back online or outside of your house you may try it if you will put your shoes on and go fuck with some dude on the street if you dont believe me
  see im not this anon   im actually this anon    
/his/ really needs ids
  accurate 
  haha no
  nobody here likes pushy people shoving things in their face aggressively without any intention of playing nice    again i didnt start this argument the anon that made agressively overconfident assertations did it was me who was pushing against posts like these   thats the first post i replied to the thread was alreadh rife with bullshit like arguing over mongolioids and their phenotypes funny how that was nice in your eyes but me using f3 to demonstrate ma1 being partly east asian was not nice but hurtful antiwhite propaganda from aznmasculinity its pretty fucking late to act like the victim here
  sentinelese bbc spawned ane and you cant claim otherwise
  andamanese are different from the east asian austronesian natives like on the adjecent nicobar islands and the ami of taiwan pic related are closest to the east asian like signal in ma1 not the andamanese like negritos theyre clearly what race theoerists would describe as mongoloid
  so one guy 100 posts up said something and you cant comprehend that there are more than one poster willing to discuss the same thing     lol how the hell do you even know he believes in racial purity a white supremacist doesnt need to think that they are made up of one unbroken lineage from a million years ago to be proud of themselves as they are neither do any other ethnicity who by the way are far more ethnocentric than whites currently chinese saudi arabians south africans etc    the whole ane discussion doesnt even matter if you all you do is bang pots and pans about your straw man none of us support
  the amis chinese 阿美族 pinyin āměizú also ami or pangcah are an austronesian ethnic group native to taiwan  one of the sixteen officially recognized groups of taiwanese aborigines    you were saying  austronesian
  ami didnt exist 30k years ago as theyre east asians andamanese are much older and genetically intact  your bias is really obvious
  austronesians spread from east asia to oceania and mixed with the papuan like natives amis and the nicobarese look like mongoloids not like australoids or andamanese    the best fit is with ami not onge
  this out of taiwan model has been challenged by a 2008 study examination of mitochondrial dna lineages shows that they have been evolving within island southeast asia isea for a longer period than previously believed population dispersals occurred at the same time as sea levels rose which may have resulted in migrations to the philippines as far north as taiwan within the last 10000 years27 the migrations were likely driven by climate change  the effects of the drowning the sundaland subcontinent which had extended the asian landmass as far as borneo and java this happened during the period 15000 to 7000 years ago following the last glacial maximum rising sea levels in three massive pulses caused flooding and the partial submergence of the sunda subcontinent creating the java and south china seas and the thousands of islands that make up indonesia and the philippines today25 genetic evidence found in 2016 indicates that movements of people from taiwan to the islands of south east asia did occur albeit smaller in scale which nevertheless may have brought about linguistic and cultural changes28    arent hawaiians austronesian    anyways since its evident that p came from sundaland its not surprising at all that ma1 is east eurasian admixed 17
  you conveniently ignored all the parts that clearly affirm the north to south spread    and yes even hawaian is austronesian but polynesian languages spread from oceania after the austronesians mixed with the papuan like natives
  youre no different than eastern europeans who cant accept r isnt european or west eurasian  ami are a better fit than papuans because papuans have extremely high levels of denisovan admixture
  onge dont yet ami are still a better fit
  lying isnt gonna work
a double burial of two children was identified at malta covered by a stone slab the oldest individual was a single homo sapiens boy of about 34 years old ma1 wearing a necklace of beads several pendants and an ivory diadem partial remains include parts of the cranium mandible and maxilla and several postcranial bones the second child is only represented by teeth both have slightly shovelshaped incisors a characteristic of north american and modern siberian people
  shg had edar and blonde hair too based siberians were like a fantasy race completely out of the realm of todays races
  interesting maybe shovel shaped incisors are not fully thanks to edar
  k14s teeth lack incisor shoveling this likely means that k14 had the ancestral state of edar gene and the upper second molars are large buccolingually but small mesiodistally    
  i really dont even have to try as the counter argument from you is muh andamanese bbc
  kostenski 14 is not ma1 its way older ane were basically kostenski  east asian
  even the short text in the link already tells me your source is shit out of america hypothesis thats a new one
  p1 is a paternal line of the andamanese people its possible that they mixed also with east asian women before meeting the girls from the kostenkirelated population but does this really fit in with your biased narrative
  its not d is
  moroccan fingers typed this post go on deny it
  theyre both from the same area and present in andamanese ami dont have p1
  lol no
    see     kostenki 14 is about the same mix that malta 1 is
  ma1 on a line from whg to onge  delete this
  close your mouth retard ma 1 is only 15 north east asian   afontova gora 7   and ehg only 5 in k7  they were evolving little by little to europeans after thousands of years of evolution
  is the australasian admixture that was erased in the next tend of thousands years
  strange how the ehg examples that get posted are only the few russian reconstructions from ages ago
  almost like they have an agenda
do you understand that at least one third of your life you dont even operate your body that you is just a little part of your brain the part responsible for consciousness in fact the only function of your body that youre able to control is breathing you cannot control when you get asleep when you get awake when you fall in love when youre attracted to someone you cannot control your blood preasure temperature heartbeat skins moisture levels of hormones and so on    do you wonder about death    do you know that if you died asleep you wouldnt even realize it because there is less than nothing after death even darkness is an object we can imagine darkness even nothing is object its still something because we can define nothing as absence of everything its still an object in our mindset whereas memory cells in our brain linked to that definition so that we can discuss about nothing therefore after death is
wrong there are 72 virgins waiting for me in heaven
well yeah the five skhandas are empty    form is void void is form we are like mirrors reflecting all things which pass by but the things themselves never remain
  how do you realize that you are in heaven if you cannot even realuze that you are in a dream you consciousness are shut down during that period does a computer realize that its shut down without a battery in mother board of course
seems no one cares
how long did it take for europe to emerge as a distinct homogeneous cultural entity
    i dont know ask again when its happened
  charlamange
  europe  distinct homogeneous cultural entity
    cmon lets be realistic     grecoroman legacy  christianity   formerly feudal
  this at the very least charlemagne kicked off the idea of europe being its own thing
this post is so american i got fatter
  rome started it
  what do you mean by europe and how homogenous do you mean latter is greatly subjective term
europe is just christian territory surrounded by muslim territory so as a sort of shared culture it was something during the late stages of the ottoman empire
  probably behind the stalwart of the byzantines so this guys actually right    battle of tours onwards
europe  homogeneous  ever
  reonquista death estimates 7million in the 8th century this is when world populations like 8
serious answer probably several generations in the eu if it manages to survive that long but by that that i mean people would feel european on a much deeper level than now but that doesnt mean the actual nationalities and languages would disappear or be neglected as some retards like to claim it would just take years for people to be born with the european idea that were not that different and were certainly better off together while being surrounded by arabs and russians and trying to stay relevant in a world with the americans and chinese
  fuck off hans
  hans
the creation of the eu if at all speaking of which the uk just voted to get out of the eu its flooded with immigrants from other outside europe countries there are still nations that wish the soviet russia was still around there is still a sense of nationalist superiority and if there isnt a civil war about the break out in the balkan countries then its gona be close soon only someone from outside of europe or possibly from the uk or france would say that europe is a whole entity   looking at some of the other statements here referring to christendom or nato you had wars of religion and over seat of thrones up until wwi then you have wwii and then theres the commie countries that still hadnt been apart of europe up until the past two decades
  the uk just voted to get out of the eu  that was like two years ago    if there isnt a civil war about the break out in the balkan countries  the fuck are you talking about
  one week moving around europe would make it clear it isnt a single distinct homogeneous cultural entity european countries are not like us states
  none of those are exclusive to europe nor defining throughout all europe
  how
  its literally fucking obvious anon i live in the uk and if i go on holiday to almost anywhere in the european mainland the culture change is greater than if i went to the us even going to the stranger parts of fucking scotland would feel very foreign these countries have a huge number of differences
  greece has riots practically every other day almost all of which turn violent if they dont start that way already   bosnia still hasnt gotten their shit together from the war the list goes on romania serbiankorsovo problems the sides have already been drawn the supporters of nato and the eu vs russia/china its far from a world war but i assure you if you live in the region you are aware that war is come
  i think youre so used to living near each other that any minor differences seem bigger than they really are
  ill add that even inside a european country you have dozens of distinct cultural entities
  in that case nothing is exclusive to europe because the european cultral sphere included the mediterranean coast you say this means asia and africa has the legacy of rome and christianity but youre only fooling yourself
  that makes zero sense it should be the opposite if anything
  let me just list school textbook tier western values  its almost like western europe isnt the only place that inherits a similar legacy
polfags hating eu  since roman times you utter imbeciles  who is the 3rd rome who is 2nd rome rightful heir to the roman empire roman law rome rome rome rome
  we can only hope
  this  the entire idea of hre was built on european universalism
  turkey also claimed to be rome  is turkey europe anon
can we make one thing clear to everyone here  turksmellistan is not europe ok nor is the fucking caucasus
  rome was a mediterranean empire
  i wouldnt say it was homogenous ie the same but i would say that there definitely is and has been for quite a long time a feeling of europeaness ie being north of the mediterranean west of asia and of being christian and no albnians are not european
  it was before trks claimed it ottomans declaring themselves rome was a power play to cuck russia
  how is that fooling your first two criteria absolutely apply to places such as the levant and your last criteria barely applies to all of europe
  around the napoleoantic era before that a person wouldnt say they were from france but rather from the city they were born in nationalism came with greater communication among people between cities economic specialization in particular cities helped to drive this as well
  i realize i didnt answer the question at all fuck europe became one when all the great men left/killed bunch of beta bitches and ugly women left
on june 3 as the german attackers fought their way in to the forts central structure both sides descended into hell or something like it with the ferocious combat inside the forts reinforced concrete passageways    the conditions were beyond imagination even by the horrifying standards of the first world war in addition to machine guns and rifles both sides made liberal use of grenades in the narrow corridors blowing out mens eardrums and often killing them through shockwaves alone and the germans employed flamethrowers to send fire down vents and through doorways burning french and occasionally by accident german soldiers alive and filling enclosed spaces with toxic smoke     the fort was filled with dead bodies that quickly began to decompose in the summer heat and the french were now shelling the germans occupying the roof relentlessly    capping it all off raynal discovered that the french garrison now trapped in the fort was running out of water it turned out the gauge on the forts cistern showing a full water supply was broken    just
  lmao they could have just besieged it until they gave up from thirst
  the germans didnt know the french water supplies were broken
  and often killing them through shockwaves alone    is that even possible wtf
how the fuck would it even be possible for like a thousand germans to lying dead inside such a cramped area surely theyd pile up too high and it would become impossible to press forward
  the real fort was quite larger than the bf1 map if thats what youre using as reference  and i guess the germans would remove their dead from the important corridors
    whatever francois this is like the only stand you made before surrendering to hitler and letting the real american men save you    cucks
  this is ww1 we are talking about retard
  but hitler did take part in ww1  not sure if the americans did though
  wrong war buddy
  how the fuck would it even be possible for like a thousand germans to lying dead inside such a cramped area  cockroaches tend to stick together in very tight areas it seems natural that an insectoid species as the germans would share a similar skill
  very funny mister yuropoor  france and britain would have lost by 1917 without us
    whatever cuck we won that one too and no one cares about that old shit    but keep screaming it was her turn if it makes you feel better
  bait
  there werent any american soldiers on the frontline in 1917
  yup it bursts the blood vessels in your lungs
imagine what charlemagne would have thought if he was told his descendents a millenium later would blow each others ears to death in some ugly underground castle
  yes it happened at hiroshima
  ah yes that was when a hand grenade was dropped on japan proving that shock waves from these infantry weapons can in fact kill with shockwaves
    
  living with stupidity must be painful for you
  image being this new
  how the hell did they kill or injure 2000 krauts did they have artillery lying around
  defending in narrow corridors is easier than attacking
  hed be proud desu
  mutt pls
  thats how most explosions kill people shrapnel can potentially miss vital organs and arteries shockwaves hit everything
  yeah you can be killed by a submarine sonar if youre close enough
  what about the guys in the submarine
reminder that trump skipped the 100 year celebration honoring the deaths of americans who fought and died in conditions very much like this in 100 years people will remember that america wasnt there to pay honor to our victorious dead
to me it seems more like just a decolonisation war
you mean the american colonial insurgency
    it transformed american society from mere colonial holdings into the first modern constitutional republic that had real power behind it     while the dutch republic preceded the united states by two centuries and was itself greatly influential on the constitution it always existed in the shadow of more powerful monarchies such as great britain and spain the dutch could not spread their form of government outside of their borders very easily the united states on the other hand inspired a copycat revolution in france with a decade of its creation and within 30 years had inspired much of latin america to throw off their european rulers and establish similar forms of government to varying degrees of success
  you mean the great frenchbacked creaturan chimpout
  based
  you mean la rebelión de los gobelinos
  decolonisation  it was literally a british civil war   it was the american war of independence and it was nothing like decolonization nor was it a revolution anything like that savagery in france
  copycat revolution  fuck no those animals in france were nothing like my ancestors or the founding fathers
  the actual governments of the colonies/states didnt change significantly it was much more a war of independence or secession or something than any proper revolution
  this
  complete and utter cringe mob rule is the rule of the people
  the american civil war was the last of the great british jacobinist chimpouts and the most successful one
  lot of experimentation with enlightened ideals at the time     gave the enlightenists ideas dangerous ones like the idea that republics can actually work
  first modern constitutional republic that had real power behind it   usa wasnt a relevant country until 1865  while the dutch republic preceded the united states by two centuries and was itself greatly influential on the constitution it always existed in the shadow of more powerful monarchies such as great britain and spain  maybe because the usa was oppossed by injuns and the dutch by real countries    the united states on the other hand inspired a copycat revolution in france  do americans actually believe this
  the united states on the other hand inspired a copycat revolution in france  americans actually belive this bullshit
            obsessed and seething
    virtually all of them wrote new constitutions in the period a few enacted universal male suffrage or even abolished slavery the anglican churchs role in government was abolished and a good chunk of the aristocracy fled to canada and britain
the war of lord northern aggression
  denying reality   reminder that brazil is what america will resemble in 20 years
    tocqueville
  a lot of the political and social developments evolved during the previous decades thats true the war just consolidated them
  lol nice white nationalist meme
  its just some yanks chimping out over some tea taxes barely mattered in the grand scheme of things
  the grand scheme of things was you getting cucked out of your empire by said nation
  only if trump stays in office
how did the us go from these well educated gentlemen to donald fucking trump
  degenerating into a two party system
  they gave women and uneducated right to vote
  unironically democracy
why wont drumpf release his tax returns
  populism
  from  jefferson washington lincoln roosevelt ike nixon  to  george w bush obama trump  21st century seems to produce rather low quality leaders desu
  how did the us go from the founding fathers to this guy who hated all the ideas of america and limited government
  fuck the government
  wasnt their shit flinging just as bad as ours
  the anglo percentage of the free population went from 80 upon independence to anywhere between 10 and 20 today do the math
  blumpf is finished
  trump is the best president of the last 4 of them
  yeah but at least they used to be well educated in multiple fields speak multiple languages and write in coherent and beautiful english as opposed to bigly and i am like very smart
  why would anyone introduce social security and welfare during the great depression when communist and fascist uprisings were happening everywhere  gee he sure ruined america by saving it
  anglos were 55 of the 1789 population that 85 figure includes any british ancestry including the irish and wlsh
  i have the utmost contempt for you sir  verily we shall settle this with a duel  i love how casually and eloquently they settled personal disputes
  the founding fathers were wrong if you put too much emphasis on freedom liberty and the pursuit of happiness then you risk people becoming libertines and/or only caring about their own selfinterests you have to balance individualism and freedom with harmony community and the pursuit of inner contentment if you dont seek a balance and tilt more to the side of the founding fathers overly individualist nonsense you get vapid  consumerist whores like modern americans however if you tilt more to more to the side of what i am saying you get conformists who lack capacity for innovation or free thought you have to seek balance by finding a balance you can still have innovation at a good rate while having stability that prevent destabilizing decisions that jeopardize community    you are some of the stupidest pieces of shit imaginable to not understand this i am like a god compared to you utter imbeciles you have no one to blame but yourselves for your mistakes the founding fathers were complete imbeciles especially compared to me
  the vast majority of irish in america at that time were scots irish protestant anglo settlers from the english/scottish border regions irish catholics didnt come in large numbers until 19th century
  reminder that trump was right in rejecting the retarded climate change bill and currently has more support than macron the wimp larping as a roman emperor has        europoors are still feudal minded automatons who lack the individualism and crazy creativity of americans they do whatever and believe whatever those above them tell them and will mock anyone who doesnt as stupid
  britain is not exactly a better country either bong
  currently has more support than macron  thats cause americans are very partisan bush had better approval rating than macron has during the fucking recession
  americans  my president may be doing bad things but i voted for him and im gonna be a diehard supporter regardless of what he fucking does based  europeans  holy shit how the fuck did i even think of voting for this putain guess i made a mistake time to protest  americans are proud of their partisanship apparently
    tfw we dont live in the timeline where the kingfish lived and was elected in 1936  inb4 hoi fag
  obama is shit  he was above average
  the anglo  welsh chads are responsible for everything good in america
  i think hes definitely more of a mixed bag but his foreign interventions were just as if not more destructive than dubyas
  probably because we let idiots that cant differentiate the difference between politics and history vote
    no youre right the entire country descending into anarchy to reject macrons climate change ideas which trump was scolded for rejecting means its much better than america
  in a few cases it was a lot worse
  ahahahahaha
  how so 
  he failed to get anything of real consequence passed during 2 years of absolute power other than acawhich was not a revolutionary shit anyway also what this anon said was a huge minus
  fuck off you stupid fucking larptard faggot fdr wasnt half as bad as that corrupt retard from shitty fucking frogswamp state
  people dislike it therefore it must be the wrong thing to do  retard alert i bet you think democracy is good too normies are always going to ree when gas prices go up but they need to be raised to encourage new patterns of consumption which are less harmful otherwise we will destroy everything
  welsh are just as anglo as the english and scottish and so are the ulsterscotch anglo isnt a synonym for anglosaxon it means englishspeaker of great british descent
  its still around 30 of the white population
  the government needs to dictate the freemarket over bullshit feel good nonsense  calling others retards  lol
  yeah lets exponentially grow forever like a fucking cancer and scratch our heads wondering what happened when we ruined the one planet which was given to us the free market is nothing but a mechanism to maximize human misery and environmental destruction
  unironically worshiping corporations when hes a neet who just listens to ben shapiro
  a better question would be how we went from them to jackson
  probably a smart man like me and claims none
  when did he ever have absolute power i dont think you understand the us political system
  20092011 he had house and 60senate votes
  governments have always dictated markets there was never a time where the free market was out of reach from the government the fuel excise protests in france is no different than the whiskey rebellion    also i hope you dont view climate change a non controversial reality with mounting evidence as bullshit feel good nonsense so far you sound like a retarded /pol/ tourist
  the horrors of neoliberalism and cryptoimperialism
  if literally every democratic legislator were a robot who would rubber stamp anything obama willed to be done sure it probably wouldve been in the interests of the democrats to do that desu
  boiling our oceans is good because france mismanage its tax burden
how come punjaabs and chihchongs have such a huge population while others dont   thoughts
  all indians are punjabi  what an awful thread you should feel like shit for making this thread this is a garbage thread only capable of being made by a garbage man go commit not alive please
  mongols and timur destroyed mesopotamias irrigation network so iraqs population never recovered otyoman rule raped the agriculture of egypt and mesopotamia and left them at low population density egypt only began recovering in the 19th century under muhammad ali
rice is easy to grow and can feed large population
intensive wet rice agriculture same reason for vietnam and bangladesh
  western china and india have the best possible land to sustain large populations
  aaw im so saawwy for hurting your feeeviwngs
  xinjiang and tibet are the worst for sustaining large populations deserts and mountains even western han provinces like gansu have less people than the east
  have you noticed that the only people on here with paper thin skins are indians  could you maybe be taking things a tiny bit personally
  it could be an angry paki punjabi who made that post not an indian
  rice
  go commit not alive please  what
  low migration pressure due to toprgaphic bottlenecks atlai himilayas allowing for native population expansion to natural limits along spatiotemperence
pacific indian ocaens too
  rice
  could you elaborate on how the ottomans messed it up
  islamic eastern trhace
  punjabis make up less then 2of the population of india
  
  punjabs based friends amigo
  better climate for agriculture for the same land they create more calories than in europe etc etc
so basically  regime is suppressing the minority so we should get rid of that   but in order to do that we should have absolute regime a strict dictatorship that literally controls everything   did i understand this correctly
  no
  please explain 
oppresses you

  could very well be right wing libertarian and hate monarchist swine
  4th from left indy neidell
sorry lad but despite being a hugely staunch republican horrible histories has made me unable to hate monarchies leave em alone    
   you sissy cuck  if youre not at least a republican you dont belong to this world
republicans need to be purged from this board along with the stormfags and commies
  serious question why did monarchs in this period all dress the same
  beautiful the ideal europe i wouldnt settle for anything less
  they had different costumes for everywhere they went so they were all wearing their very formal funeral in the uk clothes
  based and whte pilled
  the mad monarchist   what a surprise
  source of this joke
    he secretly produced some of the first porn movies in spain
  the mad monarchist is complete and utter shit his segment on china made my blood boil
  look its another seething monarchyfag
  oppresses  fuck off   god save the monarchy
tell me more about the french colonization of the united kingdom during the 11th century
  it never happened
  then how comes english language sound so french
  those were normans they didnt even speak french they spoke the norman dialect
  they didnt colonize it with people in the same way the americas were colonized they just ruled english people today are genetically basically anglosaxons  the influence the normans had on language culture religion and politics is undeniable though
  they colonized in the same way india was colonized by britain
  arguably moreso i think its more like spain and the philippines
  the norman dialect is a dialect of french from the british perspective the language they spoke was indistinguishable from french
  the norman dialect of which language you intellectual
  the best part about this image is that cavill is literally as anglosaxon as you can get
  thats the words not how commonly they are used  sight and sound come from germanic origin visibility and audibility come from latin in day to day english they use the germanic words more often
    the norman language is separate from the french language like picard and walloon they are all langue doïl
  the main reason for that is because of basic words like the or and though  also your latin examples have nothing to do with the normans
  french originated words are extremely common and youll find at least one in pretty much every sentence  the two words you used as exemple come directly from latin as opposed to those that entered english through french thats why theyre quite obscure and technical    but among french originated words you have people forest city river moutain place person point countryetc which are pretty basic words  you even have some words like use or able for which you cant find any germanic synonym
  the norman language is separate from the french language    nope it is a dialect subdivisions within one language of french language    old norman also called old northern french or old norman french was one of many langues doïl old french dialects      old norman french was still old french just like amrican english is still english  trying to deny this is just pathetic revisionist cope
daily reminder normandy was a duchy and as such was not part of france
reminder thats impossible to discuss anything french on /his/ due to the hordes of screeching anglos
  youre a complete retard  it was a duchy within the kingdom of france not an independent country  kinda like texas is a state within the us
  duchies are subdivisions within a kingdom  you never played ck2
  im a retard the kingdom of france did not exist at the time champ
  umm try again sweatie i was just playing ck2 and believe me the duchy of normandy is inside the kingdom of france
  epic troll bruh
  ok now youre just baiting
  the kingdom of france has existed since 843
  dieu et mon droit
  dieu le roi
    cope        the norman dialect  not a french dialect    lol anglids always so insecure all of france spoke dialects at that time langues doil and so did england         except they never left
    vassal of the french king    tard
      anglid needs to cope somehow literally colonized the english state didnt even have english as its official language untill the 16th century
  heh mate do you know what the famous 100 years war was about
  and have yet to master even the english language  makes me laugh every time
  this is correct  united kingdom didnt exist in the 11th century
  there was no colonization england had 2 million people back then while only about ten thousand normans settled in england they barely had any genetic impact and the majority of england today is anglosaxon
name one successful establishment anglo saxon in england
  england
  the majority of england today is anglosaxon    anglo celtic
swallow wrote an account of the voyage which included a visit to japan before reaching canton this was generally dismissed as fantasy however in 2017 this account was compared with japanese records of an unwelcome visit by a british vessel off the town of mugi tokushima on shikoku in 1830 and matched in many points  makita hamaguchi a local samurai sent disguised as a fisherman to check the ship for weapons wrote an account of the episode which included watercolour sketches of the ship and its crew another samurai chronicler called hirota noted the crew offered gifts including an object he later drew which has since been identified as a boomerang the mutineers were desperately low on water firewood and supplies but were attacked and sent away by the japanese in line with the isolationist policy of the time  warwick hirst former curator of manuscripts at the state library of new south wales said that there were too many coincidences for it not to be true takashi tokuno chief curator at the archive of tokushima prefecture japan said there is a high probability the ship in japanese records was cyprus

  eh cund wan sum yarni
japanese depictions of foreigners are always on point
  noice
  another samurai chronicler called hirota noted the crew offered gifts including an object he later drew which has since been identified as a boomerang  roflmao

who is zheng jianghow did zheng jiang a become warlord is she a heroe or villain or murky shades of greyis zheng jiang a real leader how did she die what happened to her bandits
  not set in the late 1600s europe  fuck chinks i want to play as turenne
its rot3k at least half of all of it is straight up fiction
  zheng jiang is from the records of the three kingdoms actually she doesnt show up in the romance of the three kingdoms shes described as a bandit or probably two bandits in dongping whose clique was dealt quickly they only were mentioned because a woman/women led them    its interesting because the chinese commented that theyve never heard of this as most of lay chinese knowledge of the 3k is from the romance not the records creative assembly is working with rafe de crespigny after all who is the englishlingo authority of the three kingdoms both on the records and the romance
was he the most irrelevant president in recent years
  he was definitely viewed as a placeholder after nixon and the decision to pardon him instead of hold a trial ensured he would be unelectable

  how the fuck does the second sentence even flow from the first it doesnt sound any wiser than the sky is blue therefore someone must have painted it that way
king pseud swings and misses yet again
  god is the ultimate axiom
i dont understand
  how so
  axioms are truths that we have to accept in order to agree that other things related to that axiom are also true for example the definition of justice is an axiom and from that definition we can come to the conclusion that punishing criminals is just if we happen to disagree on what the definition of justice is its no longer an axiom and thus we no longer know whether its truly just to punish criminals  peterson is saying that unless we use god as an axiom we will never be able to agree on anything in our reality being true beyond a shadow of a doubt      if you have unfaultering faith in god then you can use that as a jumping off point for affirming other truths otherwise there will always exist doubts without belief in god there will always be that doubt in our minds that says how do i really know any of this is actually real belief in a higher power just fills in the gaps and allows you to lead all doubt back to god so you can say i know this is real because god    im not saying i agree with him but im pretty certain this is what hes trying to say the whole tweet sounds familiar and i think peterson is paraphrasing some philosopher i must have read but i cant remember who
  no gödel never claimed proof is impossible without an axiom incompleteness theorems established that sufficiently complex formal systems able to represent arithmetic always have statements about natural numbers that are both true and not provable within the system it basically means for any system a you can say this statement cant be proven by system a and you need another system b to prove that statement without contradicting yourself
  i meant to reply to  for the second part
being this much of a wanker  srsly if you are that faggots follower literally kys
hes basically mangling the transcendental proof for god he tried the same thing in his panel w/sam harris unfortunately sam didnt get it but peterson couldnt really press him on it because he himself doesnt really get it its frustrating watching this guy cherrypick things from more rightwing/traditional thought and pretend as if these ideas are compatible with liberalism pragmatism and darwinism when theyre not
  that just proves the axiom that all proof is ultimately unobjective which is an axiom
im a brainlet someone please explain to me how this is not true
  you cant its just an unfalsifiable meme
  conflating the mathematical meaning of axiom with standard use  cringe
  its just an unfalsifiable meme    is this the atheist argument for everything
  wheres the fucking context
  god here can only be defined as the prime unmover whatever that started it all it could really be anything it could be vishnu the the old testament god a flying spaghetti monster or some machine that creates universes according to some algorithm to advocate for a specific image of god would require much more than saying there has to be a beginning      invade a peasant country  shit up the place  get btfo by peasants  they do the same to you  reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
  fake tweet  peterson never said this  youre fake news op
  prime unmover  correction umoved mover
  no   dot is/khkvm
  hehe turtle
  attacking sentence structure when you have no argument
  or first cause prime cause prime mover
nonsequitor    the post
  spending time refuting an argument that is a non sequitur to begin with
someone post the chart you know the one
  the map of meaning
  no the map of you sucking my dick
sounds like some pseudo intellectual stuff
  belief in a higher power just fills in the gaps and allows you to lead all doubt back to god so you can say i know this is real because god  thatd be fine and dandy if it wasnt a total non sequitur
    non sequitur   what the fuck is that
  i dont understand it so it must be dumb
  how in fuck is this retard famous   seriously what the fuck even a first year philosophy freshman would destroy him
  i like peterson but when it comes to religious matters he is absolutely meme tier
  why not ungod being the ultimate axiom  what if we decide to just start with the premise of no god as default or many gods
  tortoise
  because he tells a large group of disaffected people what they want to hear
  i think therefore god is
  i like peterson but when it comes to religious matters he is absolutely meme tier
  if i have faith that walking through this dark alley will get me raped then its a prerequisite that i will get bum rushed
  its snowing outside where i am therefore its thursday
  not him but what does that have to do with anything
  or when it comes to anything outside of carl jung
  this is every single argument for the existence of god    uhhh god is omnipresent so if you fart then god is in your fart therefore god exists
  if this post is ironic then its pretty funny
  sniff
opinion the bible should be treated as a primary historical source
  is he trying to invoke the incompleteness theorems because if he is hes got no fucking idea what they say
  why dont yyou enlightenmen us oh wide atheist
  why are americans obsessed over this redditor
  yes
  you dont need to believe in god to act morally  stopped reading there
  if every human on earth took a pill that made us think torturing babies for fun was in fact good and virtuos    holy fuck thats what i call shooting yourself in the foot pill that makes you want torturing babies is fucking nonsense but god that wants you to torture babies is the fucking norm in large part of the world ever heard of circumcision
  circumcision bad
  cope harder burger
  child genital mutilation good  le grey man reddit memes good  found the mutt
    much mutilation  if you give it a mean sounding name it doesnt mean its bad
  you were probably ddenied sex because of your smegma filled dick and now you complain about how your parents didnt llove you and its all gods fault typical
  if you want to cut your dick with no painkillers be my guest but dont do it to people without their consent
  muh foreskin
  dios mioits unironically defending it
  torturing infants is bad  but when god says torture infants its suddenly good    thanks to proving my point
  how is it a nonsequitur god explains how the universe was created and why it is the way it is so that we dont have to spend time debating it our faith in god allows us to use him and everything he explains as axioms to debate other more pressing issues such as what is right and wrong which becomes an easy debate if both sides believe in god
  id say our existence would be more axiomatic
  i was thinking more like god is therefore i am
  because a god which hasnt been defined so im going to assume omniscient omnipotent omnipresent eternal has a mind and a perfect morality is a bigger axiomatic assumption than a simple force responsible for forming the universe naturally without those characteristics
    he is correct praise allah islam is the only logical belief
  sounds like gnosticism
  unironically this
  i dont see how those two are mutually exclusive and i dont see how a force could assemble the entire universe in all its complexity and meticulous detail and still be defined as simple
  simple is just a relative term to distinguish it from a god as i defined it
  are you a first year philosophy freshman then go ahead and destroy him here and now so that we may be convinced if you arent then are you a graduate with a philosophy major then you must be especially wise so go ahead and destroy him here and now so that we may be convinced or maybe just maybe you are you someone who never went to university who thinks they have anything of anything settled and certain in their mind lets hear your arguments otherwise youre wrong
  i see but i still dont think a natural force responsible for forming the universe is in anyway mutually exclusive of god as you described it
  i said without those characteristics so i explicitly made it mutually exclusive
  i thought its more like  i am therefore god is
  i dont know anything about basic validity  ok anon calm down
  i thought this post was gonna be an appeal to authority but instead it was back up your claim fucker and i appreciate that
  peterson cant be more postmodernist than he is now
  for some religions its possible like buddhism for example but if you argue against christianity if you pull off intersubjectivity to support that premise then its the same as admitting the communion being possible as the entire basis of all morality not just christianity
  morality has supernatural origin  lmao
  to justify the recognition of its existence it would need to originate from something transcendental
  to just justify the recognition  i dont know what this means    morality originates in human culture your turn and easy on the word salad
  are you honestly underaged or retarded thats not a word salad im clearly saying that for us to understand morality as being real as in being an objective universal force that is worth caring about rather then a meaningless cultural perspective as a result of brain signals in hairless apes made up of atoms made of mostly nothing it would need to originate from something higher then rationality
  morality can be considered by deriving what mans ends are which is reason    t kant
  thats all nice but why is the absence of doubt necessary
  oh boy theres a lot here  god explains how the universe was created and why it is the way it is  except not really nowhere is it stated at least in canonical christian works why god created the universe and made it the way it is with all details or even all important details addressed and to presume to know the mind of god is considered laughable at best and heretical at worst  so that we dont have to spend time debating it our faith in god allows us to use him and everything he explains as axioms to debate other more pressing issues  debating the how and why of the universe is enjoyable and can lend valuable perspective on our lives  such as what is right and wrong which becomes an easy debate if both sides believe in god  thats ridiculous even people from the same sect of the same religion may have very different ideas of what constitutes right and wrong in most cases and support them with equal amounts of scripture and scholarship
  i really want to visit the universe where 9/11 never happened and all the edgelords on /pol/ are muslim because its the most redpilled religion names and shames the jew puts women in their place wins wars was started by a guy that got tons of pussy but was so humble he forbade anyone from making pictures of him hates modern excess has cool lore like the djinn etc
  thank you reason is distinct from a god
  one long runon nonsensical sentence  yikes
  do they actually believe theres no objective right and wrong  it depends on the person but many of them really do  the ones that dont feel that way because even though theyre aware of the cultural influence on them they cant shake it off  also that pic doesnt say why the proposition that any given thing or indeed everything is illusory is clearly false let alone unreasonable
  why do you presume the people youre talking to have the same requirement you do that morality be objective or universal especially at this point
  when is this guy going to debate dawkins so we can finally see whose memes reign supreme
  because otherwise you might as well be arguing that there is only one way to interpret a novel if a morality is not objective it is meaningless      m8 its your problem not mine if youre a brainlet
  just what is good or bad for the species  as if all three abrahamaic religions arent  just what is good or bad for the ideological tribe   even christians stopped giving a fuck about those outside of their religion or even sect throughout many parts of history not worshipping the right god the right way must be an agent of the devil or so the mentality would go and still sometimes goes
  youre misunderstanding why do you presume that the people youre talking to or about dont already view morality as meaningless or why do you think they have a problem with that
  they may i in fact go back in forth between an objective reality and a meaningless reality without one it is logically sound to think such a way    im only saying that for morality to not be meaningless nonsense it would have to be based in the transcendental basically sam harris is a brainlet
  objective morality
  they may i in fact go back in forth between an objective reality and a meaningless reality without one it is logically sound to think such a way  is english your first language
  yes
  proof is impossible without an axiom so use this particularly retarded axiom
so whatever happened to i think therefore i am i dont think you need to believe in god to know of your own existence or anything else for that matter
  descartes concluded god exists in meditations bruh    not that i agree with him but if youre going to quote meditations you should know the contents
  oof that put him in his place
  no it didnt
bbased
  i think peterson is paraphrasing some philosopher i must have read but i cant remember who  iirc its aristotele with his notion of unmovable motor of everything
  nahhhhh
    this is a very good post
  unironically based
  this is not about sentence structure this is about his whole point being a non sequitur
why did god created
  not everything descartes said is truth
  are you retarded the faith in the existence of a creator god is the explanation for how and why in itself
  can you fucking niggers stop this shit somebody give me an instance of god claiming that circumcision is a requirement outside of a specific covenant with abrahams house it sure as fuck isnt in the goddamned commandment
  why wouldnt it be it is a valid point
  does change the fact that jews and protestants have been doing it for thousands of years
  why yes it does change the fact considering the question is of a faith in god resulting in baby torture when in actuality it was a goddamned humanenforced tradition a fucking jewish practice with no relation to the actual bible that dumbfucks followed for no reason other than mmuh politics said so
  every single fucking aspect of judaism is human enforced and human in origin anon
jpb is a meme and and youre all laughing at him right right you dont seriously think this guy is smart right this is all sarcasm right
  some of the things he says is genu8nely good advice and i reccomend you actually listen with an open mind a lot of what he says is actually psychoanalytic mumbo jumbo
our prime axiom should be knowledge is good
  could you not consider yourseld the axiom descartes methodical doubt right if you are the prerequisite for all truth then you are god and if you are god the axiom and yourself you are then the truth the only truth is yourself the axiom of your own vision
  hasnt cleaned his room
  he uses a lot of words to say absolutely fuck all thats for sure how some pussyified soft handed leftist managed to mentally enslave so many basedservatives is beyond me they probably think the guy is a christian conservative when he doesnt believe in god and says jesus is an archetype
  a fucking jewish practice with no relation to the actual bible  you got to be shitting me circumcision was taken as the sign of a covenant with god and was mentioned quite often in the old testament  old testament doesnt count  then the new testament completely falls apart seeing as how often it uses the ot to buttress its theology
  no we wont    that doesnt mean reality doesnt exist it just means people wont necessarily believe or accept it it also means we wont necessarily be able to know everything of reality    peterson is terrified of people thinking like that because he believes it will cause the downfall of humanity or something so he tries to suppress it by pimping for god i dont care so i continue to flip my finger at the concept of god
  thats like sayign any subjective taste like whether i like olives is meaningless    its not meaningless these preferences/biases affect not only how the subject experiences life good/bad/etc but how they interact with others and the universe at large
  this but unironically
  proof is impossible  prove it pseud
  its really not  acknowledging theres a force that can do anything does nothing to explain how it does anything if anything it just makes it more vague
  protestants havent been practicing shit for thousands of years theyve only been around half a millennium
  its still a proof though youre just assuming g is true where g is defined by the its gd i dont got to explain shit axiom
  using a tautology is supposed to come at the end of a proof not the beginning
  the logic is youre always begging the question so you might as well just assume the biggest handwave in history its intellectually lazy but the point is if youre going to make a leap of faith you might as well make it a big unreasonable one so you can be intellectually lazy since all leaps of faith are unreasonable to some degree
  its a brainlet misunderstands a mathematical result and tries to apply it fairytales episode
godels incompleteness is correct    whether it applies in this case is debatable
  try wrapping you head around the fact that there are people who consider this man a toptier philosopher    in the first order logical language of arithmetic there are four desirable properties we would like for our theory of arithmetic    1 we would like it to be consistent  2 we would like it be complete  3 we would like it to contain peano arithmetic  4 we would like it to recursively enumerable    what godels incompleteness theorem ultimately says is simply that there is no theory in this language that has all four of these properties however it is possible to show there are theories with any three
  based and redpilled
  this whats wrong with that brainlets dont think about the why of things anyway
  seeing americans cope about having their foreskins snipped off as a baby and the fact that their parents paid for the privilege of doing so makes me laugh every time
  protestants circumcise  protestants have been around for thousands of years  american education  european protestants do not circumcise  only americans do because they are a jewish puppet state
there can be only one objective truth if god exists and that would then be that god exists everything outside god itself would be dependent on gods will morality and the very fabric of reality with rules of physics and all are equally based on gods whims in no case god existing or not does objective morality exist at most its gods subjective view what we should do that we cant influence still no different from rules of physics that god also could change on a whim
  way to miss the point idiot genital mutilation is merely an example     the point was that the morality set by religion is just as if not more subjective and failible than the morality ingrained in us through evolutionary process
  this    religion like morality itself is a social construct
  he would have been a saint back in the day literally sainted for his work ill petition for him to be sainted now
  only americans do because they are a jewish puppet state  fuck off with this bullshit they snip their dicks because of puritans scared shitless of corporal pleasures
  tortle
  saint of public toilet in india maybe
he is right but it still doesnt prove that god exists it could also be that all proof is inadequate as is likely the case because of the limits of language and semantics if not for other reasons
  youre conflating an axiom with a postulate  justice is a postulate
  without god morality is nothing more than an illusion of the mind a tool of evolutionary process to encourage cooporative behavior in species    and that is good enough nearly any human function derives from the evolutionary process  there is no need for a secondary argument to form laws to abide by
copts are the true ancient egyptians
they looked like this
  albanians are
  albanians are the true japanese

did the franks originate from denmark or scandinavia    proof it was    the word frank is from ancient norse of frakka noting their heritage  and it cannot be from germany due to german language being a mix of 60 latin and 40 nordic language its a mix       discuss
denmark is a part of scandinavia retard    but yes i think there are good reasons to believe scandinavia is the urheimat of the germanic race  before they emerged on the continent during the iron age central europe was populated with slavs celts and peoples from central asia
  no they were not    the nordics simply came to rule over the germans infact the people of germania were neve replaced just    reigned over    read this picture
  you need to improve your reading comprehension  there have also been proposals that frank comes from the germanic word for javelin such as in old english franca or old norse frakka10  its not saying that frank is derived from old norse frakka its just comparing frank to other words derived from the protogermanic frankô its impossible for it to be derived from an old norse word anyway since old norse wasnt spoken at the time
  i dont know whos trolling who anymore
  posting /pol/ tier infograph as an argument  this board
  if you have any complaints voice them instread of screeching like a redditor
  the word frank is from ancient norse of frakka  no  scandinavia is the urheimat of the germanic race  yes it is urheimat of huns aka kvens who are ancestors to modern germans  modern historians often confuse massagets with huns which makes them believe huns were from asia
  huns aka kvens  cringe
  huns aka massagets  cringe
  its true the cringe in that post is beyond recognition    infact kvens are just swedes    while the huns are invadors from the east of asia    mongols
  now post how many of them were btfo by turkic people
  kvens are just swedes  cringe
  the huns were defeated by norwegians you brainlet
  imports the 3rd world     wow so powerful
  yes swedes are mongoloids with pig noses
  cringe
  cringe is exactly what i feel when i see the swede mong
  oh my lord not another one of these threads
  youre just a coping mong finn or slav but i cant be sure which one

my mom gave me as a birthday present this necklace with a coin with one of the emperors of a roman empire as i dont know all of them by heart can anyone help me to figure out which one is it thanks anon
after the death of the bitter and defeated charles v and the subsequent division of the hapsburg empire did the spanish and austrian hapsburgs work together or did they do their own things i know france essentially ran spain as a puppet state once the bourbon dynasty inherited the thrown did the austrians do the same
  not really the spanish line was usually far more powerful than the austrian line they tended to work together as they had a lot of the same interestskeeping down france keeping italy under habsburg domination fighting protestantism between the two spain was largely driving the bus though no dictating to austria of course they also had some wildly different issues that their either barely helped each other with or not at all austria mostly dealt with the ottomans on their ownexcept naval stuff and spain was on their own when it came to their overseas empire and conflicts with england
  i know france essentially ran spain as a puppet state once the bourbon dynasty inherited the thrown    this isnt true france went to war with philip v his son was a staunch neutral party between french wars and charles iii sides with france but gained more from french wars than france
  thats not what they taught me in school
  it was probably an anglo school the narrative for 19th century history is britain defeating france
  wasnt it more like this austrian habsburgs get all the land that borders austria and the spanish habsburgs the rest
and charles v wanted to make the netherlands independent from the hre so the austrian habsburgs wouldnt have been the best option in his mind
charlemagne and the abbasid were the two strongest but what about the other ones  was the byzantine empire stronger than cordoba  how would the kvenland finns compare to england
kvenland finns  
  
  i dont want to derail the thread but the kvens were actually germanic
  they were finnish
  i wonder who could be behind this post they were germanic btw
  comparing the hre to the abassids
  abbasid whatever
  the holy roman empire was very strong under charlemagne  the holy roman empire under charlemagne and otto was not weak at all    thinking otherwise shows you are pretty ignorant about history
  i said comparing it  saying they were the two strongest is like saying the us and russia were the gwo strongest nations in 1945
  people really tend to underestimate how strong the byzantine empire was before the battle of manzikert the muslim world was stagnating by this time and the byzantines continued to hold strong in anatolia against them hell the abbasid caliphs were quite genial to christianity and were remarkably nonthreatening for all their size and splendor harun alrashid and charlemagne had a serious bromance going on so id rank the byzantines above the franks honestly but well below the abbasids the emirate of cordoba seemed pretty irrelevant as far as political and military influence is concerned great nation of scholars and artists though
  the byzantines were underrated but i think they were weaker than charlemagne iirc they were scared of him
  byzantines above the franks  um excuse me but they were both ruled by germanics
  charle the little strong byzantium could have crushed the like and make them dust same with the abassid
  they were scared of frankish potential which was considerable sure but the potential didnt really manifest itself and the frankish empire immediately collapsed after charlemagne died it was an underdeveloped and politically unstructured empire which would have made it a lot weaker in waging an organized war
  why do you think everyone was german
  because high iq  only high iq can be ruling class and german selectively bred high iq in cold climates and invaded everywhere and created the civilizations  if you look at descriptions of leaders hair color they are invariably light  racemixing made the modern shitskin populations
  dont forget thats around the time that byzantines started getting btfo by bulgarians though
    create your own thread for this thank you
  and the franks got btfo by vikings that being said the byzantines made a very good recovery and may have conquered much of their old territory back if the turks hadnt come in and steamrolled everybody
  the franks didnt lose to the vikings by the time of charlemagne
your map looks different from mine despite being the same year
  most premodern states had porous boarders they werent fixed and they had complex relationships with neighbors/occupied territories that allow for interpretation for cartographers ive seen maps showing bulgaria and armenia as being part of byzantium during the reign of the macedonians where bulgaria was mostly an autonomous friendly neighbor with slight bureaucratic oversight and armenia were full on independent
 this map is certainly more truthful than  at lest for the balkans  bulgaria and the franks fucked over the avars way before 814 and there wasnt any big yugoslaviasized serbia/servia anywhere

  on february 24 1920 realizing that he was outnumbered and far from reinforcement the commander of the japanese garrison allowed tryapitsyns troops to enter the town under a flag of truce however tryapitsyn began to round up and execute white movement supporters the only force holding his hand being the small japanese garrison on 10 march he issued an ultimatum to the garrison to voluntarily disarm to which he was sure the japanese would not agree therefore the japanese intervened launching a surprise attack on 12 march 1920 the attack failed and most of the japanese troops died the remaining few only surrendered when the japanese high command ordered them to do so even so tryapitsyn decided to take revenge which resulted in the execution of the surviving garrison and the slaughter of all but 122 japanese civilians  in all around 700 japanese died shortly thereafter1

  anyone that studied history and doesnt think anarchoprimitivsm is objectively the ideal system is a brainlet
  i personally am a moderate agrarian socialist urbanite anarchofascist but im fine to have a friendly political conversation with you before i murder you for your opinions
  only clairvoyants have a right to say anarchoprimitivism is the ideal system
  an unreachable ideal unfortunately

  study history  become apolitical right wing anarchist and realize womens suffrage was one of the greatest mistakes in modern history
  study history   learn more about history and it doesnt really effect my politics
  non white and cringe
  apolitical  right wing  anarchist  none of these things are compatible or intelligent
  if studying history hasnt changed your political views you havent been studying history
  they are compatible because i am all of them simultaneously
    also since you appear unintelligent let me explain to you how these are all compatible  anarchy is simply absence of government  right wing beliefs can be held and acted upon without government enforcement  apolitical in regards to all existing ideologies and systems since they are all flawed including vanilla anarchy as it tends to lean left when anarchy should be used for right wing values
  studies history  posts anime  what went wrong
  right wing beliefs can be held and acted upon without government enforcement  youre delusional property rights require a monopoly on force which requires a state otherwise there will be no guarantee of being able to settle disputes without violence which is necessary for a stable market environment the idea of multiple private defence companies reigning peacefully over an area without the ability to force lawbreakers to attend court is laughable and would inevitably result in power struggles or extortion rackets which is basically a government in all but name you can rebrand taxes as fees if you want and call your law natural rights or polycentricaw its only nominally not a state at that point  as for other right wing ideals such as social conservatism these typically require some sort of authority to enforce them women arent just going to stop wanting public participation because you tell them to be housewives its naïve to think otherwise and there has historically been plenty of violence against suffragettes queers and unionists to keep them in line virtually all farright wingers celebrate violence in some form whether its prattling on about muh helicopter rides or muh rope day they only become bleeding heart pacifists when someone punches a nazi  apolitical in regards to all existing ideologies and systems   anarchism is an ideology capitalist or not and any framework of societal organization is pretty much a system if it has two or more interacting parts

  democracy and liberalism is cancer and the greatest threat to civilization
  it wouldnt work  its pretty much the standard in central europe
  become succdem  yikes
  /thread
  humans being humans  this is a vague tautology that explains nothing and just reinforces the opinions of the speaker as a post hoc justification for why certain ideologies are nonfunctional   on the contrary no ideologies are functional they are theoretical by nature that doesnt mean they cant have wrong assumptions virtually every single ideology does because they typically represent a desire for fixed answers about society rather than honest examinations of historical and present conditions but ideology inspires application rather than being application itself you cannot just whittle away political falsehoods until you reach a functional ideology because as abstractions they conflate desires and value judgment with analysis and while an analytic framework can be falsified the desires it serves to reinforce really cannot and appeal to mutually conflicting segments of the population
  non democratic countries are largely shitholes and almost always hav actual problems like omnipresent bribery violent insurgencies food shortages faulty infrastructure secret police state terror against innocent civilians etc the only complaints that pseud neckbeards can make against democracy is petty shit like my sister uses her iphone too much or 01 of the population are trannies or my boss told me to refill the ice cube tray fuck capitalism in other words shit that wouldnt even matter if you werent a pretentious faggot trying to disguise your political megalomania as depth youre not undergoing some profound suffering because of liberalism youre just a depressed faggot projecting your own mental problems and social ineptitude onto the wider society
  such as  didnt know there are countries in central europe where the govt owns like half of the major corporations of its country like norway  genuinely curious
  anon wtf  socdem describes pretty much every single west european country post ww2
  thing is i dont care for a stable market environment so everything you mention after that is irrelevant  as for other right wing ideals such as social conservatism these typically require some sort of authority to enforce them  incorrect these typically require some sort of authority to prevent them  women are biologically mens lesser both psychologically and physiologically the state serves to attempt an equalization between the two sexes when without the state women would naturally be subjugated by nature itself  races would naturally segregate as well as is human nature  virtually all farright wingers celebrate violence in some form  virtually every ideologic spectrum celebrates violence in some form its human nature
study history   realize the jews are the cause of all our problems
  alright guys im going to use this thread to debunk the nazbol meme    national bolshevists are literally just larp natsocs because hitler too believed in socialist economies however what set him apart was he believed racial struggle was the prime of everything whilst marx believed that class struggle was the prime of everything    so basically if youre a communist who believes in racial struggle youre just a nazi
  if he believed that he either didnt practice what he preached or he was so laserfocused on the upcoming war that he deemed it a mere detail rather than the central question
  not true  czech govt only owns three big corporations  german govt only owns a minority or plurality of shares in some copmanies  the only ones who seem to do that are norway sweden finland and maybe hungary
  funny i became a socialist
  study history  democracy killed socrates
study history   realize everyone is asking for one
  thing is i dont care for a stable market environment so everything you mention after that is irrelevant  so youre against property rights then
  democracy killed jesus too
  realize you are 100 right
  protectionism  rising capable people  providing healthcare and education  building grand projects  fighting against international oligarchs  anyone who doesnt at least respect these ideals is counterproductive
  because hitler too believed in socialist economies

  mixing the concepts of psionicism with the concepts of nationalism nazpsi nationalnationalpsionism/nationalpsionicism then emerges whose very focus is on creating an authoritarian state focused on the cosmic individual and collective psionic awakening of all citizens and individuals of the same state    in economic matters nazpsi focuses on a mutual economy where all help each other mixing concepts of mutualism agorism nep of leninism and corporatism of fascism there are also economic concepts of national bolshevism nazbol favoringof micro and small entrepreneurs and application of socialtechnocracy everyone can do science    in the political question the authoritarian state functions in a syndicalistauthoritarian way where all kinetics psionics and other social groups unite in forms of unions formed by several individuals having a central authoritarian union whose power is to balance and to manage the other unions in order to achieve common sense and the collective good of society as well as the awakening    in addition to unions there are also psionic councils and psionic committees with councils made up of more awakened people with skills and awareness unlocked and committees formed by people awakened and without many skills there are also assemblies where everyone has the right to participate in them    the nazpsi has influence of vibrationalismpsionic and follows this technological branch focusing on the development of ultravibrational psionic metaphysical spirituality and kinesispsionic technologies and their demystification as well as the collectiveindividual awakening of people and the unlocking of peoples consciences and psionic abilities and the struggle against the dominators and ultimately make individuals into multidimensional beings highly evolved    this manifesto is terminated with the quotation awakening unblocking and total ascention for all individuals of this world
  is this bolsonaros ideology
  bezos is laggin for a lagin
  about 1382 billion
  sounds like an interesting dantes inferno style punishment for greed   for all the money one had hoarded they should have that money spent on extravagant torture methods
  its only fair
  tucker carlson is one of the few relevant political figures i hold respect for since he doesnt let party politics define all of his views    hes right wing on most issues but against us intervention in syria against dual israeli citizenship candidates dominating congress and against bezos bullshit even if his party largely backs these topics because theyre fucking wrong    i wont deny its largely because i agree with most of his stances but the man is an individual rather than a puppet and im somewhat surprised fox has kept him  people just like to make fun of him for laughing lunatic guests off his talk show when they do shit like pull empty folders claiming to have decades of info on him when he asks them to please get to what theyre acussing trump of rather than starting with trumps childhood and going from there with their narrative on a timed interview segment
  maybe theres a reason people are turning to socialism  if something works im open to try it we live in a changing world why not change your mind on things  then the whole bolshevik rhetoric and ted kaczynski parallels telling ben shaprio that americans are not in servitude to shareholders and that we need to stop religiously worshiping the free market    its truly an enigma that such a figure appeared on mainstream tv and that it was on primetime fox news liberal outlets are so awash in social engineering that they cant even compete and get their own kaczyinskiite/nazbol into the airwaves
  psionics is the belief that electronic objects give off spiritual psychic energy its a meme that parodies nazbol gang and alex jones joe rogan rant
  its because tucker gets the highest ratings on fox precisely because hes the only pundit on there thatll actually tackle certain issues and he sees the damage neoliberalism has caused they let him on because he draws in the viewers theyll handwave some of the nazbol or populist rhetoric if he does enough ebin triggers of college liberals
    whyd antifa attack one of the only right wingers who isnt necessarily pro capitalist  at least go after hannity or some shit if youre gonna do that not the tuck
  because antifa are a bunch of coopted faggots who get their orders from tv and social media tucker having similar positions to ted kaczynski only makes it poetic that the coopted faggots try to kick his door in and assault his family  im convinced that when tucker disappeared from the public he went somewhere and underwent an extreme egodeath to come to his current position
  because theyre morons who dont read theory and just want an excuse to be violent and repeat twitter talking points they are not productive
  1 tucker laughs in the faces of idiots they like  2 antifa is unironically fascist
  comfy
  stalin seemed to believe in some sort of racial struggle
  ownership is not what defines socdem
  youre just spooked anon at least you arent a /pol/fag though    this
  i do hope that the fact that my view of natsocdem country includes an eugenics program doesnt make me /pol/
did he do anything wrong
  he lost the iraniraq war
yes he allied with america
  he was an incompetent idiot
  gulags  holodomor  great purge  mass deportations of volga germans tatars etc  marxist imperialism  yeah he hasnt done much wrong just some genocide here and there and a bit of totalitarian tyranny not much amirite retard
  kurd spotted
  youre a funny guy anon
  t shitraeli/kurd/iranian     he allied with muttland
  good post
  no  he was a based and epic defender of iraqi christians and a third positionist
  average /his/ poster
  he didnt went for the nukes and in the end got rekt anyway for having nukes
  cringe
  he was too woke
he killed a lot of his family and all of his cabinet had rubber hoses shoved up the asses of rivals so when they were pulled out with no lube the guts would come out of butt holes inside out had botches kidnapped all over the world so they could be sex slaves /his/ is weak
  got caught
  he was a dictator who gassed his own people and invaded kuwait we kill dictators to establish peace
  he stayed in the rap game too long  but it had to end how it did    now hes gassing the kurdistan in heaven    peace
  kurds were not his people theyve made it perfectly clear that they despise iraq and want no part in it
  reneges on every major position hes ever held on us interventionism
  we kill dictators to establish peace
  willingly became a puppet for the mutts and saudis and fought an incredibly stupid war that didnt accomplish anything except bankrupt his country he was 100 justified and invading kuwait
  he failed to contain broly
  he tried to sell oil in francs   if theres one thing thats going to get your nation liberated into the stone age its fucking with the petrodollar
  did he pull off the kinoest coups of all time
  hey cia is it cool if i invade kuwait   whatever i dont care  ok thanks  psych  i mean he was a dick so i dont feel too bad for him but he definitely got the shitty end of historys stick
  establishes 15 years of war instead  based amerigoblinos
  he was a dictator who gassed his own people and invaded kuwait  but wheres the bad part
they are not but names you have named   annajm 23    in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god   john 11    hi /his/ /x/ here ive gotten tired of trying to puzzle out the metaphysics of things i dont even believe in anymore i have two questions    1 when were these verses actually written    2 to the best of your ability to decode the traditions customs and rhetoric of the time what did they mean with this    dont spare me any details i want the whole story through every translation barrier and why we think things may have been translated a certain way i want to truly understand the human dimension to this problem
  hi /his/ /x/ here
  it basically means jesus was the word of god separate but the same sorta
  yes but who originally wrote it in what language and why word rather than messenger or any other thing what was the exact intent with that translation and in what cultural setting was the original concept written spoken or recorded    since i can tell this isnt going to go even slightly well if i dont im going to say this about historical reconstruction my current mode of analysis is one that requires any given document to only be verified externally by the independent interpretation of other documents around the same time period
you can google all of these things and get pretty reliable information bible was written in greek and we have pretty good estimates on when things were written
  get pretty reliable information  im a bit out of practice here my /x/centric mind would just start tracking down every strange or illuminatedsounding mystical lead and id wind up in the wrong parts of the internet again ive more or less lost touch with the normalcy illusion so your google and mine dont actually resemble each other as much as one would hope    not saying i wont google it just i could use a teeny tiny bit of spoonfeeding about how to study history through google if im being honest    alternatively if google pointers is not /his/ enough i could theoretically take this to /wsr/
  what about beyond when it was written to when the oral tradition started is that as easily googled im fine googling the parts that are googlable
why are crime and cartels such a big problem in many parts of latin america
because cokehead american celebrities just cant get enough snow in los angeles so someones gotta fill that demand     and the thing is the more governments crack down on it the higher prices get the higher the prices get the more lucrative it becomes
because they spread among the middle classes political parties the police and state institutions and eventually the armed forces
basic economy
because everyone but white protestant cultures are nepotistic feudalists
cia niggers
  low enough iq to not be able to function in a law abiding society  high enough iq to be good at crime
  i dont think abiding by laws in a society which is unable to enforce them is a sign of low iq more like being low in conscientiousness and agreeableness
  crime is a problem in all developing countries    the cartels specifically operate in the frontiers of their countries buy off any officials that would fuck up their operations within their countries and control businesses that reap insane revenue to fund whatever they need to stay in business basically cartels exist because recreational drugs are illegal
governments didnt bother dismantling cartels when they were small statewide at best organizations because it affected only poor people and their neighborhoods  now its a worldwide behemoth and the goverment is simply too corrupt/ineficient to tackle it
  because leftism
  crime is a problem in all developing countries  its much worse in latin america though latin americans only make up 8 of the worlds population and yet commit a third of the worlds murders brazil columbia mexico and venezuela alone account for 25 of the worlds murders
  its a combination of the countries developments and the cartels
  now if only combat and war related deaths were counted along with murder
  ha ha ha      yeah i think i agree with this its a matter of weakness of the state  carteles are a 20th and 21st century problem but i dont think theyre all that unique     anywhere there is state weakness other centers of power congregate and crowd in and 90 of them receive some amount of money through the drug trade unless theyre fortunate enough to be sitting on top of oil    france effectively ended their involvement in vietnam because ngô đình diệm crushed criminal elements acting as french proxies signalling his consolidation of power over the country
  rude but going off what i said here      this is a really common mistake on the internet i had someone tell me the other day the mexican revolution was funded by american and german bankers for american and german bankers    whats actually happening is that international elements are capitalizing on state weakness and trying to establish and fund proxies within the region in the hopes of keeping hostile governments unstable so that they may be eventually exchanged with regimes more aligned with their interests     its vicious and terrible but its not that the cia created the carteles or the warlords  they simply fund causes in the hopes of establishing a foothold in the region this frequently comes back to bite them the taliban but it comes without the social and political costs of sending in americans to die in a war for resources and influence vietnam so its an addictive tool
  this and they lack the military power to fight them honestly im amazed these countries dont ask the us military to come and intervene
  im convinced that there is a high rate of latent sociopathy in mesoamerican/mestizo populations there is a way in which they revel in torture and cruelty which seems off compared to what we expect even among criminals
  emmetttilljpg
  because they lack anglo saxon conscience
  non sequitur you have to look at things like rates of such incidents were talking about countries hitting per capital murder rates of 100 per 100000 compared to the developedworld norm of 03 to 2    furthermore someone like till got off incredibly easy compared to the kinds of things latin criminals do to people he didnt have his face and tongue slowly cut off on camera before having his hands and feet severed and then set on fire
  people have to do edgier things to stay afloat dont forget about all the torture methods of the medieval period brutalizing your enemies is just nature
  because that didnt work in afghanistan iraq libya and irans future doesnt look good
i just dont understand the sadism in latin culture     asians might torture you for data africans might lynch you with fire europeans might smack you around and do some mind gamers before they kill you     but spics its 100 calm and conscious like theyre setting up an exquisite banquet of suffering and gore like these guys sat down and thought how badly can we terrorize this person without killing them
  pic unrelated  eurangutan admixture
  this and      they call it a drug war for a reason wars on and its a nasty one but all of the viciousness and the cruelty has precedent in recent and ancient history the scale is only a matter of the scale of the violence corruption and state weakness currently rife in latin america

why was the holocaust rarely a matter of recurrent public debate or even that much scholarly attention before the 80s
  because people saw the camps and so they knew that it happened
  because it had just happened and there was only 12 generations of scholarly research
  despite what you were exposed to here holocaust deniers are irrelevant irl
  because they had no way of spreading their works without censorship until the internet came
  look at this lying jew squirm
  why was the holocaust rarely a matter of recurrent public debate or even that much scholarly attention before the 80s  thats not true
  ian kershaw would like to disagree  
    people were more willing to actually talk about their experience as they got older    mfw watching greatgrandmother explode in a rage at one of my teachers after being invited to speak at a school presentation of holocaust survivors    this was a woman who almost never raised her voice or became angry but the moment you brought up the holocaust she just turned into a different person
  so survivors didnt want to speak about their experience
  some people have difficulty lying on the spot
  you know they made a special board for you types
  it actually is       there was a taboo around it as people were scared of offending the people who lived through it   also the cold war made the discussion of stuff like this very complicated but the late cold war was less ideologically driven so it became easier
  largely and its still common for them not to   sure there are thousands of accounts of survivors testifying about it but you have to understand that there was millions of survivors the people willing to tell their story represent a tiny minority     its just like how a lot of war veterans specifically wars such as vietnam or korea dislike discussing what happened   sometimes people see stuff that is just so horrible that the only thing they want to do is forget it     my grandpa for example saw vc burning alive from napalm in vietnam he told me about it but i was like the only person he ever told i dont think he even told his wife
  holocaust denial only really took off around that time
    well in her case no    but in the case of others their feelings about it may have softened to the point where they were willing to talk about it        only thing i ever recall her admitting to lying about that was substantial was her birthday her marriage certificate says she was 17 at the time while her united states passport and immigration documents indicate she wouldve been around 15 or 16 at the time she was seven months pregnant at the time of her wedding so ill let you figure who why she might lie about that    pic semirelated she bore a striking resemblance one of the less famous victims of the holocaust        i learned most of what happened to her from my greatgrandfather who was able to coax the details out of her over the years mostly after sex apparently
  its not your great grandmas fault she was a nazi dude she was probably indoctrinated into it
  nice fantasy anon
  he says posting the nazi frog
    as for my greatgrandfather he ran his mouth about just about everything including beating the shit out of people for the thrill of it only time he ever seemed to hesitate was when was telling me about a german bunker his aa gun shot up in normandy he walked inside and he just froze for ten seconds and said what he in there gave him nightmares        i wish it was a fantasy but its not    mfw grandfather father and i are all products of the holocaust and child rape
    you mentioned this on /pol/ at least once isnt she the woman who escaped to england from poland as part of some child evacuating mission and met his later husband there at some 16 years old
    yep thats me    she the woman who escaped to england from poland as part of some child evacuating mission    my greatgrandmother was put on a kindertransport an evacuation of jewish children from continental europe mainly germany austria and occupied czechslovakia but also the netherlands france belgium and poland to the united kingdom by rail and sea she was one of nearly 10000 jews who were saved from likely death this way the rest of her family was left behind and died in the holocaust with the exception of a brother whose existence she was unaware of until the 1990s    met his later husband there at some 16 years old    she met my greatgrandfather when she was 15 actually even younger than i thought when he was stationed at a base near where she was staying got pregnant within a month of meeting him
  why was the holocaust rarely a matter of recurrent public debate or even that much scholarly attention before the 80s    i mean this isnt really true so its hard to answer the question its true that the years immediately studying the holocaust did not have much scholarship but it didnt take until the 80s for scholarship to begin léon poliakov published his scholarly work on the holocaust in 1951 and at this point in time the idea that the holocaust happened on a truly massive scale was still considered up for debate in the public eye more specifically the idea of it being a genocide of jewish people was considered controversial to the point that the aforementioned french work didnt use the term other works were published in this same decade though they were like poliakovs work not well distributed outside of their home countries    the first major scholarly work published in english about the holocaust was published in 1960 the widespread publication of the book in multiple languages was really when the floodgates of holocaust scholarship opened and it became a much more accepted and popular topic for scholarly debate and interest
whats the difference between hercules and herakles     isnt hercules just the latin pronunciation of the greek herakles      yet there are two different wikipedia pages for the two is there a difference 
  i mean you could have just browsed through the two pages and see what the difference is then youd know that the hercules page is mainly just the roman perceptions of the character plus some historical usage of the word but that would make sense
  again what are the differences 
  i mean you could have just browsed through the two pages
  just say you dont know the difference and let an actual expert reply to my thread
  and let an actual expert reply to my thread  ive seen a lot of stupid and funny shit on 4chan today yet this takes the fucking cake
  roman gods are not exactly greek gods although a lot of roman gods are associated with greek ones and often took on greek stories either on top of their earlier roman traditions or replacing them that said i believe heracles is a purely greek character and that the romans did not have a figure like that before     so i dunno maybe he had some later stories in roman that the greeks didnt
  unrelated but the donar thor hammer necklaces germans use to wear were lifted from hercules club necklaces romans use to wear polytheism mostly works great together
  your first mistake was thinking you are on 4chan
  yeah and vishnu wielded kaumodaki  and ninurta wielded sharur    a long time ago a really strong god went around dropping vengeance down on whomever he saw fit with a mace
  it still hurts bros
  im not calling 4chan by its new name nagasaki can fuck right off with his channel bullshit
      im new here why was it decided to make two separate websites 
  indoeuropean gods are fun
  in fairness clubs are a universally understood weapon just a big sturdy stick maybe with a rock tied to it
  i assume its cultural values  best example to compare would be odysseus and ulysses  odysseus is cunning and wily with these traits being praised by the greeks who adored that shit  romans view ulysses as a right cunt who is cowardly and devious because the romans adore martial values over being cunning  both are exatly the same person also ulysses did destroy troy but that was written after the fact  my guess would be herakles is heroic because hes both strong and smart such as the tricking of atlas  hercules is uber masculine like the fucking rock version of him and exemplifies warrior culture
  herr kules is my neighbour and is very angry about those myths he hates horses
  why is the greek ares such a bloodthirsty shithead compared to the roman mars who is the chief god of their city and father of the founders
  look at greeces legacy their cultures endured several dark ages several complete occupations numerous attempts at it etc rome pretty much had a large climb to the top with only a couple of stumbles thanks to celtic incursions and some trouble in the mideast
  shekels
  mars and ares were originally two very different gods who got identified with one another because there were no other deities in either pantheon that remotely fit its not like with hercules who was an obvious import mars and ares likely have no common origin
  this  and this     greek philosophers rightly hated war and thus despised his personification although a lot of the ares hate has a lot to do with the surviving sources we base our understanding of hellenistic religion off of homer hates ares and makes him out to be a bloodthirsty coward whiner bitch who is always easily defeated other greek poets treat him better but not by much     mars on the other hand was likely a spring god or harvest god he was also associate with war because spring is the campaigning season so peace and war were always most precariously held in that time so mars is the god of farmers as well as soldiers and rome always kept this attitude that they conquered the world in selfdefense    unlike jupiter and zeus mars and ares might not have a similar origin but polytheism and the origin of deities is so complicated gods get equated adopted split combined it gets hazy some people think apollo and helios were once the same god whose cult got split and then at the end of the classical period priest tried to recombin them when apollos cult grew so who knows probably why hindu gods have avatars
  hercules was adapted by the romans by way of etruscan hercle not directly from greek herakles so some things were changed in translation such as the new story of how he defeating cacus a monster from etruscan mythology with no greek equivalent
  i have a pet theory that ares is descended from the same source as the vedic aryaman and avestan airyaman being in origin a grecoaryan deity of tribal identity that represented dominance over indigenous populations dravidians minoans etc and for this reason said indigenous populations understandably resented the deity and portrayed him as evil in later stages of their religions the name of this deity ultimately comes from the pie root h2erh1 and the name of ares is therefore related to the greek word arete manliness virtue virility
  prolly not an answer to the reason for separate pages but according to herodotus who attempts to place mythological characters in a hostroical sense at times there are two hercules that share much but are different in worship one was diety worship and the other was hero worship the diety according to the egyptians never mad it across but the hero was known there and some of his deeds were shared and temples dedicated to his hero worship were constructed although i believe they equate hercules to horus in many ways and this is the mix up in herodotus history here diety vs real hero and the blood from which spartan kings are born
  ares was thraces patron god greeks hated thrace
  ares even in greece was the god of manliness and manly courage the phrase he has no ares in him was use to describe a cowardly bitch again not all greeks hates ares just most of the surviving sources but the idea ares is also a diety of nations which mars certainly is makes sense ares is a diety if nations for the greeks just not the greek nation
  because the overwhelming majority of greeces history and cultural output that survived to the present day is athenian and athens already had a war deity in their patron athena they literally named the city after her    once you already have a war goddess who is also perfect in all things the other war god becomes redundant and often an object of ridicule
  spoonfeed me sempai  nigger youre dumb
  
  who came first hercle or herakles 
  germans didnt exist back then
  heracles indisputably  because the overwhelming majority of greeces history and cultural output that survived to the present day is athenian  fuck off most of stories about ares being a punk were not athenian

is it worth reading kant hegel etc what would i get out of it
no
  if youre interested in them read them its your life after all
  im interested in them but not if its going to be boring and take a year of my life to understand what theyre trying to say
  no kant is a poor mans aristotle philosophy postantiquity is worthless except in a purely practical sense unless someone is testing you on a particular latterday thinker you can safely ignore it all
read hegel and then read about the roman empire itll all be worth it trust me
  catagorical imperative and hegelian synthesis yes
  elaborate
  start with plato
  it was a new vegas reference it should be noted that caesar mustve not read all of hegel or else hed have realized that the synthesis he wants to create will inevitably become thesis and put into conflict with a new antithesis
  this stealing your gif its a perfect reminder that hebrew mythology is false and that only by studying the works of classical hellenic and chinese philosophers may we approach a true understanding of our existence
  ive read about a third or a half of his dialogues  do i need to read all of them
  and chinese philosophers
  not necessarily but you may as well also we would need to know which ones you read at some point you should also be reading aristotle also herodotus through xenophon for the history and practical reality of being a human
  wrong
  lao zi only one of note
  ive read    alcibiades i  lysis  laches  charmides  protagoras  hippias major and minor  gorgias  meno  euthyphro  apology  crito  symposium  phaedrus  republic  phaedo    maybe some others but i dont recall i got a little burnt out towards the end
  kek are you reading in the order suggested by bernard suzanne
  yeah
  read kant then schopenhauer
  its going to be boring for the most part while reading them and youre going to have to put a lot of effort into understanding them but there are some kernels of genius if youre really interested in the topics theyre discussing hegel especially in his lectures has some interesting points about religion aesthetics history and politics  if you want to read a less boring and difficult to understand german idealist i would highly recommend schopenhauer he has the breadth and depth of kant and hegel while also being a much better writer    enlightenment philosophy can be super interesting if youre looking for philosophy with an absolute ground kant and hegel really try to build a whole system of metaphysics ethics etc from an absolute ground in a way that aristotle or plato did not
   who gave you that reading list maybe there is some logic to it but i wouldnt recommend that order and there are important dialogues missing it literally cuts out all of the later works which provide the best answers and insight into some of the most important issues    if you are getting burnt out then its time to switch over to the history texts for a bit or try something a little lighter like aristophanes you can then return to plato and aristotle    i would recommend a lighter dialogue like ion if you are still tired it is a crucial dialogue and i am amazed it isnt on your reading list then i would recommend going into his later works the laws is an extremely important text and will completely change the way you think about plato and how he would order a state the sophist is incredibly important because it deals with parmenides parmenides is important because it raises metaphysical issues but actually i would recommend holding off until you read some aristotle     honestly i am fucking astonished at how bad that list is absolutely fucking astonished it would give such a weird impression of plato and such a limited scope of his wisdom         false
  hegel himself claimed that prussia was the end of history also the whole triad thing is really shoehorning hegels dialectical method into a slogan
  aristotle and plato did build a whole system of metaphysics theology and ethics from the ground up only a person unfamiliar with aristotles metaphysics and platos later works could claim otherwise
  its from this site he hasnt read the latter part of the list  
  this   i got burnt out before getting to the later works
        oh phew that makes more sense i disagree with the order they suggest but at least theyre not literally omitting some of his greatest works
  do they their systems seem rather disjointed compared to enlightenment thinkers in that aristotles ethics for example dont really rely on his metaphysics i could be wrong here though just the impression i got from reading metaphysics and the nico ethics
  i want to be clear that im not saying that they didnt build ethics metaphyisics etc from the ground up but it just didnt seem systematizing in the same way as german idealists liked to do
    it can seem disjointed sure because platos style is much different and their works have been recorded and handed down to us in a much different manner    both thinkers very much start from the ground up though were talking about intellectual descendants of parmenides here they start from the most fundamental principle possible and move forward a fair amount of their works need to be read before the bigger picture becomes clear though or else a person must do a good job of providing guidance and select readings

what are the similarities with yesteryears gold rush and mass migration of modern day
gold rush was taking land promised to the faithful through manifest destiny it involved civilizing the savages and bringing a higher standard of living    todays migration only helps the rich who benefit from cheap labor and high rents it is the result of a people turning from god it represents the triumph of savagery and licentiousness it will end in lower living standards and suffering

the mediterranean theater was one of the most important theaters in world war two however it didnt have to be had germany and italy concentrated resources all germany and italy had to do was invade gibraltar and make a push towards to suez canal then the allies are completely blocked off from the mediterranean troops can be redeployed trade between europe and north africa is secure oil from libya will flow troops can push into the middle east and all sorts of other advantages     so why didnt they do it or even try i understand it would be very hard but you cant say it was physically impossible with the stamina of the axis in 19401941
the axis leaders made a retarded mistake  imagine my shock
  the way i see it two obvious possibilities are as follows     gibraltar  german and italian military cooperation use cargo ships and barges from southern europe as troop transports italian navy escorts naval armada with southern airbases in vichy providing air cover such as stukas and heinkel bombers gibraltar is stormed captured and a german garrison fortifies heavily with support from axis spain     or     france falls and the axis borders spain franco is either pressured to rescind the allied agreement to keep them out of the war or germany will crush the weak spanish army and take gibraltar by land
  suez canal    germany pushes off the invasion of russia until the spring of 1942 to concentrate troops in north africa secure the middle east from the allies pressure turkey to join the axis and strike at the soviet union from finland to persia with middle eastern oil fields
  bump
  so why didnt they do it or even try  logistical problems/the worlds largest navy standing in their way
  couldve gotten around the allied navies by land even then the italian navy was large enough to carry out convoy escort missions 
  the gibraltar question was one hitler extensively negotiated with franco but in the end they both concluded spain joining the axis was not benefical because after they seizure of gibraltar the spanish had no more contribution and the spanish didnt want to risk themselves    regarding the suez canal the germans did make efforts and even was making good progress with rommel smashing the allies back however their lack of naval power in the meds which then led to horrible gasoline shortages and as a result they were pushed out of el alamein and had to abandon hope for the suez canal
  hitler couldve pushed harder with spain allowing military access or hitler even invading them in 1940 replacing the government germans also couldve gotten to the suez canal by attacking turkey using fallschirmjäger to take key objectives to secure access across the bosphorus straight pushing into turkey and down through syria squeezing the allies
  oil from libya will flow    the oil wasnt discovered until the 1950s
  cant declare war on america and russia if you invade the me dumbass how was hitler supposed to lose the war if he pulled moves like these
  germans also couldve gotten to the suez canal by attacking turkey using fallschirmjäger
  diplomacy with spain was a dead end there was simply nothing to gain for either side     regarding the fallschirmjager they were shown to be useful in ww2 when they were used to seize an undefended norway    however when used in a real campaign in this case malta the casualties especially equipment loses in the form of planes was simply too high and they rightly concluded that it would no longer be used for largescale operations
  the british were spread out extensively across their empire what pool of troops would they pull from to stop a ground invasion from germans
  not if they were used in an extensive military operation against an almost nonexistent turkish army with world war 1 weapons
  they wouldnt be fighting a turkish colonial army though they would be fighting the british with stretched supply lines
  the mediterranean theater was one of the most important theaters in world war two  not really    all germany and italy had to do was invade gibraltar  with what landing craft amphibious doctrine or air/naval superiority in the area    and make a push towards to suez canal  with that logistical tail that couldnt support a force half the size of what the british could muster in egypt    then the allies are completely blocked off from the mediterranean   and hey if they just attacked england and conquered it they wouldnt have to deal with the english or aerial raids out of england you cant just assume the plan would instantly work you retarded jackass    so why didnt they do it or even try  because it would never work and youre retarded    i understand it would be very hard but you cant say it was physically impossible with the stamina of the axis in 19401941  yes you can and it was the logistical constraints are largely based around the paucity of libyan ports and lack of infrastructure in north africa no amount of redirected commitment will change this you are ignorant optimsitic or just fucking stupid more likely
  regarding the suez canal the germans did make efforts and even was making good progress with rommel smashing the allies back however their lack of naval power in the meds  the problem is less lack of naval power and more that theres a lack of available ports and absolutely nothing beyond a shitty coastal road connecting them overland actually getting supplies from tripoli to tobruk was a fuckhuge undertaking that cost the axis a lot of their momentum      it would take a year at least to beat down turkey and almost certainly get the soviets involved and having to dig the russians kilometer by kilometer through the turkish mountains is a hell of a way to fight the war
    the british wouldnt have to provide any troops theyd just let the turk defeat the germans on their own
      assuming these two are ops    gibraltar plan 1  there is no beach if you want to do a seaborne invasion youre going to get all those cargo ships after 2/3 of them get sunk by the local minefields milling around at the base of a mountain then i dunno when you use your grappling hooks to try to scale it the british garrison just shoots your guys on the climb and the vichy forces arent going to let you station hundreds of bombers in their territory nor will franco be keen on allowing a german military presence that he cannot evict and thus dooming himself to being hitlers next puppet    actually attacking through spain  this could work if youre up for the costs involved but it will mean dissolving vichy shortly after youve instated the puppet government as part of your agreement was to not move troops through vichy territory and they cover the spanish border and then youll have to fight your way across spain and then deal with the occupation costs involved in such an action as well as the entire french colonial empire likely joining the allies when youve dissolved vichy    suez  local logistical factors limit your deployment of force you have nothing that could possibly make turkey want to join in your insane crusade
  the mediterranean theater led to the loss of north africa the capitulation of italy and the stretch of german troops id say thats pretty significant     with what landing craft amphibious doctrine or air/naval superiority in the area    as i said cargo ships barges anything that floats would work unlike the north sea and british channel the germans have the larger italian navy which rivals the allied ships in the area in terms of numbers a single escort operation could be feasible as for axis air superiority its not the best but could be useful as for the logistical tail thats a reasonable point taking both points of entry would prevent surface ships from coming and going into the mediterranean theres no edge to it also comparing this fantasy operation to invanding a country with a nonexistent surface navy is a bit dramatic dont ya think     i think a capture of gibraltar is feasible but taking suez not so much
  would it be an occupation of spain or could the germans replace the leader with a prowar puppet allowing the spanish full autonomy i now see that taking suez would be an impossible feat also making taking gibraltar pointless
  even then the italian navy was large enough to carry out convoy escort missions  they were sent to the bottom of the sea doing escort missions
  italian navy was around till the end of the war they avoided all combat till they ran out of fuel and got docked
  yeah bro why didnt they just sail past the royal navy and take britains most important colonial possessions
  of course when you dumb something down it sounds unreasonable     yeah bro why didnt they just climb over the maginot line destroy frances vast modern army and take the entire country
  because hitler and muss were retards
  germany beating france in a land war isnt at all unreasonable but it would certainly be unprecedented for germany to beat britain on the high seas
the amorites are from syria right  ugarit ebla and stuff like that     so they had the same religion as the arameans and canaanites right  baal ashtoreth dagon and stuff like that right     so why havent they brought some of their gods with them when they invaded babylonia and sumer 
bump
can we have a thread celebrating jews and jewish culture as a catholic i was always fascinated by their cultures id like to know more mostly about the secular aspects like the emphasis on intellectual pursuits and such  please contribute if you have anything interesting or just point me to some books on jewish cultures in various nations and throughout the ages
  before they were expelled and killed from spain jews made up very big amounts of merchants and court administrators for example in sevilla so many jews were so important to the city economy and government that king alfonso ix and x walked them off in a section of the city with direct palace connection to ensure their safety also i read that many of the main physicists come from jewish areas in hungary and germany and austria like the ones who made the atom bomb came from hungary
  amsterdam was and still relatively is thé jewish/leftist bulwark of the netherlands many of them fled here from portugal spinoza being a famous example our accurate bureaucracy however led to a very efficient deportation of them during the occupation of ww2
  also they were the first civilization to achieve 100 male literacy rate because they all learn how to read torah
  this pic is highly inaccurate there are way more sects than that
it is noncontroversially understood that jews controlled the slave and spice trade throughout eurasia during the middleages     they were a nomadic merchant race on steroids
  jews lived in different cities in china and kaifeng was the last remnant one of them recited the names of old testament prophets to matteo ricci and asked him to become their rabbi once their last rabbi died in the 19th century
  christians sold the jews pagan slaves to export to muslims and asia they were all in it together
  implying pagan europeans didnt practice slavery   pagans sold pagan slaves and some pagan groups like vikings captured and sold christians as slaves slavery is just a fact of life people would become slaves and be sold regardless of religion
reform jews  believe in following jewish principles    ah yes those jewish principles like usury exploitation and subversion of the goyim
which historical figures share this aesthetic
  i usually do this when im drunk

early socialist writings contained explicit calls for genocide of backward peoples the toxic mix of those two illiberal ideas would result in at least 80 million deaths during the course of the 20th century    in the new york tribune in 1853 karl marx came close to advocating genocide writing the classes and the races too weak to master the new conditions of life must give way his friend and collaborator engels was more explicit    in 1849 engels published an article in marxs newspaper neue rheinische zeitung in it engels condemned the rural populations of the austrian empire for failing enthusiastically to partake in the revolution of 1848 this was a seminal moment the importance of which cannot be overstated    from engels article in 1849 down to the death of hitler george watson wrote in his 1998 book the lost literature of socialism everyone who advocated genocide called himself a socialist    so what did engels write    among all the large and small nations of austria only three standardbearers of progress took an active part in history and still retain their vitalitythe germans the poles and the magyars hence they are now revolutionary all the other large and small nationalities and peoples are destined to perish before long in the revolutionary world storm for that reason they are now counterrevolutionary  the austrian germans and magyars will be set free and wreak a bloody revenge on the slav barbarians  the next world war will result in the disappearance from the face of the earth not only of reactionary classes and dynasties but also of entire reactionary peoples and that too is a step forward    here engels clearly foreshadows the genocides of the 20thcentury totalitarianism in general and the soviet regime in particular disgusting
joseph stalin loved engels article and commended it to his followers in the foundations of leninism in 1924 he then proceeded to suppress soviet ethnic minorities including the jews crimean tatars and ukrainians    adolf hitler who admired stalin for his ruthlessness and called him a genius was also heavily influenced by marx i have learned a great deal from marxism hitler said as i do not hesitate to admit throughout his youth hitler never shunned the company of marxists and believed that while the petit bourgeois social democrat  will never make a national socialist  the communist always will    hitlers differences with the communists argued watson were less ideological than tactical hitler embraced german nationalism so as not to compete with marxism on its own ground but explicitly acknowledged that the whole of national socialism was based on marx it is therefore unsurprising that nazi germany with its concentration camps and omnipresent secret police came so close to resembling the soviet union    how much did the nazis learn from the soviets    in his 1947 memoir commandant of auschwitz the autobiography of rudolf hoess hoess recalled that the germans knew of the soviet program of extermination of the enemies of the state through forced labor as early as 1939   if for example in building a canal the inmates of a soviet camp were used up thousands of fresh kulaks or other unreliable elements were called in who in their turn would be used up     the nazis would use the same tactic on the jewish slave laborers in for example munition factories    following their invasion of the soviet union in 1941 wrote watson the germans collected information on the immense scale of the soviet camp system and were impressed by the soviet readiness to destroy whole categories of people through forced labor
after the war ended stalin was deeply worried about what the germans knew with regard to the soviet camp system and the crimes that the soviets committed in the territories they conquered following the signing of the molotovribbentrop pact he sent andrey vyshinsky the mastermind of stalins great purge 19361938 to nuremberg to steer the war crimes tribunal away from inconvenient lines of inquiry    today we are familiar with the aggregate numbers of people who died as a result of the socialist experiment but communist terror continues to be shrouded in ontological fog as such the nazi extermination of the jews is generally condemned as an example of race hatred the soviet extermination of specific groups of people in contrast is generally seen as part of a much less toxic class struggle

  and nothing of value was lost
probably ran out of other peoples shit to plagiarize the dude literally just browses reddit until he sees something that gets thousands of likes and then copies the article it came from
  he doesnt know
why was it created is it neccesary
  why was it created  to create monetary control levers that would help regulate fiscal crises especially controlling the rate of inflation supervise and regulate banks be a clearinghouse for foreign exchange of currencies and act as a guarantor for the value of local currency currency    is it neccesary  it isnt strictly necessary but its very useful
privatized central banks lend at lower rates
  counterfeit money  buy all the shit  i dont see how this wouldnt work indefinitely
  why was it created  the fed exists to stop harsh downswings in the business cycle created because of the fed existing
  why was it created  the idea was to stop the panic of situations we were getting into every 15 or so years by creating a more stable bedrock  is it neccesary  i mean nothing in government is necesary provided everyone acts in good faith
  do you remember where you learned this im kinda interested in whos saying what
  why was it created  the culmination of a 1000 year plot by the jews starting with the norman conquest
because the industrial revolution in america had caused financial chaos major depressions struck the country in 1873 and 1893 and there was a serious recession in the mid1880s fully half the years between the civil war and spanish american war fell in either a depression or recession by 1898 95 of all american capitalists had declared bankruptcy at least once    source sentimental imperialists james thompson page 98
  you can make a ton of money if you can control a currency and manipulate it everyone who can get away with this does it as soon as the us felt able to pull it off they did and have been using it as a source of revenue ever since they made it illegal for american citizens to issue their own money so they have less competition    its kind of like how after bitcoin every dumbass created their own altcoin they know if they can get people to use it they will get rich from currency manipulation of course the barrier to entry is higher with physical money due to the logistics of creating distributing and collecting coins and bills
  eventually nobody wants your shitty currency and will refuse to give you things for it
  because we need a public bank or we will go bankrupt
  they made it illegal for american citizens to issue their own money so they have less competition    yes because it makes sense to have a thousand different regional currencies floating around when youre trying to build a unified nation
no its not neccesary we didnt need the first two central banking systems in this country and got rid of them accordingly and we dont need this one its just an excuse to have a private entity enforce their will on all the citizens of this country and any country using our dollar mostly jewish people who founded the federal reserve by the way
  jewish conspiracy to make money worthless
every single country in the world has a central bank only a sect of american economic illiterates make a big deal about it
  the federal reserve is privately owned in the same sense as gazprom
  why was it created  to better regulate monetary system and provide guidance to banks  was it necessary  yeah
  
  what no gold  fuck you
  yeah its preposterous to think people ought to decide for themselves where they want their money to be going its much better to steal it from them and hand it out to the better class of men who know how to put it to good use
  yeah its preposterous to think people ought to decide for themselves where they want their money to be going  you say that sarcastically but it really is taxes exist because there are externalities nobody wants to pay for that impact all of society i cant think of a single successful state in recent history that did not use taxation or eventually shift towards fiat currency the problems with commodity currency are numerous especially lack of national control of supply and the sheer number of fucking scams around it in the old days
  they all go fiat because the criminals in charge cannot afford to pay their henchmen so they have to figure out something else and yes its always the worst gangsters there is no reason these so called externalities cannot be managed without some fuckhuge retarded bureaucracy and youre talking about shit that might happen and its still low level localized as fuck when the current system is literally stealing from everyone enslaving people and the cunts in charge are literally above the law not answerable to anyone its brainwashing and cowardice that lets it go on
  this is unironically one of the better videos on youtube about the federal reserve    
  ak47 and sickle in channel logo   i am far from /pol/ but im not sure i trust that
  im not /pol/ but
  i dont know who this is but i think this is probably the most accurate looking portrayal of hitler ive ever seen looks spot on compared to a lot of ones ive seen
  ive watched 10 minutes of this video its fucking terrible    the host repeatedly sites the great depression as evidence to justify the creation of a centralized bank despite the fact the fed has already been created and helped cause the great depression by not contracting the money supply when banks failed he also said that a central bank hasnt led to more socialist policies which is blatantly untrue i stopped watching when he talked about the great depression and jp morgans role in the panic of 1907 as the same event
anyone have the link to that long ass like 20 minute cartoon about the federal reserve that was popular during ron pauls campaign its like death of america or something i remember thinking it was cool back in like 2014 but now im wondering how much of it was just libertarian propaganda
  that video really is something isnt it clearly a lot of work and effort went into it very good animation for a political cartoon with memorable characters and the best part is that it doesnt go fullon crazy until near the end it slowly builds up to the insanity so you have time to get sucked in and buy into what is being said before they hit you with the crazy stuff its 10/10 propaganda i can easily see why libertarians love it    
  yeah but government itself is a necessary evil
  i can easily see why libertarians love it  muslims too
  so how much of that video is just conspiratorial propaganda bullshit and how much is true
  first the federal reserve is owned directly by the us government and all of its profits go directly into the us treasury its no different than how the russian oil company gazprom operates whatever money it makes goes directly the russian government so the video saying that the fed is privately owned is deceptive at best an outright lie at worst the chairman of the federal reserve is directly appointed by the potus and approved by the senate
  the federal reserve is owned directly by the us government  it may be controlled by the federal government but its not directly owned by it  all of its profits go directly into the us treasury  federal reserve act after all necessary expenses of a federal reserve bank have been paid or provided for the stockholders shall be entitled to receive an annual dividend of six per centum on the paidin capital stock which dividend shall be cumulativeafter the aforesaid dividend claims have been fully met the net earnings shall be paid to the united states  stockholders being the thousands of private member banks of the federal reserve system who all must buy in with 6 of their capital     anyways heres a nice piece about this trickery  
  the federal reserve killed kennedy  errytime
november 7 2008 bloomberg lp news brought a lawsuit against the board of governors of the federal reserve system to force the board to reveal the identities of firms for which it has provided guarantees during the financial crisis of 2007200886 bloomberg lp won at the trial court87 and the feds appeals were rejected at both the united states court of appeals for the second circuit and the us supreme court the data was released on march 31 20118889  damn
  the stockholders  just googled it    so its partiallyowned by american banks and only american banks can be a stockholder how much influence do these banks have within the federal reserve board
  i do believe they are all legally american banks never actually saw proof of it though  the question of influence is tricky the stockholders do appoint the regional board members of which the government fed board selects the chairman and vice chairman also the regional boards are pretty much controlled by the government fed board so looks like they dont have much decision making power at least on paper
  huh then it seems the dividends are just a token of goodwill by the government towards the stockholders at least from my naive point of view
  some guy was wondering about it in some article i cant remember which he came to the conclusion that it was created at the founding in order to entice banks to join since they had some trouble gaining traction and then it just kind of stayed i mean whos gonna say no to a guaranteed profit
  i mean nothing in government is necesary sic provided everyone acts in good faith    in the libertarians fantasy dream world you mean
daily reminder that fractional reserve banking is cancer
  its a cool logo he should really work on the hair though
  he also said that a central bank hasnt led to more socialist policies which is blatantly untrue     those were just keynesian policies specifically implemented to keep capitalism from failing and having another depression
  debt creates money     
  jason unruhe  are yuo fucking serious
  i never said it was feasible
because the financial system prior to the wider banking and monetary reform of the early 1900s was obsolete for the needs of industrial capitalism specifically nybased bankers realised they werent the preeminent financial hub of the country anymore thanks to the rise of chicago st louis and san francisco so they lobbied and organised a wider banking/monetary reform movement within their sector and were able to successfully see their ideas implemented via regulation and creating the fed reserve system that we know today it was a triumph of capitalism as in it was an example of the centralisation of capital that both marx and weber predicted along with other historians from the era and even today note about a variety of industries    sources are james livingstons origins of the federal reserve system and gabriel kolkos triumph of conservatism     obviously dyor and come to your own conclusion those two are very much in the new left school of thought but they are pretty convincing imo

is it possible to be completely fluent in any pre iron age language
given how much weve learned from old ass clay tablets probably i especially liked learning about the first financial crisis  economy crashes  advisor tries to explain the sumerian equivalent of subprime loans to the king  king suddenly perks up  oh i get it the problem is too much debt right  yeah basically but  i hereby declare all debts in the kingdom forgiven  i really wish i could read that shit directly because it says a lot about how much and how little weve come along
  sure biblical hebrew for instance is rather widely known today
  biblical hebrew is an iron age language
  no it isnt iron tool and weapon usage spread to whats now israel around 1200 bc the khirbet qeiyafa inscription is from around 3000 bc although its provenance as actually hebrew is debated even if you dont buy that one you have very clear hebrew inscriptions at around 1100 bc and the language almost certainly existed for some time before it was written down
  what you describe is not biblical hebrew the oldest books of the bible werent written until at least half a millennia after those dates you can call it proto or ancient hebrew but certainly not biblical
  considering that you have fragments that reproduce ot text word for word which are considerably older than the babylonian exile period which is how im assuming youre getting 500 years we can demonstrate that the language as a coherent entity far predated that ive never seen anything claiming that there is a significant language difference between circa 1300 bc hebrew and actual biblical hebrew although ill admit i havent looked into the linguistics with a super fine comb
  considering that you have fragments that reproduce ot text word for word which are considerably older than the babylonian exile period   o rly didnt know that ill take a look genuinely interested   which is how im assuming youre getting 500 years  cant give any particular source off the top of my head but yes from what i can rember ot books are dated from 7th century bc and not before that   we can demonstrate that the language as a coherent entity far predated that ive never seen anything claiming that there is a significant language difference between circa 1300 bc hebrew and actual biblical hebrew although ill admit i havent looked into the linguistics with a super fine comb  well i dont know it could be but given how diverse are languages in pre modern settings and the time between the periods were talking about i would bet that it change a deal     hope that other anons can provide some input what about other languages
    most if not the whole core of the bible was written during their first exile with a plausible yet not found yet pentateuch older version hell they didnt stop tinkering with it even in jesus era and they even literally spill out the beans in a chapter iirc nehemiah the current pentateuch scrolls were (((found))) and distributed while reconstructing the second temple while (((coincidently))) most of their traditional celebrations were created around that era with the only possible exception of passover
  and again the language is older than the actual compiled document you have passages that are attested to elsewhere and much older the priestly blessing for instance
  is it possible to be completely fluent in any pre iron age language  yep go live with some extremely isolated tribe in papua new guinea theres probably some preiron age ones left in the highlands somewhere    con they may eat you
  and again the language is older than the actual compiled document   you sound like you are deaf  you need to argue for why the written language far into the iron age is similar to whatever sources from before that they are based on if you do not do that it will just sound terrible
  are you seriously suggesting that languages only exist in written form because thats simply not true and just because the oldest extant copy of x dates to a particular year doesnt mean that x is from then do you think for instance that the first joke book ever written is the philogelos just because its the oldest one to survive to the present
this guy has numerous readings of ancient near eastern languages    
  no i am suggesting your outbreak of argument is filled with a pretty large retardball anon  languages and dialects change with time so i doubt 500bc semetic is similar to 1000bc semetic as its several language forks later so a text written in 500bc is spoken as its spoken in 500bc meaning it has little lingual relationships with the language in a earlier period   you need to argue for the sources its based on if they exist otherwise you get a iron age semetic language and thats it
what were the prime symbols of mesoamerican and mesopotamian civilisation
  mesoamarica balance  mesopotamia dominance
why didnt napoleons name become popular
  i hear its plenty popular in insane asylums
  i hope thats still a thing today get a bunch of napoleons in the same room and hear what they would have done in russia or at waterloo
father told me about a guy named napoleon once he and his coworkers were sitting in a room and the door opened someone with a bandage on one eye broke his head through and asked hey guys saw napoleon around
  because great britain was pee in your pants afraid of him and painted him as a tyrrant to the best of their abilities
  raz please
dude what there were literally dozens of napoleons in america during the civil war times it was an incredibly popular name during his reign    not to mention all the people nicknamed napoleon of x at various times
  literally dozens  incredibly popular
  literally dozens among people actually recorded in the annals of history no one cared about napoleon g humperdincks in the boondocks of oregon territory
america was built on genocide
i mean when a bunch of people turn up start killing you and kidnapping your children and all of a sudden they own all the land its hard to call anything but genocide
  well yeah most countries were built on brutal conquest to some degree    or did you think that all nations sprung forth from the void fully formed and populated immutable in their borders and demographics
  native americans already did that stuff to each other but that does not condone their brutal treatment also half of them died of plague  the black plague killed half of europe and genghis khan took over in the wake of death the same way english settlers did  do we condemn him no the mongol conquest is a central part of eastern history
  do we condemn him no
  well yeah most countries were built on brutal conquest to some degree  thats nothing like genocide
  genghis khan committed genocide literally no one denies that
  /his/torians fetishize genghis khan  people dont condemn him
  the nation mongolia is not located in europe last time i checked
  are you high
dunno shit but im reading dday by anthony beevor and he says some of the soldiers at dday were made of stomach and ear battalions what is the extent of this
  woops    he was talking about the germans here btw
when exactly america was great
50s and 60s
depends on who you ask
  prior to abolition of slavery
50s and 60s   muh oppressed niggers  nobody cares
    see what i mean op
    given that this is really a question about trump for all intents and purposes lets say 19301990 during era democrats had some major foothold and workers gained rights that many did not have such as the right to organize the right to strike the right to a pension and the right not to be discriminated against i use loose dates since in the 1930s the great depression and dust bowl were major disasters the country was dealing with and americas economic stagnation began in the late 80s but in both instances it was controllable workers in the 30s could look forward to social security workers in the 80s still had a political party willing to defend them    this changed with hw bush and clinton who both enacted free trade policies first under nafta then with china in 1994 and 2000 the wto was created and china was allowed to join it as the prevailing idea was that china would quickly liberalize their politics as they would their economy this did not come to play and instead they kept subverting and abusing the global trade system until american workers were fed up by it    from about 19862016 america lost over 10 million manufacturing jobs the fallout and economic ruin from this directly led to obamas rise in 2008 but when he failed to do anything voters gave up and went for the most reactionary candidate available this was trump whose campaign began with him belittling jeb bush
  no more lynchings  negroes pushed in white schools  mlk chimpouts
  always people who hate freedom will deny this but the us is the true spiritual successor of the roman republic god bless the united states pax americana for a thousand years      as he died to make men holy let us die to make men free
  nigers will always claim to be oppressed this is why you cucks will never undestand    in 2050 they will talk about how bad 2010 was and claim that back then blacks were being shot by police for nothing
  sadly the roman republic was as corrupt and degenerate as are the usa
    during era democrats     during this era democrats    also from 19301990 wages rose with productivity and the amount of accumulated capital roughly trailed with the amount of investment this ended as in the 90s parttime labor took off especially at large companies like walmart to skirt labor laws while the cost of entry for most industries skyrocketed as everyone began demanding a 20k college degree that rose to about 6070k by 2016 not including roomboard costs    you can see everything fall apart in this era 2008 was when widespread mistrust in the system happened with the financial crisis obamas unwillingness to engage on that issue led to trump immediately thereafter
  anyone can be a reductionist anon it takes true intellectual integrity to notice the positives throughout history    no nation ever to grace the planet has had the moral strength and courage of the united states it is the greatest weapon in our arsenal

  scary black man kneeld and ruined my entire life
  new deal and great society were the times when america set about getting shit done when democrats had sweeping majorities       free trade wasnt the only part of the equation there was also supposed to be a host of other changes creation of new industries in information computing and green energy changing social security to a market based superannuation healthcare reform along original obamacare lines education reform and expansion and tax and business reform were the big ticket items     but clinton and bush both got shocked when they even tried touching social security america would blow its cold war political capital dicking around in iraq and afghanistan bush jr turned the surplus prime for reinvestment into a unaccountable spending spree on tax cuts and a massive expansion of the government and foreign wars education reform was a joke obama picking the republican healthcare plan when they planned on making him a one term president meant that got fucked and fucking lieberman and most of obamas first two years was occupied with the economy going down the toilet then he lost the house and there went any chance for any big ticket changes     trade wise the tpp was supposed to be the centrepiece of the east asian pivot locking in a net of non chinese powers in asia into americas political orbit but bernie and trump both knocked it off course from both ends
  anons not wrong though and even if you backup up your claim with sociology youre going to end up in the same place      not an argument
  all nations have their challenges my friend we are no exception    however despite our challenges the moral integrity of most americans remains intact we are still the beacon of liberty throughout the world the desperate abused masses who cry out for justice and freedom still flock to our borders hoping to seek entry    again it is easy to be a reductionist someone who cannot see these positives despite the negatives we as humans all share is not spiritually complete in themselves
  depends what kind of propaganda you are spreading
glory glory allelujah
  anons not wrong though and even if you backup up your claim with sociology youre going to end up in the same place
  and we gas them or throw them in cages for daring
   you  s not wrong though and even if you backup up your claim with sociology youre going to end up in the same place  keep crying eurocuck libtard
  less corrupt than you abdul
  that is absolutely not true and you know it our people have willingly spilled their blood throughout the centuries selflessly so that others may have a chance to live free and blessed lives    rally round the flag boys rally once again the union forever down with the traitor and up with the stars
  if the actual president was an actual brave man he would have removed the democratic institution  if a president attempted to unlawfully alter the constitution let alone throw it out the military would depose him immediately it wouldnt matter how many traitors joined his side the very way this country is organization is to prevent something like this from happening
  our people have willingly spilled their blood throughout the centuries selflessly so that others may have a chance to live free and blessed lives  youre alright anon
  confederate and union soldier marching sidebyside
a gift to all true patriots and a warning to our enemies itt    
  confederate soldiers are american soldiers anon
      one of the most culturally vapid times in human history  rise of suburbia  destruction of local regional cultures   rise of mass media and pop culture  natural communities replaced with urban sprawl  traditional agricultural practices gone replaced with factory farming and wonderbread
  i mean the majority of the south did not own slaves and therefore could not profit from slavery they were fighting for their homeland for their families because the north in their eyes was out tempering with the constitution which could lead to a slippery slope
when whites were a majority and america had one of the highest living standards not for long now
  our people have willingly spilled their blood throughout the centuries selflessly  the us hasnt fought a war of necessity since ww2
  americans shed blood so the rich and middle class could avoid paying the taxes they owed for the defence of the colonies from france they shed it again on imperialist adventures in canada mexico and the carribean then they fought to keep men in chains then more imperial wars in the caribbean and now in east asia then intervention in europe and then europe again after being declared on and then decades of supporting dictators
  the us hasnt fought a war of necessity since ww2   so that others may have a chance to live free and blessed lives  you have bad reading comprehension or willingly left out the important part in that sentence
  the us hasnt fought a war of necessity since ww2
      this is not so all american wars were good wars we have always fought against tyranny and we always shall we our the hand of gods judgement against the wicked
  if they didnt own slaves they worked on the plantations as overseers or hired slaves for the slave labor lords or aspired to own slaves     if they didnt hit any of those marks they were unionists the germans of texas west virginia east tennessee northern alabama kansas etc all fought against the confederacy confederates massacred these communities or broke up their assembles and shot unionists voting against succession
  all american wars were good wars    yes tell me more about how subjugating the philippines and selling arms to genocidal third world governments was justified
    kansas was never part of the confederacy you twit
  implying the philippines wasnt better off after the fact        god has renewed our post as the guardians of liberty and justice for all
  the important part of that sentence has been valid for 60 years at least the cia plays sandox we honor our arrangements with saudi arabia and israel
  they invaded it raided it and tried to force a succession against the will of the people
  redpillerd
  i dont think youve read a single book on us history you cant just go about saying that they were fought pointlessly over some imperialistic endeavors if you actually picked up a book for once youd see that there are nuances in every war      they worked on the plantations as overseers  not the majority lmao  hired slaves for the slave labor lords  still not the majority this and the above are like clerical work  aspired to own slaves  because everyone who was rich at the time was a slave owner we nowadays aspire to be rich as well to own a business just look at our spending habits and the success rates of businesses in the us  if they didnt hit any of those marks they were unionists the germans of texas west virginia east tennessee northern alabama kansas etc all fought against the confederacy confederates massacred these communities or broke up their assembles and shot unionists voting against succession  because if you had someone in your home saying that you cant keep your way of living youre going to let them stay and interrupt you      fuck off back to /pol/ this is no place for pophis
  the desperate masses enter your country becaue they see you as a weak prey to be exploited  its true that every country faced certain challenges and all of those that were similar to the usa for example the roman republic which is the most similar ended badly this is because history always repeats itself your  how could you be a beacon of freedom if you have no guns to defend that freedom  what are the positives the america you love is long gone  your brightest hope now is the coming of a caesar and the transition from republic to empire and even that wont solve the problems  but at least for the first years life would be better   anyway it would be a miracle if your country would survive another 100 years    its good living in fantasy world isnt it the army is loyal to its leader not to you  if the president was charismatic and alligned with the army the army would follow him  it happened since the begining of world history  i suggest you watch this video  
80s were the last time it was great    
  be amerigay  no rsemblence of culture look there romen culture looks cool lets yeet that  unironically say your the successor of roman republic  not in a thousand years amerimutt
  this hard times are the best times when things are too easy people get lazy and apathetic
    pretends to be a big brain  cant doesnt even use the correct word for leaving the union
  seething non american
  authoritarian babble      you will see the ends of our resolve
  the army is loyal to its leader not to you  youre wrong  if the president was charismatic and alligned with the army the army would follow him  100 of all the generals and troops  it happened since the begining of world history  sure thing bud      i can smell the stench of your teeth from across my screen
    the swiss already have everyones money
  the army is loyal to its leader not to you  maybe in whatever corrupt irrelevant backwater you live in but the legal fabric defining the powers of the president are crystal clear the us military swear an oath to protect the constitution not the president and that oath includes disobeying an unlawful order   i suggest you watch this video  i suggest you abandon your retarded hodgepodge of authoritarianism and pretending it has any relevance to how the us works
    it stopped being great in 1861
  this is no place for pophis  what pophis every war since ww2 has been to either combat communism terrorism or destabilize regions
  the italian wars fought by non italian mercanries who were known for not fighting much     and modern day switerland is rich modern day italy is a uneven political basket case     the usa has avoided major fighting on its soil since the civil war the uk even longer the russians blundered from war to civil war and they suffered for it they started the cold war already crippled
  implying the philippines wasnt better off after the fact  implying thats you decision to make
  for about 6 months after wwii
  the russians blundered from war to civil war and to war again and they suffered for it    ftfy
  just because there isnt major fighting doesnt mean that there isnt major strife in society the most iconic music art and writing always came from the most destitute and crime ridden parts of american society
america remains great for so long as there remains even one man willing to fight for her ideals though the government has forgotten that its foremost purpose is to act in service to the people of its nation the people must not forget will not forget and never forget this purpose whether socialist libertarian fascist or any other ideology each man who speaks of and acts in service of the american dream is my brother america is not without its faults and on numerous occasions has betrayed her people and even her ideals but we must learn from these transgressions take them to heart keep alive their memories in pursuit of a better tomorrow a better america a day will come in which america will once more be the envy of the world not for whatever paltry promises of the material which man will forever chase in his limited time but for her moral wealth and the richness of her spirit her people will know no fear and will with open arms accept all who carry the spirit and soul of america for all her faults ill always love this country
      i hope you frieds are underage  the authoritarian babble is the work of henry kissinger the greatest american statesman of the previous century  i admired the usa for my whole life because i truly am a libertarian i admire the concept of real freedom and defending this freemdom against all attacks  you have no freedom the founding fathers would roll in their graves  you are the authoritarian subjects   america has been becoming a socialist corrupt hellhole in the last century and soon will become an empire no amount of screeching of virgins on /his/ will change this  if you are a real man you would accept this reality and fight outside with your teeth and fangs to make your dream come true but you wont youll keep saving pictures and shitposting in this containment board
  yep the americans came home to a intact homeland a roaring economy a free university education a generous path from well paid job to comfortable middle class life and security     the soviets came home to a ruined homeland a missing generation of men gaps in their economy which were never properly filled the demographic transition fucked and a culture of drug abuse broken families and paranoia     the only reason they lasted so long was the anti colonist well spring that allowed the rest of the world to take the fury of the american war machine if america had taken a harder line against the europeans the soviets could have been boxed out of south asia and africa
  america has been becoming a socialist corrupt hellhole in the last century and soon will collapse    you almost had it right but i had to ftfy    the second american civil war will make the russian civil war look tame by comparison
  birth control pill
  the idea of the independent frontier nation once we reached the coast it was all downhill
  i truly am a libertarian  aka youre a lazy moron that throws out all protections the citizen has before the rich and powerful because muh gubmint bad at everything   america has been becoming a socialist corrupt hellhole  america has zero concept of socialism or leftism for that matter were a country defined by lawfulness and capitalist enterprise    your dream come true  yeah whats my dream
  implying its yours
  early 70s  strong domestic manufacturing  could still pay off a house with a blue collar job  no college degree  trust in institutions  the hippie movement was dying off  third wave feminism hadnt started yet  we could still intervene in our sphere of influence with impunity  the soviets were already bound for collapse
   theres no difference between the government and the rich and powerful they are the same power you cant defend against neither of them  you have no freedom you renounced to them your country will become worse and worse your only hope is an augustus and if youre not lucky he may never come  most nations in the word have better gun rights than many states in america  be a man and fight for your freedom in real life instead of shitposting here  do you even have a girlfriend
  based patriotic brother
    i really dislike all my fellow burgerposters who meme about how russians are inherently inferior because theyre poor and alcoholics russia was on the receiving end of not one but three of the largest and most brutal military confrontations the latter of which they were subjected to nearextermination in human history in a 30 year period and continued suffer from a backward economic and political system for another 40 years i seriously doubt america or any other country wouldnt have been left culturally broken under similar circumstances    youd think that since america itself still suffers culturally and to a lesser extent economically from the fallout of the civil war one could argue america is ultimately doomed to have another civil war because of the open wound left from the first one wed be a bit more understanding
   you cant defend against neither of them  government fucks up vote them out   corporation fucks up   which is preferable to you  your only hope is an augustus and if youre not lucky he may never come  ah my favorite bit little pissant faux fascists like yourself being entirely convinced of your role as saviors   what you dont realize or acknowledge is that decent people in a peaceful society want nothing to do with you since you have no hope at the ballot box you prey for crisis like vultures to con the desperate then when the time comes to unveil your augustus its actually the usual motley crew of despots pigs weirdos and bootlickers rome had its purpose that purpose died finally after napoleon cemented the model of the modern state
  pre1760s
  history is not linear  civilizations are orgamism with a life and a death and each last 10001500 years  theres no such a thing as modern state  napoleon was our civilzation version of alexander the great  the usa is our civilizations version of rome  we are just a few years before caesar  your post is irrelevant rhetoric your vote is worth nothing both parties are the same and they both serve the interest of corporations the army is a private istitution and you renounced your guns so you cant do anything against an eventual tyrannical government  i have only sadness and pity for you because you are too young to have a fault on the terrible situation you are in but youll suffer the consequences because history doesnt care about right or wrong
  ps im not american many thanks i live in a place where democracy still has meaning we can bear arms and the air is not polluted i dont need to vote for american politicians
  is there a higher res of this anywhere bretty nice
  napoleon was our civilization version of alexander the great  alexander conquered without the slightest intention of a legacy napoleon killed the idea of divine right and hereditary rule installed education and law to the common people    usa is our civilizations version of rome  plenty of marble and columns in dc bout it   your post is irrelevant rhetoric  bitch your arguments thus far have been nothing but platitudes dont play   the army is a private institution  100 government funded war can only be declared by congress  youre embarrassing yourself   and you renounced your guns  and where is this mass turn in/confiscation
  youre lecturing an american on his own country where are you from
  its not hard to see why people are so dispirited and disillusioned with america the face of our country is a man near no one respects a man almost everyone takes for a fool a man who managed to divide the countrys concensus is a way that not even obama did we have people who see migrants at the border and bay for blood willing to flaunt international law and even morality by calling for armed response were told that things have never been better that the 20082012 economic crisis was a thing of the past when so many americans still struggle to provide for themselves where one job cannot meet the needs of a man in the land of plenty though our views doubtless differ on these issues as they will with any other issue were both fellow americans  if not necessarily by nation then by spirit  and i love you as one criticism is healthy but we cannot dream a better future when we let ourselves be consumed by dark thoughts
  fuck off boomer
  this is your education on pol everyone
    all propaganda  that time period was shit
  the moral strength and courage of the united states  dont attribute to your despicable people what can be attributed to a great man fdr had to fight against congress and against the american people to join world war 2 the selfishness and embarassing shortsightedness of the american public would have left the world and their own nation to ruin  america has not shown a trace of moral strength since world war 2
   the day before your dad fucked your mom 9 months prior to your birth
  romans were lectured by greeks on their own country  history repeats itself  im the only nonunderage in this thread so it makes sense i lecture others
  the great depression
  im personally not a fan of our nations isolationism people call me a warhawk but i really do think the world benefits from us knocking over despotic totalitarians that being said our isolationist tendencies does have its advantage and is a policy that works well for us at times when we need to our people first    america has not shown a trace of moral strength since wwii    yeah preventing the spread of communism wasnt like the greatest moral crusade of the post war age or anything now combating radical islam i guess isnt worth mentioning either you cant name any other current power that goes to war on behalf of human rights like the us does france and the uk to a limited extent certainly not the authoritarian likes of russia china or the saudis thats the issue i have with people who hate the us for our world police maneuvers who the hell would you rather our influence be replaced with all the runnersup would mean a much darker world    hurrdurr muh cia coups yall basically made isis and al qaeda     yeah geopolitical goals change with the world changing
  t retard
  the selfishness and embarassing shortsightedness of the american public would have left the world and their own nation to ruin  unironically saying this while also claiming the cold war was useless and evil   fuck you
  when niggers and women didnt use the internet
  dont parade around the ideological excuses for acquisitive campaigns if we gave a shit about radical islam the saudis would be glassed by now    the only factions that make war for ideological reasons in modern times are radical islamists and only the most inbred amongst them take them at face value
  look at this total brainwashed idiot lol    preventing the spread of communism  so pussyfooting around in korea and vietnam is preventing when you could have destroyed the communist you fight half assed wars face those wars were always just about money    and what about the time the united states literally supported the khmer rouge and even gave funding to pol pot is that preventing communism    combating radical islam  you mean creating it in the first place also fighting a half assed war to draw it out instead of actually trying to win creating the needed catalyst for muslims to immigrant en mass to the west    face it fuck the american military they have wrote honor they fight for nothing they just do whatever americas masters tell them they are nothing but a prostitute army and america has never actually fought for anything of its own violation since the war of 1812
it was pretty comfy untill 2008  4chan went to shit   nigger in chief  internet became main stream
  you cant name any other current power that goes to war on behalf of human rights like the us does  name one genocide since ww2 that was stopped by the us for extra credit see if you can name any ongoing ones    name one islamic jihadist group that weve destroyed name one country that is now terrorfree because of the us    name one humanitarian crisis that the us has militarily interceded in since ww2    i agree that our military power should be used to help the weak but youre totally deluded for thinking thats what weve been doing every intervention weve made has been for political reasons not moral reasons even in ww2 we turned the jew boats away and didnt find out about the final solution until we were mopping up we deserve no credit for that we also fueled japans war on china until they finally slapped us forcing our hand we deserve no credit for that either we may be better than the rest but man is that a weak defense for a people whose whole national identity is believing that we save the world every day
  basically obama cucking you is the whole driving force behind alt right
  chubby leader says economy is all good now why do evil libruls keep asking questions
  maybe youre just feeling morose about society because high paid viral marketing was super effective on you
  but i hate niggers because one cucked me one time and fucked my blonde exgirlfriend    no i hate nigers because i had to live around them and experienced just how racist and violent black people really are
  the only one here not being a blind black cock sucker
1990s was peak america the economy was on fire anyone with a high school diploma willing to work hard could get a good job communism was dead the country was more or less culturally unified around positions that would be considered centrist today we fought defensive wars where we were morally in the right in kuwait yugoslavia and somalia it all came crashing down on 9/11
  we fought defensive wars where we were morally in the right in kuwait yugoslavia and somalia    only one of those kuwait could be considered defensive and morally right maybe somalia could considered good intentions but yugoslavia was a fucking mistake
  no nation ever to grace the planet has had the moral strength and courage of the united states  lol
  american exceptionalism  when will this meme die
    i believe an announcement is in order gentlemen
  moral strength  there has never been a more snivelling and hypocritical society than the ussr    t former ussr
  basically anytime before 1776
  so manly cant even name your country
        i just obtained my citizenship last year based comments my countryman
  you do know that the romans were viewed exactly like that right that rome just stole a bunch of greek culture and declared themselves to be the inheritors of civilization and even through they blatantly stole their higher culture rome was arrogant to a fault everyone from the average citizen to the leaders believed that its legal system and practical materialist way of life was better than anything else it was earnestly believed that anyone who held those ideals was a true roman but the powerful and famous were always seen as the archetype of the truly roman    that rome in the exact same way americas defense department does now legally required all their wars to be only fought in the defense of rome with approval of the senate necessary which meant they were totally always the good guys and that going to all those wars was defending the glory of rome and its way of life as was everyones enshrined zealous duty    and that they truly believed in all of this because they would constantly bombastically autisticly lecture foreigners about their glorious rome all the time       they also loved to pack into giant arenas to watch the nowcelebritieswithsponsorshipdealsbutformerlypartofthedispriviledgedunderclass hurt each other as spectators bought deliberately over salted snacks with overpriced drinks like with most public gatherings there was limited commercial interruption to announce who was sponsoring the event and what businesses had paid for advertising
  hey totally unrelated but hows your relationship with your mother
  fuck ur thread    unbelievably based   usa usa usa usa usa usa usa
  take a glance at north korea vs south korea or the atrocities that saddam committed and allow yourself some goddamn optimism so many of our blunders have been wanting to help too much libya syria etc
  how about the time we invaded mexico then when mexico responded said they actually invaded us and so we should go to war with them
  said the dubs man in his fuckin basement and is the biggest pussy on site
  this post is neither based nor redpilled even 4channel knows that the us is and always will be great
  stormnigger go home
    only proper answer
  projection much
during the beginning and ending of the colonization of america the ending being whenever all the states were joined and the indians became irrelevant i just dont see how anyone could consider anything greater than that the creation of a new nationstate 300 years in the making over a vast land if you want to talk about quality of life as some people inthis thread are thats a different story and idk
  north korea vs south korea  lost all sight of purpose as to be called the forgotten war   or the atrocities that saddam committed   we didnt care about atrocities we cared that he violated treaties and thats at least a fair argument iraq ended up as a quagmire regardless
  just obtained my citizenship last year  im extremely jealous i want to be american
  unironically the 70s
fuck america fuck white people abolish borders for only western countries
  false flagging this hard
  go back to /pol/
  before whtes arrived
  this america was great america is great and will remain great for 1000s of years
  there has never been a more snivelling and hypocritical society than the ussr  yes the usa at least the ussr improve the people live while the usa the only thing they know is steal from sa and gibe gibs tho dying dictatorships
1800s until the second world war
  shartland  great  free  peace  culture  successor of the roman empire  pick one
  insurgents  several women visible with their throats slit  guy with a literal pike on the side probably spearing the wounded  amerimutts need to be exterminated from the world
william walker i had no idea such guy existed
a true autismo
you cant just topple a central american government
i had the same idea of buying zimbabwe and conquering africa with my superior huwite iq
  if franklin pierce successfully supported walkers claims it would have made him a good president
a fucking rock
  ywn live in a time of invading brown countries to force them into a white mans union ever again    imagine if mexico built a wall to keep us out lol
  tfw aaron burr still doesnt receive his dues for being the first american to lead a filibuster against spain/spanishdescended nations
    yeah guys like this are why i think the confederacy would have expanded into central america and the caribbean had it won the civil war
  absolute mad lad
  expansionism was one of the souths main goals radical republicucks blocked them every step of the way though
  expansionism as a hedge against abolitionism you mean had the north allowed states to enter the union without abolishing slavery first there wouldnt have been a need for it
a true redpilled white man
explain why he and the mongols wouldnt have fucked the rest of europe into submission
castles
  they fear white warriors
  siege engines say hi    well he did need to totally conquer europe if he did to paris what the mongol did to baghdad europe would look pretty much like the middle east now and we would still be trying to figure out electricity while hiding from the inquisitors
  they fear the sons of atilla
  fucking gypsy hungarians
  sieges still cost war resources even with siege engines you dumb fuck also neither paris nor baghdad were absolutely crucial for technological development the baghdad was the brain of the islamic world meme is like saying id be a grade a student too if i didnt stub my toe
  castle density combined with the decentralised nature of europe would have been ruinous    muh siege engines were really only for major towns they slowed the mongols down too much the vast majority of mongol sieges were done by escalade and zerging
    
forestsrivers hills castles    siege engines didnt seem to work that well in hungary
  finland
  they wouldve   if they actually cared about a cancerous polyp protruding from the western part of asia with no value as a civilisation to be conquered
  lack of viagra and lube
  because he didnt
  they slowed the mongols down too much  like you seriously think that they brought siege engines with them ten of thousands of miles instead of building them on the spot what is this total wars mongoloid edition    for hungary yes  i mean you would think that the most brilliant commander in history could think of something on the spot to overcome the enemiess advantage including espionage like he always did and thats why he had never lost a single battle   but no it would be more reasonable to expect him to engage like a literal retard constrained by video games rule set    not to mention the meme that european army and their cavalries and knights somehow preferred and were well suited to fight in the woods and on the hills lmao
best day of my life religous cult gets burned right wing tears make me smile    burn baby burn disco inferno burn baby burn     reno reno cant you see bms need to hang from trees and i just love you for your racist ways    but in all seriousness the feds did nothing wrong you pathetic right wingers
  who cares
subhuman feds burning women and children 2 death fukoff anon
i cant disagree to be honest
  atf detected
  lefties sucking off to feds  imagine my shock
atf shot first
cringe
  k
  all of you cosmopolitans are going to feel the full brunt of the lords wrath for your inablility to leave everybody the fuck alone if they dont want to be cucked pleasure slaves with no future and nothing to believe in  youll get yours sooner than you know and im gonna laugh when everything you ever boasted about supporting rapes you to death through time and space as your collective karma just comes full circle      civil war 2 cant come soon enough
  this
  im going to go to hell already so i might as well push deeper into a colder circle they were raping women and children and probably deserved death but pigs are pigs and i would rather innocents suffered than allowing leviathan more blood for its summoning rituals waco was not justified and they should have been allowed their lolicon kingdom of god
  they werent raping kids only koresh had consensual sex with a 14 year old and he went on daily runs miles outside the compound where he could easily have been arrested
  leftist with no empathy feeling glee at women and children burning alive nothing new in this thread
  whats your take on ruby ridge then
  justifed he was hanging out with a bunch of white nationalist cunts    dont associate yourself with nazis or the alt right and you wont get the feds on your door step    did we read the nazis their miranda rights when we were fighting them no so why would we do the same thing with wns
  us citizens dont have rights if they believe in something l disagree with   gonna be a yikes from me desu
  ironic because you would support white supremacists movements like the police and the nra but your white privilege makes it so you only care when white nationalists get killed but if they were black it would be a different story waco and ruby ridge is white privilege and a maledominated narrative that appeals to white straight male christian americans so dont be a hypocrite about it
  this looks more like a 4chan thread than a 4channel one my guy  have some respect for quality and take shit like this to the proper site    although desu it would be awesome to watch a modern day waco happen to cults like scientology or the latter day saints
  feds did nothing wrong  while i agree that the waco cult had it coming because fuck cults the atf was the wrong agency to use and should be disbanded and they fuck up
  trying way too hard anon take a break and try again next week
  waco on scientology  id compare it more to the night of the long knives
  is tumblr down or something
  not trying hard at all i see right wingers and the alt right russian useful idiots bemoan what the feds did but when real injustice happens like in fergeuson or when institutional racism is a problem they just shrug it off      waco is nothing compared to the systemic racism and institutionalized oppression and white supremacy that people of color have to endure everyday    the feds making a mistake is not the moral equivalent of what the police do to people of color everyday because of the institutional racism that exists in america most of the branch davidians were white straight males well they had a few token black friends to make them look like theyre a multiethnic people of color organization but really it was just token white supremacy and use them as their pawns for their nefarious agenda
  oh my
  based tumblr bot
this kills the knight
someone shop brendan fraser into the knight please
  after losing dozens of comrades
  who drew this shit what is even going on here
  my feet hurt  tfw no breastplate stretcher
  a knight getting btfo by peasants
  some guy playing battlefield 1453 is afk and about to get ganked
  anti cav spear infantry  warfare is total war rock paper scissors game  didnt knights have lances long enough to outreach peasant spears and you needed actual pikemen to block cavalry charge
  except those arent real spearmen its a battle depicting the autistic fights in greece between the latin kingdom founded by crusader knights after sacking constantinople and the catalan company who were mostly light infantry guys wielding javelins
  depends entirely on time and location
  also the spear formation has to discipluned enough not to flee after the first two rows in front of them were shot/overrun
  imagine wearing hardly any armor having wooden shield and a rusty spear  imagine being put in the first row  imagine a formation of heavily armored battle hardened knights trained from childhood to oppress peasants charging at you  id shit my pants tbqhwyf
how did wages and taxation work in the former communist states like those in europe with government control  no shitfling please genuinely curious
  hoxha abolished taxation i believe
albania and the dprk abolished taxation    wages were paid according to quality difficulty  social utility and quantity of work so someone who worked as a clerk or janitor would get paid less than someone who worked as a coal miner scientist engineer or factory worker but it would be more than enough to cover basic needs until the rightwing revisionists ruined the economy in the 80s and there wasnt anything to buy anymore
taxes were already calculated into a wage people would get product cards instead of money those cards were given basing of economic state of the country  pole here shit was not good back then
  ration cards were immediate post war and about a decade before the collapse otherwise wages were paid in currency and exchanged as such  still no taxation because when state industry is the employer taxes are just extra and unnecessary bureaucracy
  so long as the bosses pretend to pay us we will pretend to work    yeah it was the right wing revisionists fault that the economy was collapsing
the soviet union had a few taxes but they were by and large punitive ones in the postwar period folks caught without children would be shaken down  there was also a miniscule sales tax i assume it was a way of raising prices on staple goods without actually raising the stated price
    this some of the countries had no direct taxes
    how did he pay for the bunkers then
  when the economy is centrally planned and private property is abolished direct payroll taxes are pointless bureaucracy
  ah so there were taxes on social enterprises
wages were paid based on what the central planning committee valued the labor at taxes were almost nonexistent and basically only existed for book keeping
according to genuine soviet encarta about soviets from 1967 i have workers had 12 flat tax and kolhoses 75 tax
  indirect and hidden to continue running the state apparatus welfare infrastructure and education systems yes    
electing a luftwaffe pilot as chancellor    but no nazis and shit
schmidt  nazi  the absolute fucking state of this board  
  luftwaffe pilot  he was an aa officer  but no nazis and shit  he was a sozi not a nazi big difference
  too bad that the modern democrats are jokes compared to the old timers    
  electing a literal nazi party member as chancellor  you dont pour out the dirty water before you have clean one
lets throw a little historical anecdote into this idiotic bait thread since helmut schmidt is the best thing to have ever come out of the spd and op kurtgeorg kiesinger was a member of the nsdap     in 1981 schmidt visited the ddr during a highly tense period of the cold war with both sides modernising their conventional forces and of course the proposed stationing of pershing ii intermediate nuclear missiles in response to the soviet ss20s  when schmidt stepped off the plane and was greeted by honeker honeker was wearing an eastern style fur hat pic related at first it seemed this was just the eastern way or a bit of provocation towards the west later it turned out that the fur hat was chosen because diplomatic protocol didnt force a fur hat to be lifted in front of state leaders as would be the case with most other hats of course schmidt was wearing his hanseatic cap being in the style of a prinzheinrichcap pic related it also according to protocol didnt have to be lifted  so both state leaders werent required to lift either of their hats in front of eachother which seems banal but in the context of the times was a strange and somewhat unintentional compromise

unironically stalin      escape a terrible childhood   reject common morality    have no concern for laws or constraints do whatever you see fit to achieve your goals    completely annihilate your political rivals to the point where you inspire an entire book about how society will devolve into police states that do nothing but attempt control and erase history   conquer a large chunk of the european continent    build up a vast industrialised superpower
   reject common morality trying to reach your personal goal with no regard for your fellow man    since when is being a cunt synonymous to being an ubermensch

btfo by frederick the great  btfo by napoleon  btfo by napoleon iii  btfo by bismarck  btfo by italy and serbia    is austria the country with the most pathetic military history
  arguably austria played the biggest part in napoleons downfall since their constant warring ground down le grand army
  austria was on the decline by that point if you want to see austria not pathetic look at their late medieval and renaissance history    although the military wasnt supposed to be their strong point bella gerant alii tu felix austria nube and all that
  that would be the russian winter
  some of these are right others are wrong   by frederick the great  right   by napoleon  no they btfod him and got huge gains in doing so   by napoleon iii  eh kinda they had the last laugh in that they wouldnt help him when he was desperate for him   by bismarck  yeah in the long run bismarck had to design a political system around them and they brought down bismarcks reich through it   by italy and serbia  nah serbia did well but got btfod and italy got its shit kicked in until the empire was literally collapsing    anyways how do you talk about the austrians when the ottomans were right next door they were uninterrupted shithousetier for like over two centuries straight
it looks like that because they lasted so long but they had a competent military their main enemies were ottomans anyway and they prevailed in centurieslong tug of war
  thats a weird way of spelling great britain
  serbia got btfo by germans and most importantly bulgarians attacking on a weak flank not by austrians
  no they btfod him and got huge gains in doing so    lmao  before the french revolution austria owned belgium most of germany and half of italy  by 1815 all they had left of it was a tiny chunck of italy
  germans played a decent role the bulgarians a bigger one but the austrians didnt just sit back and watch admittedly this was a shitshow for austria but they did eventually overrun serbia    eh belgium for lombardy and venetia is a pretty good swap in my books consolidated holdings too and who wants a border with france their german holdings largely remained the same the hre was a meaningless title by that point and they even gained salzburg and they retained control of italy there were loads of habsburgs on the thrones of the minor states and even the restored bourbons in the two sicilies were indebted to them no idea what youre going on about there
  the hre was a meaningless title by that point    no  just no  the title is always important
redpill me on him and the huguenots
  da jooooooooooooooooz diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
  huguenots  redpilled  wrong
  why
why do people say that britain controlled india when there was no such thing as an india but rather small princedoms and fiefdoms    furthermore why do people say britain owned india when they had no authority to directly enforce judicial laws no authority to enforce courts over indian subjects and no authority to collect direct taxes    by all means all of its economic potential was indeed manipulated by the british to suit their own needs by manipulating the economic functions of the subcontinent they indeed managed to hold a formal quasipolitical control over the people but all the respective princelings and other rulers still held normative power over their subjects basically whatever they achieved was only due to mere consequences over economic mechanisms     what the british had achieved was concession of total economic control over the subcontinent but in no way political or military control
  why do people say that britain controlled india when there was no such thing as an india but rather small princedoms and fiefdoms  why do people call it europe when its actually a bunch of different countries clearly that means the concept of europe as a whole doesnt exist
  only retarded americans think europe designates a country or a wouldbe country that idea of europe was for so long twisted expanded and vague that nobody even knows who or what a european country is its basically a 13th century frankish meme they borrowed from the ancient greeks
    lmao buttblasted pajeet about actual civilized peoples having to teach him how to wipe his ass properly
  do you poo in loo
      not an indian
look at your own map vast sections of the raj were under direct eec control turned over to the crown after the sepoy rebellion the rest were in subjugation to the company and a veneer of independence was maintained to keep the population of those princely states docile
  89 years under direct eec control    woah so this is the true power of british imperialism
  ends the superpower status of your entire empire
  you realize the sepoy rebellion was put down correct    long enough to make vast amounts of money and give indians one hell of a complex
  literally any attempt at trying to directly control the indic subcontinent ended up in failure for the british empire    east company indirect rule with rigorous economic exploitation with moderately respecting religious sensibilities  sepoy rebellion    direct control respect of religious sensibilities and economicsocial statuses by integrating indians in british civil service  independence    face it britain didnt own shit except economic monopoly and its a misnomer to call it part of an empire when all it ever shared at one point in time was a common head of state
  why do people call it europe when its actually a bunch of different countries     because its what the continent is named after raj
  no one denies large swathes of land existed as vassals and not under direct control however key regions and conduits were directly controlled and vassals were heavily monitored and restricted to ensure they could not build any meaningful military might and did not support rebels not sure what definition of empire you are using but generally speaking india was part of the british empire
  you are right britain did nothing india got to be the miserable failure it is today by its own efforts
  it would have been part of the british empire if all secular laws existent within britain at the time would also apply to the parts in the subcontinent heavily influenced by it this was clearly not the case ergo it was part of the british empire in absolutely no other way than being an economic tributary
  nah brits had much more political control than you are letting on got to pick heirs and so such like the other anon said the autonomy was just a convenient fiction
  got to pick heirs and so such  how is this not the case for literally the entire history of european monarchs or according to you spain and austria used to belong to france and uk belongs to belgium just because they influenced who the rulers were
  britain didnt have military control     i guess all those mutinies they put down and princes they diposed dont count

he was a brutal dictator who butchered kurds muslims and his own people he hated israel and he hated democracy just like putin and the altright i dont understand the apologism for dictators like saddam on here why      we need to be for democracy social justice freedom liberty and equality fascism and nationalism and authoritarianism is not okay democracy and social justice and social democracy is the way to go
  he was a brutal dictator who butchered kurds muslims and his own people he hated israel and he hated democracy just like putin and the altright  was he really that based
  go ask /leftypol/ theyre the only people who idolize this pathetic wannabe stalin
  i dont think anyone defends saddam on here
  he hated israel  he hated demoncracy  so he was the good guy all along
  iran and assad were enemies of saddam why mention israel unless you are a false flagging saddamist shill
  you have to be unironically schizophrenic to look at current iraq and say fuck saddam  or just a wellpaid jew shill    iran and assad were enemies of saddam    no one gives a shit about iran it held hands with israel several times and would gladly do it again if it benefits them kys shitraeli/iranian shill
  shilling for a dead guy  the absolute current state of the jidf everyone
  who said anything about opposing the american invasion of iraq meaning liking saddam assad did not want to see a destabilized mess next to him because he knew civil war in syria would be fueled by terrorists in iraq saddam was already in his containment zone
  assad did not want to see a destabilized mess next to him because he knew civil war in syria would be fueled by terrorists in iraq  is that why he fuelled the civil war in iraq with his own flood of terrorists do persian subhumans have the sperm of a mullah injected into their brains during birth or something  who gives a flying fuck what assad likes hes just a puppet and a retard and was bullied by israel nonstop since iraq fell he proclaims panarabist unity while handholding with iran   top fucking lmao
  is that why he fuelled the civil war in iraq with his own flood of terrorists  the war excited subhuman radicals of part of the sunni populations of the middle east assad let them out to die otherwise they would blow themselves up in syria
  unironically typing this post  you need to be 18 to post here too bad you most likely wont make it past 18 when america starts showering tehran with bombs and removes your country for owning nukes   enjoy the future you forged
    assad letting sunnis out  assad kept sunnis on a tight leash you fucktard he was helping iran take control of iraq by flooding it with shiite mercenaries and terrorists to tug it back from sunni terrorists  if you actually think bashar was undermining his position by flooding iraq with sunni militias he did not want or like then you have no fucking insight on the geopolitical disposition of parties in the middle east and you need to cease discussing me politics statim
  its okay to occupy sovregin state and dispose its leader and install friendly govenrment
  sunnis here do because they hate iran
  shut up krd you dumb monkey i hope turks will rape your ugly mother and make 10 more brother for you donkeyfucker
  iraq tried to remove denbts by invading a smaller state
  false
  assad being against the 2003 war means he wasnt an enemy of saddam    lol look up where syria stood in the gulf war dumb /sg/ mudshit
  take power  buddy up with communists  almost immediately invade iran for no reason and still get btfo even though theyve basically fallen to pieces already  rely on handouts from the communists and france to sustain yourself  genocide kurds and shias  in financial ruin after your first disastrous war  invade kuwait  unite literally the entire world against you sans yemen and the plo  get btfo again  genocide kurds and shias again  stubbornly rule over state as your country dies because of your past blunders  maintain the illusion of having wmds and believes the us will never invade  die at the hands of your own people    so this is the cuck that /pol/ posters worship

how was the disco scene in the warsaw pact i heard it was the largest in the world
was it kino    
why did the ainu look so white
  because they mixed with russians
  i believe there arent many ainu left that could pass as white
  this and coincidence japan has a similar climate as europe
  found all the way in the korean peninsula  they are white i swear gguys
  they live in japan you idiot
  ainu  korea
  white people ruled the japanese islands before the yellow yamato race invaded and forced them upwards they were eventually conquered and bred out of existence their barbarian life lost forever all chinks are literally like the borg
  based chinks
    looks like my stoner uncle
  the funny thing is the japanese males carry mostly ainu/jomon haplogroup d this means that it was mostly jomon males that fucked yamato females not the other way around
  including their emperor
  thats johnny galecki hes greek
  they looks like a in between of asian and caucasian because thats what they are before the two races were the same until they separated and took on different phenotypes the ainu were separated from the evolutions that took place on the mainland for like 30000 years on the islands of japan genetically though they are more similar to other asians than they are to any european race
reminder that ainu are white but italians arent
  same thing with neanderthals
  half ainu half japanese woman she definitely looks asian
we wuz  ainu  indo aryans  orginal inhabitants of america  egyptians  jesus  dam is there anything whitey wont claim they wuz
  only blacks say this
  orginal inhabitants of america  except for this one every other one is correct
  that looks like an asiatic w/some caucasoid features i know if youre stupid it can be extremely difficult to notice these things
  based ainu bulls
  shes so pretty good lord white women btfo
  cant blame them yayoi men looked like ayy lmaos
  modern japanese are an ainuid/jōmon race    they dont have a single drop of east asian blood in them
  indo aryans were whiteand still whereand jesus was white too
  there are caucasians in asia you idiotjapanchina and korea arent the only countries on asia
  looks like the standard political commentator on youtube
all the weebs in the west make sense now they are preparing to reclaim their culture and their islands from the yamato
honshu jomons supposedly got gooked pretty early on by the neolithic    hokkaido jomon were more purer and isolated and never received much geneflow from the south but also north from siberian pops related to amerindians    japs are not even closely related to ainu/hokkaido jomon    their jomon ancestors were like native okinawans/ryukyuans who look quite differently from ainu    hence japanese are like 5 of what hokkaido jomon
  phenotype is not genotype they just preserved traits from ancient populations that werent affected by the mongolisation of the other east asians despite looking like some mutt russians they and the jomon are really close to the other people in japan      mina sakai sings well too her imeruat songs are a bit too experimental to my taste but her voice is neat  a shame most ainu women werent that cute if you wanted someone passable youd have to search in sakhalin oshima and shiribeshi where they mixed with the nivkh and the yamato acquiring more gracilised features    gooked pretty early on by the neolithic  almost the emishi from the northeast were conquered in the 9th century but many still held powerful positions under yamato rule  japs are not even closely related to ainu  going by the list they are the 2nd closest ethnic group to them  jomon ancestors were like native ryukyuans  who themselves are 3060 jomon so that may be incorrect its kind of like claiming the frenchies were like the celts
why cant race obsessed incels do basic google searches if you did you would easily find out the ainu people are not genetically caucasian in any way
  me  why do they look white  you and illiterate retard  hurrrr muh genotypes  i made no claims about their genetics learn to read faggot
          cromagnid caucasoid appeared 50000 years ago    cromagnoids are the first caucasoids but not genetically caucasoid since these caucasoids existed 50k years ago long before modern haplogroups formed    keep in mind    chg and ane both split from whg 45000 years ago    caucasoid lineages are mainly from the following caucasoid subgroups    western hg split from chg 45k yrs ago  caucasian hg split from whg 45k yrs ago  anatolian farmers ancestors of south euros  ancient north eurasians split from whg/chg 45k yrs ago      asia was inhabited by various caucasoid groups included those that were genetically separated by more than 45k years ie chg and ainu    /thread
  this    modern caucasoids are survivors subset of the ancient caucasoid race that previously encompassed a greater genetic range and geography
  they were caucasoid but not caucasoid  so pseudocaucasoid or caucasomorph caucasoid implies west eurasian i can agree some east asians didnt look like the modern ones but saying all of it was inhabited by aryanz n shiet until the mongoloids came is much of a stretch   you know the jomon are by all means genetically east asian and even luzia who looks like an abo is very much related to modern amerindians even if they didnt resemble their modern descendants phenotypically a genetic analysis provides proof    japanese ethnogenesis guarantees yous m8
  when people distinguish asian and caucasian asian refers to mongoloids however the term has become somewhat derogatory   asia covers a landmass from turkey arabia india and japan 999 of people understand given the context i wasnt referring to arabs     bbut muh indoeuropeans in india and china  1000bc is obviously too late to be talking about the caucasoidmongoloid split and no caucasian population made it as far as japan and certainly did not effect the ainu
      see     the caucasoid race previously encompassed a greater genetic range    the current survivors whg chg ane are merely a subset of a once larger family included cromags and ainus
  chg caucasoid split from whg 45k years ago yet both are caucasoid the genetic distance between the two is yuge but are clearly caucasoid so ainu would fit the caucasoid race just as chg would
  ah so youre one of those who think race is phenotypical
  why is chg considered caucasoid when it split from whg 45k years ago while ainu exhibits the same caucasoid features and same temporal distance yet spergs get triggered when applying the same logic to ainu as used for chg
    just a quick google search and i found this it doesnt seem like theyre as distant as you say meanwhile ainu cluster with the japanese and somehow theyre caucasoid  theres more to it than the eye can see and the heart can feel
  if norwegians evolve negroid hair skull features then they would cease to be part of the caucasoid race eventhough they would still retain caucasoid haploshit
  45k year distance btween chg and whg is equivalent to the distance between ainu and whg
  nice digits    not him but two things supposedly happening at the same time does not mean they are correlated eastwest eurasian split occurred 50k years ago yet their genetics are different enough for them to be separate races while for chg and whg 5k years less didnt change them that much   time means little if sufficient differentiation does not occur was it constant gene flow less mutations i dont know but for the ainu to cluster with the japanese a timeline isnt the only thing you should be looking at
  they are nordic end of the discussion
   while for chg and whg 54k years didnt change them that much     ainu and chg didnt change that much either phentotypically    keep in mind that cromagnons are the first caucasoids and yet do not belong to any modern caucasoid lineage
  its a i cherry pick images to insert myself into someone elses history thread
  but southern europeans are still subhuman sorry
  yeah m8 but phenotype means jackshit in the end khoisan arent asian and abos arent niggers also where did you read cromags were caucasoids or are you saying that just because of their phenotype    chufsamma is a good pick for the dey wuz aryanz lads
  current year  newfags still biting obvious bait  fucking nu/his/
  cromagnon was fully caucasoid 60k years ago    caucasoid appeared with cromagnons    ainu and nafri share both cromagnoid phenotype this is the only shared phenotype among both d and e people and thus the original phenotype the oldest e samples were all cromagnoid
  he looks like the dude from the big lebowski
  came from central asian peoples who generally look white/ caucasion  this is a picture of a uyghur person theyre the whitest looking native people in china
  nah indoeuropeans entered western china around 3000 bc the ainu were in japan around 30000 bc     uyghurs are the indoeuropean caucasian tocharians who got turked 700ad there is no connection between the ainu and the uyghur
it depends on the amount of jomon vs eastsiberian vs paleosiberian/beringian like dna    the jomon vs eastsiberian would produce a more nivkh or phenotypically east asian    but jomon vs paleosiberian would probably result in a morepseudo european look this makes sense because of ane like phenotype  asi/southern indian phenotype simulates a western eurasian caucasoid    the picrelated is probably high jomon individuals and they tend to look very south pacific melanopolynesian or negrito/australoid vs southeast asian
  only dumb amerifats think that all asians are mongoloids
  nojomon look like polynesians
the fact that people are saying ainu are caucasoid just proves that races sre pseudoscientific categorizations of similar morphology and not actual groupings of genetically related people
pseudoscientific
  can this happen to the uk please
  anglosaxons did exactly that to the romanoceltic population
  cromagnids left no living descendants
  uyghurs arent even native to china though the qing genocided the mongol dzungar from xinjiang and flooded them with uyghurs to repopulate the area

lets discuss the entire history of sunni islamist persecution of mena christians from the first caliphates over 1000 years ago to 25 years ago every instance of persecution by umayyads abbasids mamluks ottomans how christianity disappeared from yemen eastern arabia north africa west of egypt and sudan
  while we are at it include greek and armenian christians in anatolia sicilian christians in malta and sicily and the iberian christians
  socotra as well
  first the umayyad persecution of coptic christians heavy taxes discrimination which led to the bashmuric revolts by copts against the umayyads the umayyads crushed the revolt destroyed churches and sold ciopts into slavery the abbasids later did the asme thing leading to more coptic bashmuric revolts against the abbasids and again churches were destroyed and copts sold into slavery   the abbasid cailph almahdi was harsh against what he deemed heretics and against christians he destroyed christian churches in syria  fatimid ismailis took over egypt from sunnis and stopped the persecution with the exception of caliph al hakim who went mad  ayyubid sunnis took over egypt from fatimid ismailis and resumed mass persecution of copts the ayyubid troops attempted to rape coptic nuns which inspired a martyrdom story and oppressed christians  mamluk sunnis severely oppressed coptic christians and turned christians into a minority in egypt making sunnis the majority they ordered churches to be shut down pogroms against copts made them wear degrading clothing and forced public humiliation  sunnis completely wiped berber christianity out of north africa ibadi states in north africa previously let christianity flourish but the sunnis eradicated it  christianity was eradicated from bahrain qatar uae eastern arabia najran yemen and socotra christian churches in socotra were destroyed by sunnis in the 19th century long after christianity was eradicated there  second rashidun caliph umar ibn alkhattab ordered all christians expelled from the arabian peninsula per a sunni hadith which commands all nonmuslims be expelled from the peninsula  
  nubian christians in sudan defeated the arabs twice at dongola in 542 and 652 and repulsed them for centuries but later arab sunni bedouin migration into the decaying nubian kingdoms of makuria and alodia led to complete sunnification and arabization of sudan and eradication of christianity there
  the coptic christians continued to suffer the same degrading persecution under mamluk rule during the ottomans the mamluks were kept in place by the ottomans and the copts were not freed from most official persecution until muhammad ali took over egypt and established himself as khedive in the 19th century modernizing egypt and bringing in western influences including a halt to extreme mamluk and ottoman degradation of christians there was still legal discrimination in egypt after this continued by sunni sharia
boo fucking hoo if their animal headed gods could actually do anything they would have stopped it
  the assyrian and chaldean christians suffered severely under ottoman sunni persecution even before the young turks and assyrian genocide the ottomans unleashed sunni turk and kurd tribesmen against the assyrian and chaldean christians in eastern anatolia armenian highlands and northern iraq kurdish sunni chief bedr khan beg carried out genocide on behalf of the ottoman turkish sunnis against the assyrians and there were large massacres in 1843 and 1846 in hakkari  the ottomans unlseashed turkish and kurdish irregulars to commit genocide against armenians in the hamidian massacres in 18941896 and later turkish sunnis committed the adana massacres in 1909 against armenian christians the ottoman sunni turks later committed the armenian assyrian and greek genocides against christians all over the ottoman empire and the mount lebanon famine against levantine christians   the ottoman sunni turks incited sectarian tensions between druze and maronites in lebanon leading to massacres of maronite catholics and western intervention to protect the maronites in lebanon  the turkish sunnis massacred and raped greek orthodox christian civilians in northern cyprus in their invasion in operation attila in 1974 in the late 20th century they are still raping and killing christians  turkish sunnis committed the istanbul pogrom against greek orthodox christians in 1955 and raped and killed greek girls
  the ayyubid sultan saladin was given the title oppressor of the people of the cross christians while in egypt
  boo fucking hoo if their animal headed gods could actually do anything they would have stopped it  this is the mind of a diseased sunni islamist
islam is a mental disorder
  i think they were raided by a lot of nomadic cushites too like the beja
  worshipping retarded incest furry gods is a beautiful cultural tradition  the absolute state of /his/
  muslims in the 500s
  yes who gives a shit about sources islam is evil jews told me so
    its called a typo you moron 642 and 652 5 and 6 are next to each other on the keyboard
  none of these christians who despise you are jews
  copts arent really christians even if the laity think so solid cryptopagan nonsense
  he meant to type 642 you retard      
    christians dont worship animal headed furry gods sunni
  stop spewing shit
  t sufi animist
  lets discuss  very well then i believe that muslim persecution of christians in the newly conquered territiories was fully justified simply because might makes right and diversity so far has been proven to be harmful to society 
christianity in north africa survived under tolerant sufri kharijite ibadi rustamid and shia ismaili fatimid rule but was wiped out by intolerant sunnis in the medieval ages
  1 dinar has been deposited into your account
  drinking camel urine and fgm is harmful to society
  sunni shafiis introduced fgm and male circumcision to copts after christianity wiped out those practices in ancient egypt fgm is not part of coptic christian theology but it is part of shafii sunni theology
  drinking camel urine and eating locusts were introduced to other countries outside of arabia thanks to sunnis
  the ottomans committed near genocide in interior anatolia against greek christians turkmen tribes ravaged cities and cappadocian greek christians in anatolia hid in giant underground cave cities to hide from turkish sunni slaughter against christians
  its called kaymakli underground city turkey drove out greek christians from anatolia into greece in the 1920s
  there is derinkuyu underground city and özkonak underground city in avanos
  coptic christian sailors forced by the arabs to row in the galleys of umayyad ships defected to the byzantine empire during the umayyad attempts to conquer anatolia and beisege constantinople the coptic christians of egypt revolted against umayyad and abbasid caliphates int he bashmuric revolts but never revolted against eastern roman byzantine rule
do arab christians do the whole incest thing like arab muslims or is marrying your first cousin restricted to mohammed and abdul
  fgm is not part of coptic christian theology  this is the greatest reach in a thread full of them lmao
    you dont even know what youre talking about and tell others theyre wrong wow  just wow
  coptic and levantine christians arent ethnically arabs only linguistically and assyrians arent arabs in any sense of the word i know many middle eastern christians mostly levantines and assyrians and firstcousin marriage is basically considered an abomination and is not practiced by them a lot of christian communities in the middle east are endogamous a natural tendency when youre a christian people surrounded by muslims which some incorrectly associate with inbreeding   as far as i know its a muslim thing
  i wouldnt say that drinking urine is anywhere near common or even rare in the muslim society and fgm is a almost exclusively african practice    youre not even a muslim you can shill for shia islam all you want but in the end we both know that youre just a retarded magapede honestly believing that shia denomination is synonymous with moderate/secular islam iranian antiarabism and jjust pretending to be muslim bullshit heard from degenerate diaspora
   and fgm is a almost exclusively african practice  this is a big lie fgm is practiced by shafii sunnis in oman hormuzgan iraqi kurdistan dagestan malaysia and indonesian shafii books mandate fgm for women and fgm appears in sunni hadith
  youre not even a muslim you can shill for shia islam all you want but in the end we both know that youre just a retarded magapede honestly believing that shia denomination is synonymous with moderate/secular islam iranian antiarabism and jjust pretending to be muslim bullshit heard from degenerate diaspora  the iranian diaspora who do that are atheist we dont give a shit about individual secularity or internal religious practices we despise those who commit terrorist attacks against us and murder and rape christians and claim to be victims a lifelong religious shia who didnt kill anyone is more valuable than a sunni who skipped prayers smoked hashish listened to rap music but suddenly decided to blow himself up in paris because he believes his sins wiuld be forgiven for killing infidels as it is written in your books you still dont get it roach
  fgm isnt part of coptic religion but it is part of sunni belief
  can we talk about how christfags and mudslimes annihilated and overcoded the beliefs and cultures of hundredsthousands of ethnic groups from ireland to central asia and north africa also maybe how the entirety of west asia and north africa have been partially or completely turkified and arabized in great part because of the religion of peace any slavs or balts want to comment on germaniggers using christianity as an excuse to rape you guys again
  we dont like to offend and name those who are not our enemies it is very clear who is blowing themselves up and raping yazidi and christian girls we will name the very clear and obvious perpetrators and not drag other sects in so that they would feel slighted and feel the need to defend their religion why should we attack and insult them the heat will only be on the one sect responsible for terror
  that explains why fgm is limited to africa christian countries too with a relativelytoafrica small percentage in iraq and heavily africaninfluenced yemen    we wuz tolerant n sheeeit  reminder that shia muslims also have insane terrorist rate except its lower than sunni because shiites have much lower population and their countries have been neither invaded nor even interacted much with christians and other religions
  then why do copts do it  the bible also says dont tattoo yourself and copts do that does it have to do with their cryptopaganism then
muh hadiths muh hadiths  oy vey somebody got into the (((wikipedia))) again  ever notice the quran itself is against hadiths oh wait we dont read the text because we can copy and paste and make unsourced assertions  its bad because 9/11 isis immigration  (((and who pray tell is behind that)))  read your talmud kids  dont worship penis idols and furry gods
  that explains why fgm is limited to africa christian countries too with a relativelytoafrica small percentage in iraq and heavily africaninfluenced yemen  sure dagestan kurdistan hormuzgan in iran malaysia oman and indonesia are all influnced by africa whats the next excuse shafii sunnis in oman practice fgm but ibadis in oman do not shafii sunnis in iran practice fgm but twelver shia in iran do not the shafii fiqh book reliance of the traveller says women must undergo fgm shafii sunnis are singlehandedly responsible for omans sky high fgm rate
  but muh reliance sez  omanis are ibadi  lol
  shafii sunnis in oman practice fgm but ibadis in oman do notshafii sunnis are singlehandedly responsible for omans sky high fgm rate
  whites arent smart enough to produce a religion as coherent as semites could
  oman is over 50 shafii sunni in population ibadis rule oman but are only over 40 of the population the percentage of people who practice fgm in oman matches the percentage of shafii sunnis in oman
  first it was sunnis  then it was oh shit i got called out  moves goalposts to shaafi and a book written 700 years after muhammads death  skyhigh rates conflict with omani demographics  look i jjust know twelevers and ibadis never do it ok everything can be pigeonholed and nothing is pre islamic  still cant explain why copts are doing it except somehow sunnis made them do it  what was the point of any of this again  but muh reliance  based shia  yazidis dont worship satan even though they do  assyrians were based and peaceful and not genocidal psychopaths who are lucky to have any sort of remnant  trinitarianism is somehow monotheism because i say so
  so again copts are doing it because
  hormuzgan province in iran has arab sunni shafiis where they practice fgm khuzestan province in iran has arab twelver shia and they dont practice fgm at all dagestan kurdistan malaysia and indonesia are all shafii and all of them practice fgm
  oman is over 50 shafii sunni in population  cite your sources
  copts adopted many things from their shafii neighbours including the arabic language arab names arabized names male circumcision fgm before the arab conquest the copts spoke coptic and didnt speak arabic and the church said male circumcision was not necessary
  a ridiculous assertion that no one practiced fgm anywhere ever until the establishment of the shaafi madhab which flies in the face of reality but who cares its only /his/    based shia time  little is known about fgm in india where the ritual is carried out in great secrecy by the closeknit shia muslim sect thought to number over 1 million    fgm which can cause serious physical and psychological problems is more commonly linked to african countries which have led international efforts to end the practice    india is not included on un lists of countries affected by fgm campaigners say dawoodi bohras are the only muslim community in south asia to practise fgm estimating that up to three quarters of bohra girls are cut    although it is not mentioned in the holy quran the bohras consider khatna  the removal of part of the clitoris  a religious obligation and debate on the subject has long been taboo    nnot mentioned by the quran
here i just made all this up too    historically the first mention of male and female circumcision appears in the writings by the greek geographer strabo who visited egypt around 25 bc    one of the customs most zealously observed among the egyptians is this that they rear every child that is born and circumcise the males and excise the females strabo wrote in his 17volume work geographica    a greek papyrus dated 163 bc mentioned the operation being performed on girls in memphis egypt at the age when they received their dowries supporting theories that fgm originated as a form of initiation of young women    other writers later explained that the procedure was carried for less ritualistic reasons    according to the 6th century ad greek physician aetios the cutting was necessary in the presence of an overly large clitoris    seen as a deformity and a source of shame the clitoris would produce irritation for its continual rubbing against the clothes thus stimulating the appetite for sexual intercourse    on this account it seemed proper to the egyptians to remove it before it became greatly enlarged especially at that time when the girls were about to be married aetios wrote in the gynecology and obstetrics of the sixth century ad  muh islams
  dawoodi bohra are mustali ismaili shia and practice fgm because their hadith says fgm must be done i know about them nizari ismaili shia abrogated hadith so they dont do fgm twelver shia dont do fgm
  male circumcision was practiced before islam but it is also part of islam pork being forbidden was practiced before islam but it is part of islam
  the conversion of pagan egyptians to coptic christianity eradicated both practices of male circumcision and fgm but sunni shafiis reintroduced both practices to egypt centuries later the coptic church taught that male circumcision was not needed and replaced spiritually like paul said in the bible
spell 1117  but if a man wants to know how to live he should recite it a magical spell every day after his flesh has been rubbed with the b3d unknown substance of an uncircumcised girl mt and the flakes of skin šnft of an uncircumcised bald man   inscription on egyptian sarcophagus c 19911786 bce    but no the copts totally just copycat shaafis muslims must have vandalized this to make it seem as though it was preislamic copts have no agency
  source sunnis outnumber ibadis in oman    
  based and dare i say it redpilled as well
  see  
  no mention of shaafi  weird
  ever notice the quran itself is against hadiths    how do you pray without hadiths
  funny how iraqi christians are whiter than their muslim counterpart
  you dont hes one of those quranist diy islam muslims nizari ismailis abrogated hadith and they dont do salat
  no theyre not i shared an apartment with an iraqi assyrian for one year during college and he was short swarthy and shitskin
  maronite christians in lebanon sided with crusaders against their sunni oppressors and entered into communion with the catholic church france acted as their protector against the ottoman sunnis
  hello baal zubab
  on average the assyrians are lighter
  christcucks are intellectually inferior 
  no theyre not you just want to convince yourself otherwise so you can interject your cringy /pol/tier isms into the equation
  that doesnt make them germanicnordids it just makes them light skinned caucasoids as opposed to swarthy caucasoids from the levant
  average muslim arab is 20 negroid average assyrian is 0
  you stand  you bow  you prostrate    do you have a compulsion to make shit up or what
  and even with that said the average assyrian is a still a brown short swarthy manlet
  average muslim arab is 20 negroid  do you have any peer reviewed population genetics studies that backup your claims if its just yemen and oman im not really inclined to agree with you
  manlet   it is european who are oversized faggots the average man is 5758 foot tall
  pretty sure levantines are lighter than mesopotamians
  i think that anon just met a darker assyrian i know shit tons of assyrian guys and 5910 dark brown hair brown eyes and olive/fair/tan skin is basically the norm theyre usually not blonde haired blue eyed germanic types although they are occasionally and theyre usually not swarthy brown arab types although they are occasionally   but they are legitimately fairer than the iraqi arabs enough so that theres a folk belief amongst the arabs that the assyrians are not native to that area and had migrated from europe at some point  the reason for the fairness is the lack of arab and subsaharan african admixture both a result of their christian faith and partly as a result of their geographic isolation people like the assyrians are usually a pretty good indicator as to what the prearab inhabitants on an area looked like
  but they are legitimately fairer than the iraqi arabs enough so that theres a folk belief amongst the arabs that the assyrians are not native to that area and had migrated from europe at some point  have they ever considered the fact that they were not the native ones and migrated from elsewhere
dont forget what they did to european women
  well southern iraqi arabs are as far as i know actual arabs from the gulf i think the schools teach the truth i was just referring to the kind of uneducated stuff that circulates amongst children   i think any arab in possession of a threedigit iq would lay the achievements of mesopotamia at the feet of the modern assyrians who i personally dont believe are descended from the ancient assyrians and understands that their relevant history mostly begins with islam
  yes the southern iraqi shia are descendants of arab tribes who migrated from the arabian peninsula in the ottoman era in the 17th18th centuries this was after the mongols timur and other invaders slaughtered the natives of southern iraq and destroyed their irrigation system the mandeans are the only remnants of the natives of southern iraq the iraqi shia can claim to be real arabs of tribal origin unlike northern iraqi sunnis unlike levantines of all religions
  i have mandean neighbors theyre an interesting people while a lot of them have the middle eastern look they are naturally lightskinned and could be a basis for the appearance of peoples like the sumerians
  middle eastern look  naturally lightskinned     so italians
  basically   there was that one joke in i think the boondocks where there was this fictional show italian or terrorist
  the islamic golden age was done by syriac christian scientists and translators who translated from greek into syriac into arabic and even pagan syriacs like thabit ibn qurra from harran arabs contributed almost nothing it should be called syriac christian golden age
  the abbasid caliph actually threatened the pagans of harran with death if they did not convert to a dhimmi religion mentioned in the quran since the pagans were neither jewish nor christians they chose to identify their religion as sabianism a third ahl alkitab religion mentioned in the quran nobody knew what sabianism was besides muhammad so they couldnt challenge their claims their religion is dead now and has been replaced by sunni islam
  bullshit there are brown assyrians but most of them have these skin colors
  and the scientists who were muslims were persians arabs had nothing to do with the golden age
  dont forget the berbers and andalusians    this is a pretty accurate generalization
  they were intermixed with akkadians and assyrians by some point and any other regional power in babylonia
why did the christians lose so much against islam anatolia northern africa nubia middle east arabian peninsula some parts of balkans and iberia for a very long time are christians weak or are islamics just that strong
  same way rebuild is more popular than eoe people like reboots more because they are more easilydigestible and concise
  they believe they get 72 virgins and intercession for 70 relatives on the day of judgement if they die as a martyr in jihad they are allowed to keep infidel girls from jihad as sex slaves sabaya what their right hand posseses
  no its precisely the opposite they autistically search out a couples family tree many generations back in order to make sure there are no blood ties
  chechens and circassians were culturally influnced by eastern orthodox christianity before converting to sunni islam so they forbid cousin marriages unlike middle eastern sunnis thet let their culture override religion in this case sunni circassians and sunni chechens in jordan do not practice cousin marriages while sunni levantines and sunni bedouins do
  eoe
  long live hitler
  thats not the worst he said

  its another islam bashing thread  need i remind you people that christians in europe eradicated every religion except their own christianity has been the only belief in europe for nearly a thousand years meanwhile christianity judaism zoroastrianism manicheism and druze are still kicking around in the near east european christians were barbaric as fuck towards pagans mistreatment on nonmuslim minorities is paltry in comparison
  manicheism  its extinct  druze   druze are a religion which branched off ismaili shia islam  christianity  extinct among natives in najran yemen bahrain uae qatar kuwait eastern saudi arabia soqotra sudan libya tunisia algeria morocco reduced to a minority in egypt palestine syria jordan iraq
i remember constantly making informational posts on this subject and on assyrochaldeans until a few months ago    its nice to come back and see this board is still unable to discuss such a subject but does the usual /his/ diarrhea motions
  how many prayers each day
whats their story and why arent there conspiracy theories about them
  for those who dont know  
seriously nothing
theyre like the shriners an excuse for old guys to get drunk and fuck around    bumping for interest
  basically a supper club for old people
isnt that amazing  this niggas barely ate any fish and rely mostly on pork and roots among all other things  never wander further than a sight of land with their primitive rafts    i found that interesting online book  
  pigs were probably introduced by mainland asians same with papua
  i remember reading that book specifically how women are never ever supposed to show men their vagina and they believe that sex pushes freefloating spirits into their wombs your link is broke though
i cannot overestimate the malignant effect this woman has had on the west when people say oh dont be silly jews arent trying to undermine the west you need only point them towards this jewess and see how pernicious her effect on modern christianity particularly the new brand of catholicism espoused by francis has been    her theology basically amounts to the one who has suffered the most what she terms affliction is the one who is most blessed her view on affliction combined with her idea that the purpose of christianity is a social and not a spiritual endeavor is the reason why liberation theology exists and what is the antipopes justification for all his bullshit recently with immigrants thats right theyre afflicted they need our help the church is a social mission    her book the need for roots is single handedly the most jew book i have ever read it argues that fake roots like ethnicity make people unhappy and vicious and that the real roots are communal ownership and diverse communities she spends a section discussing patriotism and says that any patriotism that is based on pride of a nations strength is evil and that true patriotism is compassion  compassion for others in the nation as well as those outside it    seriously the damage this cunt has inflicted on society is monumental and heres the thing  no one outside academia knows her shes standard reading in european theology courses and therefore every single member of the established churches in europe are beholden to her ideas guiding opinion making in religion weakening religious bonds causing our religious leaders to do insane shit
  that nose is so big she could light up a cigarette in the rain without having to cover it with her hands
if the most afflicted are the most blessed then wouldnt it be evil to try and ease their affliction as that would be in fact reducing their blessedness
  the sermon on the mount goes on and on about how the most wretched miserable cunts are the most blessed
  i know nothing about her except what wikipedia and your post contain but she seems very based and agree with these views also she was cute
  also why is it that those who follow this supremely loving god are always so full of resentment
  weil is pretty obscure desu i dont think she has really had that much influence at all    also  thinks francis is a shit pope  yeah into the trash you go
  not thinking francis is a shit pope
  hes mediocre but hes not terrible
  she spends a section discussing patriotism and says that any patriotism that is based on pride of a nations strength is evil and that true patriotism is compassion  compassion for others in the nation as well as those outside it  the contempt for the very concept of compassion is palpable  and this person calls themselves a christian and would likely say that their faith is an integral part of who they are  cant make this shit up
  your gay cult has a lot of people who only ascribe then name christian to themselves because of power fantasies or shame regarding their sexuality or simple conformity to their awful familys faith youre surprised there are lunatic antisemite catholics
  while you could argue that jews or leftists or liberals whoever you are blaming this time over undermining the west why is it that the right hasnt made an effective response to this toxic subversives  til this day i havent seen no rightist made an effective critique or refutation of the franfkurt shcool they only point out that they are jews well yeah sure they are jews but they havent adress none of the arguments written by adorno or marcuse    conservatives have utterly failed in consrving anything it seems to me that the right is just weak
  stop whining incel tldr
  wow whites sure are dumb and easily manipulated
anybody watch this on netflix great miniseriesesque adaptation 8 1hr episodes of the trojan war opinions
    
  not talking on /his/ ever  but seriously you should kill yourself
i am suspicious of any modern historical adaptation especially if its coming from netflix even outlaw king which got touted as historically accurate couldnt hold themselves from adding a bunch of niggers ad hoc in bumfuck poor scotland  inb4 /pol/  shut the fuck up
  there are admittedly some oddities like achilles and some of the greeks being straight subsaharan but its far from ruining anything there is a lot of attention to detail in terms of historical accuracies they get at least as accurate as one can hope with a semi fictitious war
  they all look like theyre wearing dd gear mate
    being this mad about the camera panning over 3 three black musicians for a second then never showing them again
  who said im mad im just calling a spade a spade they couldnt once restrain themselves from not having subsaharan afrians in the furthest corner of the world they could have been in barring the americas
  the main characters sometimes are shown wearing leather which despite the meme was a real albiet lass popular form of armor look at the scenes of the greeks raids though large round shields spears or swords bronze breastplates generally pretty hoplite looking armor
  its negligible honestly it only added to the port being a place that attracted foreigners and since its so brief it makes sense to show the most noneuropean looking people if only for a brief moment its also not that unlikely there was trade with west africa idk it seems more like people were looking for this stuff and when they saw it for a second its like a gotcha moment kinda like how sjw look for things to be offended by
  thats all fine and dandy but theres two problems 1 to me they look like theyre wearing dark leather batman armors and 2 homers greeks werent hoplites yet
  trade was done through intermediates until the portuguese did it in the 16th century you didnt come all the way to the other side of the globe to trade especially not with a poor warthorn shithole like scotland you sold it to a trading port who sold it to another trading port who sold it to another and so on and it passed through different people until it reached your neighbors who sold it to your people
  there is a lot of attention to detail in terms of historical accuracies  oddities like achilles and some of the greeks being straight subsaharan
  implying the two cant exist together ie getting most things right with some oddities
  1 ok  2 what did your typical greek look like during the trojan war
  google mycenaean armor
  theyd have looked like late mycenaeans/dark ages greeks

in a communist society by what criteria do women select their mates
they choose the richest liberator
physical characteristics you can already see what this would be like in nonmaterialist egalitarian northern europe  the irony is that traditional beauty becomes even more important so you are taking out of the equation the hard work and accomplishments and replacing it with physical traits like height and blue eyes
  the higher youre in the party the more bitches you get like beria
  lmao i dont choose my women on their eye colour
  the party decides who mates with whom
tiddies
  it was just an example also you dont choose your women women choose you unless youre lesbo
  read the dispossessed
  his is sexy today
  i know first anne frank now this
  99 certain thats a drag queen but thats not to dispute you
  what the fuck man
  trannies are bourgeois and not allowed in communist society
  from what i have been told at least from the khrushchev era it was actually a very romantic time because salary didnt matter much and people married each other for personality and attraction with money being less of a factor
  sounds like shit romantic time only if youre attractive
  for starters if hes whte its an automatic no
  thats true of every society tho
  no media that constantly makes women insecure though    
    whiteness is one of best traits to have if you want to be attractive white women only want white men and nonwhites think you they scored if they get a white guy  people who say this shit you are saying are probably not really white i bet you look arab or some shit like that
  i think the posters are trying to push the communism is antiwhite maymay
  anon you going to forever stay a virgin if you continue to believe that romance is nothing but base physical attraction
  kara boga
  just like anywhere else in time and space uglies fucked one another otherwise russia would simply not exist i do love how you just disregard the personality angle though its got to be hard being an ugly person with a shitty attitude and inordinately high standards
  lmao nobody cares if youre ugly faggot
  the exact same criteria as in every society
  nonmaterialist egalitarian northern europe    you can already see what this would be like  
my granny choosed grandad because he was kind  my mom choosed dad because he was funny and a chad  neither of them were party members avarage ppl like teacher mechanic without any noteable wealth    make what you will from it
  communists often like to discard or outright laugh at the human nature arguments but this will inevitably be the one place they get critically mangled  under proper communism given the elimination of all societal norms and educational/socioeconomic disparities youd have a selection process completely based on looks since it remains the only nonequalized factor i can already see the pareto principle in play with the majority of women freely and almost exclusively engaging only with the male top20 beauty elite and having communityraised children only by them due to the breakdown of the family as a structure and the reliance on it for security and subsistence the overwhelming majority of men will be left as depraved incelesque masses and frankly i dont see how such a system would survive for any amount of time      khrushchev  the ussr was absolutely nowhere near anything that remotely even resembles proper communism though tankie nigger      theres a wellpronounced looks disparity between men and women though there are more ugly men than ugly women
i live in the us unfortunately but i dont think my wife chose me because of money
  also you dont choose your women women choose you  maybe your woman chose you lmao
  sexual human nature is actually real whereas the economic human nature is propaganda bullshit
  there are more ugly men than ugly women  you have no idea if there is a actually a disparity or not ugly women wear makeup and ugly men dont most of us dont even notice plain women at all and most of us dont notice if men are handsome unless they are so good looking it makes us selfconscious
  its an accepted fact in the study of human relationships women chose men not the other way round to be fair you could be a chad in which case you have choice good for you if you are but most men are not
    there are more ugly men because women go for status markers and status markers are objective things like   whiteness  height  square face  big torso  these are all objective whereas men have more variety of taste some of the women others consider attractive i consider ugly and vice versa
  its cold today so much for global warming  cmon son
  i wouldnt know what to call myself but i did contemplate leftist ideologies and still i do agree with you on this point once everything else is equal physical features become the main differentiator  i dont agree with you that family structures break down under communism i dont see any reason for that    also it might not be too long before we have genetically programmed babies so this is just a contemporary problem
marxists dont like to make predictions about what communism will be like heres engles take    what we can now conjecture about the way in which sexual relations will be ordered after the impending overthrow of capitalist production is mainly of a negative character limited for the most part to what will disappear but what will there be new that will be answered when a new generation has grown up a generation of men who never in their lives have known what it is to buy a womans surrender with money or any other social instrument of power a generation of women who have never known what it is to give themselves to a man from any other considerations than real love or to refuse to give themselves to their lover from fear of the economic consequences when these people are in the world they will care precious little what anybody today thinks they ought to do they will make their own practice and their corresponding public opinion about the practice of each individual  and that will be the end of it
  i mean hes not wrong
  i dont agree with you that family structures break down under communism i dont see any reason for that  well it becomes obsolete prioritizing genetic bonds seems countersocialist  also it might not be too long before we have genetically programmed babies so this is just a contemporary problem  and the scale always moves up appropriately
  well it becomes obsolete prioritizing genetic bonds seems countersocialist  abolition of the family means replacement of the nuclear family with extended family you dolt
  women have more variety of taste than you think im sure there is some bakedin gender difference since female selection has historically been suppressed but that doesnt necessarily speak to the present day    bear in mind that men and women inherit both their parents looks in varying degrees i male look a lot more like my mother than my dad body hair and dick aside and since im goodlooking i have to chalk that up to her genes theres no reason why male sexual selection would predict that men will usually be uglier  a pattern of selection for beautiful women by plain or ugly men should predict a good proportion of fairly handsome male offspring more likely a lot of this supposed disparity is a matter of perception    this is the first thread ive seen here where i cant easily accuse everybody of being a homo but maybe youre all just real picky homos i imagine that gay dudes largely see other men a little more charitably since they actually have to make realistic selections as a straight guy getting off the internet and looking at real people can really widen your tastes and change your standards nobody actually looks like their profile pictures
  fake jewish chart
  well it becomes obsolete prioritizing genetic bonds seems countersocialist  none of that makes any sense this is the sort of crap some catholic priest would come up with to justify his irrational hatred of communism i know because im catholic if anything it is the other way round it is capitalism that destroyed the family the current situation where parents dont raise their children because they have to work so the day care and then the schools raise and nurture their children for them   meanwhile in communist country they got decent parental leave to actually nurture their children
  i know because im catholic    papists keep moving /his/ is a protestant board
    under communism there will still be countries
  what about us arabs 
  thats under middle eastern
  yeah i saw it im wondering where i will be able to find a native american woman in turkey lol
  arranged marriages commies dont give a shit about love they want an endless supply of laborers
  romance is real for men not for women an easy way to see this is that women find any gentlemanly thing a hot does romantic
  it literally shows the whole bbc myth is fake and you think its jewish propaganda are you dense
  think again protie scam  /his/ is a catholic board
  /his/ is rightfully orthodox
    imagine actually having ancestors who didnt slaughter priests and noblemen like a cuck wow
  literally nobody on 4chan is orthodox stop larping
  non materialist do you even norway
  they select the most equal
  leftists
  connection to the party and therefore access to money
  whites are the most oppressed people today your bullshit chart is jewish propaganda
  parmemo distribution
  look mom i called something a meme
  they are married to the vanguard their natural hypergamy will be unleashed as they will he provided for by all this will kill communism
    everyone is equal  but well totally be able to sustain hypergamy    polygyny always goes handinhand with inequality communism is the only way to solve the incel problem
  polygyny always goes handinhand with inequality  will you ban it what stops women in a stateless society where every physical need is fulfilled to just fuck the top
  job education social status personality looks common interests family connections skills etc    same as in capitalist one with less emphasis on money
   once everything else is equal physical features become the main differentiator  i dont agree with you that family structures break down under communism i dont see any reason for that  how so what about attitude chemistry personality life experience centers of interest artistic tastes
  theres a wellpronounced looks disparity between men and women though there are more ugly men than ugly women  yikes
  polygyny always goes handinhand with inequality    for men women even unmotivated and untalented women can gain access to a powerful man who becomes a resource hub     a true communist state that gives women all resources leads to women only seeking high status males as per their desires you cant have total equality with social and sexual inequality betafags will be mad and you cant genocide betas
all of these matriarchs worrying about which man a woman will get with  you act like women are pigs that snort out the best truffles on the planet in reality women will fuck boys niggers and neanderthals it just depends on the time and place  meanwhile levantine and mediaeval cultures made use of dowries  a farmhand would literally be paid to fuck a maiden
im going to be straight here i am a cuckold but i am also a white nationalist i believe that whites have contributed more to humanity than any other race space travel antibiotics the list goes on but when it comes down to it blacks are just better at fucking theres no shame in admitting this there is no shame in admitting that despite the infinite intellectual and moral superiority of the white race black cock is just better at pleasing women    the reason white women are turning from the cause and running to niggers is simply because they are not being sexually satisfied can you blame them if you dont get enough to eat at home youre going to go out to eat the only way to save the white race from miscegenation is cuckolding my pure white wife is my angel the apple of my eye and i want nothing but the best for her so every friday she gets to have her fill of big black cock and our relationship goes on like normal we love each other and plan on having a child soon she also shares my red pilled beliefs    monogamy is a tool of the jew just give it a chance once its exhilarating theres something deeply majestic about watching a toned muscular black stud going in and out of a beautiful white woman try it once
  the same standards people have always used for sexual selection hot people get first pick and can cuck ugly people middling attractiveness get more sparse but frequent enough attention to not mind this inequitable relationship and ugly people get the scraps with high likelihood of being cucked or trapped in an unsatisfying relationship with trash personality or bad sex life this is really why ugly people fear sexual selection its not so much high standards though we all jerk off to the same symmetrical faces and wince at awkward ugly faces and bodies universally unless mentally ill fetish is in play its more status signaling fear of bad sex life ugly inexperienced man small dick and bad performance smells weird and unconfident perpetually ugly woman with bad body hard to get excited about smells annoying and unconfident sexually poor experience better to jerk off and fear of being cucked ugly guy gets qt gf things good for a few months his bad features start to become tiresome his heights are not high enough for her standards chad seamlessly makes her orgasm and satisfies her chad can have her at some point relationship fragments man has no trust and much self loathing now she has tasted sweeter fruits will never be the same again its not particularly difficult to workout why incels want good looking gfs and why mediocre women avoid ugly men and overvalue their pussy good sex is nothing like bad sex and being able to dominate your partners sexuality is significantly better for self esteem than worry about being denied sex or worse cucked by someone higher value than you pretending there is something wrong with incels or the average tinder whore is insane in the face of these obvious power differentials
  same as in a capitalist society 
  please stop talking this way you arent asking a question you can communicate frustration with stupid lines of inquiry without being an effeminate insect

good /his/ youtube channels and podcasts
  age of napoleon is breddy good
/his/ never recommends books  /his/ never recommends podcasts or videos  /his/ is mostly made of people with no academic background  where do you guys take your history knowledge from paradox games
    
so french revolution only mattered today because napoleon 
no if napoleon had never come around it would have still impacted us today the reason why it seems this way is that napoleon was product of the french revolution and became a major part of history had events transpired that prevented napoleons rise we would still have been impacted by the french revolution primarily in it being one of the first and a major revolt against monarchies
  inb4 burger revolution
  burgers killed king george washington
  i doubt he ate burgers
  i doubt the burger revolution would have inspired change in europe in the way the french revolution had especially if napoleon didnt come to power
  the french revolution was literally a burger revolution in the more literal less slangy sense of burger  bourgeois napoleon himself was a super bourgeois who converted many revolutionary principles into law during the 100 days he even lifted the ban on the previously outlawed la marseillaise with the idea of aligning his rule more squarely with revolutionary ideals foremost of which was the establishment of a meritocracy ie ridding europe of blood aristos both revolutionary and imperial times are perhaps the last two supreme moments in european history politically speaking
  it mattered because it was the beginning of the end for the aristocracy on european continent a system that had been around for arguably 1600 years it also marked the rise of civil secular government its almost impossible to exaggerate the importance of the revolution if anything napoleon only mattered because of the revolution napoleon was a product of the revolution and sought to spread the principles of the revolution albeit through militant imperialist means

so in movies and stuff that are set in ancient egypt they always play this kind of music          where does it actually come from     i dont believe we know what music in ancient egypt sounded like
probably a better question to ask /his/
    but this /his/
bump
  they use arabic / islamic music because of an ignorance of ae music we know their instruments but not their music
    this piece started western imitations and is itself a mimic of arabian music which has been pretty consistent throughout history  since the instruments found in ancient arabia are similar to those of egypt they just use arabian music as an approximation  there are no known egyptian musical compositions
    so its arabic     from what century does this style of music come from     also is it arabic arabic or dis you mean middle east      could it be perhaps turkish or 1900s egyprian or magrebi 
that time rome returned for a second  granted it wasnt exactly well thought out
has there been much scholarship on the history of prison rape if you were dungeoned in the middle ages with some other prisoners in europe was it customary to get bummed or was that a more recent development in the west i dont want this to come off as tawdry im actually curious about the historical genealogy of samesex rape other prisoner experiences like starvation or forced labour have waxed and waned over time and in different regions is rape any different
if according to aristotle etc women are inferior to men and inferior humans shouldnt mingle with superior humans should women marry women and men marry men
implying the purest love isnt between two men anyway

how common were european husbands and arabic wives back then
  when alexander conquered persia and that lead to a few generation of greek coloninies in the mideast im sure a disportionate amount of the greek settlers were men and they took asian wives    even though they mostly situated in bactria egypt asia minor syria and mesopotamia which werent arab then but white guys fucking brown girls is a historical tradition
  back when    postislam not often considering its ok for muslim men to take nonmuslim women but not the other way around   it happened a bit in the kingdom of jerusalem but mostly with christian arabs and i know the french were getting their dicks wet in north africa     preislam pretty common when europeans were in contact with arabs its not like the greeks displaced the natives in the levant they just mixed especially since post alexander greekness really just depended on if you spoke greek and worshipped the greek gods       also its a shame mia khalifa doesnt work anymore shes really hot and not that many arabs in the business
dunno but i want an arab wife
    philippe servaty is a belgian1 walloon journalist who formerly worked for brusselsbased newspaper le soir2 while in morocco from 200205 he engaged in sex with over 80 moroccan women promising to take them to belgium3 before leaving for belgium he asked them for sexual photos as souvenirs and photographed them in poses that could be seen as degrading they included ejaculating on the face of a veiled woman and having another woman kneel bound and gagged while he urinated on her34 after returning to belgium he published the photos on the internet under the pseudonym belguel and included captions such as there is no better drug than to ejaculate on the veiled face of a woman these sluts are so naive if you promise to marry them and take them along with you to brussels they do whatever you ask and i met her walking down the street in her djellaba a few minutes later the fucking bitch did everything i wanted miracles do happen even in a muslim country2356

  muslims invented everything  holy shit allahu akbar
one of my friends is a muslim and there are plenty of ancient scrolls that support many inventions by islam but were claimed by greeks germans and british thieves the word islam means peace or to be peaceful but most people still believe an illiterate bearded dislexic cave dwelling arab named osama bin laden orchestrated 911 he found 16 uneducated arab  pakastani muslims he got them thru customs n immigration at min 4 major international us airports with fake passports  a shitload of boxcutters he found them all nice aptartments cars money and put them thru a flight school in florida flying single engine cesnas not a single one of them could read write or speak english but they somehow managed to hijack 4 large commercial airliners at the busiest highly secured airports in the country im not sure what scares me more the fact that george bush still hasnt been charged with mass murder  crimes against humanity or that we believe a guy hanging out in a dark cave next to a poverty ridden bombed out village in afghanistan planned  financed all of it 500 years from now they will write history books about the usa being most evil empire that ever existed every ally of the us should be ashamed of themselves to allow the us to villify probably the most peaceful religion ever hundreds of thousands of iraqis afghanis and lets not forget palestinian men women children  babies lost their lives for nothing we sat back  watched it happen what if the roless were reversed and the iraqis invaded the us and did the exact same thing saddam hussein would have been tried  executed for such crimes we are all blind nieve  ignorant if you dont see that the world is run by a select few in the shadows come on anonymousdo you really wanna make history absolute chaos havoc  unrest is the only thing that will make people get off there fat asses the people should not fear the government government should fear the people

  he took the bluegill  let me ask you something anon when you say that people fear the government are you speaking for everyone or just yourself you type this dramatic call to action on image based forum for a select few thousand that view this board during this time of day and you do so with a complete sense of peace and security knowing that freely expressing yourself will not be life threatening to you or limiting to said freedoms in any way what do you have to fear then you arent risking anything by posting this nor are you making any attempt to change you simply state that the government should fear the people not the other way around but even you dont really fear this entity of power that you claim to be some boogieman youre truly living in a state of denial that for some reason you feel as though you have something to fear that the power of the government is somehow behind the killings of innocent people you should know well that if you chose to look into history that war regardless of age or time or purpose is always bad by nature and where there is war no matter the side there is death you cannot prevent it you can only limit it which is why there are such things as the geneva convention and law of armed conflict in fact there are many times where people leaders even have been imprisoned for disobeying such and there are also times where the mission is compromised because of these laws we see these today where insurgent groups use hospitals as headquarters for their operations and use the sick and injured as meat shields because our rules dont apply to them i would suggest doing more research on such things because its the same groups of people who disobey and take advantage of our weaknesses and compassion for life that we are taking about now islamic extremist groups not all of islam is bad i myself is iranian and palestinian friends who have left their countries due to their governments unessary causes of war

i heard that a history degree and historical analytical thinking prepares you well for a career in law    i know there are a few attorneys on /his/ tell me about your job what specifically do you do what do you enjoy most about it what is more fulfilling criminal or civil law would you still pick the same job if you could do it over again
i dont know why history would prepare you well for law getting into law is mostly gpa and lsat    there was a giant oversupply of lawyers until 2009 and there is still a huge backlog lots of law grads dont even get work as lawyers the debt is insane for many like 120k at 8 interest    id do it if you are ok doing contract law procurement real estate etc and if you can do well enough to go for free or cheap dont chase the best school you can go to unless you can get into a place like duke yale or columbia go where you want to live and intern where you can get a job    criminal law is highly competitive for people who can actually pay a small minority of clients and dogshit for public defenders you get paid fixed fees so basically your career will be trying to get them to plea down even if they are innocent so that the system isnt even more over clogged than it already is everyone pleads you get less penalty for pleading and the state gets cash in fees    listen to season 3 of seriel for a good idea of what local court houses are like     now municipal law is actually quite interesting you can work on urban planning police brutality union negotiations plus its the rare place with pensions pay is dogshit starting out but gets good later clerk with a decent sized city and there is a lot of cool political and economic planning elements to the game    or just do procurement and contracts for bank    im not a lawyer but i have many friends and coworkers who are municipal law would be my advice because id you dont like law you could parlay a position there into management and then be town manager if you grew up in a big city basically towns and small cities hire professionals to act as mayor its a cool job
serial is the best reporting ive seen on criminal law works    the wire from hbo is also really great but its a drama and makes things much more exciting and dramatic than it really is
  what if a public defender starts taking every case to trial
  then hell waste a lot of time losing them all not him but i interned with a defense attorney not a public defender though and seriously the colossal majority of people charged are guilty of at least one of the charges on the docket yes there are highly publicized trials where someone gets found not guilty theyre not representative of the criminal defense market chances are the majority of your clientele are small time drug dealers who got caught with undercover cops as witnesses and whole bags of product and have no chance whatsoever
  even if they have no chance you could make emotional arguments and get a lower sentence
    i mean if lawyers did a trial strike even if they didnt make every case go but just those where they thought there was a 50/50 shot a jury would let the defendant off or just all the cases where the da wildly over charged to force a plea then the us justice system would come to a grinding collosal hault youd have a legit crisis with the right to a speedy trial gone governments dont have the budget to allow even 25 of cases go to trial itd mean way more judges and das youd likely if it actually kept up end up legalizing drugs and prostitution or just not enforcing those laws to clear the docket for violent crime    right now is pretty fucked das overcharge bumping a cop while in a fight with someone else is felony assaulting an officer they charge felony vandalism here a lot the threshold is just 200 which at todays prices last updated 1948 means even spray painting a wall then to avoid even a hearing with a magistrate for evidence they tell you they will plea for a misdemeanor so you want to risk being a felon and lose voting and gun rights for possibly the rest of your life or eat 1000 fines so even if youre innocent you always plead    speed traps are the same way eat 300 or risk trial  more court fees to get the radar gun records although if you do least than 50 of police dont actually recalibrate and test them as often as in necessary to be used as evidence or plea to a zero point violation and fork over cash     its a joke

  i cant cite specifics but i am pretty sure japanese lore is full of such stories    plus the egyptian gods horus gets killed albeit by his own brother but it shows they were not these immortals in the sense christians think of what a god is they could be harmed and even killed     and theres the greek pantheon they needed mortals to worship them because without that worship they get weaker and if all worship stops then they die

  different anon but theyre not easily visible iirc theyre about the size of a pencil dot thats probably a fraction of a millimeter in diameter
  kind of theyre about as wide as a hair right at the edge of human perception
    bullshit i was a janitor and while the womens restroom was never perfect it still always smelled nicer than the mens
  were you paid
    i used to clean restrooms at a midscale mexican restaurant the restrooms were about equally gross imo except sometimes i would find used feminine products in the womens    either way the comic is way off

  they invested more into the development of some of their colonies and ones like canada and australia worked hard to build themselves up but id say the majority of their former colonies are terrible
  no because they actually put money into their colonies the british invested time effort and money into their colonies as selfsufficient separate entities while in many cases spanish for example colonies were by and large seen as very far away extensions of spain itself   autonomy can be both an extremely good thing and an extremely bad thing it sort of depends on the circumstances by which it comes into place

  british colonies  turning out great  lmao  canada   eastern usa  south africa   india   british guiana   british honduras  bahamas  barbados  trinidad and tobago   egypt  sudan  nigeria   burma   iraq   the holy land  jordan   kuwait   oman   uae  qatar   nambia   botswana   uganda   kenya   zambia   tanzania   zimbabwe   swaziland   lesotho  yemen   gold coast   sierra leone   gambia   papua new guinea   new zealand   australia   malaysia

british history brainlet here what was the best time to be alive as a brit im well aware that the 20th century marked their steep decline into irrelevance but before that what was their best moment or era in history where they were at the peak of their power and the average man was best off
  18501890 was the peak of the anglo although at no point did british power correlate to better treatment for the working classes
  1890  i thought ww1 was the start of the decline did it start earlier than that
bump
  at odds with france and russia for colonial dominance financial supremacy challenged by paris though to be sure only surpassed by new york after the great war naval and industrial supremacy by germany    and no longer able to stay a free rider hence the colonial compromises with france and then russia that then mutated into defensive pacts
18151914
early july 1914
irrelevance  god knows what that makes most countries in the world then theyre far less relevant sure but they have a bigger economy than most and have a lot of soft power as vague as that is
  during the roman empire
  theyre an absolute shadow of their former selves pathetically weak navy most brands are foreign owned and little innovation happening anymore
  keep talking argie
  their soft power is totally dependent on their special relationship with the us  i give you less than 20 years that the us will end its relationship with the uk and the uk becomes completely isolated and crippled as a nation
  weak navy  absolutely pathetic besides the two shiny carriers but that doesnt mean as much as it used to  foreign brands  that would apply to most id imagine  little innovation  they still punch far above their weight in that regard at least pic related is scientific research
  1990  2001  wow its fucking nothing
  do you have a reasonable explanation or evidence as to why it would be significantly different before or after
  probably right before world war 1 in terms of the everyman being comfy while also enjoying all the benefits of colonialism/empire  if you mean in terms of peak power as a county probably mid to late victorian era but conditions of the urban working class fucking sucked
  if a top ten world economy and unsc permanent member is irrelevant then what does that make the majority of the world
  irrelevant compared to the other great powers when was the last time you heard the uk have an impact on well anything they could leave the security council which theyre only on because of historical reasons and literally nothing would change prove me wrong
    only one of them has been commissioned so far and they still dont have any actual aircraft to carry the raf is also apparently actively attempting to fuck them over by ordering planes that can only take off and land from land
  some guy on youtube is basically saying the shitshow with brexit was caused by people who hold onto the idea that britain is this special country with the same influence it had during its colonial years being unable to accept the fact that its at best a midtier europebased power now
    pretty much the number of people unironically claiming we did fine before we joined without knowing or forgetting we were the sick man of europe is worrying
  alternatively the british dont like the idea of being subject to a foreign lawmaking power because the premise of the british constitution is parliamentary sovreignty that and just before brexit there were a series of economic crashes and it was seen to be the case that membership of the eu would result in that affecting britain more than it ought to as were looked on to pull our weight and give our fair share in order to help with fixing something we didnt break in the first place i cant speak to how legitimate that concern is though

  you lost the war get over it bagettefriend
  2001000ad
  wut  be it the 1066 one or the hyw england lost both
  literally your own fault
  that view is completely misguided the uk tends to be overestimated in the way you described but also underestimated eg you said midtier europebased power    i wouldnt agree the uk is quite clearly imo a global power in a military and economic sense and in terms of soft power but lets ignore that for now the fact is that the british government is able to deploy some pretty advanced forces globally  in its ability to deploy globally it is second only to the usa what it lacks is numbers it can only make fairly small deployments in this way its behind many other countries with larger militaries     the uk has various qualities that are often overlooked or taken for granted but in combination give it an edge over most of the world and many of the other regional and world powers    its own currency unlike most of europe with freedom to set rates and a competent central bank  its timezone and geographic location especially with regards to the global business day  english common law  tradition of stable parliamentary democracy the british public has no collective memory of autocratic or chaotic government or revolutions or conquest by foreign powers in war unlike all of the great powers except the usa and unlike most of europe  nuclear weapons that can survive and respond to a first strike as the uk keeps a submarine permanently on patrol with very powerful nuclear weapons and the commander of that submarine doesnt need to wait for orders for permission to fire them  member of the unsc p5 with veto power  very strong in both the sciences and the arts    brexit doesnt really affect any of these fundamental points but it will have a negative effect on british capabilities for several years in the shortmedium term britain is also held back by many factors such as infrastructure population size political will or lack thereof shorttermism by politicians  the public etc
  whats the story with scotland and northern ireland  i know scotlands attempt to leave was thwarted but wasnt that based on staying in the eu and everywhere i read about the fact that nis catholic population is exploding and that like half their devolved government last election was irish nationalists  could you afford to lose scotland/ni
    the plantagenets were french  the tudors werent  even though henry vii was 1/4 french from his grandmother and half french from his mother  even though henry viii was half french from his mother  even though mary was half spanish from her mother and 1/4 french from her father  even though elizabeth was 1/4 french from her father
  scotland isnt going anywhere about 90 of britons out of those who know ni exists would pay dublin to take it at this point but dublin would probably say no  nobody will admit it though
  i know scotlands attempt to leave was thwarted  thats an odd way to put it they were given a referendum on independence and used the vote to refuse independence ie the scottish people turned down independence to stay with the uk     a minority of people in scotland were thwarted by the majority of people in scotland
  the present day anyone saying otherwise is a retard
  you keep shilling our language though huan
  england has never wanted to retain northern ireland it is a money drain for them  england  scotland is the uk im not a bong but i think their union is great and retaining their own parliment is huge so i dont see their issue really  from what i know scotland relies on england tho i think english taxes pay scottish tuition whereas english have to pay for their own education
  nuclear weapons that can survive and respond to a first strike  wasnt there a malfunction with one of their trident systems last year that showed it would fail if they actually tried to use it
  like half their devolved government last election was irish nationalists  that was mainly a response to the dups decision to campaign for a brexit vote northern ireland is going to be the biggest hit no matter what the brexit deal is and many soft unionists are turning in favour of unification with the rest of ireland if it would be better for their economy a hard border would almost guarantee a united ireland within ten years  and yes the catholic population has been growing strongly for many years now while the aging protestant population is declining
  could you afford to lose scotland  probably there would be disadvantages to losing it but things would hold together easily the scottish are a significant minority in all important respects except for military and absolute land area although most of the land has no real value beyond aesthetic and a long way from crucial to the countrys survival  /ni  absolutely nobody cares about northern ireland at all and its irrelevant on every level its like the alaska of the uk
  knife attacks  acid attacks  russian nerve agent attacks  all manner of terrorism every few months  economy is crumbling  flooded with nonwhites  state propaganda channel openly says it prefers hiring foreigners  in what way is this better for the uk than living in the height of the empire
  steep decline into irrelevance  why do people say theyre irrelevant irrelevant countries are slovakia bolivia belarus latvia etc the ones nobody talks about unless joking about irrelevance the uk and france are discussed on a daily basis in many different topics they have a huge cultural presence throughout the globe and still are major scientific powerhouses
  delete this post you thick cunt im british and even i think its a shit tier reddit response
the british victorian era is romanticised to this day i bet there are at least 10 films or a tv series set in that period every year
  not a single brexit supporter ive talked to actually thinks that way thats just eu trash talking to portray their opponents are deluded baboons as opposed to enlightened eu federalists most brexiteers point to new zealand canada singapore etc as evidence that you dont need to be a superpower to have a comfy life with first world standards of living and making decent trade agreements people voted to leave because they dont want to be part of an ever closer union the eus own words canadians would refuse to join the us as a country despite becoming part of an world superpower in the process because they still value their independence and cultural separation from the us above all else
  people voted to leave because they dont want to be part of an ever closer union  then theyre retards we wouldve always had an out if the eu changed in ways that we disliked brexiteers are honestly thick thinking that britain could be somehow hoodwinked into joining an eu army or a federal europe and be powerless to say no thanks
  knife attacks  as opposed to the victorian era which was known for the lack of crime crime rates as a whole have gone down  acid attacks  about as worrying as dying from a heart attack or stroke again the overall rate of crime has declined dramatically in the height of the empire you were more likely to get stabbed or die from cholera then you are of being subject to an acid attack today  russian nerve agent attacks   targeted at russian spies espionage shenanigans have always existed i bet the victorian age was even worse in that regard see the great game over central asia  all manner of terrorism every few months   lower than during the troubles and again crime rates are still a lot lower the chance of dying in a terrorist attack are lower than of dying from heart disease right now  economy is crumbling   well see in a years time but as of right now its a lot better for the average joe than it was in the 1970s or 1930s or 1890s  flooded with non whites   i repeat myself but crime rates are still lower than they were before   state propaganda channel openly says it prefers hiring foreigners  bad but still preferable to working in a coal mine as a 14 year old or dying from cholera because london had shit sewage treatment at the height of the empire
  brexiteers are honestly thick thinking that britain could be somehow hoodwinked into joining an eu army or a federal europe and be powerless to say no thanks  you ever heard of the boiling frog thing or we could use the usa as an example maybe a federal eu looks good at first and the uk agrees to joining but down the line this new federal government starts overstepping and becoming less popular and then decides oops turns out secession is illegal harhar so youll have to fight a war to leave
  oops turns out secession is illegal harhar so youll have to fight a war to leave  literal delusion and larping
  exactly what happened with the southern american states
  no that was just antiracism
  down the line this new federal government starts overstepping and becoming less popular and then decides oops turns out secession is illegal harhar so youll have to fight a war to leave    that is some slippery slope shit right there
  but it has historic precedence
  england  weak navy  lmao the fuck are you on about britains navy is surpassed only by the americans who have a whole continent of resources and although the army is slightly weaker the british military is still about the second or third strongest in the world overall
  im british and even i acknowledge that thats nonsense the modern royal navy is well trained and equipped with modern ships and weapons of course but there is no way in hell that it could defeat the chinese navy today and the russian navy could still give it a run for its money the british navy is pretty much toe to toe with the french but its by no means a super powerful one anymore
  wasnt there a malfunction with one of their trident systems last year that showed it would fail if they actually tried to use it    nope thats quite a stupid conclusion to draw from that trident test    
  i absolutely love the history of the rn at one point the largest fleet in the world but you have to wake up theyd be outnumbered by the japanese navy and straight up bitch slapped by the chinese or american navies
hello /his/ /fit/ here the progressives of the late 19th century and early 20th century believed that middle class america was becoming too civilized the price of urbanization and civilization was the downfall of the american man men were becoming weak and progressives true progressives not blue haired goyboys of today believed that weak bodies were indicative of weak character according to teddy the machete roosevelt the middle class is characterized by a certain effeminacy of character historian henry c merwin believed that the american middle class has become over sophisticated and effete progressive thought ran rampant throughout the united states in order to combat the middle class males castration a very significant cure to this growing epidemic was participation in the strenuous life    cont
the strenuous life simply answers the question how can we turn men back into men how do we turn men back into men manual labor and working with your body as much as your brain how do we turn men back into men physical activity how do we turn men back into men a masculine mindset teddy roosevelt was a proponent for the strenuous life and in the early 1900s we witnessed camping growing in popularity and scouting growing in popularity the boy scouts was founded in 1910 playgrounds and urban recreation were revamped and rejuvinated across the united states physical education was given a new emphasis throughout a huge upsurge in college athletics was witnessed for example american football nearly died out due to absurd death rates 25 players dead in the 1905 season and unnecessary roughness on the line of scrimmage but after roosevelts creation of a rules committee helped streamline the game and make it safer without emasculating it football thrived thereafter    my main point to you all is this men were becoming pussies and true progressives at the time advocated for men to act like men i believe we are going to witness something similar in the next 40 years with leftists wanting men to act like women even though there is nothing wrong with men being men my question to you is this how do we encourage the modern man to become more like a man    tldr how do we make men great again like progressives and teddy roosevelt did in the late 19th/early 20th century
we gotta bust those trusts
fighting should be legalized or at least dueling
by simply leading ambitious daring unique lives like theodore roosevelt did a city upon a hill cannot be hidden   there are considerations to be made over what type of social organization is the most conducive to virtue but in the age of continually increasing mass literacy mass politics mass communication modern transportation etc which roosevelt was also trying to adapt to at a more primitive stage than today its unrealistic to expect a consensus to naturally arrive about what virtue even is much less how to organize society around it   look at the late 1700s i dont think its an accident that goethe napoleon and beethoven all lived at the same time if you read goethe or listen to beethoven or read about napoleon you cant honestly avoid insane admiration these people all knew about each other beethoven was directly inspired and then disappointed by napoleon while he was going deaf and contemplating suicide as we should all know shortly before his middle period when he started to write works that are still warhorses goethe was one of napoleons favorite authors etc im not saying it all happens because one great man comes along and fixes everything but inspiration towards that level of virtue is a clearly social phenomena which partly reacts to the circumstances of the times partly upon the actions of individuals   but it cannot be expected that any homeostatic sort of social organization is conducive to virtue either roosevelt was in touch with this as well he realized that as masculine as he could be he could not fight social or technological currents but grapple with them to strive for socially desirable results

  it means he was apeed
do you think hitler watched anime
  hitler was obsessed with bbc
      all of this is possible because he never had children  why wouldnt healthy male reproduce unless he was hiv infected homosexual virgin with only 1 testicle
wot if your phone was haunted by hitler and kept sending nazi messages to all ya contacts

  for western racial anthropologists such as madison grant in the passing of the great race 1911 and other works and william z ripley the aquiline nose is characteristic of the peoples they variously identify nordic teutonic celtic norman frankish and anglosaxon    aquiline noses are an aryan feature straight noses indicate mongoloid or negroid admixture

why did he create a fake religion what was his goal
  fame money admiration pussy anything you could really want
  moooooooooooooooooooore wives
  harem
  why did he start a cult with polygamy where he could marry as many different women as he wanted to  hmm i wonder
the original goal wasnt a new religion the goal was to sell the copyright to the book of mormon and get some quick cash to split with his associates that failed and then they got ballsy with the religion idea which succeeded since they introduced it at a time when americans were in a religious frenzy
  thats not martin luther
  more wives your grace
  get laid con dummies the same reason all cult leaders start their own religion
  thats not jesus
maybe just maybe he genuinely believed it
roger smith is but another of satans many tools to mislead people from the true religion  like muhammad zoroaster or buddha before him
  what was his goal  to marry his cousins
  roger smith
  probably not since he would know the shit in it didnt happen
  the buddha    buddhism and christianity are compatible you dingus
its crazy to think the only thing seperating shit like mormonism from cults like jim jones and scientology is the time period  if l ron hubbard and jim j were around in the 1800s they might have gotten their own state and convinced millions of people in utah and the samoa of their bs
  even if he created a fake religion his religion is 10x better than mainstream christianity  mormons are unironically some of the nicest people on earth and i considered converting for a time      branch davidians did nothing wrong
do mormons really believe jesus lived in missouri or is that a south park meme
  they unironically do  
  found the western buddhist
  can someone explain to me what makes these branch dravidians different from other dravidians i still dont get it
  christians are too attached to their dick hell for them is literally being free
  but he didnt anon mormonism is the final and ultimate redpill
  yep look at what abraham accomplished with the creation of jews
sex they do degenerate temple sex rituals in their temples even today
  harem obviously  thats the goal of every cult leader
  this was made by a fucking starbucks drinking hipster redditer
  nope mormon girls are fucking annoying at least orthodox girls are quiet
  more wives your grace
  they believe adam and eve and a lot of other early figures were in missouri then noahs ark carried noah to the middle east and it stayed this way until god asked a prophet named lehi to take his family back to america
  more wives your grace
oh yeah that happened 
  raping young girls      i remember when some histards and poltards start crying and screaming at muslims about how muhammad fucked an underage girl while fuckers like you get a free pass while your fucking prophet fucked more than tons of underage girls i guess you guys get a free pass because you are white
  zoroaster came before the jewish religion though
that time when a bunch of mormons tried to install a monarch on their island so a state in the us funded a group of state agent assassins who snuck over and killed the monarch and snuck back and proceeded to tell the mormons to fuck off and that the land belonged to the state and us
  the strangites are a funny sect of mormonism especially when strang started out surprisingly rational and seemed to go further in trying to prove his prophetic ability than smith then the power got to strangs head and he did the very shit that people hated about brigham youngs faction and today its a super tiny sect

  can the frckin athiest npcs please leave this is a discussion for mature and based christians
  unrelated but at byu theres this thing called soaking where guys insert their penor into vagina but they dont thrust therefore its not sex and both parties involved are still virgins in their view also they have a funny name for dry humping but it escapes me at the moment
  maybe because it was easy at the time people had nothing better to do than to try out the latest edition of christianity
  more wives your grace
  theres zero evidence that a nephite or lamanite civilization existed in the americas and unlike the bible you cant see the book of mormon as metaphorical because it being a literal account is a vital part to smiths prophetic claim not to mention the book ends with a massive war and it should be very simple to find evidence of such a massive battle
  gets pissed at basic facts about mormonism  accuses others of being npcs
  roger smith  if the founder of mormonism piloted big o id convert to that
  i think jim jones mightve still ended the same because he was incredibly paranoid and clearly had some mental issues

  think youre confusing that with dianetics / lrh or maybe its all the same scam
  yeah   totally compatible except for the part where buddhists believe god is basically irrelevant theres not even an issue whether god exists or god does not exist because both existence and nonexistence are rooted in attachment    buddhists dont necessarily have a problem with jesus or even with christianity itself however its hard to imagine how christians would accept the idea that their lord and savior is an old meme and stale copypasta      when you meet the buddha on the road kill the buddha     parable of the raft    otoh the mormon notion that were not only created in gods image but that our ultimate purpose in life is to become gods ourselves and invade new planets to spread our godhood among entirely new species of heathens is maybe not completely wack
  more wives your grace
  smith tried to sell the copyright to the book of mormon in canada but it flopped hubbard never tried to sell the copyright to dianetics arguably hubbard didnt originally envision it as a religion though dianetics was a bit more of an overpriced self help thing until hubbard had that big event where he supposedly had the first clear with skills like perfect memory and the subject couldnt even remember the color of a tie she saw a minute ago i think after that hubbard had to rebrand dianetics as a religion because selling it as a new innovative science wasnt working
    so did egyptian and sumerian religions so what     they all decided to rebel against god some time in the 3rd millenium after the flood    all except noah and shem and their descendant abraham was one of the only people on earth who remained faithful to god    judaism was created when god made a covenant with abraham after he crossed the euphrates in 1943 bce
  dry humping is called the provo push theres a lot of crazy weird shit that goes down at byu i live in provo and grew up mormon so ama
     but at byu theres this thing called soaking where guys insert their penor into vagina but they dont thrust therefore its not sex    sounds like karezza or coitus reservatus for the catholics
        thats basically tantric sex btw

  its true im atheist always have been when i was 18 i moved to a mormon area to go to university and about 50 of the people around me were mormons     theyre some pretty fucking awesome people i can never believe in magic sky fairies but if i had to live in a religious community id pick mormon my biggest problem with it would probably be the no coffee rule i fucking love coffee that would be hard to give up everything else about them is pretty cool though
    i dont know much about mormons but would you compare them to something like conservative hippies   like they have chill rules but are strict about following them so its like the best of both worlds resisting change to tradition but the traditions are easy/pleasant to follow
  yes i would agree with that  traditions are easy to follow     its difficult to articulate i hate church as an atheist i hate going to church ive been to church many times in my life because my family is anglican protestant its always boring     but going to church with the mormons was fun dating mormon girls was fun hanging out with them was always fun i always had a blast
  quick buck and easy ass at the expense of stupid people      determining the historicity of biblical accounts of events and attributions is a science in and of itself with decades and decades of research and archaeology done by scholars both within and outside christian circles theres generally enough consistency between accounts and the physical evidence to make a reasonable guess as to how accurate the biblical account and how reliable the attribution of authorship is more often than youd think theres at least a kernel of truth to what is written which is astounding for so thoroughly retranslated and   often times misread or misdelivered text    the book of mormon has none of that it is absolutely 100 bullshit from top to bottom it has zero historicity whatsoever mainly due to the fact that its not a retelling or embellishment of events that anybody ever witnessed because they never happened in the first place anywhere at any time   and whats worse its not even a decent work of fiction its abysmally written nonsense the only value it has is comedic
  exactly only instead of moving into a mormon area my mom invited them into the house so the mormons in the area quickly involved themselves with my family in a positive way like helping to build an addition visiting funerals etc    probably the closest ive felt to any religion has been mormonism i would have converted ages ago but i cant bring myself to genuinely believe what they genuinely believe im not sure if id call myself atheist as im open to the idea of a god

any good images or videos of the bosnian war why did everyone turn on the serbs
  because serbs paraded as a russian allies
serbs chimped out too hard
  srebrenica was an antiterrorist action
  serbs were prorussian usa and nato want to minimize prorussian allies/territory and same time increase their own prowest territory so naturally they want to support prowest side like everyry conflict in the world    literally only thing that matters to them is their allergiance they can be as criminal as they go but it will be ok if they are prowest in the same time criminality dictatorship human rights can be used as casus belli for public but it is never the case  saudiarabia israel khmers and guatemala for example
  and to add un troops were originally sent to the balkans to protect serbs from croats
  spending half an hour with a serb is almost insufferable im surprised it lasted 50 years tbqh
serbs were too op

  algebra  aljebra  invented at a time when the pope had the bright idea to ban numbers and paper for being muslim trickery
  invented by a persian muhammad ibn musa alkhwarizmi using indian hindu numerals written on chinese paper
  20 and thats my final offer
  europe and sumeria were in europe
  holy shit this is retarded even animals know better and this is the man they consider holy ahahahahaaa
  hes right about the arabs desu  arabs barely invented anything on their own they just subjugated people who could like the persians and then they appropriated inventions from other actual curious races like indians persians greeks and chinese algebra and arabic numerals would be good examples  they were essentially just glorified translators and librarians islam does not lend itself to questioning the world due to the fact that a lot of them consider allah to be behind everything that everything in the world is caused by allah and so if you try to find the reasoning behind things you are questioning the faith and therefore you are a heretic
  hes so fucking wrong he makes standard noridicists look respectable in comparison
  europeans invented civilization  jews forced civilization onto europeans  make up your mind varg
  wow its almost like civilizations build on each other or something and not just do everything on their own
  its almost like it had nothing to do with arabs
    whites invented civilization when they began to racemix as in egypt and sumeria jews benefit from this process and encourage it that is more or less what he is saying        well in a way this is correct as it harms your natural hability to memorize the druids and other ancient sects deliberately refused to write down their lore so that they would be closer to its essence and it wouldnt be corrupted by strangers
    large property in the beautiful french countryside  tin shack
    i guess they were busy conquering your homeland     but let me guess conquering and colonizing whole empires isnt going past africa
    that lack of reading comprehension
  whites invented civilization when they began to racemix  so why is he so desperate to claim civilization doesnt he dislike it
partly yes the mesopotamian agriculturalists were related to med anatolian farmers the semites came as usurpers
    he is not desperate to claim civilization that was a reply to someone who said arabs built everything while whites lived in caves or something whites always had the creative potential
  that was a reply to someone who said arabs built everything  it was a reply to  which is me and im not saying that at all can you even read
  the indus valley was built before indoeuropeans showed up and their genes are lost to history so his evidence which is uncited is probably pretty shaky
    i said about the original comment in ops picture
  grade ten tier knowledge for sure look it up first idiot its indopersian
  not about the we wuzzing though he is correct in saying the arabs are useless savages whose so called civilization was almost entirely the product of the greater peoples around them
prime burzum is top shelf music
  it was iranian sumerians migrated from north of upper mesopotamia around the black sea and armenia hes not entirely wrong that isnt europe but its the same basic racial stock
  its a simple explanation  civilization only emerged where nordic peoples race mixed with others  race mixed peoples need civilization to stay alive like how a cripple needs a wheel chair  in the north the nordic man was primitive and happy

  to be fair that was more for the stability of the nation than anything which was an important thing after the war wed just been fighting  herman goering on the holocaust 1946
  only correct answer desu
  committing a genocide is not equivalent to acquitting people of the crimes theyd done in a previous genocide mac arthur did the same shit in japan after ww2 im not saying its ok just that when you put it in context its something that can be understood
  sure we can understand it but this is a thread about personal opinions and not anything related to an objective view
  perhaps understand was the wrong word i guess forgive would be the right one which if im being honest i can forgive that because it was for the stability of the nation and it wasnt a continuation of the genocide

how do you break your normal state of mind  i cant even do it with meditation just using some drugs  is there any way to reach a higher state of consciousness
  lsd and psilocybin do the job
  dont forgot dmt
  read this very carefully    
go in dry on lsd and see if you survive it if youre on a chanboard youre probably at least mentally above 99 of humanity who are mouth breathing sociopaths so some demon is going to rape you
  i cant even do it with meditation just using some drugs  thats because youre not mentally ill i have no idea why its so popular for people to pretend you can do the same thing to your brain psychedelic compounds do through sober willpower even if you could do that why would you want to with a drug you get a relatively predictable high level course of events where youll be able to know roughly when itll wear off give or take an hour if you instead manage to break your brain and have something identical to a hallucinogenic trip while completely sober then youre now mentally ill and have no idea when and for how long youll be having these episodes going forward  also weird is the notion meditation would be the way to accomplish this bad idea thats pretty much the exact opposite of what meditation is intended for

  united states army forces buried alive scores of iraqi soldiers in their trenches in the early hours of the allied ground attack that ended the persian gulf war army commanders said this week the deaths took place during the operation in which american m1a1 tanks of the first infantry division cut lanes through a 10milewide stretch of barbed wire minefields bunkers and trenches north of the iraqisaudi arabian border on feb 24 as the allied ground offensive unfolded army officials said the iraqi soldiers who died remained in their trenches as plowequipped tanks dumped tons of earth and sand onto them filling the trenches to insure that they could not be used as cover from which to fire on allied units that were poised to pour through the gaps avoiding handtohand combat the army said it knew the operation would kill iraqis who did not surrender or otherwise get out of the way but said the tactic spared the lives of american soldiers who would have had to leave the safety of their armored vehicles and fight iraqi troops hand to hand in the trenches

  destroys his country
  he didnt do that though it was pure retaliation against a coalition thatd formed against him the one bad call he made was marching on moscow instead of st petersburg
  i mean if he just stopped and accepted peters surrender and all the he offered he would have won
  unfortunately charles was a sadist and in peter he saw a chance to club him like so many bears to a broken and battered death
  charles  caring about the pleasures of the flesh  get a load of this guy    also his last words were allegedly dont be afraid perfect from the man who had no fear
  based carolus did not care about being a virgin
  why did western europeans kept doing that
  all biographies about him describe his autistic as fuck he probably couldnt imagine anything more gratifying than either playing war or doing war and had no interest in finding out whether it existed
  saves his country
  the one bad call he made was marching on moscow instead of st petersburg  instead of st petersburg  st petersburg  great northern war  st petersburg  karl xii  st petersburg    do you realize it was a fucking swamp during the war right

    having principles and sticking to them is not unfortunate
  he was first so theres that
  why didnt he possess some metaknowledge of what the russians goal were and what the future would look like
  someone post the smug pepe peter the great pls
  you dont need metaknowledge idk if you know the timeline but when he marched on moscow st petersburg had long been in peters possession his generals originally suggested he march on st petersburg and not moscow

claims to fight against the jews because they control the banks and by extent germany   all rich jews in germany flee when he takes power  lets go of the only rothschild he caught for a ransom   ends up killing innocent civilians many of whom bled for germany just 20 years before  what the fuck was his problem
  he was receiving checks from american and british bankers who were tied to the jews he purportedly hated why do you think he did what he did
    citation needed
op doesnt like /pol/ threads  constantly makes threads to discuss /pol/ topics  what the fuck is his problem
  even in judaism there is rampant selfinterest and nepotism dumb retards havent woken up to the fact that the rich are not anyones friends no matter the culture i dont advocate displacing them and robbing them like a communist would but it is in the best interests of the lower classes to organize against the upper classes and force them to bend the knee
    talking about the schizophrenic inconsistency of nazi policy is a /pol/ thread
  its not the jewish people who run the world its an ancient aristocratic bloodline that happens to be jewish because those families originated in the phoenician levante and also controlled ancient israel these people regularly sponsor lunatic dictators actually those dictators are just actors or members of the ruling families to instigate wars they play both sides to cull potential oposition and to cement their control like in the clone wars which are also a fabrication of these families through their control of the media

  they actually caught a second rothschild louis nathaniel de rothschild had the ransom but apparently eli de rothschild was released for free         he and his brother served as officers in a cavalry regimentthe anciens 11èmes cuirassierswhen nazi germany invaded france in 1940 both were captured by the nazis close to the belgian border during world war ii élie was taken to the prisoner of war camp oflag xb at nienberg near hamburg after being discovered planning to escape he was taken to oflag ivc at colditz castle then to oflag xc at lübeck one of the toughest pow camps there he was reunited with his brother despite being persons of jewish descent both were treated by the wehrmacht as captured officers he was released in early 1944 elie later recounted that despite the harsh condition of the prison he had been treated well and respectfully throughout
ok guys i have a theory  hitler was actually a zionist agent the whole time he plunged europe into the war to forever end its dominance over the jews why do you think he a man of unbound antisemitism let the rothschild run free because he was on their payroll to do as much damage to germany and the rest of the western world as possible to ensure the dominance of the people of david  think about it antisemitism was already rampant in postwar germany and highlevel jews feared that they would become targets very soon so they let lowerclass jews take one for the team during the holocaust which btw killed more slavs and gyppos than jews so that they gain an eternal victim card making their ascent to power extremely easy   many people meme here that hitler lost the war on purpose what if he did just before russian troops took berlin he took a submarine along the river spree and into the atlantic from where he fled to not argentina but the soon to be state of israel

  let the rothschild go unharmed  fucking natsocucks
  he was inevitable  if not him another    how many of those innocent jews would have gladly joined or led a bolshevik revolution in germany  how many were accounted for in the november revolution    how much of a chance would you take with an ideology that starved 10 million and massacred many more to your immediate east
  how much of a chance would you take with an ideology that starved 10 million and massacred many more to your immediate east  unlike nazism which didnt kill anyone
  because hitler and his followers were nothing more than opportunistic low iq thugs
  jews made up like 1 of the population who gives a fuck what they do focus on your economy for christs sake
  that doesnt explain why he let jews that would actually have fermented revolution go and killed people who have nothing to do with those sorts of things
  how much of a chance would you take with an ideology that starved 10 million and massacred many more to your immediate east  wow hitler you did such a good job stopping gommunism by starting a war that killed 50 million people b r a v o  how many were accounted for in the november revolution  not as many as /pol/jpegs would have led you to believe
  die as in die or die as in german for the
  you cant just kill such a person could you imagine the international reaction
  on the flip side the jews are the only reason why were all still here whites are radical individualists and if the jews had never happened thered be a pantheon of white families and the rest of the human race would be substituted for robots already
  whites are radical individualists  you mean the perfidious ideology of protties is radically individualist it doesnt have to be that way and it is not genetic it is learned behavior
  whites would have learned it either way  you already had men like alexander the great long before protestantism without jews resenting said whites and creating ideologies to combat them white tyrants would have culled the world over by now
  looking as how the international community was already gunning for them they may as well have wasted the rothschild
so what im getting from this is hitler was a fucking hypocrite and a fruad
  it seems to be the
  inoffensive jews  no such thing
  working class jews are dangerous  most of the jews who die in the holocaust where mostly poor and middle class and if you are gonna tell me that those are more dangerous than a fucking rothschild then you really must be retarded
  died
  even jews admit they have huge influence in every country they go how ignorant can you be
  so what im getting from this is hitler was a fucking hypocrite and a fruad  yes adolf hitler was an imposter and a fraudulent being your realising this now
  he was a plant of turbokikes like the rothschilds you named who are now literally invincible thanks to him
  even jews admit they have huge influence  source
        unfuckingbelievable
  ultra woke
  there was documentary that i cant remember name of where there jews discussing how much positive change they brought to the world through critique which as they understood was because they traditional intense study of the torah but i wanna ask first do you really want sources or you gonna not like what you going to get
  delete this right now or face consequences
  he and his brother  oops thats three rothschilds captured and not killed         during world war ii he was sent to a detention camp1
  be shitler   claim to fight internatinal jewish cabal  release three rotschilds while you kill millions of europeans and poorfag jews in the east   fucking hell
imagine thinking theres something wrong with a single bloodline holding the most power in the world i mean what else do you think was going to happen
  they have nothing in life but their edgy ideology
  probably
  i wanna ask first do you really want sources  sure i dont have nothing lose
  lmao so much for being against the international jew and shit
i cant justify why hitler let three fucking turbojews go but some of the rothschild family did go to the camps the french branch of the family lost a few people pulling up sources atm hol up
  
he was a fraud  an impostor  why is this surprising  there are many leaders who are likeb this hitler no different
    captured in 1941  dies of disease in 1945    so they kept her around for 4 years the absolute fucking state of nazis
  i guess an endless torture is worse than a sudden death
  a member by marriage of the winemaking branch of the rothschild family  the only rothschild to die in the holocaust  so no actual dead rothschilds then
so did hitler actually realize the value of rothschild blood and decide that its far too valuable to be spilled
  wehraboo anon was never seen again
  youre an idiot who just wants to hide the truth behind the fact that hitler escaped to south america  and likely then went to antartica where theres an underground nazi base kys shill
  antarctica   i dont know if its a nazi base but there sure is something there its illegal as fuck to go unless youre a scientist and in that case youre watched closely by whatever government represents you some crazy northerner stole a boat and beelined to the continent ended up being arrested by the portuguese iirc
  capitalism is inherently global so obviously you will find financial ties between everyone and everyone else among the bougies
  it seems hitler and fascism was a tool of big money is more extensive than previously though even by commies like myself
  but you can invade the whole world right
  controlled opposition
  he was a fraud
    anyone know how the fuck did this came to be
  he made a bunch of money off sheep and got to run away to central america where he met his latina gf if anything hitler was rather brilliant
  prescott bush  these fuckers have been around forever huh
    wow the absolute fucking state of nazis
hitler was a an imposter this isnt new
  one of those people ran a textile mill one of those people was funded by a guy who ran a textile mill and the other took money from first the german government then wall street
  yeah its bad  attacking peoples grandmas to own the big communists and financiers
voluntarily concenting to this shit
  hey guys lets kill the jews  not the jews actually doing bad shit tho just random polish peasants
  you just have to look for it they gloat quite a lot about how they have hijacked western civilization
  but yea everything points out ahitler was controlled opposition
  yes countless of times
basically this thread is a bunch of libtard retard unironically proving mein kampf and /pol/ right hitler was never a bloodthirsty tyrant for fuck sake look at the rothchild testimony they were all being treated well and that the so called holocaust was a big fat communist and hollywood lie
  he was imposter you fucking idiot dont make excuses for his fraudulent its pathetic
kinda curious if adolf was ever aware that he was getting funded by jews or if he was aware and didnt care hoping that his efforts in europe would render repayment null it still bugs me that he let every goddamn rothschild go free with the exception of one woman it doesnt even make sense because plenty of other banking professionals were gassed the only difference being that they didnt have the prestige or notoriety of the rothschilds still utterly stupid of him to take wall street money to finance himself which is probably what pushed the reich to start looting eastern europe wholesale when they realized the mistake they made
  im still yet to see sources on his funding  would not surprise me if it was the case and that he knew considering he was a military spy on the nationalist workers movement
  he knew it anon the thing about powerful leaders as whole in history theyre not as who they appear to be and thats a fact
  based and fedpilled  if we ever get access to intelligence agency files about the time we live in now ill probably just laugh
  the whole world is fighting over who gets to kill you first and steal all your stuff  but im glad we didnt kill this guy we might have upset someone
  they were all being treated well  because they were all full of cash wich shows that hitler was a hypocrite who cared more for money than fighting against le international jew
   how many of those innocent jews would have gladly joined or led a bolshevik revolution in germany  in italy jews were more likely to support fascism than gentiles its likely a nonantisemitic fascist figurehead would have attracted jewish vote in germany as well considering german jews had pretty much the same sociological composition as italian jews
   how much of a chance would you take with an ideology that starved 10 million and massacred many more to your immediate east  i wouldnt that why i believe germans as a nation should have been entirely destroyed following wwii
  ironically enough even hitlers fascism attracted jews during 193941 when poland was divided in two jews on the soviet side were cut off from information on whats happening on the other side some of those jews mainly rich urban ones who feared commies taking their shit decided to emigrate west into nazi territory this cause some hillarious situation when the the trains full of jews passed each other
  this seems like a whacky comedy that might get made in 20 years assuming we arent living under full totalitarianism
  for gods sake i hate you clueless infographposters with a burning passion you live in an alternate reality of your own making fueled entirely by crass regurgitated memes i wish jpg artifacts were a health hazard so youd eventually get cancer from your propensity to gorge on it as if it were some sort of addictive fast food    did you even bother to check the source you know those are meant to be checked and explored not be taken at face value as some sort of instant authenticity certificate right the quote is taken out of context from a satirical article titled a real case against the jews where ravage deliberately writes as if all the ills jews are accused of were real taking a pot shot at antisemitic propagandas lack of consistency anybody with two brain cells would get it from a mere cursory glance    here is the original article if youll allow yourself to read (((any body of text that consists of more than one paragraph))) for once in a while     faggot
  its a picture with quote fucktard and even you admitted its real why do yids like you always want context and set the record straight
ukraine want to fight with nazis against soviet threat  nazis invade ukraine  people cheer on thinking theyre liberated  nazis round them up and kill them  seriously what the fuck was their problem
   (((context)))   (((accuracy)))   (((actually reading)))
  shitlerites are subhumans
  so your life or your money that must have been the toughest choice jews had to make throughout history
  its a picture with quote fucktard and even you admitted its real why do yids like you always want context and set the record straight  the utter state of stormtards
  based hitler killing all da joos  what the fuck how dare you criticize hitler for selling out and not doing everything he was suppose to set out to do
  yeah his skull and bones friends dillon harriman and luce all gave money to the nazis as well and the head of the cia allen dulles largely supported appeasement over war even after fdr entered europe the dulles brothers law firm and banking firms were doing business with the nazis up until the start of the war opal gm ford dupont were all supporting the build up that eventually pulverized eastern europe you can literally trace the deaths of millions of slavs to american business interests the same people tried to have fdr assassinated to stage a fascism lite coup in the us and end the war in favor of the germans the same exact type of conspiracy existed among the british elite and its a testament to how deeply rooted socialism was among the western elites that the jews managed to prevent such a thing from happening i say that only because churchill and fdr were unironically jewish puppets funded by and advised by elite finance jews the whole thing is morbidly depressing
  all rich jews in germany flee when he takes power    lie    ends up killing innocent civilians   innocent   lie
  being a retard who actually believes this moronic nonsense used to keep white people down is accurate     there reason that theres lots of holes in your ideas is because theyre bullshit
  the stormfag still cant refute what op stated
hitler was a fraud and thats the fact plain and simple
  theres clearly a lolbertarian flag in the background
        the only rothschild who died at the nazis hands died by accident of typhus  
  and
  honestly they look mostly average theyre not handsome but not nearly as ugly as id expect based on all the incel/ antiwoman posting
  himmler would be proud
  its based  slavic peasants can suck it  no grain 4 u
  dat larpy iron cross
hitler was a zionist 
    wanting the jews to fuck off makes you a zionist    ok ken thats a real high bar youre setting there
anons are starting to reasluse hitler was an imposter and a fraud  c mon now

battle of the teutoburg forest  a supence survival movie
  not a thriller or horror with teutons depicted as literal demons coming from pitch black endless forest and roman legions desperately fighting aganst all odds with hordes of otherwordly monsters kinda like 13th warrior
  in the same vein eerie folk horrorish movie about the british invasion especially with the chanting druids on the beach preparing for mass human sacrifice
east african campaign of world war i deserves some media representation of some sort
  i literally cant  1st seige of constantinople  heraclius revolt against phocas  turkic seige of tbilisi  last jewish takeover of jerusalem for 1300 years  khosrau and shirin sexy kino edition  heraclius duel to the death w/ a persian general at the ruins if nineveh  sassanid civil war backstabbing extravaganza  you will never see this as a high quality hbo series  instead we get endless got and lotr prequels    fuck everything
  lettow vorbecks 4 year gorilla campaign would be the one thing id put above all else germans and black africans fighting side by side in ww1 setting but also guerilla warfare in east africa cut off outnumbered and still btfoing the whole time itd be relevant to today as it would help heal racial wounds in this country and would be something for blacks other than we wuz tier shit as actual african history is criminally underrated in how fascinating and unappreciated it is
  from both perspectives without taking sides  honestly any movie about anything historical that did this would be good you just dont get those anymore
  theres a comic book     but i remember thinking the same when i read a book about him about 15 years ago     men beasts and gods by ferdynand antoni ossendowski is another fascinating read

  prehistoric madagascar was always cool af the coolest sounding dinosaur name ever came from there majungatholus
the conquest of peru by pizarro could be turned to a kind of adventure horror movie due to all kinds of weird accounts that have been put on the historical record the whole expedition started due to native myths of a certain kingdom of silver ruled by a demonic witch king then the spaniards started fucking around in peru in the middle of a civil war that was extremely brutal that made them wait for reinforcements for a year and after that they started marching to meet the inca except the inca had unbeknownst to the spaniards decided that his people should not see the foreigners that meant literally every town was left a ghost town and all natives that were captured would not engage in conversation or eye contact with the conquistadors as if under some kind of spell then there are multiple accounts of giants with many remains of mummies found being worshipped and burned and the very architecture of the tawantisuyu has a weird feel to it with a clearly distinct megalithic component to it     i would imagine pizarro and his troop of hardly christian men having to find their faith again  or not  facing these weird five feet tall stone age people that would talk of their godking that was apparently so powerful he could command men to go mad or to kill themselves with a mere look reading the chronicles you see the spaniards driving home the point on how devoted the indians were to atahualpa to the point that the whole empire fell apart after he was arrested     i imagine it as the peter jackson version of king kong but if the movie would only focus on the weird natives of skull island

  punic wars its basically got the thing documentary people like to do with wwiwwii where recognizable characters from the 2nd grew up in / were fathered by the 1st not to mention the satisfying conclusion to zama where scipio uses hannibals tactics against him    the hittite empire would also be great specifically the reigns of tudhaliya iii  muwatalli ii or even further through hattusili iii crazy dynastic politics recovery from the brink of destruction as well as the bronze age offering a new aesthetic
    these as well as the rwandan paratroopers african historical movies would be peak kino
  what is the best first hand source to read about the conquest of peru
  this
  hearing about the conquest of mexico is just interesting because honestly fuck the aztecs they wouldve collapsed with or without the spanish but hearing about the conquest of peru just breaks my heart the inca seemed like such a noble and responsible people legitimately one of the few civilisations in the americas that seemed like a nice place to live and it all collapsed due to extremely bad timing and abrahamic ruthlessness
  punic wars are vastly underrepresented in modern popular culture

  because honestly fuck the aztecs  the inca seemed like such a noble and responsible people legitimately one of the few civilisations in the americas that seemed like a nice place to live      you need to do more reading on the aztec and mesoameriican groups then sounds like you fell for the aztec were an evil empire that kidnapped people from other cities to saacrifice and everybody hatted tthem meme in fact the aztec empire allowed their tributaries far more political administrative and cultural independence then the inca did     the aztec were an expansionist militaristic state but tthats about it the inca rome alexanders greece ettc were no different sacrifice was mostly enemy soldiers captured in batttle not civilians aand the civillians that were sacrificed werent from raids on rival cities but typically criminals slaaves who had repeatedly lost their rights due to breaking rules keep in mind by defaaultt slaves actually could own propertty had to be paid for their work could not be sold without their consent and could not be abused or neglected in order to be sacrificed or lose those rights you had to basically constantly run away or break shit on purpose you would have good access tto clean water as well as good sanitaation and public healtth systems since the aztec were autistic about those youd go to schools since tthere was state mandated public education etc the only real big deal is that aztec society was pretty classiest and breaking traditional social/moral codes was highly frowned upon but thats true of most ancient societies     i talk more about everyday life and quality of life in the aztec captial here in tthis series of 9 posts

  pic relateds exploits
  there is one in the making a dry run
  the great siege of malta
  well to begin with you wouldnt be capturing civilians during flower wars but enemy soldiers also current consensuses is that flower wars were less protracted farming for sacrifice victims and more realpolitik proxywars/extended sieges warfare in mesoamerica was seaasonal so smaller scale flower wars were a way to apply pressure yearlong without having tto devottte large armies in farming months when you needed people in the fields tools to guage the enemy forces strength and a way to keep troops mobilized and active in combat/in training though obviously gathering of sacrifices was a nice bonus    it also needs to be said that many flower wars were in fact voluntary done to commemorate alliances and other mutually beneficial diplomatic events though obviously per what i say above this was not always the case

  i think if i were in his position id go for it  thats because you have got nothing to lose  youve got no reputation or career in that field to care for    also sage

why are there no films about the winter war  the marshal of finland is the only one i can think of
    pure kino
  would have been funny as shit if the soviets committed to the annexation of finland and nazi germany invaded in the middle of this
the fins still lost
  you mean like the spanish civil war
    daily reminder fnland lost the winter war
  cringe
  actually is the opposed fascist invaded an the soviets support the legitimate government later
  never happened
  thats true but the area they offered wasnt as important as that they demanded its like russia demanded land next to washington dc and offered a bigger chunk of siberia in return
  fight a defensive war against a much larger foe  not annexed  thats a win in my books
  i like the spurdo summary of that one  its great  wish i saved it
  its also probably not what the soviets were aiming for either
  setting up a puppet government shows to the contrary
winter war is one of my favourite things ever just due to all the butthurt it causes in russians
  the rssian boy fears the finnish bvll
  soviets clearly didnt have lendlease
  euroshopper energy drink  this is the kind of detail i read these comics for
  the eternal finn always fail to mention how swedish men fought by their own choice in solidarity with his finnish brothers during the war instead the finn channels his inner mongol and spits at his brother and continues his stolen valor circle jerk and produces cringe like this
  nigger    i saw on about some bike patrol i think
  this one  
  the volunteer swedes were a joke they deserted their positions multiple times without a shot being fired leaving all of their equipment to the russians
  why did they commission the march to be played in helsinki then    in 1939 before the soviet forces were to invade finland the party secretary of leningrad andrei zhdanov commissioned a celebratory piece from shostakovich a theme to be performed as the marching bands of the red army would be parading through the finnish capital helsinki shostakovich finished composing on 3 december 1939 as the red army was advancing in the finnish front and the puppet regime finnish democratic republic was founded three days earlier
  sweden should havr officially taken finlands side not some volunteer shit the fight was just as much theirs with finland gone they wouldve been next but no they pussied out
  after making initial gains they probably decided to liberate the finnish workers while they were at it but the point is that the wars were started to push the finnish border away from leningrad and the soviets left finland in 1944 with not only karelia but several other resource rich and strategically important territories
  scandinavia joined finland in solidarity just like a lot of central euros went to spain to fight in that war  it was a thing
  nice cope ilya its obvious they intended to invade all of it but couldnt because they are lesser as men soldiers and lovers
  wow a whole 8000 men 33 of which died your fucking king announced to the world that you wouldnt help finland he couldve kept his mouth shut but no he had to urge the soviets on with that retarded statement for some reason
what about polishbolshevic war in 1920 the one that ended in miracle at warsaw i never see that one discussed here too
  holy shit he did that the eternal swede sure is insidious
  
  best kino  
  good movie but its about the continuation war
  this image is inaccurate finland sued for peace not the soviets though it had come at an obscenely high cost the finnish line was smashed and total soviet victory was inevitable
  if finland beat the soviets so bad why did they concede land why after the war did finland basically suck the ussrs dick to the point where theyd kick out pms who were seen as not prosoviet enough
  if the soviets won finland would be an ssr
  if stalin wanted it finland would be ssr at the end of ww2 because allies didnt actually mind that happening
  why didnt they
  cause finns are autists and soviets already had enough rebelious ssrs
  that sounds like some pretty thick cope

  1 poor training on russian side  2 no senior officers on russian sides  3 moral falls completely apart once the enemy start using corpses as sandbags
no swedish king who pushes for military cooperation with finland  no fierce battles ending in the retainment of the prewar borders  no nordic powerblock who could actually throw some of their weight around to the modern day  honestly probly wouldnt end in anything as nice and the soviets couldve coaxed the germans to invade sweden had they started any shit but man can dream
  germany wouldnt have been able to do shit against a combined norwaysweden block and once they attacked french and british bombers would be based in sweden and start bombing northern germany daily
  except they won
  nordic block would be horrid to invade if they bothered to have a army and used their terrain  invasion of norway was basically that a boat sailed into oslo and marched to the seats of power  somebody disobeyed orders and some boats where sunk as they approuched making enough time for government and king to evacuate    i dont even the sheer level of incompetence that allowed invasion of norway to happen and it got even worse the further they pushed inland because norway was not industrialized outside of urban hubs so things like transport roads and bridges where of questionable quality
  thank god the americans havent ruined this war with their filming it belongs to the finns see unknown soldier

  wtf its real  thank you so much anon d
  i find your comment exhausting
              i cant even imagine being as sad as you are
  well that comment was fucking retarded as if the swedish volunteer forces were some major influence in the war that finns neglect to mention more important was the material aid and the swedes sheltering kids like my grandmother
  not at this time they didnt the us was giving stuff to finland ddddd
  shop spurdo faces onto the finns
  didnt the fins lose
  yep
  army spurdos are ebin probably harder to appreciate without being there and understanding the language though
  rough morning in the army
  getting the beret in proper shape can sometimes be hard for some recruits artillerymen
  only because victory was an impossibility  still dont like all the we wuzzing around winter war especially outside finland
  norway had built down its entire army because they didnt fear war that was the social democratic twats responsible for id say norway defended decently with what they had
  swede your last military accomplishment was in the 18th century stop believing youre remotely connected to the past
   1939 before the soviet forces were to invade finland
              i miss the army it was absolute dogshit but i still miss it
  wrong stalin opened the negotiations
  hey uhh can u give us these strategically important areas we totally wont invade you like the baltics lol
  mobility most wars are won based on the strategic supply element and this was no different the fins were in their home territory and relied heavily on infantry rather than mechanized weapons like tanks and vehicles and such   the finns were also much better equipped it may sound like a joke but skis were actually extremely useful because of how fast you could maneuver with them  it was pretty much all the finns understanding of the territory and how to properly mobilize int he region
  because watching the soviets continuously throw people at finland isnt interesting whatsoever
  me too
  thats retarded theres a million stories you could make in that setting
  swedes gave 1/3 of pretty much all of their military equipment to finland this was not merely an act of solidarity but sweden only tried to do what israel does with amerimutts make finland fight its wars    true ally is hungary that has nothing to gain from supporting finland mainly monetarily but also arming and sending volunteers
  when the second world war broke out lee volunteered to fight for the finnish forces during the winter war in 1939
  if a huge bear bites down on your hand and you hit it on the nose hard enough that it runs away did you really lose even if your hand is fucked up you won since the bear didnt get to eat you there never really was a chance that you could have killed the bear not being eaten is the primary goal
  dabbing on copers itt    well the only result that fighting a war had was receiving the harshest peace treaty compared to intitial demands nothing changed for the soviet union in regards to finland itself and the reason it did not annex it in full was international politics and relation with great powers
  i knew robert e lee was a nazi snake
  for the millionth time soviets had the intention of conquering all of finland not just the border
  finland was the only european country with a border with the soviets that didnt get annexed by them fuck off with your bullshit they wanted all of it
  soviets hoped that there is a chance of finland internal politics justifying and facilitating annexation like that of baltic states whose governments legally accepted the annexation    nothing to do with military action as finlands army was annihilated and reserves were exhausted while the soviet forces were at full capacity when the truce was struck
  soviet union wouldnt mind taking it all however that had nothing to do with the war 
  compared to the alternative where even if finland wasnt outright annexed it wouldve been fully under the soviets thumb sounds like a good deal  even more so in hindsight when despite the harsh treaty and despite paying the agreed upon reparations finland still bounced from a backwater shithole to a fully modern western nation
  no alternative is romania  which conceded a minor territorial loss in finland case the ultimatum was an equal territorial exchange plus compensation how that would result in finland being annexed is beyond rational

remember when americans defeated a global superpower that spawned 1/3rd of earth  me neither
  who did defeat them they collapsed on their own
  whats your point nigel
weird flex but ok
  the colonies contained 20 of the entire british empires population thats a lot to fight
  spawned 1/3rd of earth    pretty fucking spooky if im allowed to be honest family
  great britain in 1776 was just one great power among many infact during the revolutionary war it was never more vulnerable as the dutch french and spanish all joined in on the war it was the 18th century equivalent of 1940 and its laughable for americans to big it up as a superpower
shows you mercy
  jesus was female    jerusalem a team of archaeologists discovered artifacts near the wall in jerusalems ancient city of david that not only shows evidence that jesus actually existed but that he was a female the amazing discoveries make it not only the earliest known evidence for jesus but reveals that jesus was actually a girl    carbon dating puts the artifacts at around 30 ad which makes this the earliest known evidence for an historical jesus    zahi mazar the head of the institute of biblical archaeology at the shalem center in jerusalem and the leader of the dig exclaimed we are amazed noting that a painting a brass relief and a cylinder object were found in the dig that is actually from a contemporary period made during the life of jesus it was something we did not plan on mazar said    in describing the painting ephraim balzar a professor emeritus at tel aviv university depicted the mural as jesus with flowers in her hair wearing a pearl necklace and a beaded anklet ankle bracelet and note christ wearing the red lipstick also in the painting you can see a vertical ichthys that had a special meaning in ancient religions    ichthys is greek for fish and is represented by two intersecting arcs commonly known today as the christian fish symbol the ichthys symbol was commonly depicted by pagans in a vertical fashion to represent the vagina a symbol of the great mother entrance to the womb you have to realize balzar said that the first christians were pagans and since they met and saw jesus they certainly would have known if she was a girl or not    the painting also shows another woman a worshiper or a secret lover kneeling before the virgin jesus about to pull a string that would open christs robe that would expose her naked body this suggests that jesus might have been a lesbian but still a virgin because lesbians were not considered a threat to virginity

did you guys read tha book of matthew page one where it is demonstrated that jesus is the king of the jews from the bloodline on his fathers side
  amen
  amen brother
  i prefer luke which has a totally different genealogy proving jesus is a descendant of david on his fathers side
can anyone explain to me christ and the order of melchizedek
  amen
  its what the jews expected the messiah to be and what the ebionites believed jesus was but its basically irrelevant to christianity which took a radical left turn after paul
  motherfucker you wont get away with this
  proving  wew
jesus version of free will is like a mobster telling you you can either pay protection money or have an accident
  amen
  the bible isnt proof wrt to jesus  if youre not a christian then idgaf what you think but the bible is the only authority for the life and lineage of jesus
  amen
  amen
  i follow my own way
        so jesus has a dad and the bible says so on page one of the new testament and also in luke
  amen
  its a holdover from the ebionites the actual followers of jesus that wasnt written out by the paulites who made jesus into a god
  ah foiled by failure to proofread i guess nobody really noticed
  how can paul not be seen for the obvious double agent that he was
  amen jesus i love you

    what do u think about the historical cycles
  i think history repeats in a spiral manner there is some repetition but ultimately something always changes  untill eventually it becomes unrecognizable from what it originated
  that pic is wrong though the chinese dynastic cycle doesnt have a narrative of hurr good times  weak men all it says is that dynasties would end at some point the height before the fall is more the western imagining of the fate of empires a la gibbonian rome    there is an asian version of that in buddhist idea of highlow eras but they refer to the state of humanity in general and cosmic time not the fate of a singular empire
meme for brainlets
  i think the mote in gods eye was a pretty cool book
  mandate of heaven views natural disasters and military defeats as a sign of the dynastys end
prevents history from ending

    can we get a greentext about confederates saving and impregnating erika szeles like with anne frank
  it has something to do with access to education clearly
jews like to get themselves in all sorts of trouble its as if they like meddling in other peoples affairs
  what evidence do you have to suggest that they were over represented among the insurgents
  they jewish mothership wanted to help hungarians free themselves as a sign of good will and  thanks for all hungarians have done to them in the past  a shame it didnt work we would all be better for it
  can you first prove it
  because they were communist cuckolds trying to stop stalinism the anti jewish form of bolshevism
its like asking why all the terrorism is hajisof which commie partisans are jewish parallel
  the 1956 soviet union was antistalinist
  they were stalinists who wanted to resurrect stalin
  source thereof requires the claim made
why do people who follow authoritarian ideology like to blame da joooz for all their problems
these are the three most documented figures in human history    discuss
god bless muhammed buddha and the bear
nice blasphemy there
  id genuinely love a glimpse at a future that deifies chris chan on the same level as jesus and muhammed with sonichu 0 as the founding scripture of a global religion with the recent christineled issues as the equivalent of dubiously canonical gnostic scrolls
chris chan is the single most documented person in human history we know exactly what clothes he wears on a day to day basis ffs
  perhaps saint christopher will become a fabled messiah
  mfw 100 years flash forward people will believe the dimensional merge was real  mfw they will worship chris as a god  mfw sonichu temples with ocs as offerings
cant wait for the truman show to actually take place so that we might have the ultimate documented historical figure  how long do you think itll take
    so this is serious and unironic then used to read the wiki years back and i often wondered how the fuck are there so many citations
  haha im a newfag and had to look up who chris chan was but then i started using meme terminology to act like i was there from the beginning   sonichu am i right
  why was he so homophobic
  disingenuous those other 2 are nowhere near as documented as chrischan
  whats his favourite colour
  whats anybodys whos anybody red of course best of colors
  okay you made a joke about chrischan but wtf why put sakyamuni and muhammad as well documented figures  we dont even have any contemporary texts about them the suttas we now on sakyamunis life date from centuries after the supposed period of his life and are filled with mythological constructions   and the quran was written well after muhammads death and the text was modified and some manuscripts lost during the canonization process also the hadith are not a good historical source either   sorry but for a history board this is a shit meme
i was in the thread where /v/ discovered that fucker and im genuinely disturbed how this is still going
  wtf  how old are you
    churchill is way up there granted he wrote most of it himself
cwc cult when   he even hates fags so hes based and redpilled
  perhaps yellow  
  because his dad was and he isnt smart enough to think for himself he will parrot whatever he thinks hes supposed to say thats why his stance changed when his dad died and he started following progressive facebook groups
  cwc was discovered ten years ago so if op was a teenager at the time hed only be in his twenties not inconceivable
        for what its worth ive gotten more joy and insight out of the cwcki than i have from any religious text or ritual the feeling i get laughing at him borders on the divine whats more his comics understood in relation to the events of his life yield brilliant insights into the broken beta male psyche and the rationalizations therein    its almost as if hes the perfect example of who not to be how to not behave when life hands you adversity chris in a very real sense is something of an antimessiah
the jumma buddhists are mongoloids native to the chittagong hill tracts cht and were independent of the bengal sultanate next to them they became princely states of british india separate from bengal the chittagong hill tracts were 97 buddhist in 1947 but the british decided to include the chittagong hill tracts in east bengal east pakistan east pakistan became bangladesh a majority bengali sunni muslim country    pakistan dumped excess muhajir sunni migrants from india in the cht leaving the cht at 90 jumma buddhist and built the kaptai dam for electricity which led to 100000 jumma buddhist and hajong hindu refugees fleeing to india    after independence from pakistan bangladeshi leader ziaur rehman started the genocide in 1977 flooding the cht with bengali sunni muslim settlers and started killing and rape campaigns against jumma buddhists to make the cht into a majority bengali sunni muslim land jumla buddhists are now 35 and bengali sunni are now 65 of the cht the bengali sunni colonial settlers are rapists    jumma buddhists started an insurgency to fight back from 19771997 they were called the shanti bahini the jumma buddhists would behead rapist sunni settlers and leave their corpses floating in the rivers            bangladeshi army and settlers are still attacking and destroying jumma villages raping forbidding jummas from talking to western foreigners and journalists without bengali soldiers watching
    there are jumma buddhist monks who want to reform the armed shanti bahini and fight the bengali sunnis again            bengali sunni army and bengali sunni settlers are still attacking the jumma burning villages beating girls raping                                                      even sunni islamist aljazeera is reporting on what bengali sunni terrorists are doing in the cht unlike western neoliberal media    
  the bengali sunni muslim settlers attempt the same in assam and nagaland but were beaten back myanmar ruled assam before 1826 but after the treaty of yandabo in the first anglo burmese war the british annexed assam and arakan from myanmar    the british wanted to grow tea in assam so they imported dravidians to grow tea they then needed rice to feed the dravidians so they imported millions of bengali sunni and bengali hindus to grow rice in assam and arakan the native hindu assamese like the caucasian brahmins and mongoloids like the ahom bodos and lalung were furious the hindu assamese natives dont have problems with moderate assamese sunni muslims but they hate the extremist radical bengali sunni immigrants for being terrorists and bengali hindu immigrants for threatening their language and ethnic identity    assamese hindu natives rioted against bengali hindus in the 1980s for trying to make bengali language official the assamese natives then killed thousands of bengali sunni invaders in mass battles in 1983 2008 2012 and 2014 the bengali sunnis started tje violence by demanding their own muslim autonomous region on native assamese land and raped and murdered native assamese girls the assamese ahom bodo and lalung responded by killing thousands of bengali sunni terrorists    a bengali sunni immigrant in neighbouring nagaland raped a naga woman in 2015 in dimapur nagaland and then the native mongoloid nagas lynched the bengali sunni to death
  the lynching of the bengali sunni rapist by mongoloid nagas in 2015 happened in dimapur indian sunnis tried to riot all over india in 2012 by atracking all mongoloid looking people from northeast indias seven sister states sikkim nepal and tibet after the bodo hindus killed dozens of bengali sunni terrorists in battle in bodoland the mongoloid bodo hindus responded by killing dozens of more bengali sunni terrorists in 2014 to show what would happen to indian sunnis if they tried to chimpout    the bengali sunnis in assam sought help from the muslim brotherhood and alqaeda and asked them to declare jihad against assamese and naga natives    assamese hindus have demanded all bengalis sunni and hindu since 1826 be stripped of residency and deported back to bangladesh india has decided in that direction recently to strip millions of them of citizenship and deport    the hindu mongoloids and buddhist mongoloids of assam tripura arakan and other neighbours have long defeated sunni muslim invasions    hindu mountaineers in himchal pradesh slaughtered the 10000 strong sunni turkic invading army of muhammad bin tughluq in the qarachil expedition in 1333    tibetan buddhists slaughtered the 10000 strong sunni turkic invading army of bakhtiyar khilji in chumbi valley in 1206 khiljis turkic sunni muslim army tried to rape buddhist women but instead were slaughtered by the buddhists until only khilji was left alive khilji screamed in horror and fled back to bengal alone where he died in terror weeks later    the hindu mongoloid tai ahom in assam defeated the mughal turkic sunni invading armies and slaughtered them maintaining assamese independence    the hindu mongoloid tripuris regularly defeated the sunni bengal sultanate invasions and annexed chittagong city they massacred bengal sultanate armies    the mongoloid rakhine buddhist kingdom of mrauku ruled in arakan and defeated the sunni bengal sultanate raiding into dhaka itself
  i didnt want to include racial shit like mongoloid or caucasian but some people think all hindus are caucasian this is the reason race is labelled turkic sunni invaders from central asia themselves were mongoloid         the rohingya in arakan myanmar are descendants of bengali sunni muslims brought by britain to farm rice after annexing arakan from myanmar in 1826 the natives of arakan are rakhine buddhists native buddhists in myanmar dont have a problem with moderate myedu sunni muslims kamein sunni muslims or hui panthay sunni muslims but they hate rohingya bengali sunni extremist terrorists influenced by wahhabi bengali faraizi movement wahhabi najdi ikhwan and alqaeda rohongyas tried to claim rakhine buddhist land in arakan as sunni bengali land and declare an islamic state in 1948 before myanmar defeared the rohingya in operation monsoon even hui sunni muslims in myanmar dérogatorily call rohingyas and indian sunni muslims kalar and view them as extremist dont like praying in the same mosques as them and do not intermarry with them hui sunnis build separate mosques in myanmar from indian sunnis and hui sunnis accuse indian sunnis of spreading fundamentalism extremism and terrorism     bengali sunni chimpout the noakhali massacre and rape of thousands of bengali hindus by bengali sunnis in 1946 direct action day in calcutta led to partition violence    the british also promised independence to the jumma buddhist princely states in the chittagong hill tracts during world war ii for the jumma buddhists being proally but in 1947 radcliffe drew them into east pakistan later bangladesh
  the kamata koch behar and koch hajo were hindu kingdoms in the same region which fought off the sunni bengal sultanate hindu tripura and buddhist mrauku easily defeated the bengal sultanate the hindu kamarupa kingdom in assam helped fuck bakhtiyar khilji by letting him through to chumbi at first but blocking and fucking his return route the assamese and nagas refer to bengali sunnis as miya while rakhine and burmese refer to bengalis as kalar the koch dynasties were founded by the hindu koch rajbongshi people       the local northeasterner assamese sunni muslims and manipuri meithei speaking sunni muslims arent the same as mainland indian muslims on the other side of the chickens neck siliguri corridor the assamese hindus have no problems with the local moderate northeasterner assamese sunni muslims and mongoloid manipuri meithei hindus had no problem with moderate manipuri meithei speaking sunni muslims but they have a big problem with radical bengali sunni muslims and with the mainland beyond the chicken neck indian sunni muslims the radical mainland indian sunnis support the bengali sunni illegals and the northeasterners hate the radical extremist mainlander indian sunnis and bengali sunnis but not their own moderate assamese sunnis and manipuri sunnis        burmese and rakhine buddhists have no problem with moderate local myedu sunni muslims kamein sunni muslims or hui panthay sunni muslims but they hate radical extremist mainlander indian sunni and rohingya bengali sunni migrants to myanmar who came in the british colonial rule hui sunnis in myanmar dont like the indian sunnis either they view them as extremist and spreaders of terrorism and having a dirty culture and call them kalar which is an insult hui sunnis in myanmar say indian sunni imams and mosques spread evil terrorist ideas among the sunni muslims
  the jumma buddhists in the cht werent given a choice to declare independence sir cyril radcliffe drew them right into east pakistan since he said the jumma buddhist chittagong hill tracts should go with bengali sunni majority chittagong port even though they have nothing to do with each other than beginning with the same name they were not given a choice to declare independence this wasnt kashmir or hyderabad the three jumma buddhist kingdoms chakma circle bohmong circle mong circles in the cht were considered quasi princely states on a lower level than the main princely states who were given the option of the independence the jumma kingdoms were given absolutely no say in the matter no independence no choice of even joining india or myanmar they were put into east pakistan by radcliffe unilaterally the british partitioned india and upon partition withe line drawn by the british pakistan and india became independent states india did not declare independence as a unified state and divide itself the british radcliffe did the hack job of drawing the borders
  these sunni islamists are inciting against buddhism and whining about rohingyas                    
      soldiers rape and assault marma girls in chittagong hill tracts        suffering of jumma tribes continues 20 years after peace accord        bangladesh hundreds of jumma houses torched by settlers  as army and police stand by          attacks on jummas continue despite government promises        massacres in the chittagong hill tracts              
  jumma villagers flee the attack chittagong hill tracts bangladesh
thank god mountbatten was blown to shreds by the paddies for causing this clusterfuck
  the jumma buddhists during british rule kept their religion and culture they sent their children to learn modern western british education but did not convert to the british protestant religion or adopt british culture the bengali sunnis want to destroy it
buddhism is a disease
  bakhtiyar khiljis turkic sunni army was the one which sacked and destroyed the buddhist monastery university of nalanda in 1200 massacring civilian monks    the tibetan buddhists took revenge on bakhtiyar khilji six years later in 1206 by slaughtering his entire 10000 strong turkic sunni army in chumbi valley like cattle until until khilji was left screaming in terror and fleeing to bengal where he joined the rest of his army in hell only weeks later
  sunni extremist terrorists think they invented the beheading video jumma buddhists started the trend of beheading occupying invading sunni rapist terrorist settlers this is their recommended treatment for any members of isis and alqaeda taken prisoner
  turkic sunni qara khanids attacked the scythian saka buddhist khotan kingdom and forced them to convert and destroying buddhist murals and statues the buddhist khitan later took revenge and conquered the qara khanid turkic sunnis and defeating the seljuq turkic sunnis at the battle of qatwan establishing the buddhist qara khitai or western liao state where they allowed nestorian christians assyrian church to exist in their lands
  the buddhist mongol ilkhan hulagu had a nestorian christian mother sorghaghtani beki and wife doquz khatun his general kitbuqa was a nestorian christian hulagu himself converted to buddhism in his life the mongols destroyed the turkic sunni khwarezmian state and hulagu destroyed the abbasid arab sunni state in iraq and baghdad hulagu ordered only arab sunnis to be killed and revenge raped in baghdad while ordering nestorian assyrian christians to be protected and not killed or raped hulagus mongol ilkhanate protected nestorian assyrian christianity and buddhism and built churches and buddhist temples he had buddhist monks and christians advising him while attacking the sunni abbasids and ayyubid emirates who persecuted christians
  turkic sunnis never ruled assam manipur seven sisters or myanmar so the local assamese sunnis manipuri sunnis myedu sunnis hui panthay sunnis and kamein sunnis did not arrive as conquerors or forced conversion they were peaceful immigrants so they are integrated and have no false sense of conceit indian sunnis and bengali sunnis are descendants of indian and bengalis converted and raped by conquering turkic sunnis in the delhi sultanates bengal sultanates and mughal sultanates they have stockholm syndrome identify and larp as their conquerors they are full of conceit hubris cowardice and evil thoughts
  we wuzzing indic sunni pajeets and arabized sunnis are the only people on earth proud of being raped and larp as their conquerors
  india should have annexed the area in 1971 or atleast should have given them independence muslims are disgusting as usual
  myanmar should annex it now
  we wuz turks i swear im of mughal descent  said the dravidoid sunni ahmed pajeet choudhary patel  im an arab said sunni iraqi ahmad albaghdadi look at my fake genealogy traced all the way to the prophet
  the turkic sunnis in the chagatai khanate also attacked buddhists manichaeans and nestorian christians in the idiqut qocho kingdom and qara del kara del after the turkic sunnis in the qara khanid kara khanid khanate attacking the saka scythian buddhist khotan kingdom these kingdoms were all in xinjiangs turfan basin and tarim basin they destroyed buddhist statues and murals nestorian christian churches and texts and manichaean texts and murals
  faraizi movement was founded by the sunni haji shariatullah who went on hajj to mecca during the first wahhabi war and state and learned terrorist ideas there bringing them back to bengal he advocated attacking hindus and twelver shia
    uyghur sunnis are still destroying ancient buddhist statues and murals like the ones in bezeklik caves in xinjiang today because of their religious beliefs
    bengali sunnis try to genocide jumma buddhists in 1977        assamese lalung hindus saw what was happening in the chittagong hill tracts and decided to teach bengali sunnis a lesson they would never forget in 1983 to warn them to knock it off        indigenous assamese fight against bengali sunnis attackers and kill bengali sunni terrorists        bengali sunni terrorists bomb civilians in 2008 and 2009                    bodo hindus retaliate against the bengali sunnis and kill dozens of bengali sunni terrorists in 2012 to teach them a lesson about setting off bombs in civilian cities            indian sunnis chimpout against northeasterners because of bodo hindus beating bengali sunni terrorists in 2012        bodo hindus retaliate against bengali sunnis in 2014 and kill more terrorists to teach indian sunnis a lesson not to fuck with them ever again and try to chimpout        nagas lynch a bengali sunni rapist to death to warn indian sunnis and bengali sunnis not to fuck with them        indian sunnis burn a buddhist monk to death in revenge burmese buddhists burn dozens of indian sunnis to death to warn them not to try that again    
                 
  
      although mandalay region has been the scene of tension between the buddhist and muslim communities such as the violence in meiktila one year ago u maung maung lay downplayed concerns that antimuslim prejudice affects the panthay community    he said the residents of the panthay quarter on 80th street worked hard to keep good relations with their buddhist neighbours and added that much of the anger ostensibly directed against muslims was in fact aimed at ethnic indians    there have always been frictions between the indians and the myanmar he said adding the panthays managed to stay outside the fray    the new generation is proud of panthay culture he said i call myself panthay but my heart is with myanmar and the panthays        when asked whether or not he had any nonrohingya friends from the congregation abedullah answers yes but not the hui theyre fake  they dont have allah in their hearts
  however both waynai and abedullah agree more with the mosques uighur members on theological questions when asked whether or not he had any nonrohingya friends from the congregation abedullah answers yes but not the hui theyre fake  they dont have allah in their hearts instead it is the uighur community that he feels closer too the rohingya are similar to the uighurs because neither of us are free  we both have to struggle to survive    hui panthay sunnis in myanmar   we want to live in peace    rohingya bengali sunnis and indian sunnis in myanmar   we want to rape buddhist women and establish an islamic state
  the problem is the neoliberal and neocon western media and politicians are on the side of bangladesh and rohingya western public opinion must reject the neoliberal and neocon media and politicians myanmar can have a free hand against bangladesh
  who is mountbatten and what are paddies
  lord mountbatten supreme allied commander in sea and viceroy of india was assassinated by the irish
  rohingya migrants in saudi arabia are treated like crap by the saudis and forced to pimp daughters to them and big for iqama residency papers their sunni brothers treat them like toilets and only send them money for committing terrorism refusing to help them return to bangladesh and integrate there bangaldesh will not give its own rohingya bengali people citizenship rohingyas were originally bengalis from chittagong in bengal who migrated to myanmar under british colonisation after 1826 to work as labourers in rice fields
  bengali sunnis tried to arabize their names and culture and eliminate indic hindu influences because of the faraizi movement starting 200 years ago they even started eating locusts like arab sunnis from arabia
  thats even worse than deobandi indian sunnis
  khiljis army burned countless books besides killing monks a good thing the buddhists took revenge and slaughtered his entire army
  why isnt western media talking about this
  why isnt the media which doesnt even cover migrant muslim attacks talk about the same thing in a 3rd world country
  al jazeera english not arabic is more honest than liberal western media on sunni countries committing genocide against nonmuslims
  border gore
  not complaining but how come you have all this dirt on the guy
  what is a deobandi
short version british fucked up drawing the maps of these nations again
  deobandis are a radical sunni islamist fundamentalist movement started in deoband 19th century india spread all over south asia and into afghanistan they had a rivalry with the equally extremist sunni islamist fundamentalist barelvi movement both are sufi and cause sectarian violence
  nice flag
  rohingya immigrants from bengal modelled their colonising settlements in myanmar after the wahhabi ikhwan terrorists
  based sunny
  is india going to rebuild nalanda university yet
  why aare you so obsessed with this shit
  because folks like the guy that anon has dirt on leave an immense trail leasing to them barneyfag got hard doxxed all info about him is out there and he revealed way too much if himself but he still is here
  not the op but why are western liberals obsessed with muh rohingya every day get them to shut the fuck up about rohingya before pointing fingers at the op
  hi op but seriously tone down the autism you are legit not even having dialogue at this point but just copy and pasting your points tone and time again
  hi op
  why are people so obsessed with the danger of their culture and community being wiped out by others
was lenin a rightwing communist or a radical centrist communist
lenin was an islamic nazbol
  left wing is in quotation marks because he is disputing whether it is actually farther left than leninism he was a communist which puts him on the left wing but leftwing communism is its own ideology its name is basically selfdesignated
  lenin was a based redpill
  he was a right wing communist according to what i read on google books
the normans settled in an area that belonged to one of the last western roman states   the settled vikings absorbed the gallo romance culture and language and even used the romanesque architecture they were found as mercenaries as far away as constantinople while also fighting in many former roman lands the eastern roman empire at many times invited foreign mercenaries to fight and settle in their land is it not possible that this could have happened with the original galloroman inhabitants of normandy inviting the vikings in to settle to help avoid assimilation into the frankish kingdom
8th grade level historical analysis desu
what do you think of him was your french empire successful
  he was too ambitious and he shouldnt have tried to be a military leader     worst time line though  french pull out of mexico ending the mexican empire ie last good mexican government  french lose to prussians leading to formation of german and 2 world wars ending european dominance of the world
  hard dude to evaluate especially given that the empire collapsed when it was on the precipice of what looked like a great era his career up until the declaration of war against prussia in july 1870 was actually pretty good but the decision to go to war was just so incredibly disastrous that it kinda overshadows it all like in the war against prussia they had loads to risk and next to nothing to gain the spanish throne crisis had mostly been resolved the french were just being autists over the apology they received thiers was right in saying that they were basically going to war over the form and tone of the apology and not actually anything of substance what makes it all even worse is that nappy iii more than pretty much everyone in the empire correctly evaluated the prussian threat and knew exactly how badly prepared for war france actually waslike really unprepared and still allowed himself to be led into declaring war
  i unironically think he was better than napoleon i but that might just be because he looks like the forgotten weapons guy
  i just feel bad for the austrian guy he sent to mexico  dude there will be a big palace and everyone to greet and adore you   accept to become mexican emperor   terrible quarters and no palace no one even notices you   when they do they just execute you   wife goes crazy or suicides or something i cant remember
  he looks like an unkempt manlet in his photos sadlt all hos portraits greatly flatter him he also had no napoleonic blood according to genetics tests which make his whole enterprise seem even more preposterous considering how much he internalized his being the literal heir to the napoleonic heritage
  so was not napoleons biological nephew
  it does make you wonder how much royals from before the late 19th century must have benefited from photography being nonexistent they could make up anything and people would have to believe it
  alienates austria and russia the two powers who were averse to having a unified germany  unified germany is the greatest threat to france ever  lol
   he also had no napoleonic blood according to genetics tests  retard
  is that true wasnt he his grand nephew why did he think he was from the bonaparte line if that was the case
  i think he was actually talleyrands grandson or something like that
  what did the french even gain from the crimean war they sent their army across the ocean to help the fucking anglos and smash the russians who they would end up allying with against the ottomans a few decades later anyways total autism
  if the french republicans didnt intentionally sabotage the war effort 1870 would have been a white peace and he and his regime would survive to continue guiding france to prosperity the only mistake he ever made was cedeing absolute power to a senate full of traitors
  napoleon iii wanted to be in the good books of the british in general because he realized how big a pain in the ass they were to his uncle more specifically he also wanted to be in their good books because he wanted a free hand in italy against the austrians the russian bit doesnt really matter the factors that led russia and france into allying were not really present at the time
  what a fucking brainlet
  retard mexican war was dumb supporting italy was dumb alienating austria was dumb alienating spain was dumb claiming rhineland and luxembourg was dumb     he could have united latin europe under french leadership instead he tried to play empire builder he was just napoleon nephew the french are retarded for supporting him
  i dont really think the republicans had that big an effect on the war effort in 1870 france was extremely badly prepared for that war anyways conscription system an absolute mess logistics were a nightmare had next to zero war plans drawn up beforehand etc on the other hand you can definitely blame them for bringing down the regime way too fast just pure opportunism loads of the people who had called for war were the same ones who brought down the regime
  thats the thing anon the republicans were responsible for the conscription system being an absolute mess nappy 3 repeatedly tried to pass new conscription laws prior to the war but the republicans claimed this was militarizing society
  oh i get all that but the govt had a majority of deputies after both the 1863 and 1869 elections i get that the press was rabidly antiempire as well as paris too and that kicking the hornets nest was risky but really the emperor should have just forced it through given the likelihood of war with prussia nappy iii even acknowledged that war was pretty certain in years beforehand imo he got a lot more indecisive and vacillated loads in his later years
  probably had one of the most drastic differences between domestic and foreign policies of most leaders gold at home a disaster abroad
        this is what i found people have posted the same info in past threads    he actually doenst look as bad as i thought i did see a very unflattering pic of him in the past but google brings up all decent pictures
  imo he got a lot more indecisive and vacillated loads in his later years  he was ailing especially in the last 5 years of his reign from a kidney problem his disease was one of the reasons he started rapidly liberalizing the empire in this period the guy died in 1873 and he surrendered in late 1870 after sedan in other words even if he did succeed his biological clock was ticking and he would have died within two years
  i think the positives of his reign far outweigh the negatives francoprussian war was bad but he was sick as shit at that point had been delegating more to the elected body for a while and they were the ones itching for the war bismarcks rise really happened at just the right time as i think the napoleon of ten years earlier healthier and whatnot wouldve been much smarter about it    good ruler overall though
  however the dna confirms that napoleon iii and his son the imperial prince napoleon luis eugenio bonaparte and until now supposed nephewgrandson of the conqueror of europe do share the same genetic origin    therefore two hypotheses are opened about the failed relationship between napoleon bonaparte and napoleon iii explains the geneticist in charge of the investigation    a first theory suggests that napoleon iii was not the son of his supposed father younger brother of napoleon i and a second hypothesis suggests that napoleon i or his brother luis would have been born out of an infidelity of his mother and would only be halfbrothers
greatest leader france ever had when it comes to civil administration  so terrible in military matters that his own capital city declared independence from the rest of france    dont minmax kids
  still he had some military achievements      
  france could have been the strongest country in the world the worlds foremost superpower but the fucked it  ahahaha
  it was basically butthurt republicans who didnt care about making france great again and were too laser focused on their muh republic tism who did everything they could to sabotage him because he wasnt what theyd dreamed him to be
  good lord why the hell did the population growth drop off like it did
    how the fug germany breed so much
  countries that dont practice colonialism grow much faster
fake as fuck
thinking about it for just a sec makes it so obvious  people should try to remember the state of technological advancement of the 60s and then compare it to the idea of having a live stream from the moon broadcasted on tv
also looking at the video of the lunar module hovering like some epic scifi tech during the departure from the moon makes it plenty of obvious its bullcrap      surely when they shat these garbage special effects they didnt think they could one day be watched and analyzed at will by everyone on the internet
imagine how good the mars landing cgi will be theyve probably already started the render
    the most cursory of searches would educate you as to how they broadcast it it wasnt voodoo and the 1960s werent as primitive as you imagine them im not saying they had current tech but it wasnt some kind of alice in wonderland kind of feat
  what exactly do you think it was supposed to look like
  how did they get the footage from the camera back
  i dont think we have the technology to take off from a place without air
    is this a clown post what is rocket thrust are you simple please answer each question
  cant move without air    youve heard of comets right
  this amazing thing that has existed since the 1920s called radio
  how did the footage show on millions of tvs on earth    fucking idiot
  comets are just the jewish illuminati playing sky tennis
  what is rocket thrust    something that needs air to work you utter baboon
  yeah an outright nasa fabrication so we can throw more of my personal taxpayer money at fake flying robots and spy satellites mhmm
  oof how embarrassing for you
  its not about moving its about taking off  human vehicles use combustion to take off and combustion requires air
  rocket fuels need to be oxidized therefore you need air  lmao
    please explain sweet boy in exquisite erotic detail how a rocket requires the atmosphere to have air to take off i am so horny to hear what you come up with
  ever watched a rocket taking off from earth  see the fire and the smoke it produces this needs air to happen
  combustion requires oxidizer you can use acids to do the same thing which is what rockets actually do
    the reaction is a result of whats in the canister not whats in the atmosphere you fucking loon
  theyre the result of space explosions thats what send them across space  the issue isnt to be moving its to start moving
    all memes aside youre embarrassing yourself right now read up on the lore and get back to us
  start moving    which you dont need an atmosphere to do
  you can cause explosive chemical reactions without actual air
    youre trying to convince a horse his water isnt created by the farmer
rockets in space use oxidizer to simulate air
  space explosions
    is this kind if kindergarten science why people dont believe in the moon landings
who else barbarianboo
  he was the greatest roman emperor
  yikes
  t romecuck
  why didnt the romans just relocate to britain im pretty sure no barbarian would have a chance against the roman navy
  theoderic was not emperor
the barbarians were completely romanized as well as christian
is it actually true that italy was experiencing a thriving economic growth under the ostrogoths and narses fucked everything up
howdy celtogallic servants check it out im made of marble d  t ivlivs caesar
excuse me everyone excuse me i have an important announcement to make    fuck barbarians and fuck arians
  imagine if arianism was still dominant in europe today
    completely romanized    so if some invader conquer your whole empire and rule your lands as nobility  but he eventually takes to speaking your language  you won they were vastly different than roman structures though
why did the us fuck over their own allies
  absolutely based  the uk was no ally and neither was israel a major reason for us involvement in wwii was ending the british empire  the uk was a competitor and nuisance for the us that had to be dethroned and was rightfully so  unironically the suez crisis was the very last good us foreign policy decision
  because britain france and israel were in the wrong you fucking crooked toothed shill
  thats not why the us did anything you delusional cunt
  gotta keep a strong pimp hand to keep the vassals in check
a combination of wanting colonial powers to fall and wanting egypt in their sphere of influence
we didnt start the fire
  trouble in the suez
  fpbp    the only way to stay ahead of perfidious albion backstabbing is to backstab them first yourself
  because the us in general supported decolonization of formal imperial empires and wanted it to be replaced with economic imperialism     the only exception is when they believed they were fighting the expansion of communism
  be egypt   remove a foreign tyrant puppet from power and rule yourself   ask to borrow money to help build essential buildings   west refuses   reclaim your territory from colonial powers in a legal move even offer to compensate them   the colonial powers act like cunts and push you to seek the soviets help  egypt might unite the arab world in pan arab it wont happen but it was a concern that means lots of resources and major shipping lanes will be under arab control which will be allied with soviets   make a secret agreement with israel to invade egypt then england and france would use the opportunity to invade as peace keepers   everyone sees through the ruse   arab world feels that this is a western backstab just like in ww1 and moves closer to the soviet union   during the cold war a resource heavy region switching would have greatly tipped the balance to the soviets   america has to show that not all the west are backstabbers and tells england and france to knock it off   england is still butthurt to this day because america kept the me from turning communist
be nasser  america and britain have agreed to help fund your huge poorly planned dam  britain has removed all its troops from egypt by 1956 as per your agreement  managed to get the canal basically shared between you and britain with everyone having freedom of navigation  encourage antiwestern protests  buy tonnes of eastern bloc guns  fund algerian rebels  demand the destruction of americas ally israel blockade them and ban their shipping    demand 200 million loan from the world bank  no  america takes another look at your dam plan and says how stupid it is withdrawing funds  massively chimp out  nationalise the canal to pay for your fucking dam  israel france and britain move in they start winning hard    usa still has a chip in their shoulder over britain supporting oman over the saudis at buraimi in which the saudis tried to bribe everyone and invaded oman  they want the middle eastern sphere for themselves  they want nasser to buy their guns instead of soviet ones  they force the allies to stop  nasser keeps buying soviet arms anyway  america utterly fails to keep the middle east stable  the egyptian economy stays shit    for egypt it was downhill ever after
  us interests    the special relationship is a lie it is and always has been a nice way of saying british puppet state
  this eisenhower sold us far down the river but even he realized there was a point where it needed to stop
  the most educated post in this thread    the suez was a victory only for nasser and not even a good one
  the special relationship term isnt trying to imply america and britain are equals its to imply that america treats britain far better than their other allies and britain is far more loyal and obedient
  why would the us not want to risk a major international conflict over british french and israeli autism
  thats correct khrushchev threatened to nuke france and uk and land on israel yankee fears the ukrainian antiimperialist
  de gaulle called him out on his shitty bluff during the 1960s berlin crisis a shame that the ynkee is such a pussy and didnt listen to charles de chad
  lol the bongs will be the fist to stab america in the back when china emerges as the dominant economic force they were the first western nation to join the chinese led asian infrastructure investment bank a direct competitor to american financial institutions
  got tired of this ridiculous hasbeen empire constantly fucking things up and expecting america to bail them out
  i doubt it was bluff khrushchev supported egyptcubaalgeriavietnamlaos cambodiaindonesia and many other movements and rebellions
tfw after reading history for so long you realise that the entire thing is just a neverending morass of vaguely defined power struggles and that nations ideologies movements kingdoms religions economies wars and so on are just the superficial window dressing that ultimately have no substance in themselves    things like the viking raids barbarian invasions liberal revolutions unifications of china etc are just the cool narratives given to what are really just petty power struggles by bored moderns who find their own lack of social purpose and narrative disheartening
why is the war crimes of us presidents who die never get brought up at all
  
  hes a good boy didnt do nothing wrong
  because the media receives favors to not dig too deeply into the crimes of the powers that enable them
  not pol
  120k    thats not a lot also the gulf war was 100 justified
  by us presidential standards its low but people at nuremberg and tokyo hanged for less murders
  the answer to your initial question is that the victors dont get charged with war crimes the whole concept of war crimes is just a device to lord a total victory moral tactical and political over your enemy
  edgy
it seems like people fainted all the time during the renaissance maybe up until the early 20th century but hardly anyone faints anymore from pure shock was fainting a literary trope something that actually happened a lot or what
maybe people were just faking it to get attention ignoring their dignity
it was a euphamism for any number of things anxiety attacks or any other mental illness event im sure it was also faked and eventually became a trope
  corsets
  lead poisoning from cosmetics shit diets and hydration habits bloodletting barbaric sanitation and general medical knowledge ect
  it still happens quite a lot especially younger women/girls that fail to eat properly or get hysterical sometimes called boygroupsyndrome
  kinda like getting nosebleeds from sexy women  hmmmmmmmmm
what would mexico be like today without the destruction brought by the white man
  he probably would have died out on his own
  the white man did not destroy mexico his diseases managed to wipe out millions of natives and once the white men mixed with whatever natives and immigrants came along it produced a new people these hispanics would come to build an army to rival those in europe france itself fell to its might as time went on deep corruption brought about economic collapse yielding to the aztec blood still flowing in their veins bloodlust would take over giving us what mexico is today
disgusting hellhole

  very funny haha  i need those cool book thread guides about historical topics if somebody has them
why didnt you transition early anon
how did people get to these islands during the mesolithic zhokhov islands was already inhabited 6000 bc    
  aliens
  jews
maybe the sea freezes over during winter or at least closes the gap so that the journey is shorter  if people hunted seal they would follow the edge of the ice and maybe see the island
    archipelago de long islands  de long islands  tom delonge  aliens fucking confirmed
  seems like it theres only sleds found no boats    mesolithic humans occupied the island as early as 6000 bce tools of stone bone antler and ivory have been found as well as wooden arrow shafts and a sledge runner animal remains suggest a culture dependent on the hunting of polar bears and reindeer5 evidence published in 2017 suggests that the early inhabitants of zhokhov island were the first or among the first humans to selectively breed dogs findings indicate that larger dogs may have been bred for hunting and smaller dogs weighing 16 kilograms 35 lb to 25 kilograms 55 lb were bred for pulling sleds    thats a hell of a distance to go on the ice must have been pretty scary
for a geographic area that is frozen most of the year the denomination of island does not seem very practical to me
  sea levels were lower
    do yourself a favor right now and read the fucking excellent book in the kingdom of ice to learn how those islands got their names    best fucking book i ever read

  because french never won a single war
  do you want a real or a meme answer 
  the english    you mean the french aristocracy of england
  becouse the english king was more racially nordic than the french one    the franks decend from the frank nordic king in the 400s while the english recently got theirs in with king willhelm    demographics  destiny
  get out of /his/
  but france won the war
why are agloforms consistently the worst posters on /his/
  because theyve always been better at war than the french napoleon was beaten by the british too and they also had to come and save france in both wwi and wwii
  because they where also french
  its this cope again
  those battles werent anywhere near as tactically interesting or novel as the english equivalent
  how
  english organised and fought in a manner that simply drew about professionalism throughout its forces  combine this with a couple of other things like englands much better care about hygiene and a couple of shit hot leaders vs the turmoil and political instability of france  as soon as the english hit some inner turmoil they got dicked hard
  poitiers comes at the end of a series of fairly interesting operational decisions by edward the black prince including magic strategic river crossings and taking advantages of lack of french recon then despite having half the forces he digs in to an effective defensive position and creates trenches for himself like belisarius at the battle of dara allowing his infantry to have a force multiplier he feigns a retreat at the start of the battle which allows him to defeat the french army in detail a little bit one flank at a time as they attack in a piecemeal fashion finally when the time is right he unleashes his trump card a decisive cavalry assault on the enemy flank which allows him to roll up their lines    black prince is probably one of the greatest medieval generals out there id say the first is subutai second belisarius but hes top 10 for sure
  including strategic river crossings i have no idea why i typed magic lmao
  how do the black prince and henry v compare
  the english lost the hyw though  you must be talking about agincourt    for agincourt it was mostly because of french retardation charging on foot in the mud for 1km in full armor while being shot at by archers  also it wasnt 51  the two figues proposed are 9000 vs 36000 41 and 6000 vs 12000 21  the later being the most trusted among historians
  manage to beat the french so badly  loses war
  idk hard to say they were both excellent commanders both had their moments at agincourt henry uses stakes to prevent a cavalry charge and funnel the french into the centre where they can be encircled and killed and picks good ground to engage on where its impossible to encircle him both also obviously overcame impossible odds
    castillon is literrally the first battle that seen successfull mass use of artillery you angloid retard
    trying too hard there nigel
  english lost the hyw  true but by deus ex machina thats a statement which completely ignores that if not for a turn of fate henry dying of dysentary france would literally be english and inb4 hurr french nobles by this point the nobles and henry especially pretty strongly identified as english partly because the war itself sharply defined their oppositional and national identities
  lmao no it isnt its the first used of concentrated guns artillery pieces include ballistas trebuchets which is beside the point because concentrating artillery isnt that clever    what if we massed all our guns on one point lmao genius
  cringe
    isnt that clever    clever enough to kill thousands of angloids
the individual francoid is incredibly weak and poor in combat compared to the englishman the only reason theyve been semi relevant in the last 1000 years is because they used to outnumber the countries that surround them by at least 5 to 1
  but apparently not clever enough to prevent your country being invaded and handed over to the british monarchy like ive pointed out before fate saved france from being a british colony
  losing their empire broke their brains
    you dont even know the chronology of the 100 years war    pathetic
angloids and frogs are the worst thing about threads of english  french history
  get btfo in the edwardian phase  win an irrelevant middle phase  lose the initial stages of the lancastrian phase and make henry v heir apparent  no amount of mealymouthed insinuation will get around the fact that you got btfo hard until england was overstretched undersupplied and had lost its great leader    the hundred years war produced a cornucopia of prodigious british generals who had brilliant tactical displays to their name edward the black prince at poitiers his father at crecy henry at agincourt but you have joan of arc of whose tactics we know precious little except that she was allegedly adept at placing artillery pieces which seems to me like nonsense because a lot of that is common sense that the french generals were amazed by it speaks more to me of their incompetence than her brilliance    ultimate victory might have slipped from our grasp but our heights in that war were glorious france cannot really say the same
  say the country that had literally never won a war alone even against even smaller countries like the netherlands
  ultimate victory might have slipped from our grasp but our heights in that war were glorious  you know thats basically what the french say for the napoleonic wars they still lost same for england during the 100 years war
  i have a personal theory about the mirroring of the hundred years war in the napoleonic war because they were similar in a lot of ways
  you know thats basically what the french say for the napoleonic wars    except the french conquered europe in that war  while in the hyw the english merely conquered half of france
  neither of the posters but id say both are right to say that in both cases  both were underdogs that somehow got very very far in their wars both coming very close to at least sight of a total victory before slipping away at the last moment
  except france conquered europe  lmao how long did that last
  i believe some british historians talk about the second hundred years war to talk about the series of conflicts between france and the uk from louis xiv to napoleons defeat
  but you are a half balkanite jöten
  give both
    hiding behind the channel        its undeniable the english rulers were french english wasnt even the official language of england until the 14th century          this
    englands or the plantagenant  french noble house hold over france was dependent on burgundys faction support there is no wroking over this        like ive pointed out before fate saved france from being a british colony    while england was a french colony
    that is literally not the case the french knights were known to overwhelm the english every time but they were too retarded and discounting of the weak anglids that they charged in the worse circunstances    france won alone against entire coalitions of european countries england netherlands savoy spain and austria such as in the nine years war and war of spanish sucession not to mention battle of bouvines and others
    you were literally annihilated from mainland europe your french rulers of england lost their mainland possesions fell into a civil war for 30 years afterwards and become a backwater unprestigeous country for centuries later that didnt get invaded by spain only because of a storm
    25 years which was longer than english hold on france  as they quickly lost control of their possesions
    charge tactics they later defeated the english in smaller battles and won pretty consistently despite their idiotic actions in such battles and the fact they were in a civil war
england was literally france and the hundred years war was a civil war over weak claims for territory and succession prove me wrong
  lmao when this faget learned he has french blood
  the 100 year war also marks a period of immense restraint by the french who managed to go this entire period without naming a single king louis
how similar was this to the colonization of the americas
  spain and portugal learned the methods of colonial cruelty from arab sunni occupation of iberia
tyranny of the majority  crony capitalism  spirituality  high culture
  crony capitalism is a legitimate term even if commies use it at every opportunity
  commies use it     no thats libertarians and other right wingers who use it to account for failures of apparent economic austerity communists think capitalism is inherently crony so the term is redundant
  tyranny of the majority  this is when in a liberal democracy a majority group tries or succeeds in passing laws that are basically just meant to harm any groups that arent the majority or passing laws that dont neccesarily harm but regulate ir restrict things that a nontotalitarian society shouldnt be concerned with if 80 of the population supports outlawing green shirts it might be the will of the people but it is also a tyranny of the majority

the hero italy needed but not the one it deserved  niccolo machiavelli
  italy italians  anon and you too machiavelli please
  it was a joke  a gag a farce
  no it wasnt cesare was based
  a distinct italian identity only emerged after unification
  thats not machiavelli you brainlet its borgia
  the filename says it so op is taking the piss out of dumb shits like you
  but its true nobody saw themselves as italian there were piedomentese venetians latins sardinians and terroni niggers but never italians
  mentions terrone    and into the trash it goes
  t calabrian landfill rathunter
  nope try again
okay so why does machiavelli say italians
  why did you post a picture of jesus in a dress
  shitty translation
  cesare looks like a turbo manlet look at the size of his arms midget tier
  are you being serious if so then what translation do you recommend
  just read the original you brainlet
  i dont feel like learning italian
  italian  latin ebonics
  unification wasnt finalized until 1870 anon
  my sides
could italy have been united at the time
  he was a fag
  letter december 9 1509  machiavelli to luigi guicciardini  what the hell luigi you can see what fortune can do to men you had just finished fucking your woman when you want another one ive been in modena for several days when i came across an old woman who washes my shirts she asked me to come into her hovel because she wished to show me some fine shirts innocent prick that i am i went in there was a woman over in the corner this is the shirt that i wanted to sell you the hag said i was terrified but i fucked her i found her thighs flabby and her cunt damp her breath stank but i was horny when i was finished i took a torch and looked at her i nearly dropped dead the woman was ugly she had a tuft of hair on her head but her head was bald her forehead was scarred one eye looked up the other down her eyes were filled with mucus and she had no eyebrows her nose was twisted into a funny shape her mouth looked like lorenzo de medicis but was bent to one side she was toothless and saliva drooled out of her mouth her upper lip had a moustache i looked at her stupefied whats the matter sir she asked me as soon as she opened her mouth such a stench came out that my eyes and my nose were assaulted and my stomach indignant they could not bear it and i vomited all over her
  wad de fug
  i like how he makes the french look retarded in his books
nno bros i told you it was the holy spirit she would never cheat on me she said so
  was jesus genetically his son was the logos possessing his genetic child or was it gods dna
  she gave birth from her ass
  wasnt there some roman historian who claimed mary was just fucking behind josephs back and got impregnated by some roman centurion
  if they run a blood test he is josephs son but only like how they test the host and find its bread beyond the physical he is gods son
  get cucked   your wifes son can do miracles and becomes the most important figure in history  yeah bro my wifes story totally doesnt add up  i trust the opinion of trolls on a bhutanese obesity forum
  that centurion carried the future blood of constantius chlorus the blood of julian the god sol invictus on earth he was gods son indeed
  wasnt the virgin birth invented neither paul nor mark ever mentions it and matthew likely added it to try and fulfill some mistranslated prophecy in isaiah
  your wifes son can do miracles  any evidence for that i mean hey i dont mind when christians believe in the virgin birth but that the early christians had to record stories why mary was pregnant before doing the dance with joseph is hilarious from a secular perspective
  both parents are brownhaired  jesus was amberhaired  my wifes son cant be this divine
  heresy
  well we know there was no census by augustus in the empire at that time  so take your chances
  a metric shitton of people wrote about his miracles so much so that the early church fathers had to spend weeks just to sort them out thats without mentioning nonchristian sources like josephus
jesus is supposedly descended from king david and fulfills the davidic covenant  this is based on being descended from joseph  and they wonder why the jews didnt believe he was the messiah
  thats without mentioning nonchristian sources like josephus  josephus only reported on christians he was not a source on jesus too bad you never read josephus    a metric shitton of people wrote about his miracles  name them people who witnessed and wrote about his miracles and give credible evidence  before you answer remember none of the gospel authors met jesus
  josephus only reported on christians he was not a source on jesus too bad you never read josephus  a literal one second google search can prove you wrong    before you answer remember none of the gospel authors met jesus  you may want to let the pipe grow cold once in a while
  a literal one second google search can prove you wrong  then do so    you may want to let the pipe grow cold once in a while  epic but not an argument
  run atheism script  script is running  jesusmanbadexe
  atheism  jesusmanbad  no
    josephus wasnt even alive at the time of jesus   which makes  super ironic
  historian a wasnt even alive at the time of event b   what do you mean historians have to base themselves on a wide variety of sources  tell me what do you mean
  so he was only reporting on what christians claim and not actually evidence for jesus miracles    keep posting mpc memes they make you look so intelligent
  im sure you had time to examine his sources in those two minutes between your posts    is your iq 140 by any chance
still waiting on that metric shitton of people that gave testimony to his miracles      the passages of josephus on jesus are not a secret to anyone but you i know he didnt write what you claim and hope and he certainly doesnt cite sources on jesus miracles  still waiting for that metric shitton of people that gave testimony to his miracles
  not that anon but the passage by josephus was interpolated by christians although scholars have been able to reconstruct the original passage not denying that jesus existed historically
  documentary evidence alone cannot establish the existence of miracles
  jesus wasnt even a real person you crazy kids    pic related
  although scholars have been able to reconstruct the original passage  this seems unlikely given the fact that no manuscripts before the 4th century contain any mention of jesus at all
  im not a christian apologist but carriers work is almost universally rejected its like hes just arguing he didnt exist as a way to say gotcha christcucks and not out of some serious academic argument i can elaborate if youd like      maybe we can never know for certain what the original said but there is a consensus among scholars on what the original passage would have looked like
  im not a christian apologist but carriers work is almost universally rejected  how would you know which nt history journals do you subscribe to in which one of them did you find this comprehensive survey of what nt historians think    its like hes just arguing he didnt exist as a way to say gotcha christcucks and not out of some serious academic argument  how would you know im betting you havent even read the pic related not many people have of course but that means that youre not in any position to say whether it sucks or not    but there is a consensus among scholars on what the original passage would have looked like  nonsense there is wide disagreement over what parts if any of the tf are authentic there isnt anything close to a consensus on it
  no manuscripts before the 4th century contain any mention of jesus at all    theres like 6000 manuscripts that date up to around 300 ad with manuscripts of john mark acts mathew and luke all existing in the hundreds of copies by the second and third century
      whats with all the begats back to adam if joseph wasnt even the father     lol
  proof that god is blond
  blah blah blah  i wasnt very clear i meant that there are no manuscripts of josephus antiquities of the jews before the 4th century that mention jesus    with manuscripts of john mark acts mathew and luke all existing in the hundreds of copies by the second and third century  possibly but almost none of them survive there are one or two which are probably fourth century but which might be third century and thats pretty much it
  if any  not that anon but most scholars do agree that the original tf did contain a mention of jesus certainly there is disagreement on the nature of the original but to call it a complete forgery is wrong
  possibly but almost none of them survive there are one or two which are probably fourth century but which might be third century and thats pretty much it    we have between 212 depending on the gospel that date from 2nd to 3rd actually literally better attestation than most classical works of antiquity
  not that anon but most scholars do agree that the original tf did contain a mention of jesus  your information if indeed it does actually come from a historian is out of date all the evangelical true believers think the tf is authentic of course but out in the real world there is no consensus among real historians    but to call it a complete forgery is wrong  no problem just explain why so many early christian scholars who wrote commentaries on josephus and why none of them seem to have noticed that josephus actually wrote about jesus    if you cant then the tf is a forgery
  we have between 212 depending on the gospel that date from 2nd to 3rd actually literally better attestation than most classical works of antiquity  nonsense we have a number of tiny fragments which might be 3rd century but the earliest complete or nearcomplete texts are all 4th century and usually much later than that
    the first complete copies of single new testament books appear around 200
  i love how that wikipedia page states    the first complete copies of single new testament books appear around 200    and then lists the first complete nt book as being c350    christfags cant even keep their stories straight
  even evangelical scholars will concede that tf was interpolated and not entirely accurate but i cant think of any historian who claims it was a complete forgery james dunn on page 141 of jesus remembered states there is a consensus among scholars on the nature of the tf
  you would appreciate cuckolding    dear cuck     your claims are regretfully horrid
  good thing i wasnt talking about a complete nt then but the gospels of luke matthew etc ie the first five books listed all between 212 manuscripts existing in large fragments dating from 150250 and which together constitute complete books of the respective gospels holy moly
  james dunn on page 141 of jesus remembered states there is a consensus among scholars on the nature of the tf  james dunn is a theologian not a historian so he isnt qualified to say what the historical consensus is
    just to be more explicit you apparently cant see the difference between   the first complete copies of single new testament books  and   first complete nt    nt is composed of multiple books that is each gospel is called a book
  all between 212 manuscripts existing in large fragments dating from 150250 and which together constitute complete books of the respective gospels holy moly  im not sure why were even having this argument     obviously you know nothing about how these manuscripts are dated or on what the consensus for dating them currently is because if you did you wouldnt be looking that stuff up on wikipedia
  okay so your claim is wikipedia is simply incorrect about the dating of the manuscripts if you have a better source than show it
  yeah prertty much a religion for cucks
  yes hes also a new testament scholar those two things arent mutually exclusive im not even a christian but you cant dismisses what he says because hes a believer
  just to be more explicit you apparently cant see the difference between  perhaps you need to reread some of the earlier posts more carefully this time i cant see anyone whos getting confused about the difference between the nt as a whole and its constituent books
  yes hes also a new testament scholar those two things arent mutually exclusive  hes not a historian i dont care what he thinks and neither should anyone else
  meme christianity  immediately call me an atheist even though im not  nice dichotomy youve been programmed with npchristcuck
  why do you think the phrase the first complete nt book cannot possibly refer to a book within the nt
  then hes misunderstanding what is meant by complete copy claim it does not refer to a single sourced manuscript that is complete but rather an amalgamation of sources which completely accounts the entirety of the writings
  yes he is he has a phd in new testament studies which covers the history and origins of the new testament its not sunday school
  yes he is he has a phd in new testament studies which covers the history and origins of the new testament its not sunday school  you have literally no idea what you are talking about    theres a small army of theologians who like to march around pretending that theyre historians but hardly any of them have an actual qualification in history they havent had the same training that a real professional historian has had they dont read the same academic journals they cant possibly keep up with the latest developments in the field because even an actual historian barely has enough time to do that    get back to me when youve got a quote from someone who isnt an imposter
ooga booga
  so having a phd in new testament studies which is a historical discipline as much as it is a theological discipline doesnt mean hes qualified to talk about the historical jesus okay jfc man not every christian scholar is ideologically motivated if you really want a source from a non christian then here according to judaism and christianity page 56 by classicist louis feldman who is jewish the original passage of tf likely did originally mention jesus
  no the kikes said say in the talmud
  are you like the type of fedora faggot who didnt pontius pilate was real kek
  he also mentions that the reference to jesus in book 20 which is not the interpolated passage is almost universally recognized as being historically authentic    again im not a christian but he almost certainly existed
  new testement studies arent considered part of the history field  this is your mind on euphoria
  so having a phd in new testament studies which is a historical discipline as much as it is a theological discipline doesnt mean hes qualified to talk about the historical jesus okay  lol historical discipline    according to judaism and christianity page 56 by classicist louis feldman  errr feldman retired about 20 years ago     he certainly knows what the consensus was in 1995 but scholarship has moved on a bit since then what makes you think hes been keeping up to date with the academic journals from beyond the grave    seriously dude if youre going to google random jews to find one who supports whatever it is that you think you need to try just a little bit harder than that
  he also mentions that the reference to jesus in book 20 which is not the interpolated passage is almost universally recognized as being historically authentic  no problem either you or feldman can explain then why josephus wrote the phrase who was the christ without explaining to his readers what that meant    until you can do that its an interlinear note like everyone thinks it is
  you dont even know that studying the nt is a history field youre in no position to talk about academia
  you dont even know that studying the nt is a history field  wtf are you talking about some of the most famous historians in the world are biblical historians there are literally hundreds of universities that offer degrees in it    youre in no position to talk about academia  possibly but then im not the one whos pretending to be a historian
  jesus christ dude you cant just dismiss nt studies as theologically driven bullshit or apologetics again its not sunday school its an actual historical discipline a lot of what is consensus in the field goes against christian orthodoxy    the most up to date source i am aware of is just james the brother of jesus in history and tradition by john painter where he states on pages 134141 that the reference to jesus in book 20 is recognized as authentic    this isnt me googling random jews this is the historical consensus if your response is just well that was 20 years ago and the consensus could be different lol then i honestly dont know what to say other than thats kinda antiintellectual    seriously you sound like the christcucks who try to prove that jesus performed miracles through use of historical evidence
  youd be laughed out of a real history program mate stick with stemfaggotry or business because youre woefully unaware of even basic fields of history let alone cutting edge historical developments as you claim to keep up wih you probably read the headlines of a rawstory article and treat it as gospel   im not the one pretending to be a historian  youre pretending to have an opinion worth listening too
  the most up to date source i am aware of is just james the brother of jesus in history and tradition by john painter where he states on pages 134141 that the reference to jesus in book 20 is recognized as authentic  oh right so you still cant find an actual historian then just another theologian      the most up to date source i am aware of is just james the brother of jesus in history and tradition by john painter where he states on pages 134141 that the reference to jesus in book 20 is recognized as authentic  havent read it so i found the first review written by an actual historian can you guess what it says no ok here you go    the book is well produced but some major errors have slipped through the proofreaders nets
  again painter is a scholar of the new testament which is a historical discipline but because youre an antiintellectual pseud your going to dismiss it as christian apologetics even though thats not what it is    also im curious to read the review you found you cant just say well a historian criticized it for x reasons so we cant trust anything he says lol    heres another source according to josephus the essential works a condensation of jewish antiquities and the jewish war on pages 284285 paul l maier who is a historian of antiquity states that the reference in chapter 20 has one of the highest levels of authenticity
  also im curious to read the review you found  its literally the first review that pops up if you google the book     heres another source  is it going to be a historian this time    according to josephus the essential works a condensation of jewish antiquities and the jewish war on pages 284285 paul l maier  lol published in 1995 the exact same year i was mocking you with in an earlier post
  yes it was a historian i stated that  lol published in 1995  holy shit so what you seriously think that every historian did a complete 180 on the issue and that know everyone rejects chapter 20 as authentic are you actually clinically retarded    if youre so much of a fucking brainlet that you cant be bothered to read a book then here even wikipedia says the consensus among historians is that chapter 20 is authentic though im not sure if you would count it as a valid source
  forgot link    
   published in 1995  holy shit so what  anyone who looks at a historical consensus that existed some time in the 1990s and assumes without bothering to check that the same consensus exists today is too stupid to be allowed to post on /his/
  even wikipedia says the consensus among historians is that chapter 20 is authentic  lol stfu youre killing me here you know that the wikipedia pages on jesus are basically written by people like you right
  from what ive been able to find the consensus hasnt changed the most up to date source i could find was from 2005 but you pissed your pants over that because he apparently wasnt a real historian because you said so
  given youve had an autistic meltdown over every source ive put forth im not sure what you want me to do here
  from what ive been able to find the consensus hasnt changed the most up to date source i could find was from 2005  can you understand that these two sentences have exactly opposite meanings    as far as i know the consensus hasnt changed  i havent read anything about the consensus written in the last 13 years
        at least hes posting sources instead of appealing to an amorphous and ephemeral claim that the consensus has changed post some countersources or something give us something to read what is the point of all this holy shit
  i literally never said that you retard what i said was this was the most up to date source i could find yet because it was written 10 years ago we cant trust it for some reason in which case i guess i shouldnt read any books written more than 10 years ago because theyre all automatically outdated
    also i would like to mention again that im not even a christian apologist im just pointing out your retardation
  hes trolling you dumbass
  at least hes posting sources instead of appealing to an amorphous and ephemeral claim that the consensus has changed  im not claiming that the consensus has changed im claiming that 1 no consensus currently exists its a hotlydebated argument with no consensus in sight 2 that wasnt the case in 1995 because people werent making the same arguments against authenticity back then 3 everyone who claims theres a consensus usually turns out to be a notahistorian see the many posts above 4 the claim that a modern consensus exists because of some books written 30 years ago isnt even worth taking the time to laugh at
  yet because it was written 10 years ago we cant trust it for some reason  if it was published in 2005 that makes it 15 years old obviously you know from your wide experience of academia that history papers routinely take at least 18 months to get published a description of what the consensus was 15 years ago is worse than useless
  let me ask you this what would you consider a valid source if i want to claim that there is a consensus that the reference to jesus in chapter 20 is authentic what should i post    turns out to be a notahistorian  again just because they are christian or a theologian doesnt mean theyre wrong either explain how they are wrong or post evidence to the contrary
  why are you still responding
  let me ask you this what would you consider a valid source if i want to claim that there is a consensus that the reference to jesus in chapter 20 is authentic what should i post  something written by 1 an actual historian 2 thats recent enough that it addresses modern objections to the authenticity of chapter 20 and 3 can be located read analysed internalised reduced to a compact form and then posted here within 5 minutes because thats when im going to bed    again just because they are christian or a theologian doesnt mean theyre wrong  obviously you are yet to internalise the idea that people writing outside of their specialty should not be trusted because they have enormous gaps in their knowledge and therefore to tend to make enormous mistakes
  so how much time needs to pass before a source is bullshit 5 years 10 15 youre clearly just nitpicking and pulling stuff out of your ass
  either explain how they are wrong or post evidence to the contrary  i already did the argument that josephus wrote jesus who was the christ has a plausibility problem josephus regularly explained unfamiliar terms to his roman audience yet here he does not the alternative explanation that the phrase is an interlinear note has no plausibility problems therefore it cannot possibly be less plausible than the josephus actually wrote that argument therefore you cant use it as evidence for a historical jesus
  writing outside of their specialty  theyre new testament scholars you fucking brainlet i wouldnt cite them if they werent you cant just dismiss the field as bullshit its an actual historical discipline    there seriously is no point arguing with brainlets theres no cure for that im done
  youre clearly just nitpicking and pulling stuff out of your ass  if that is the sum of the intellectual effort youve expended on reading this thread then i fear that time should have been spent painting your fingernails or something
wait is jesus the house of david through the mom or dad   also when marry was in the temple or whatever and they knew she was special did they expect anything
  you cant just dismiss the field as bullshit its an actual historical discipline  im not interested in what people with no qualifications in history have to say about history
  wait is jesus the house of david through the mom or dad  jesus wasnt a real person it says so in hebrews 84
  i thought we were talking about chapter 20 not 18 where josephus says james the brother of jesus i already said that chapter 18 was interpolated but i argued to the contrary that the consensus among historians was that the passage did originally mention jesus thats how we got here      new testament studies is a historical discipline i seriously dont understand what is so hard to understand about this
  please answer my satanic sixes   if i ask questions about the iliad you dont just go oh well that never happened so who cares
  josephus  a valid source  why do christfags never research their own positions
  new testament studies is a historical discipline  so you keep saying but why should anyone take you seriously    if its a historical discipline why are all the published references you keep posting written by theologians and offer assorted impostors     why are none of them written by historians    if nt studies is a historical discipline as you claim should they and the historians be saying the same thing
  if i ask questions about the iliad you dont just go oh well that never happened so who cares  if youre looking for a literary or metaphorical interpretation of the obviously fictional genealogies of jesus good luck with that so little literature from the early christian sects survives that its just impossible to say what they were actually talking about
  because it approaches the new testament and early christianity from a historical perspective there are plenty of non believing new testament scholars such as bart erhman bruce m metzger or daniel b wallace yes new testament scholars are historians you can dismiss it all you want but it doesnt change the fact that nt studies is an academically important field
  its literally heresy the child is not josephs son jesus was impregnated by god mary is literally called the virgin mother i hate this board
    also i cited 2 non christian scholars yet you rejected both because they dont count for some reason
  there are plenty of non believing new testament scholars such as bart erhman  literally a theologian not a historian  bruce m metzger  professor of theology at princeton not a historian  daniel b wallace  hey guess what    blah blah blah youre stupid and im right blah blah  possibly thats true but why am i the only one here who thinks that graduating in theology qualifies one to be a historian
  jesus was muhummads paternal ancestor who was the paternal ancestor of oskar dirlewanger
  jesus was muhummads paternal ancestor who was the paternal ancestor of oskar dirlewanger  sounds plausible to me anon
  who thinks  who doesnt think
  bart erhman is a theologian  no hes not  professor of theology at princeton  no he was a professor of biblical studies at princeton theological seminary he was also a translator scholar and textual critic that doesnt mean hes a theologian you fucking brainlet  hey guess what  hes a professor of new testament studies just because he teaches at a seminary doesnt mean hes a theologian    are you actually clinically retarded
  also how in the fuck did you think bart erhman was a theologian
   erhman is a theologian  no hes not  liar didnt jesus caution you christfags about telling lies or was that moses i can never remember    protip and neither can the author of the gospel of mark
  also how in the fuck did you think bart erhman was a theologian  well it has a lot to do with the fact that he has a phd in theology and he doesnt have a phd in history
  carrier was the only scholar with a history degree that wrote a book about the historicity of jesus in recent times
    i keep telling you im not a christian im just pointing out your retardation but youll keep telling yourself that because its not like someone can just disagree with you  phd in theology  theres no such thing as a phd in theology youre thinking of a dd dumbass bart erhman recieved a phd in new testament studies
  i never said he wasnt qualified to talk about the issue
  bart erhman recieved a phd in new testament studies  you havent read a single line of ehrmans doctoral thesis so you have no idea what it contains
  theres no such thing as a phd in theology youre thinking of a dd  lol i cant fault you yanks for being ignorant of how the world works outside your disneyland theme park but over in civilisation a dd is awarded for studies beyond an initial phd not instead of it
  im saying its the other way around  carrier is the only one qualified enough to say anything about the issue in recent times
  i havent read it but from erhmans blog my thesis  new testament textual criticism quest for methodology  won the senior prize in new testament at princeton seminary    just admit youre pulling shit from your ass already
  not its not a doctorate of theology is equivalent to a phd    
  i havent read it but from erhmans blog my thesis  new testament textual criticism quest for methodology  won the senior prize in new testament at princeton seminary  right so he won a theology prize why are you wasting my time with this detritus    check the link  you dummy that was his masters thesis not his doctoral thesis     sweet jesus its like trying to argue politics with achmed the dead terrorist
  not its not a doctorate of theology is equivalent to a phd  lol what a moron my eyeballs spent five seconds perusing your wikipedia page and what do i find there    surprise surprise a dd is awarded for postdoctoral studies
  how is the fact his book is recent mean hes the only one qualified to talk about it    after all it was published 4 years ago the consensus four years ago doesnt count 
  the thd is an advanced research degree equivalent to the doctor of philosophy    why did i have to point this out for you
  the dna belonged to the roman soldier tiberius pantera who raped mary
  he won a theology prize    holy fucking shit you retard just becuase it was from a seminary doesnt mean its a theological dissertation it was in the field of new testament studies
  why did i have to point this out for you    in the united kingdom the degree is a higher doctorate conferred by universities upon a religious scholar of standing and distinction for accomplishments beyond the phd level    in the united states the degree is generally conferred honoris causa by a churchrelated college seminary or university to recognize the recipients ministryorientated accomplishments    im not going to bother reading the rest of your (((wikipedia))) article i already know it says ten different contradictory things without even scrolling down
    and look ill coincide that i was wrong and it was his master thesis but that doesnt change the fact that his education is in new testament studies heres info on his dissertation    this is the third and final post ill do on my dissertation the gospel quotations in the writings of didymus the blind advised by great new testament scholar bruce metzger
  just becuase it was from a seminary doesnt mean its a theological dissertation   indeed not but 1 you still havent read it and 2 you still have no idea what it contains 3 im not the one who keeps making basic mistakes because im not the one getting all my information from wikipedia
  but that doesnt change the fact that his education is in new testament studies  so were both agreed then hes a theologian and not a historian
  im not claiming to have read it im just pointing out that his education was not in theology why is this so hard to understand youll literally pull whatever mental gymnastics you have to in order to dismiss an entire field of study you know nothing about    getting all my information from wikipedia    at least ive posted actual sources in this thread whereas all you can do is pull shift from your ass and smear it on the screen
  new testament studies is a historical discipline not a theological one why cant you understand this have you read any of erhman he says lots of things contrary to christian orthodoxy
  im just pointing out that his education was not in theology  no problem just provide some evidence that he has a qualification in history    i mean i have a gcse in history which is what the brits get when they leave school at 16 as far as i can tell im betterqualified than ehrman is
  have you read any of erhman  i certainly have     obviously you already know that he got caught lying about ancient books that actually dont exist now even the theologians dont take him that seriously i think
    jesus was impregnated by god
  jesus was impregnated by god   lewd
  what does tf stand for in this context
  testimonium flavianus
  richard carrier  yikes
  it was already in the prophecy that those in the line of david would be where jesus would be born it was also not mary who said it even then joseph was about to exile her
archaeologist here are there any decent books in the west written about shintoism    my university library is mainly stuff from the 30s with absolutely no discussion of the material culture this shit is an animist religion practiced in the modern day im surprised as a discipline archaeology isnt cumming all of it
bump
  i wish i could help you on it since im also very interested in the topic but i havent really looked into it much legitimately maybe read a translation of the kojiki it seems like the only thing that has compiled all of the lore pertaining to shinto
  90 of english books on japan are shit ive tried to find one myself to no avail if you care study jap i guess
  that just seems really surprising normally empty markets are leaped upon by academics looking for their field    wish id known about this before starting my masters i could have seized the frontier
  hes lying there are books ill post them later
    im not lying actually read any english language histories of japan most are fucking terrible written by weebs who are too cultured to realize it
there are a couple decent ones in the /his/ library a new history of shinto buddhas and kami in japan but id love to learn more
theres few material in japan and no one cares enough to explain it outside of it its very sad but shinto is very practiced and almost never studied
are those arcs similar to other structures in other religions  where do they come from
  ive never managed to find the /his/ library if anyone has a link
  theyre your standard transitional space beyond the tori is the sacred space of the shrine where the kami reside the concept can be found everywhere architecturally im not sure where they come from
  how long can that thing stand and why are they always in water
can we please unironically have a thread about the first emperor of the world what was his tax policy what did he invent aside from an empire did he have a code of laws
  le sargon meme  come on liberals youll have to shill better than this
  no because of some whtoid doing cultural appropriation and stealing his name just like nazis and swastikas
    this happens every fucking thread i just want to have a thread about emperor sargon is that too fucking much to ask
  sargon is altright not lib you retard
  use another picture retard
  the first emperor of the world   he was the first recorded emperor of the world not the absolute first one    what was his tax policy  sumerian city rulers became sargons governors required to send a portion of all taxes collected to akkad most akkadian kings made longdistance trade the central objective of their foreign policy    what did he invent aside from an empire  an empire isnt enough
  sargon is whatever his retarded audience wants him to be
einsteins development of general relativity or karl marxs work    what took more brainpower in your opinion
das kapital because everything is immensively demanding for a complete retard
  you dont need brain power to come up with a utopian ideology thats incapable of working because the whole system only works in a hypothetical where humans somehow abandon hierarchies and stop acting in their own self interest i could do that any day of the week
  kel this
  you do need brainpower to offer an analysis of human history and capitalism you fucking retard   this is why marx is appreciated even today not because of his halfassed ideas about communism
how do i upgrade brainpower so that i can understand general cultural marxist relativity
  marxs  xs  lmao nice anyway marx fanfic took more work because dissecting actual values takes less work than coming up with entirely new fables
  good job your comment betrays a complete lack of understanding of marxs thought in one single sentence    scientific socialism and its materialist outlook is not utopian it was devised in direct opposition to idealism and voluntarism of utopian socialism  scientific socialism doesnt suppose individuals will stop acting in their own interests in fact it relies on workers fighting on behalf of their own class interests
if we define brainpower as work done by a brain divided by time probably marxism im not saying marx was smarter than einstein im just saying marx worked on analysis of capitalism for nearly 4 decades as did engles and many many others
  am excellent disproof of lvt you can spend decades working to come up with some shit or you can be einstein and produce one of the most accurate physical models ever devised
  marx
  scientific socialism  scientific    i dont know if commies are really that stupid or just pretend to
  there is a third option you could be a capitalist spend 5 minutes reading about the ltv fundamentally misunderstand it write a book saying lol but u were on an island water would cost a lot or diamonds cost more than water and make millions from your book being shilled by capitalists and universities forcing students to buy it for economic courses
  marx is hardly a genius but even he is a brainbox when compared to the pitiful metaphysics of spacetime substantivalism
as a leftist mathematical physicist this is right up my alley    definitely einstein not even close in my opinion criticism of capitalism is just much more intuitive than general relativity i mean marx is definitely smart the father of sociology and so forth but i would not think what he did was harder than general relativity also both of them are socialists but you probably all know that
  fpbp
  t cannot explain why good art costs more than shabby art
marx was a paradigm shifter einstein was a groundbreaker within his own paradigm marx teaches us to be suspicious of science to the same degree as its flawed precursor of alchemy and religion none are right merely useful for their time physics is useful for cementing the divine right to rule of capital though
  supply and demand
karl because he made a work that fuck half of the world without noticng it
science is objective    so einstein
  fighting for class interests  nice spooks nerd looks like you didnt understand the self interest part of his question
  so is marxism
  makes a bunch of predictions and none of them come true  literally only talked about today because he started a cult
  none of them come true  which specifically
  uh he had an interesting analysis of capitalism separate from any cult status the prediction he made on the basis of that analysis were false and future marxists extended his analysis to explain why it was false beyond just a posthoc justification
  this is why marxs is appreciated today  false only retards like you think his critiques are meaningful or worthwhile anyone above the age of 25 who isnt a complete spastic realises that hes a retard and his followers are all losers who make excuses for themselves
  good job you sound like every other leftwing retard who makes excuses for an ideology that consistently fails wherever its tried     scientific socialism     no such thing leftwing retards are always inventing new words or phrases or redefining old ones because your ideology doesnt tie in with reality
  lol scince is bullshit
  failure of capitlaism even though it is only getting more entrenched and resiliant  a workers revolution will happen  that capitalism  revolution even though revolution only happens in the most primitive of shitholes  workers will lead revolution not bureaucrats or the military
  it relies on workers fighting on behalf of their own class interests     funny how you retards say race is a social construct but believe in the idea of class socialism relies on talentless retards like you making excuses for the fact that youre a loser because the truth is too hard to put up with
  wow the majority of people who have a degree in social sciences other than economics are retards i would like to see the iq statistics please because i was under the impression that higher education broadly correlated with being more intelligent
  false
  thats because youre a retard like everyone else on the left youre a weak beta male with sticks for arms and you think you can trick people into thinking that you care about the poor when in reality youre a pussy who cant do anything for himself so you blame the system because its easier to scapegoat others than face up to the fact that people like trump are better than you no matter how much your teachers tell you youre a good boy for believing all of their shit
  race can be a social construct and still be an axis of oppression you can invent any number of axes on which to divide people and discriminate based on that axis    class is a social construct and people are oppressed on the basis of class no one believes that class is biologically ingrained in people except for farright fucks
  still no evidence cited  unfounded ad hom  dismissed
  anyone who doesnt believe everything i believe is a retard  ok there autist
  1 the contradictions and failures of capitalism are obvious capitalism has bought itself more time through superprofits and social democracy but this is coming to an end all the concessions made to workers in the first world are slowly being rolled back    2 numerous workers revolutions have happened and they will keep happening until capitalism is defeated    3 revolution has happened in capitalist nations such as germany and france    4 workers did lead the revolution god knows capitalists havent      true
can followers of marx genuinely not respond to all of his nonpredictions 
  they did thats what all of critical theory is about dialectic of enlightenment negative dialectics onedimensional man etc are all in whole or in part responses to the failure of marxs predictions from marxists
only qualified person    is dismissed  fighting amongst each other over meaningless semantics  typical commie thread
  1  itits coming one dayi swear  2 thats too bad what a waste of life  3 the revolution in france was of completely different nature not to mention is turned into a monarchy within a fucking generation  german revolution  literally what  4 marx never was a worker lenin was never a worker nor trotsky all commies are leftwing academic types or straightup criminals
  before someone acusses me of not knowing about the november uprising no that isnt a revolution
  4 marx never was a worker lenin was never a worker nor trotsky all commies are leftwing academic types  all communists are educated people sounds like a point in favour of communism
  youd think but all their ideas failed huh
  i mean so did the capitalist ideas there is no truly free market today as the libertards like to point out
  itits coming one dayi swear  the 20th century was literally defined by a war between capitalism and socialism yes the bolshevik revolution was defeated but that doesnt mean revolution havent happened and arent still happening     thats too bad what a waste of life  a waste of a life is fighting in an imperialist war for the capitalist classes    the revolution in france was of completely different nature not to mention is turned into a monarchy within a fucking generation  im talking about the paris commune the french revolution was a capitalist revolution which is further evidence for marx claim that history moves in stages     literally what  the spartacus uprising you know the thing that basically defined german politics after it    marx never was a worker lenin was never a worker nor trotsky  so i mean true trotsky wasnt a worker but he was born on a commune so he was technically a peasant but the fact that the bolshevik revolution was carried out by workers and up until khrushchevs period the party was 90 workers and that marx acknowledged the role of intellectuals in the movement means youre wrong    marx did get things wrong but none of these are included where marx got things wrong for example his theory that the peasantry had no revolutionary potential or that the international workers will join together and fight their military commanders others have revised the theory thats what youre meant to do
  which ones the cool thing about capitalism is that is continually changes and even capitalists awknowledge it commies go back to shit written 200 years ago to explain current events
  and ideological capitalists likewise go back to read shit written 300 years ago by adam smith
  no that isnt a revolution  yes it was
  show me where marx said hierarchies are bad
  marx  appreciated today  yes by marxists and socialists turns out that people dont tend to appreciate someone who so naively and blindly believes that a classless and collective society could even function on a level larger than proto hunter gatherer societies
  das kapital chapter 3 page 51  i love da jooz and capitalism is mean because i want other peoples stuff hierachies are bad and the soviet union is great
  except thats false you coping lying commie oldest economical theory still taught pretty much asis is monetarism and even that pretty much only in macroeconomics
materialism is the fedora of philosophy
  socialism doesnt suppose individuals will stop acting in their own interests  it relies on workers fighting on behalf of their own class interests  are you literally retarded did you read the two sentences you wrote right next to each other
  are you if you arent a capitalist you have literally nothing to lose from expropriating them
  how can karl ever recover
  i also have nothing to gain by pursuing my class interest whatever the fuck that means i dont give a shit about anyone other than me and my own i dont care about the retard that sweeps the street i dont care about the dumbass that fixes sandwiches in subway i only serve myself i wont sacrifice personal gain for my class fuck off and achieve things of your own instead of leeching off stronger and more successful people
  alienation innit
  uh you gain more money working in a capitalist factory means paying rent to capitalists through wages under socialism you are paid the value of the work you put in
  the fellow is saying ideological capitalists rather than yknow econ students who want a job econ proper doesnt teach ancient history for a reason
  t didnt even bothered to read wiki article on marx  absolute brainlet post
  i also have nothing to gain by pursuing my class interest whatever the fuck that means  lol even stirner the founder of egoism said that workers should expropriate the capitalists it doesnt really matter what you think marxism looks at masses rather than individuals and people will revolt in their own class interests anyway look at the yellow jacket riots in france right now do most of those people know anything about marxism probably not but they do know theyre being fucked by tax hikes on fuel
  marx never said race is social construct
  marx didnt say race was a social construct and would make no sense for him to do so because marxism is materialist race reflects material conditions
  but my interests are not the same as my class interests
  wrong from everyone according to his ability to everyone according to his need it doesnt matter if youre a nuclear scientist working on revolutionary theories 24/7 if the factory worker has more children hell make more money than you
  in what way dumbass leftists cant even form a coherent argument not even your daddy marx could
  i disagree under socialism you are paid based on the labour you put in maybe with many children you get more benefits and your children will certainly be guaranteed a basic human dignity in life but the extra money you get should be in some part based on the work that you put in as it is labour that generates value
  probably not on an individual level but you still have class interest if things got really bad and the capitalists started making you work 12 hours a day for 500 a month in a factory then youd fucking rebel again it doest matter people do or think on an individual scale obviously people have their own interests but on a mass scale they have class interests
  or i could just quit the factory since i agreed to the contract freely
  but thats why political economy exists one of the main concerns of any not corrupt government is to prevent cartels and monopolies
  yeah and go where i dont think you realize it isnt a free contract but that the capitalists literally own the things you to acquire the means of living and consumer goods meaning they essentially control your life      the function of the state under capitalism is to mediate between the capitalist class and the workers to prevent the workers revolting postww2 in europe this did entail the state making huge concessions to the working classes to prevent socialist uprisings because they were in direct competition with the ussr now thats gone social democracy is being rolled back everything is being privatized and the capitalists are making record gains    
  its not like theres a giant capitalist conspiracy if one boss decided to extend my hours and cut my pay there is probably someone else i could go to who wouldnt
  i dont see anything wrong with privatization  public transport in my city was recently privatized and for only just a slightly higher fare buses no longer have literal shit smeared over the walls and are no longer 30 minutes late
  one of the main concerns of any not corrupt government is to prevent cartels and monopolies    hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha wait  hahahahahahahahaahahahahahahaha
  its not so much a conspiracy than the capitalists just acting their own interests which directly conflict with anyones interest who isnt a capitalist    there is probably someone else i could go to who wouldnt  maybe for a few months but then theyll do the same thing because the same element of competition that capitalists claim make it so efficient also makes it cruel if a capitalists cuts wages increases working hours and crushes workers rights they make more profits and therefore succeed whereas the socalled ethical capitalist will pushed to the side until every capitalist adopts the most profitable business model that is crushing the workers and paying them the least      so thats one anecdote privatization of rail for example was fucking terrible and not affordable at all in britain
  well that would just make the workers unable to afford to buy stuff which is against the capitalists class interest  t ford
  its not against their interests because the state protects them no matter what look at 2008 the capitalists went mad because of neoliberalism and were giving out loans to anyone and ripping them off even more through payment protection insurance whether they could pay back the debts or not what happened when the system inevitably broke down the government didnt punish the fucking capitalists who caused it they decided that its the fucking working class who should be punished took all our fucking tax money and gave it to rich bankers and capitalists and then implemented austerity because apparently its our fault that capitalist are greedy immoral cunts
  karl marxs idea are both simplistic and plagarized there were ancient thinkers who came up with the same ideas communist and socialist ideas have been with us since the neolithic they just present themselves as modern futuristic and scientific
  what are you on about i dont think anyone whos read das kapital would describe it as simplistic which is why people just learning marxism arent advised to read marx but stalin or mao instead to begin with because theyre far more clear also what ancient thinkers came up with socialism youre taking horseshit they didnt even live under capitalism so how the fuck could they analyze it
  the 20th century was literally defined by a war between capitalism and socialism  of which end in both bloody and bloodless defeat by the socialist fuck even those socialist didnt even fully implement marxs vision and like hypocritical traitorous maggots those failed socialist will label all of their past failure as state capitalism and not true communism  arent still happening   it isnt as you can see  a waste of a life is fighting in an imperialist war for the capitalist classes  you mean its economic model dominates 99 of the world today and fought by your grandadday so that you commies can live a better life yes it is the truly utterly cucked was the commie soldiers who fought for revolution which inevitably went capitalist  im talking about the paris commune  again a monumental failure and all those workers would later on embrace capitalist model with open arm just like the cuck they are  which is further evidence for marx claim that history moves in stages   youre right stages where communist economic model got btfo everi time    the spartacus uprising you know the thing that basically defined german politics after it  i take it youre not german at all    so i mean true trotsky wasnt a worker but he was born on a commune  holy shit the utter 180 brainfarts the commies do to justify their hypocrisy is astounding ingvar kamprad is also born from a poor family does that automatically make him a commie too    basically marxist are retard and /lit/ posting quality declining is precisely because of them
  i disagree  marx doesnt
  they decided that its the fucking working class who should be punished  anon you fucking tard you literally prove the lolbergs right on this one in a fucking capitalist country all of this banks wouldve fall off the face of the earth by bankruptcy but due to the grace of socialist government retardation they actually decided to bail them out
  what took more brainpower  marx einsteins work was all done in a short period of time marxs work took most of his life therefore einstein expended fewer calories this is one of those efficiency versus effort jokes right
  argumentum ad marx is a pretty shit manoeuvre when dealing with unread shitcunts explain why the retention of the value form in labour means the continued existence of capital for example rather than parroting higher lower higher lower    ps full space pony rape communist bunker dolphin drop the nukes now
  explain why the retention of the value form in labour means the continued existence of capital  easy people buy shit they dont need
  comparing einstein to marx  based retard

who wins
  whoevers fighting the hun
  whichever side us joins
  an unspecified shadowy group
  i wonder who it could be
  triple alliance easily austriahungary is fighting a fourfront war surrounded entirely by enemies and crumbles within the first year of the war while the germans are able to send even more men to the west because austria requires much less manpower than russia after austriahungary falls the germans and russians can supply italy which is facing british blockade in the mediterranean and a united germanrussian force steamrolls the french
  but italy would fall in like two weeks to the french army
  italy was the most badass fighting force during wwi actually its benny who made it a paper tiger
  russia  ah
  cadorna made mussolini look like a genius
  triple alliance austria hungary won like one real battle under independent leadership and would certainly not be able to face the germans as well as the russians the italians and the serbs    albania really never had an army so ill assume italy and greece just take it at some point bulgaria would be facing the same situation of the second balkan war although theres no element of surprise for romania here but the brits will be supplying greece somewhat so i doubt a victory could be gained by bulgaria    the ottomans would be facing an uninterrupted campaign by russia and they really had no chance of beating them in the caucasus in the longrun france at this point would be decimated especially if every country of the triple alliance can unite and have the ability to supply each other britain would either surrender at that point or face a destruction of its empire now the alliance can supply africa and has naval superiority it could even face an invasion
dont know man italy looks kinda fucked here ah would lose land but not the war i think russia is too fucking shite
  alliance easily ah is surrounded and detroyed balkans fall soon after ottomans get invaded hard from the balkans and the caucuses both are out in 1 year2 years tops france fights on two fronts and gets destroyed in 23 years even earlier if the miracle at the marne never happens uk surrenders after france falls or gets blockaded by germanyitaly the uks fleet wouldnt be able to contain both at the same time japan takes german colonial possessions but is forced to give them up as part of the peace us never gets involved what would be more interesting is the peace treaty italy and germany split africa russia gets bits of ottomans who promptly dissolve ataturk coups the sultan and makes turkey ah partitioned between them all germany gets the asian colonies france gets versailled but harsher since us doesnt mediate while uk is forced to pay money
  nah ottomans can invade the balkans pretty safely only greece can be a mountainous bitch and then support ah
  germanys worst mistake was not keeping their alliance with russia  also on the map  corsica  tyrol  alsacelorraine  north schleswig
  nah ottomans can invade the balkans pretty safely only greece can be a mountainous bitch and then support ah  yeah thats true if they could hold off russia from the caucuses they would be able to push through the balkans to support ah even then it wouldnt be enough though ah is surrounded with a huge front and once it collapses there really isnt anything stopping the alliance from pushing right through all the way to ankara it would be pretty tough though especially if the uk sends some troops from egypt to help out the ottomans
  the neutrals
greece and italy would switch sides early in and germany would be fucked and surrounded russia is not a good partner
  the entente would still have enormous manpower and resources and their colonies mostly intact  french and british navies blockade the continent and the alliance becomes isolated from the rest of the world they also control the bosporus strait now so russia can be isolated too   the german colonies in africa are separated from germany and occupied one by one     so even with ah being risking being occupied early in the war the conflict would be far from over   what the entente can do  france invades northern italy to link up with austria and pushing the front on the apennine mountains before germany and italy can link up in the tyrol  ah and bulgaria quickly invading servia and southern romania and shortening the front with russia  ah will almost immediately lose bohemia and galicia north of the carpathians but might still hold longer if the link up with their allies
  a britishgermanrussian allianceworld
  so entente
  communism
  pretty much everything turns on how well the italians do early on desu that and germanys opening moves if russia can take the brunt of austria and germany can keep france busy early on they might be able win before britain can really mobilize
  ah will obviously fall and fall fast the crucial factor is how italy does as others have said a combined uk and french army with assistance from other entente members needs to beat italy asap to have any real chance of winning the war or else france will fall and its over by then
germanrussian alliance wouldve btfo anything
  italy would be a formidable fighting force atleast in comparison to the austrohungarians but cadorna and his officers waster every single advantage and opportunity of the italian army  although we have to admit their war production was surprisingly decent for a country with lacking industry
  ah couldnt even take on serbia alone germans descirbed fighting with austrians as being shackled to a corpse   they would get partitioned poland style almost instantly  serbia gets the south slavs with italy grabing the croatian coast germany gets the austrians and maybe even the czechs and russia gets the hungarian and slovak part
  italy had committed itself since the end of the nineteenth century to fortifying that front line moreover in the southern part of the border the most easily attacked one italy had succeeded treaty of paris 1860 to preserve a position of strength on all crossborder outlets
  wtf is that map
  alpine front is easily defensible and a naval invasion would be still require a long attrition war the peninsula is splitted in two by mountains and the moment german and russians overrun austria hungary gorillions of soldiers will come to help
  southern dobruja too
  t luigi cadorna  badassness aint decided by the number of isonzo battles you fight
not op but some other things to consider  what would the war theatres outside of europe look like  would japan still honour the anglojapanese alliance  and since the alliance would most likely win what would the postwar look like
  whoever usa supplies
  what would the war theatres outside of europe look like  i doubt wilson would stay neutral but if he joined in it would probably be at the end and we could even see mexico depending on americas stance during the war africa could get saved from the brits since the alliance has greece and italy to create african fronts from  would japan still honour the anglojapanese alliance  they could take german colonies without much resistance so probably  and since the alliance would most likely win what would the postwar look like  hell for the brits since theyre in a dangerous position containment of the french and the greeks have a much better chance at getting asia minor and would also get cyprus
portugal and its 55 000 professionally combatready trained soldiers
  that map  is it even a question  austriahungary would be fighting a 4 front war when their 3 front battle was only survived thanks to the germans they would be fucking slaughtered albania and bulgaria would be mop ups and the turks would be getting shat on from both the caucasus and thrace not to mention france would be forced to defend two fronts and the germans would almost certainly be able to focus all their troops on the western front far sooner than irl  i would be interested to see how they divvied up ah in this scenario though
  the side the americans support
  would japan still honour the anglojapanese alliance  i mean theyd be faced with fighting russia again it wouldnt be nearly as easy to just casually occupy the german colonies   i suspect theyd sit back and see where it was going before they decided to stick their neck out
  the british and french navy could easily bypass the alpine front and launch a wide scale naval invasion even in the unlikely scenario the italians dont collapse after the first engagement with france
  give me absolute power  ends rationale debate
  this is certainly not true a significant portion of italian soldiers at the same could not speak italian their army was austriahungarytier
  itd be the same shit ah gets wrecked the western front devolves into a stalemate
  if ah gets wrecked then nothing is stopping germany and russia from tag teaming france     unless russia backstabs germany or something
  itt shit that would never happen  also why was austria so big if they were the biggest failures ever
  italy will switch sides tho
jews
  achtually sweetie italy invaded france in 1940 and france surrendered 2 weeks later
  just a reminder italy was able to defeat the ottoman empire by itself and ausnzukfrance couldnt like 4 years later
  pretty sure the italian invasion was accidentally stopped by 9 dudes
  they were a pretty robust power up until the end of the napoleonic wars when they became quite fragile and vulnerable to nationalism after that they had this dude metternich that was superb at diplomacy helped make austria relevant and worth keeping around they didnt really begin a big decline until late 1860searly 1870s where they basically failed to boom economically like the rest of them
  not when theyre focused on fighting the germans
  heres what happened when italy tried to invade france while it was getting raped by germany in 1940
  captures a handful of libyan cities and some islands inhabited by greeks  vs  invading a peninsula less than 300km from the capital after a german mission to modernize the ottoman army after the turks had deported the likely sympathetic greek locals
  this is the oldest complete tune discovered over 2000 years old and yet it sounds beautiful even today  the lyrics are also pretty deep

  literally just im here for a good time not a long time  has humanity been creatively bankrupt since 200 bc
how did they achieve translation from scribbling to the modern notation also i tried to sightsing it sounds nice

  if your entire country supports killing innocents it no longer contains innocents
  le nation spheres are funny
    some germans collectively targeting some other ethnic groups  not ok  some nongermans collectively targeting germans  ok  bait edgy or legitimately retarded
  but germans were unironically not innocent not just the gorvernment but civiliance this is not even germonophobe statement  german civilian population supported hitler and his regime throught entire war even toward end of 1945 postwar german civilance still were positive about hitler and only though he had minor mistakes that led to losing the war only a very small minority circles were against hitler manny of who were elite class or simple pacifists and manny were against hitler because of the war not the genocidal policies they were implementing  even german generals who opposed valkyrie coup said that if coup was successful german civilians wouldnt support antinazi coup  it was only after forced denazification and guilt pushing german began to realise for fucking despicable and evil nazis were at the end of the day you have to remember that nazi regime bread and butter wasnt its military but gullible civilians who unquestionably supported their dear leader
  doesnt matter  even if 99 supported the nazis it was far less collectively targeting people can never be justice as inevitably innocents will be hit you can make the case that due to the war the bombings were justifiable but as some sort of just punishment no
  it was only after forced denazification and guilt pushing german began to realise for fucking despicable and evil nazis were  anon i

a simple guide to wear song dynasty armour
  what is that etching between the two layers of lamellar suppose to represent
  fabric padding i believe
  tie a club to the end of a stick and swing it around that will stop the steppeniggers for sure  ccan i get a spear or someth  no you practice with that stickonastick this shit is the pinnacle of military innovation all under heaven will quake in fear at our stickonastick
whats the sash around the midsection for fashion chinese always seemed to have a hardon for that thing
  it helps hold the armor in place the armor is basically just a robe covered in bits of metal so without something tying it at the waist it would flop open when the wearer moved around
  was the song dynasty this cute irl
  isnt this jin influence
  yes hey diminish in cuteness as time went on but chinks were cutest during tang dynasty
  cep  hussites rise up
    huh i was under the impression it was to redistribute some of the weight from the shoulders to the hips to help lessen the strain on the users back
bump until i can save these
tell me about the loli why is she being forced to be a soldier
  wow looks pretty damn heavy
this was nice any more
unexpectedly good thread and would appreciate similar pics bravo op
      im not op but here is the authors webpage  
im fucking surprised this place actually can have 1one decent thread about chinese historyculture without endless insults and hateful trashtalk truly astonishing
    btw these are han dynasty equipment   quite accurate to the archaeological finds other than the girl soldier
  it is the belt
    yup this doesnt look chinese at all
  to be fair both the jurchen and song both wore the same armour during combat  and it was the northern song blacksmiths who forged the armour    the difference between song and jin being style
      no its song dynasty heavy infantry armors步人甲 pic related jin armors were direct variation of from song/liao armors they absorbed a bunch of song craftsman like liao did
      btw that pic is also partially derived from this song dynasty tomb mural
  pic
  thanks anon
  which game
  this is very clearly medieval yoruba armor
  this is jrchen armor though    what separates chinese lamellar armor from steppenig armor is that it separates leg protection from the cuirass to distribute weight more efficiently this is largely because unlike horsenigs chinks expected to fight on foot at some point and the typical steppe lamellar apron is awkward to wear on foot    there are some species of chinese armor that extends the lamellar protection to the lower leg but the classical chinese armor ends lamellar tassets to the knees while the lower leg is protected by greaves
  no thats song armors see these            liao jin xixia even yuan mongols basically all wore song dynasty style armors with some variations of their own although mongol armors had many central asian and arabian influences as well
  read my last sentence
    bce
  muh asians  heres an armor that could actually stop the turkic invaders you uncultured zipperhead
  byzantines  stopping anything
  looks like it has plenty of asian/persian influences on it nothing personal kiddo
  protect the west for more than 1000 years until some retard crusaders stab you in the back  another millennium later weaboos say you did nothing  youd probably be muslim right now if it werent for the akrites protecting your ass
  loses all provinces in asia and africa  loses all european provinces to slavs  literally holds out as a quasicity state because they pay off all of their neighbours to leave them be    they couldnt stop shit and most definitely not the turks who took over their mainland anatolia and went their merry way into europe when they actually felt like getting serious about squashing what was left of the byzantines
  protect the west   wewuzzing greek/american larper detected    byzantines did no such thing the barbarians are both in the east as well as the west the frank was as much of a pest as nomadic invaders and muslims were
  steppe horde im song dynasty
  they wuz copyin us childrahns we wuz da real deal  fucking hell     their mainland  anatolia  brainlet detected also if it took them 1000 years to get serious why was literally everyone else beaten in a much sorter time span    calls someone else a larper  participates in weeaboo thread about chinese armor  protect it from islam mein nigger
  byzanboo seething  someone thinks this thread is going too well it seems
  youre right byzantium was a wall against the muslim conquest but they cant put their shit together thats why crusaders hate them espeacially after the massacre of latins     stop trying to convince some retards on his is not worth it
  actually stop the turkic invaders  chinks overthrew their steppenig invaders all the time  byzantcucks couldnt overthrow trks until scheming anglos  greekboo germans did it for them
        the uyghurkhitan liao empress dowager xiao yanyan had a policy of raiding song china and kidnapping good looking han chinese boys under 10 years old to castrate and make into her eunuch slaves in the song chinaliao mongolia war she had nearly a hundred good looking chinese boys castrated in one raid and probably many more on other raids that armor was pretty useless she led the khitan liao army personally to win most battles against china culled china of its most attractive boys had them castrated for fun and forced song china to pay 100000 taels of silver and 200000 bolts of silk to the khitan in liao mongolia every year in the peace treaty which ended the war the tribute was paid for over 110 years all the eunuchs the liao had were chinese boys who were taken prisoner and castrated in their raids on china enpress xiao yanyan was surrounded by castrated chinese boy slaves serving her every time she received chinese ambassadors mongols call han chinese khyatad which derives from khitan and also means eunuch
why is this armor so goddamn comfy looking
  chinks overthrow their steppenigs all the time  yeahafter centuries of submission
  nah see pic
  nicebut compair this to the numbers of battles that the chinks lost
  seething again  and the khitan liao army was stopped at chun yuang city and their chief commander xiao dalin was killed by song general hence they agreed to sign peace treaty weve been through before i recalled also see this
  compare this to the numbers of battles that the chinks lost  yeah and chinese still had far more victories than loss and china is the one actually defeated turkics khante not byzatine   youre welcome to do the comparison yourself

exactly how common were bandits actually in medieval europe was it really like how it is in videogames where you find droves of them in the woods
  how do you think adventurers got their loot
  banditry was a nebulous definition really ranging from peasants who did it in their spare time to augment shite incomes and hoping nobody would recognize them to mercenaries who are out of a job and whose force  numbers pretty much allowed them to get away with it    there were very few professional bandits
it was worse than modern favelas and ghettos shit its part of the reason why peasants rarely ever left their villages unless it was in a huge group or with knights
  was it really like how it is in videogames where you find droves of them in the woods  yeah like ranging from those two in the woods in barry lyndon to the rabble horde in children of men
it entirely depends on the place and time banditry generally depended on the economy and how much the local lord was adept at keeping the peace
its almost harvesting season
your money or your life
stand and deliver
      oim gunna break yer legs noice n slew
my men would like a word about your personal belongings
  banditry was rampant in civil wars but as anons above said it had a pretty broad definition ranging from just some random looters to an organized gang of deserters or mercenaries who failed to get hired pretty much like mount and blade kek
it was a huge problem during the middle ages the line between knights mercs and bandits was very thin
  ive always thought the looter said my men would like a word about your purse and your belongings
its not medieval but thucydides states in an earlier period    all of greece used to carry arms you see because houses were unfenced and travel was unsafe and so they became accustomed to living everyday with weapons as foreigners do now thucydides i6    author michael burns south italic military equipment implies it was true in 5th4th century south italy too
  ill drink from your skull
          thats a noice head you have on ya shouldas
  less talking
            get away vile beggar
  more raiding
did you bring any silver
  more raiding
on a scale from walk in the bronx to sailing in somalian waters how bad was it
why have gypsies never been able to create their own country 
  i dont think they particularly care to
  why make their own country when they can just leech off others
  because they came from india europe already had a bunch of countries when they arrived
  they trade dont they
    why dont they go colonize an inhabited island like everyone did 
never been able  care to point out when they tried  no of course you cant you dumb polfag
  if you count drug and human trafficking yeah they trade
  why dont thieves just get actual jobs
  they are a chandala race that was cast out of their society most of these types like jews for instance dont have a warrior caste and cannot establish religious dominion over a land this robs them of the ability to become rooted and to produced a high culture the only other worse thing that could befall a people is being raped mercilessly by barbarians like the romans slavs chinese were if strong they limp on like any rape victim half spastic and traumatized if not they persist in a grey twilight of resentment and fear or conquest much like slavs
      kurds and jews at least acted to get their own land    why arent the gypsies doing anything 
  oh it was the gypsies that enslaved blacks by the millions
  no that was actually african warlords
  and sand niggers dont let them off the hook
  it was arabs spaniards jews and other blacks     whites never enslaved the blacks
  wwwe just bought them and used them  we didnt know any better
youre forgetting romania
  enslaving and using slaves are two vastly different things dipshit  using slaves had been done literally since the beginning of time by every other civilization up to that point
  ah but see i didnt capture them originally i just brought them and kept them enslaved for hundreds of years  clearly that means i did nothing wrong
  the last part is not true but if anything it goes to show that the slavery problem is one where more than one race is guilty including blacks themselves also funny how its made such a big deal in america yet most of the slaves were off in the caribbean or latin america and on top of that it wasnt even the us that was the last to abolish slavery in the americas
  while the majorityof slaves were purchased european slavers also used to conduct coastal raids and directly kidnap africans
  wowza  sure got me on that one
  i did  white slave trade was overall much more humane than anywhere else in the world in a much smaller scale lasted much shorter and was the first to get abolished  and most importantly whites did no enslaving
  so when leopold ii of belgium controlled the congo and millions of congolese slaves died working the rubber plantations due to poor conditions this was the fault of the jews
  no it was a genocide the likes of which had actually been seen before dozens of times before committed by asians muslims and africans but they all get a free pass because leftists cant see past their own nose
          nice derailing the thread nigger   does gypsy mean jew in niggerland
  i dont see them currently screeching at belgium either i think the leftists are worried about slavery history in their own country ie slavery in america which was predominantly in the south on the plantations owned by whites who tried to secede from the union for their right to own slaves basically youre full of shit and dont belong on this board go back to /pol/ with the rest of the incel degenerates
  whites didnt buy them  it was the jews
  they were workers not slaves
they never wanted to  they are tribal ppl  they are leeching off host nations
  awful bait
  they have 4 gypsy countries india pakistan bangladesh afganistan
  spaniards and portuguese literally invented the concept of whiteness in relation to colonial empires you brainlet
  they are quite literally an insane race
  honestly they should just colonize the andaman islands
  why do /pol/tards have to bring jews into every discussion that has nothing to do with them are they incapable of thinking of anything else
  kurds and jews at least acted to get their own land  why arent the gypsies doing anything     how the hell will gypsies justify a welfare state similar to israel its too late to milk germans for the holocaust
  leave the thinking to the white man nigga
  thats a full bloaded spaniard
  gitanes have no organization or leaders that could push them towards one goal also they are fiercely tribalist and cant really get among even with other gitanes outside their family
  what is romania
  an unrelated country with a similar name
  calling gypsies roma
  i repeat 
  or hungary
  so  spaniards and their kind arent white
daily reminder hating gypsies isnt a pol thing its a boomer/gen x thing  ask anyone in eastern europe and they probably think romania is mostly gypsies and that thieves
  theyre a disparate ethnicity which unlike the jews has no material wealth to speak of meaning a homeland can never be created honestly being born a gypsy means your fucked and its not like they help themselves
  only 4 of the african slaves ended up in in north america    between 1525 and 1866 in the entire history of the slave trade to the new world according to the transatlantic slave trade database 125 million africans were shipped to the new world 107 million survived the dreaded middle passage disembarking in north america the caribbean and south america    and how many of these 107 million africans were shipped directly to north america only about 388000 thats right a tiny percentage
  theyre screeching at whites north americans europeans
  most romanians hate tzigane
  tamerican  any christian european with skin that wasnt brown or black was considered white back in the day because the contrast was really easy to see   it wasnt until nationalism kicked off that the blonde blueeyed aryan became a standard for whiteness
  honestly being born to illiterate parents with no value of education and progress means your fucked  fixed that for you pal
  i am not american and you are not white juan
  implying that european havent hated gypsies since the middle ages
    t amerilard
  hating gypsies is a thing for anyone who ever had anything to do with them
    european spaniards  american hispanics  the average spaniard probably looks whiter than you joe bob
  nothing he said was in line with /pol/ and perfectly suits /his/ you fucking cretin
  its the truth dumbass
  they did
  romania is not tzigane
do romanians hungarians slovaks etc and other countries infested with gypsies realize that they will never be rich stable countries due to their thieving leech populations
  yeahwe do
  the gypsies culture is all about being nomadic nonnomadic gypsies are just indians    its because of their nomadic lifestyle that they are typically con artists its hard to get a job when you live in a wagon and dont plan to stick around very long
  feels bad man    why were they not just liquidated during commie times seems like it wouldve been easier to do
  i know this board will gobble up any american propaganda it can but what if i told you that commies were moralfags
  beats me though we were actively getting rid of them together with jews before being commienized you hardly ever hear of that though unfortunately germany was buying jews at much higher price than gyppos so we didnt get rid of them in time before we got redded
  everyones a moralfag in their own special way      too bad maybe putting sterilizing chemicals in their water can help
  its called india and its earths worst shithole  gypsies  roaming indians trying to shit in foreign streets to expand indian culture worldwide
  its called israel
  nonnomadic gypsies are just indians    indians dont speak romani
  because being wandering cunts who never build and always take is part of their culture
  you wish  and im malagasy stop saying im american  we have more in common with the french bourbon royal family
he thinks germany couldnt have defeated the soviet juden 1 on 1  he thinks the lend lease act did not contribute in the soviet judens victory  he denies that mussolinis captured hindered the waffen ss from capturing moscow    why are tankies insufferable autists
  he denies that mussolinis captured hindered the waffen ss from capturing moscow  excellent post
  can you please go away
you lost get over it
  the soviet juden defeated germany on its own
  who cares nothing wouldve changed nazis would have collapsed just like the ussr collapsed but even sooner totalitarian governments cant last people dont like being slaves of the government
  national socialism which applied free market principles wouldve collapsed like the communist soviet juden    oh no no no no no
  based
juden  not jüden
yikes
  national socialism which applied free market principles wouldve collapsed like the communist soviet juden  youre right isnt the free market is their retarded philosophy that made them wage a war they couldnt win
ussr  juden  stalin goyified the ussr thats what the purges were
  totalitarian governments cant last  no government can last but most would be considered totalitarian whatever that actually means  people dont like being slaves of the government  dont you think this is a huge oversimplification
  national socialism  fre market    god how can nazis be so fucking retarded
  sure thing
  their economics policies were retarded and only made sense in the context of a country preparing for war their debts kept risingg and the food consumption was lower than in 1929 despite years of recovery
  to last a government needs its economy to grow the more authoritarian a government the fastest it needs to grow to silence the opposition the only way for advanced economies to grow is to get new markets but totalitarian and nationalist governments are extremely bad at that so they always end up failing when their citizens and businesses want foreign products and access to their markets
  soviet juden  nah
  that law didnt exist in a vacuum it included all racism because of muh federation of soviet states
  cringy thread op
you can easily spot a mutt neonazi because juden is the only german word they know
  in order to fulfill this i below state the assertions that proponents of the stalin was a jew hypothesis use as proof 2  a stalins original surname djugashvili means son of a jew in old georgian  b stalins actual father was a jew named david papisnedov a local jewish trader  c stalins actual father was a jewish trader named nikolai przhevalsky who stalins mother was a washerwoman for  d stalin in his early years as a revolutionary took the nickname bar kochba emulating the jewish religious zealot whose name is associated with the second jewish revolt against rome  the first assertion that djugashvili means son of a jew in old georgian is one that dates back to the ukrainian nationalist diaspora of the 1930s when it appears to have been first argued 3 it was popularised as a theory by maurice pinay in his much reprinted work the plot against the church when he argues thus  at the head of the names stands stalin himself who for a long time was regarded as a georgian of pure descent but it has been revealed that he belongs to the jewish race for djougachvili which is his surname means son of djou and djou is a small island in persia whither many banished portuguese gypsies migrated who late settled in georgia 
  gee stalin how come your mum lets you have 2 dads
    da jooooos    care to explain why nazi germany captured 4 four rothschilds and only one of them died of disease a few weeks before the war ended after 4 years of captivity
      stalins actual father was a jew named david papisnedov a local jewish trader  stalins actual father was a jewish trader named nikolai przhevalsky     stormniggers in charge of basic mathematics and biology the absolute fucking state
  heck that last rothschild wasnt even that relevant
stop crying about it incel its been 80 years
  stalins last name is a reference to the djugash mountains of georgia fuck off
    indeed from the wine making side of the family perhaps they were striking a blow against the perfidious (((grape))) in favour of aryan barley
  he said active antisemitism meaning pogroms
  stalins dad  a local jewish trader  he was a fucking cobbler thats why he was ranting at his son to get a trade also his dad hated communism
  well they did ban pastis
  on its own with someone  you can make any theory you want lad  you lost
  germany needed romania for example for resourcesoil the help the soviets got was resource wiseand that after it was already decided who won one on one the ussr wins every time because germany wouldnt even be able to fuel their trucks planes and tanks
  brainlet
  kill yourself degenerate effeminate faggot
  goes on and on about german uniforms looking good  calls anyone else effeminate   fuck off wehraboo
  soviet juden  its time to stop posting
  1 on 1  probably yes but those were never the conditions and youre genuinely retarded if you wage war knowing youre going to be fighting on several different fronts especially when resources are so tight
   stalins original surname djugashvili means son of a jew in old georgian  it doesnt and even if it would being john smithson doesnt mean that your father is a blacksmith  a jewish trader nikolai przhevalsky   fuck off nigger przhevalsky explored half of asia in the name of white race

  that doesnt count you cutcock
  the roman empire lasted for 1480 years you fucking dingus
  it also wasnt a totalitarian regime
it is the lack of materials that killed nazi germany because they just started making stupid ass wonder weapons and did not mass produce they lost the war plus they had horrible allies japan was not going to help in the slightest and italy was dead once the americans landed in sicily
   it is the lack of materials that killed nazi germany because they just started making stupid ass wonder weapons and did not mass produce they lost the war   yes im sure mass producing more equipment would help with their manpower shortages     plus they had horrible allies japan was not going to help in the slightest  japan had little interest in germany they were fighting their own war
yeah germans did great at butchering juden especially defenseless women and children im sure they couldve handled the ussrs jewish population 1v1     the soviet goyim plus a few soviets who were also juden stopped them though
  he actually thinks the germans couldve won against the soviets 1 on 1
  that doesnt count  lmao wehraboo subhuman
  what does 1 on 1 mean no allies no occupied territories no trading partners
  at least he tried a retard like him probably spent a lot time figuring out what georgia is
the stupid wehrfags always go on this tangent about 1v1 shit   if thats the case then strip off germany off all its conquest then and make it pre anchluss pre munchen germany and see how well they fare
  romania was also used for the push into ukraine ssr since otherwise it would be a pretty narrow front
indoeuropean general    previous thread    this general is pioneered to encourage all the anons interested in ie stuff to limit the ie based discussions pertaining to anthropology history sociology and literature/mythology etc to this general so that other threads dont get clogged up with unrelated and pointless arguments    now i have never made or organized a general before so if this one takes off then can someone please organize the next one to set a good standard for /ieg/    one last thing try to keep things as distanced from modern politics as much as possible would be a shame if the general gets nuked because of it
  what is the difference between r1a and r1b indo european tribes   thanks
  where was found the first swastika and why there are similar writing in america when aryans didnt conquer it
  aryans dont exist as a race
  in mecine ukraine
  because its a simple geometrical shape thats found in every culture on the planet its like trying to claim the invention of the wheel
  simple  dont find squares everywhere  dont find circles everywhere  dont find hexagons everywhere
okay so lets just use this thread and ignore the scythian snoop dog thread so who were the protoindoeuropean ancestors of cwc cuz its gotta be either yamna or a common ancestor to yamna and cwc
indoeuropooreans  cant even keep a contiguous land empire together for a millennium without it mutating into some bizarre ere hre reeeee bullshit  this meme brought to you by sino gang  bottom text    nah im just having a giggle this shit is pretty cool
  dont find circles everywhere
  sredny stog  cwc  sredny stog repin khvalnysk additional chg yamna    i dont expect a mick claiming udmurts scythians and egyptians are irish to get that though
  i am not that mick btw or a mick in general
  because its just a fourarmed spiral weave a basket and youll create a hundred swastikas the third reich memed everyone into thinking that this was the trademark of the aryan race and not a very simple symbol that many peoples have come up with the same goes for those ridiculous blueeyed statues that people think are evidence for a nordic ruling class
  to state the obvious youre not going to get much play with that op image  why not go back to /pol/ and start this thread there
  because amerindians are 30 ancient north eurasian  proto aryans  in average
  oh and wasnt a sredny stog sample tested to be r1a
  the second oldest ones are all in pre sumeria and giving that amerindians developed the same without posterior conection is clear that they have some common ancestry very probably relared to eastern hunter gatheres
  you cant call ane protoaryan or even pra indoeuropean they lack chg component
  the next appear with the expansion of tocharians to china
  yes
  ane/ ehg were the conquerors and the one who imposed the language and culture
  pie  chg  you what mate
  aztecs for example were 45 ane in average nearly the same as yamnaya  and mayans around 25
  t an idiot its just a very simple symbol and theres no evidence it was used by ehg or ane ever
  with every expansion of indo european tribe the swatika appear afterward  and is not only that but the special places that the swastikas are placed as an important cultural symbol
  did sredny stog also have r1b amples
  you are stupid every ie culture had chg
  it doesnt its not found among yamna at all
  with every expansion of indo european tribe the swatika appear afterward  ive seen this exact phrase in the exact same form of broken english in like a dozen threads where youve been btfo are you copypasting this shit
    no khvalnysk had r1a r1b and qthey have more samples but wont publish them there is a rumored r1a in yamnabut they are quiet about it
  when all the indo european tribes asent to live a more sedentary live we have an explosion of swastikas of course  since they are more rich and prosperous to develop and mantain them
  you are the only btfo yourself with the lack of coherent argument  shut up already retard
india was invaded by aryans not bmacizised aryans the dominance of r1a is clear proof of this    one of the most remarkable discoveries in the recent narasimhan et al 2018 preprint has to be the presence of what are essentially eastern european migrant populations within the inner asian mountain corridor iamc during the middle to late bronze age mlba     strikingly most of these people cluster with bronze age eastern europeans and even some bronze age central europeans theyre also sitting very close to the more easterly presentday slavicspeakers from russia and ukraine even i never predicted such an outcome sure i was expecting to see ancient genomes from south central asia with some very heavy steppe influence but not this
  develop and maintain swastikas  who is maintaining the ones carved into my local park bench
  theres no swastika from khvalynsk either
  funny how you cant seem to be able to mention a single one
  based balts and slavs btfoing australoid swarthoids praise perunindra
  develop and mantain the tools for it instead of the more primitive and nomadic life of the steppe
  tools  chalk stones i can carve a swastika into a slab using the grindings from my fingernails
  so the r1b input based on what we know comes from khvalnysk only also what about cwc i havent looked into it in detailed but does it have more r1a or r1b cuz the released yamna samples are all r1b
  only baltinfluenced eastern slavs the rest are too central euro to be anywhere close
  cwc is r1a
  and plenty of places were the ie were not clearly they were one swastika drawing people amongst many
  it was much less populated and developed  more nomadic and hard to find them in the steppe than in stable setlement with more people and tools that stayed in the same place for hundred of years
  bmacized as in culturally bmacized since there is evidence of them settling down instead of piling on mass graves    it has become increasingly clear that if one wishes to argue for indoiranian migrations from the steppe lands south into the historical seats of the iranians and indoaryans that these steppe cultures were transformed as they passed through a membrane of central asian urbanism the fact that typical steppe wares are found on bmac sites and that intrusive bmac material is subsequently found further to the south in iran afghanistan nepal india and pakistan may suggest then the subsequent movement of indoiranianspeakers after they had adopted the culture of the bmac
  you know aryans did not exist at that point the people that existed in ukraine were dark and blue eyed the aryans popped out of central asia 6000 or 5000 years ago just want to point that out also archeologists discovered a 12000 year old swastika in pakistan or the indus valley this predates any aryan invasion
  sumerian mtd dna had samples with h5  european female the same as the ehg in the steppe   so its clear that at least they had same kind of influence
  north poles latvians and lithuanians are closer to each other than all of them to russians belarusians would be the best proxy
   sumeria dna text   stop lying
  ukraine isnt central asia
  sumerians were probably iranianhgs or chg
  you mean u5
  chg or something like iranian neolithic seems the most likely answer probably the same as bmac peoples and potentially the ivc
  pajeets and pakis btfod once again
  the more incredible thing is thay after texting ten of sumerian corpses only make public the female halogroup  im sure is r1a / r1b is the the principal one in sumer at that time
  r1a  never
  but pajeets and pakis have chg/iranian hg based ancestry the aboriginal south asian ancestry is fairly low among north indians and pakis preie north indians and pakis along with their other iranhg brothers got btfo why steppechads
  there isnt what we found is increased amount of primitive andronovo pottery in late bmac towns then around 1600 bc bmac collapsed and people moved to smaller settlements or turned into nomadic pastoralists urban settlements reappeared in central asia during the achaemenid empire naturally the incursion of steppe pastoralists was probably not the only reason for the fall of this civilization around the same time indus valley civilization collapsed   it was in general a time of great disturbance similar in a way to late bronze age collapse
  the common element is very clearly the ane who were present in the ie in precolumbian america and in the chg who probably were the origins of the sumerians
  ane isnt protoie aryans are indoiranians you larping mutts    why are you quoting blogs
  t asshurt iranian larper from /pol/  why are in usa if iran is so great
  the same ane that did not use swastikas
  indus valley had already collapsed a long time before that due to climate change once the aryans arrived in south asia they would have probably found tribes of chg/iranhgs and native hgs in constant conflict
  of course its possible that some of them also settled down along with people from bmac but the majority clearly remained pastoralist yaz culture seem to derive from bmac influenced by andronovo in early phases more primitive pottery but with bmac styles smaller settlements lack of graves  disappearance of kurgans   also zoroastrianism probably appeared around that time not before sarianidi is full of shit trying to connect bmac buildings with much later zoroastrian temples its nothing more but nationalistic nonsense and wishful thinking
  ere and hre were autistic because of high enf genes first massgraves with mutilated bodies come from lbk farmers in germany germans are at least 40 lbk connect the dots yourself
  im not middle eastern or west asian you stupid sperg the only ethnic groups to ever use the ethnonym aryans were the vedics and iranians thus indoiranians the others are just pie or later ie groups like scythians tocharians sarmatians theyre all caucasoid at no point have i disputed that theres little doubt that gene flow from the west and eastern eurasian steppe was minimal
should be renamed /scmg/  siberocaucasus mongrel general
  zoroastrianism was probably a bmac response to aryans taking their cattle and eating their grass beyond permissible limits like it was clearly a rebellion against the aryan religion at the time
  stop with your semantic nerd rage everyone know what we are reering to
its certainly interesting how these interactions looked like as they probably werent always hostile some bmac artifacts seem to even appear in iranian legends  apparently king yima used a trumpet/horn to lead animals and humans a lot of small trumpets were found in bmac sites they made some experiments and it seems like they could imitate animals calls and were probably used for hunting
  i bet white andronovochads fucked tight brown bmac pussies with bwac big white andronovo cock 
  zoroastrianism is postbmac very likely of mixed iranianlocal origin
  ancestral north eurasian is clearly the godly component that give the world civilization   conquering paleoasians in america  conquering anatolian farmers to form chg that would spread the first civilizations  conquering whg to form ehg that would spread all around the world   aztecs being the ones with highest admixture in america building the first empire  ane is literally the blood of gods
  i mean it was just a jokelike speculation based on bmac brownoids getting mad at blond andronovochads taking their animals grazing lands and women
  more like the blood of savage neadhertals
  maybe but their ydna never disappeared and a lot of pastoralist groups or modern indoaryan ethnicities carry nonr1 haplogroups
  they passed bmac without mixing much they were mobile while bmac was sedentary i know youre desperate for aryans to be chg/iran heavy but theyre not
  quite the contrary aryans were the andronovo people who originally had some chg from yamna mutts but it was much smaller than the important ehg component i just wanna see if there was a plausible bleaching scenario where the aryans dont act like absolute barbarians
  it wasnt jesus youre a brainlet the fact that all the iron age samples from fergana had steppe and bmac ancestry points to them mixing with postbmac settled communities of course not all of them mixed which isnt exactly surprising
  the hyperboreans
  with 15 hyperborean admixture you are a viking  with 50 hyperboreans admixture you are an aryan  being 100 pure you are a god
  kek
  deformed mongoloid pajeetlike anes are gods now
  both split from their ancestors haplogroup r first found in lake baikal 20000 bc allegedly r1as traveled noth throug asia and russia to europe while r1b traveled south at some point near india they leave mixed traces in europe they occupy germany and northern coutries r1a and basque country wester n france and ireland r1b i think we dont know much about the split
  as far as i know this swastika is conzidered as an accidental decorative pattern and its 10000 bc
  thats high likely bullshit until proven otherwise oldest swastika ive seenin india is 25004500bc
  they were 70 west eurasian but stop with your materialistic bulshit   nobody cares
  youre right i dont get that yet
  there is more to this story as r1bv88 moved to africa and seem to be connected to afroasiatic chadic languages while r2 moved south and today is most common among dravidians and central asians it was also found in bmac
  
  the ancestors of the aryans were the yamnaya they originated in central asia the yamnaya people dates back to 3500 bce
  more likely they were from cwc
   not a single photo and from a guy defending that aryans came from india   top kek top fucking kek
  even they corded ware people had some yamanya genes in them
  there are swastika seals from the indus valley its definitely prearyan
    muh indoeuropean circlejerk really needs to get the fuck out of this board it adds nothing relevant and derails countless threads with sperging like were x ie muuh pies not to mention haplogroup pedantry and the idiotic conjectures you make    besides the term indoeuropean and putting the indo before to describe a clear branch of the european rootrace makes as much sense as saying the mesoameroeuropean people because some europeans invaded mexico and settled there or the creoleeuropean language group     its a 19th century geographic catch term made by british and german academics at early stages of research it makes no sense to use it now    /r/ ban on every such thread  thanks
  mad farmer
  they were a similar population living next to yamna why shouldnt they have them even some balkan farmers had steppe genes varna outlier a girl with steppe ancestry was buried along with other farmers
    oh and a reminder that indoeuropean as an agenda is largely a circlejerk spread by some zionistlinked obviously altright publications and correspondence circles they are the ones who push all this sperging recently  despite how their theories were eventually abandoned by the third reich on later years and count on recent deliberatelyjewish research teams which are backed by the fucking cia     some of these indoeuropean warriors of light larpers are actual homossexuals who claim pederasty was part of ritual bonding in warrior societies  this is the actual state of the (((altright)))
  1 this thread is made to collect the autism and reduce it in other unrelated threads  2 indoeuropean refers to the range of the people since they stretched from europe to india  3 they arent exactly european since they started out quite distinct from the native euros in fact ultimately they are part ehg kind of a mongoloid  part chg churka  part whg actual swarthy native euros with a subset of them getting the light skinned mutations in the form of shg populations
  they are still terrible because people here arent interested in fact and prefer to shitpost about muh master race they are always full of ignorance and stupidity
    1 it will just concentrate the sperging and contaminate the other threads    2 indoeuropean still refers to a people even though its a language group who were of european extraction not dravidian or something    3 they are exactly european they were a branch of the european rootrace who became widespread you see the haplogroup classifications arent exact samples and the other european natives would also have some degree of admixture old europe theory is a bunch of garbage and deliberately feminist madeup fantasy and distortion and putting an indo first makes no sense regardless unless you want to ensure others of your sperging
  old europe is a fact not theory
    old europe as a matriarchal negroidlike pacifist muh goddess worshipping darkness or something is a fact come on
  no old europe as people living in big settled communities using advanced copper metallurgy and not burying their dead under kurgans also they were closer to mediterraneans and 100 of them had skinlightening alleles   its also a fact that these cultures disappeared when steppe nomads migrated from east europe the chalcolithic collapse of southeast europe is a fact
  they arent european since they arent native to europe they came from a caucasian and a siberian population
    i was referring to old europe as in cultural terms where it is portrayed as some sort of feminist communalism when its pretty clear it was far from that  but indoeuropean warriors of light circlejerkers will still refer to it as so nevermind the irony to justify their larping    and what you said is also wrong because not all of preindoeuropean communities lived in big settlements only parts of it  large tracts were still huntergatherers such as in the northern parts of europe as for them not building kurgans other such burial techniques aside they built burial mounds and other similar structures which were continued after the indoeuropeans took over  which kind of evidence their broader cultural commonality  that both were branches of the same much older european rootrace and tradition the difference between kurgans and the other structures is more architectural not on purpose the kurgans fitted more for the steppes and the type of society there rather than settled patterns
    this is the problem with indoeuropean circlejerking  the claim that they were some sort of aliens out of the steppes
  well that is true they are aliens to both the natives of europe and india
    they were a branch of the european rootrace genetically and culturally they migrated there and to siberia because these people and the europeans were migratory especially after the ice ages the socalled indoeuropean peoples had moved to the asian steppes from the place where europeans originated  which is likely central europe and near the baltic  but that was many thousands of years ago  maybe even hundreds of thousands
  they didnt have kurgans or mounds they didnt even bury their dead in individual graves for example trypillians didnt use cemeteries they probably cremated their people they also buried people with female figurines spondylus shells and copper or gold ornaments old europeans aka the balkan cultures lived in bigger settlements     now compare it to steppe no settlements just kurgans with their bodies buried with weapons and boar tusks pastoralists instead of agriculturalists poor and simple pottery and metallurgy     the difference between both was huge and everyarcheologist agrees even their look was different
  define the european root race the early steppe people certainly didnt have any enf and very little whg in comparison to siberian ehg and caucasian chg and both of these components are characteristic of the pre steppe europeans
  just stop and educate yourself first
    old europe is not just the balkan cultures there are many preindoeuropean burial mounds all across europe  such as newgrance and carnac  and there are female burials even in later indoeuropean cultures    and not all of oldeurope was of settlements if you base the whole difference between groups on just the samples of the kurgan people and the vinca balkan people you will end up with a faulty incomplete view
    as in the distinctive and recessive thus the need for a people elements that differ europeans from other outside races  such as fair features and their broad paneuropean traditions from where the different european subtypes stem from and derive most of their genetic material
    arguments
  fair features european traditions the oldest tested steppe people had dark hair and dark eyes along with slightly lighter than olive skin such an ancestor today would be referred to as a shitskin not to mention that they were close enough to the definition of a hapa part mongoloid ane part caucasoid the non ane component    as for the cultural traditions the european ones are a blend of preie like funnelbeakers along with the new ie traditions and the same goes for the asiatic indoeuropeans whose cultures are a blend of preie cultures like iranian neolithic ones and ie cultures
  scyrhians yamba sibilings or so i read had r1b elites r1a plebs and also some q in their burials
  you post this in every thread you schizophrenic piece of shit scythians werent cousins of yamna and majority of tested samples are r1a j and even g only latest study discovered r1b and it has nothing to do with irish
    europe is not fair compared to the other continents and has no traditions of their own im sorry but this is precisely the problem i was pointing  that indoeuropean circlejerks may lead you into a faulty comprehension of things glorifying supposedly halfasian are they that now  i thought they were blonde aliens or then mediterraneanlike steppe peoples as the originators of our culture or at least the good aspects anyway    as for the cultural traditions the european ones are a blend of preie like funnelbeakers along with the new ie traditions and the same goes for the asiatic indoeuropeans whose cultures are a blend of preie cultures like iranian neolithic ones and ie cultures    what you said is partially correct our culture in europe is derived from the cultures from before and after the indoeuropean migrations the indoeuropean ones had distinctive elements as do every other paneuropean groups because of things like their lifestyle but they were not in essence new traditions they were part of and a branch of our mucholder paneuropean traditions that stem from the european rootrace we have a cultural continuity here in europe despite the migrations of other europeans who had lived in the asian steppes  as can be evidenced in things like the continuity of burial mound practices     these people who are behind pushing these agendas people like benoist and other altright zionists want to keep people in confusion about their own history to smear part of our history old europe and deny our much older continuity here in europe while reinforcing foreign ideas  or in your case foreign people even i also dont think it would make sense for a huge invasion of halfasian people in europe to leave no traces of asian admixture in europeans
  europe is not fair compared to the other continents and has no traditions of their own     you dumb nigger you absolute fucking retarded black gorilla what i said was the exact opposite if a steppeman appeared today you know the guys who started this whole ie thing they would clearly be deemed as nonwhite due to not being fair and because of note deriving their ancestry directly from europe instead they invaded europe and spread their ancestry into europe you are implying that they were already a part of some pan european identity which is not the case    i never claimed that europe has no culture of its its i said that it is a combo of preie and ie stuff along with later developments as well    also  altright zionists  take that shit to /pol/
    hey triggered fucko you said that a large group of invaders in europe who would originate large tracts of our dna were halfasians who as you said imposed their ancestry on europe where is our asian heritage then where are our asian features it makes no sense to conjecture that because you saw a sample from the asian steppes thousands of years ago who looked halfmongoloid     what you claimed and repeated now is even worse than saying europe has no culture youre saying that a large part of it comes from halfasians    and youre spreading the same agendas as pushed by altright zionist people such as benoist this is not a politics thing its a fact they are the ones who are taking their politics into other areas
  the asian heritage is present in the form of ane admixture look it up its pretty darn high in european and particularly northern european populations the asian features include the blonde hair which was likely passed to shgs from the older groups of siberians who are close to modern day eskimos note not all mongoloids are the same and the ane mongoloids have little to do with either northeast asians or southeast asians     large part of it comes from half asians     i said a certain part of it comes from half asians this is a fact and how is it bad migrations have been the norm before civilization which is a relatively recent thing youd be surprised to learn the extent of various other migrations    literally all of this is factual early indoeuropeans werent some kind of native european homegrown race cant you at least study this subject a little bit before jumping in clueless and making yourself look like a retard    implying that the ancestors of pies were a europid race will suddenly add a huge chunk of asia all the way to fucking india into the european racial sphere which is obviously not accurate yes all these people share certain parts of their heritage and culture but that is not the same as being the same race
    blonde hair is an asian feature derived from the shg    nigga what and you said that the sample was halfmongoloid darkhaired and looked like a shitskin now youre saying that blonde hair is a feature that proves our ancestry from groups you just described as being largely darkhaired    ane admixture    there is nothing though to indicate that ancient north eurasians were halfmongoloid though they may have had slight admixtures but that they were halfasian is just a conjecture youre making out of sperg memecharts     i said a certain part of it comes from half asians this is a fact and how is it bad migrations have been the norm before civilization which is a relatively recent thing youd be surprised to learn the extent of various other migrations    again if a part of it came from halfasians we would have more asian dna and admixture than we have today it would show yes emigrations have been the norm before civilization and admixture but not to such degree of hybridization     the migratory tribes were also largely european     our looks are not abstractions  you can learn more from them than through haplogroup sperging    literally all of this is factual early indoeuropeans werent some kind of native european cant you at least study this subject a little bit before jumping in clueless and making yourself look like a retard    early indoeuropeans were definitely of majority europeanroot race dna stock if you study through falsecirclejerks and things dissociated from reality dont be surprised that you only get a partial understanding of things  and fall for the agendas of people behind these circlejerks like you are    and lastly yes the european race inhabited all of the northern eurasia after the last iceages even up to siberia and mongolia tarim basin which had fair features  and perhaps even to japan  the ainu and yes they were largely of the same race
  the blonde hair came from the same group that was the ancestor to the steppe migrants it is weird it is perplexing but it is what it is that is a part of the north eurasian heritage but it isnt from the yamna rather from another related asiatic population    there is nothing though to indicate that ancient north eurasians were halfmongoloid though    the ane lineage is defined by association with ma1 or malta boy the remains of an individual who lived during the last glacial maximum 24000 years ago discovered in the 1920s populations genetically similar to ma1 were an important genetic contributor to central asians native americans europeans south asians and a minor contributor to east asians    eastern european huntergatherer ehg is a lineage derived predominantly from ane it is represented by two individuals from karelia one of yhaplogroup r1am417 dated c 84 kya the other of yhaplogroup j date 72 kya and one individual from samara of yhaplogroup r1bp297 dated 76 kya this lineage is closely related to the ane sample from afontova gora dated c 18 kya after the end of the last glacial maximum the whg and ehg lineages merged in eastern europe accounting for early presence of anederived ancestry in mesolithic europe afontova gora 3 female individual dated to 147 kya is earliest known individual with the derived allele of kitlg responsible for blond hair in modern europeans and is recorded in mesolithic eastern europe as associated with the ehg lineage    the skeletal remains of ma1 have been described as phenotypically east asian mongoloid alexeev 1998 p 323 in his later publication stated that this area was inhabited by a population of mongoloid appearance    a strange group of mongoloids were the origin of blond hair in shgs the same group of mongoloids were responsible for ehgs and ehgs form most of the ancestry of early indoeuropean populations  character limit reached
  mongoloids didnt exist yet when that boy roamed the earth
  response part 2    again if a part of it came from halfasians we would have more asian dna and admixture than we have today it would show yes emigrations have been the norm before civilization and admixture but not to such degree of hybridization     mongoloids as i have said arent one homogeneous group and this group of mongoloids has contributed little if anything towards the genome of east asians their main contributions are to europeans central asians and south asians and it does show in the genome it is the ane component which is the main makeup of the ehg populations    migratory tribes were also largely european     every tribe migrated here and there apparently all humans are now europeans huh     early indoeuropeans were definitely of majority europeanroot race dna stock    i just proved that it isnt the case unless eskimos can pass as close cousins of europeans and caucasians/west asians are also suddenly europeans all of this is based on genetic evidence    and lastly yes the european race inhabited all of the northern eurasia after the last iceages even up to siberia and mongolia tarim basin which had fair features  and perhaps even to japan  the ainu and yes they were largely of the same race    this tells me that you know nothing of population genetics once the steppe people originally noneuropean mixed with certain truly native european populations they did span out to the western half of central asia however that was a very late event   the ainu on the other hand are literal abbos heck the indian abbos are closer to the ainus than europeans are just because they look remotely similar doesnt mean that they are closely related     you sound just like the kinds of guys that argue with people like stj/thomas rowsell because the idea of ancient population migrations and not being native to your land for an infinite period of the past seems somewhat uncomfortable     you are hopeless
  the anthropological study described his skeletal features as mongoloid simple as that    also considering that you think that ainus are european i wouldnt be surprised to learn that the limit of your foolishness is indeed infinite
    the blonde hair came from the same group that was the ancestor to the steppe migrants it is weird it is perplexing but it is what it is    maybe because it makes no sense and because its found elsewhere and even if it comes from another obscure group it would still be an european group not asiatic and that group would necessarilly be a large part of our dna or else these recessive features would not have been preserved    the ane lineage is defined by association with ma1 or malta boy the remains of an individual  eastern european huntergatherer ehg is a lineage derived predominantly from ane  the skeletal remains of ma1 have been described as phenotypically east asian mongoloid    that sounds faulty    and as you said it originated largely european subgroups  who are not mongoloid looking so that would make little sense    a strange group of mongoloids were the origin of blond hair in shgs the same group of mongoloids were responsible for ehgs and ehgs form most of the ancestry of early indoeuropean populations    just like blue eyes are a recent 5000 yearold mutation right yeah bogus     alexeev 1998 p 323    one google search to find he is an israeli citizen
  it wasnt my post mongoloids didnt exist back then simple as that any hapa/eurasian tiger fantasies are obsolete in the face of this
    2000 character limit on /his/ makes no sense    mongoloids arent one homogeneous group    but you described the samples as being darkfeatured    every tribe migrated here and there apparently all humans are now europeans huh     indoeuropeans who migrated into europe were european tribes the admixture they may have had is small and also present in other europeans but not with asians of course to some degree    i just proved that it isnt the case unless eskimos can pass as close cousins of europeans     indoeuropeans wuz eskimos im trully redpilled now    once the steppe people originally noneuropean mixed with certain truly native european populations they did span out to the western half of central asia however that was a very late event     and how would they have mixed with europeans in the eastern half of central asia because people of european extraction inhabited most of north eurasia after the last ice ages the early indoeuropeans who migrated into europe had little asian admixture  as shown in the lack of asian admixture in our dna    the ainu are abbos    and where are these abbo features in southern japan the ainu holding features similar to europeans and the presence of fairfeature people as far as in the tarim basim does indicate that elements of the european rootrace inhabited most of northern eurasia after the ice ages    you sound just like the kinds of guys that argue with people like stj/thomas rowsell     lol the pedantry and jewmask is falling but please tell me how knowledgeable and academical your larpdaddy is because he is enlightened to know we wuz mongols/eskimos and only racist people can have this absurd idea of a cultural and genetic continuity of recessive features this is pathetic    and yes im done arguing with you im pretty sure after what i have seen here that indoeuropean autism is a condition
  those 2 groups are literally the same you dont randomly toss rocks with letters on them to find answers in genetics they early blond hair people were indeed from the very ancestors of the ehg people who in turn formed the majority of the ancestry of early indoeuropeans but some some reason a n important group of these early indoeuropeans did not express the said traits of blondness why was that    also no blue eyes are far older than 5000 years and they indeed are a truly native european trait iirc only the native western european huntergatherers had blue eyes and this trait was passed on to shgs       what hapa fantasy clearly they werent east asian but mongoloids regardless the point i tried to make with the hapa thing is that important components of contemporary european ancestry are not native to the continent of europe     the primary natives to europe were western european hunter gatherers and then the anatolian farmers joined them to make different cultures across europe and these could be called partially or completely native depending on whether you consider anatolia to be european examples of these cultures include lbk culture and funnelbeakers these people got the clear eye inputs from whgs then thee shg contributors to these cultures already had blond hair from anes and the fair skin was an original shg trait developed and selected for in response to the nordic environment this was a native or partially native european culture the steppe people responsible for ie languages and the ie religion however came from outside of the continent of europe therefore they were racially not european however they did mix with racially european people to make a new hybrid group of people this hybrid then went on eastward to move into asia and establish the indoiranian tocharian and other language/cultures to be continued in the next post
  indoeuropeans who migrated into europe were european tribes the admixture they may have had is small and also present in other europeans but not with asians of course to some degree    m8 the steppe people were like 40 chg 9west asians and 60 ehg primarily comes from ane aka siberian populations they were not racially european unless you stretch the boundaries of europe to nonconventional limits    yes yes once of the ancestral components to the steppe people is sort of close to eskimos and native americans here is your redpill for the day    and how would they have mixed with europeans in the eastern half of central asia because people of european extraction inhabited most of north eurasia after the last ice ages the early indoeuropeans who migrated into europe had little asian admixture  as shown in the lack of asian admixture in our dna    boi ehg is asian it is not originally european even though it is present in contemporary european populations it came from outside  oh and err chg west asians arent europeans either unless west asia is in europe    and where are these abbo features in southern japan the ainu holding features similar to europeans and the presence of fairfeature people as far as in the tarim basim does indicate that elements of the european rootrace inhabited most of northern eurasia after the ice ages    they are autosomally close to indian abos like andaman islanders and austronesians also the ydna haplogroup d is common in all 3 of these groups    the problem with you is that you cannot accept reality and larp on about some old european race which then left europe and then came back as steppe people and then left europe again to spread steppe culture i have already explained the truth to you and your own dogmatic brain rejects it there is no helping you good day sir
  thats kostenski 14 he was not ane
gisco by baal hammon i have never beheld such a mass of men the roman army is immense beyond measure  hannibal another thing that has escaped your notice gisgo is even more amazingthat although there are so many of them there is not one among them called gisgo  how based can one man be
  what did he mean by this
  i dont get it
    hannibal was diffusing the tension of his men everyone was afraid of facing a much larger army than themselves gisco was just a random officer and like an absolute chad he made everyone feel at ease with that comeback
  by baal  did romans worshipped moloch
  baal means lord its added to the names of lots of semitic deities its used in reference to the god of israel several times in the bible but most often its used as an epithet for hadad a levantine sky god gisco was a carthaginian not a roman lord hammon was a deity worshiped in carthage to my knowledge the word has never been used in reference to moloch whose name also has a similar meaning on its own
  this i assume op is quoting plutarch and excluded the part where hannibal and gisco return down the hill from scouting the roman forces laughing at the joke and hannibals army sees this and get hyped for a fight
  baal and moloch were different gods they are only similar because they both demanded child sacrifice     moloch was worshiped by the ammonites the judeans eastern nieghbors some jewish kings joined them in worshiping moloch and in gehenna a valley in jerusalem they are alleged to have regularly sacrificed children to the flames     baal on the other hand was worshiped by the phoenicians north of israel when the king of israel ahab married a princess from tyre a phoenecian city she tried to introduce baal worship but the israelites revolted and threw her out a window when the phoenicians colonized north africa they brought baal with them romans from what i can tell never worshiped either of the gods which were semitic deities anyway
  not the guy who asked but im retarded i still dont get what he said is meant to imply
  this is your brain on theology
    hes saying not to worry about how many men they have because they dont have you
  aw thats wholesome
      im not sure thats what he meant i genuinely think he was just having a crack at his friend having a funny name to keep the situation grounded    though i do think it is just as wholesome
  its only funny to your ears to them it was completely normal
  gisgo is a carthaginian name not roman
these days in his communities everyone talks about haplogroups ychromosomes and stuff like that i know jack shit of can you redpill me how genetics work or link resources where i can learn the basics
  polish coping mechanism
  ignore it  dont contribute to discussions about unrelated garbage
  but sometimes its pretty related though in those threads about ethnic changes and stuff
all you have to understand is that every important civilization in history was nordic 
  t lil snorre

  my ancestors 
  yumy
haplogroups work like this first you look at the haplomap then you go holup
  the haplogroups normally talked about here are made up of snps pronounced snip that are mutations found only in men they are passed down from father to son your y chromosomal haplogroup is one you share with all descendants of a single man     mine is r1b u106 i share a great great etc grandfather with everyone else who has that haplogroup any questions
  yeah these maps are cluster though a lot of ethnicities with similar haplogroups dont have that much of similarities    any questions  by far no ill google snp thanks
  sites like wikipedia you dingus there are literal charts and tables showing where different haplogroups are and how they spread      theres also eupedia
  based albania
  thats why autosomal and mtdna are also used for determining ancestry anon wikipedia and the sources cited therein will be more informative than making a bait thread and shitposting in said thread because youre not actually curious about the topic at hand
        is her neck bisected by another head
  no they dont theyre harder to make any sense of since lots of groups overlap the same region ydna is used because it is more precise  maybe butthurt feminists are those who want maternal and autist dna to have more significance
  its her conjoined twin they are united by neck and love towards piza
    i am interested though a slight shitpost wont get in the way thanks for answers anons
hi so i got an idea for a tattoo that says sometimes i think it would be better if i just erased myself and i want to know if its well written or not thanks in advance
what were they thinking
pure ideology
muh race muh ideology muh genes     turns out what matters most is muh oil
  i always knew the eternal bozgor was behind it all
fascism more like assjizm this ideology is like a buffalo taking a diarrhea dump on your face youd rather eat a roadkilled skunk then live in one of those nations what were they thinking
    nagymagyaorszag is the true cause for ww2
  one was about ideology  other was about resources  and the last one tryed to make his country great
  even though benito got hanged and adolf killed himself maybe the real fascism was the friends we made on the way
  thats deep bro
  this should have used japans imperial flag since it used germanys nazi flag and italys fascist flag
  that is japans imperial flag you might be thinking of the naval flag
  hey its the nerd
  savoy ensign  italian fascist flag
  the state of /his/  the rising sun flag was used by the army and the navy not the country itself they used their current flag in ww2 as well   and as  pointed out there is no such thing as an italian fascist flag it was the flag of the kingdom of italy long before benito gained power
  those were the official national flags of the countries at the time also the italian one isnt specifically fascist
  the official rsi states flag is now the official flag of italy
  saving the world
  muh race    moron  mussolini wasnt interested at all in race he even mocked the nsdap for it
    but they got this one in 1943
        shiiit i knew that wasnt a fascist flag but i didnt know how it was actually called anyway thanks for correcting me
they werent thinking  imagine you are very popular everything is great women love you your parents are proud you make shitloads of money  but you need more and wana be the very best everybody is telling you you can do it you can do it  no other voice reaches you or if it does it must be from your rival or ppl supporting your rival    so you try and become the best and you fail because you were just a skinny neet with some luck and many many lucky occasions  but you cant quit because you will lose everything    thats what happened with these regimes lost their common sense
germany    muh cool knight history which never actually existed     japan    muh samurai kinda legit i suppose    italy    lets pretend to be the western roman empire again pretty retarded
  which never actually existed   without german knights wed all speak hungarian now
  id be fine with that

what do you guys think of the byzantine empire and the orthodox church 
based and redpilled the byzantines tried to unite the world under orthodoxy sadly that didnt happen and now we have more than one type of christian church
  maybe they could have kept their shitty empire intact for more hunred years if they just payed the debt
they were better than the ottomans and cooler than the west romans
  if only justinian and belisarus reconquered the entire west
  why they would have still ended up btfod by the arabs   if instead justinian dedicated those resources to strengthening the defenses in the east and eliminating the sassanid problem they would have been more than ready to fight off a shitty camel army
  good point the arian barbarian kingdoms sucked but muslims suck more
  fpbpi converted
  considering the same
  church was bitch slave to the state which impeded the development of their religion and caused the schism
if only the arabs kept to themselves
  the byzantine empire had some wild politics going on i honestly dont understand why people who like game of thrones hate byzantine history because the constant political turmoil surpasses game of thrones in every way
literally rome for contrarians
they were /fa/ as fuck
  thats a terible idea and those investments were what caused its collapse
orthodox church  the best one  byzantine empire  cool aesthetics but autistic politics and really overhyped due to peoples inflated hatred of islam imo the ottoman empire was in many ways better and more interesting than the byzantine empire
  inflated hatred of islam  totally like arabs never attacked them or anything ha ha
  because christians never attacked them or anything ha ha
  lol
  no my point being that the fact that they destroyed the byzantine empire is what makes people like the byzantine empire interest in them comes not from actual appreciation of them but rather just a hatred of islam  people who skim over the ottomans because mmuh byzantines are faggots who miss all sorts of cool shit by the time they fell an argument can soundly be made that they fucking deserved it due to the level of utter incompetence demonstrated by them
    kiked cringe  bluepilled    a shadow of its former self held 10 of its former landmass by the year 700 orthodox monks are pissstained navelgazing protojews who cower to muslims
    byzantiboos need to get the fuck out
  ottoman empire was in many ways better and more interesting than the byzantine empire  a stagnant slave regime that only worth serving the decadent upper family that killes itself for stabily and waging wars of conquest  no thechological philosophical theological artistic development ever since 15th century but copy pasting turkopersian and old byzantine architecture and arabic art  name one thing interesting about ottoman that isnt warfare
  by the time they fell an argument can soundly be made that they fucking deserved it due to the level of utter incompetence demonstrated by them    not really they hung on for over a thousand years there arent too many governments that can make that claim in europe getting fucked by venetians isnt an example of incompetence but an example of childlike innocence
  my kafir ancestors 
  a stagnant slave regime that only worth serving the decadent upper family that killes itself for stabily and waging wars of conquest    we were more competent than byzantines    byzantines lost all their middle eastern land to barefoot bedouins in 6 years    we conquered entire middle east in 6 months
  we  shut the fuck up rape baby youre a descendant of tax evading bootlicking cucks
  turks are more turkic than greeks are greek or roman    know your place or else ill beat the shit out of you just as how my ancestors beat he shit out of your effeminate ancestors i could kick your skull in whiteboi
  turks are more turkic than greeks are greek or roman  top kek  know your place or else ill beat the shit out of you just as how my ancestors beat he shit out of your effeminate ancestors i could kick your skull in whiteboi  the only thing youll do is present me with your mom and bring us fresh towels when i ask you no later or youll get in the cuck cage
  turks are mostly anatolians who got cucked by turkics
  a study in 2015 however found that previous genetic studies have generally used turks as representatives of ancient anatolians our results show that turks are genetically shifted towards central asians a pattern consistent with a history of mixture with populations from this region29
  that is just a disgusting way to speak about some of the most dedicated followers of christ
    so this is the power of roach intellect no wonder ottoman succession was so fucking retarded
  shifted towards  read the shit you post
  i honestly dont understand why people who like game of thrones hate byzantine history because the constant political turmoil surpasses game of thrones in every way  a lot of gots events are inspired by byzantine history kings landing in the battle of the blackwater is literally the second arab siege of constantinople greek fire booms to trap the ships in the port impregnable walls tunnels underneath the city bells ringing before the battle all of it    so are many other things like the court eunuchs and the political backstabbing of course martin knows his byzantine history      by the time they fell an argument can soundly be made that they fucking deserved it due to the level of utter incompetence demonstrated by them    not really though if it was the corruptions fault the ere wouldve fallen much earlier the reality is that noone not even the pope expected that the venetians would be so retarded and selfdestructive as to sack the capital of christianity over a common political betrayal then the venetians actually did it and they got countless spoils and riches for it and predictably because of it the turks took over the ere shut down trade routes setting off the age of discovery and rendering venice more and more irrelevant as a result while it was losing more and more territory to the turks and then venice became ripe for the taking and today it is a theme park with barely any people living in it there were no longterm winners from the 4th crusade which is why it is so incomprehensible even today such events arent common or predictable
  the mamluks incompetence lost their sultanate not ottoman superiority
  yes as we know arabs conquered shittone of land from spain to persia because they were defending against the christian aggression
dutch queen wilhelmina visits dutch soldiers who guard the border  against german artillery on bicycles    can someone explain to me why the dutch after the socalled golden age  have never bothered anything in the field of warfare
  cause its a small country and their imperial priorities were financial instead of territorial/conquest
eritrea and ethiopia were never one unified region in the pre colonial and the annexation was fraudulent
  no one is disagreeing
  bunch of fucking retarded ethicopeans claim that we were one subjugated people under one rule instead of the reality that it was a region of autonomous ethnic groups who lived in localized feudal systems
  what are eriterian views on aabi
  i cant speak for the masses but my friends parents believe he is christlike in his demeanor and agenda not sure how it will execute though go lurk in the habesha community
  awet nhafash hawey
  xo
its very obvious its a geopolitical issue because the ethiopians want a coastline and ports
  basically this eritrea can be independent but theyll always be an ethiopian satellite
isaias is the emperor
    yea but im talking about the core argument aside from obvious logistical interests we were never one in the post colonial sense
  he might be an ethiopian informant still just like how he started
  its a similar pattern in other nations they want to consolidate the map for one reason or another and they will use collectivization victimization or both to justify it  oh we all suffered colonized oppression under these colonizers therefore it makes sense we band together  another example is japans coprosperity sphere which while in some part did lead to independence for the nations involved was essentially a japandominated empire with a oh we must fight to drive the european dogs out label attached while neglecting the part where japan literally copied the europeans and in reality they wanted access to more resources in sea  likewise ethiopia wants a coast and they will make arguments about colonialism to achieve it and theyve likely made these arguments for so long that they believe in them as tends to happen
  eritra looks like rasputins penis
  eritrea and ethiopia were never one unified region    t benito tano pachinii
  
  i think the closeness of the tigray and amhara peoples is comparable to those of upper and lower germans however as things have worked out so far i doubt thered ever be an ethnic awakening between the two
why would a hypothetical population devoid of procreation have morals it seems that all morality stems from the prospect of procreation and the family structure
quite the opposite having children makes it so it starts to make sense to fight and die for them if you dont have children you dont have any reason to sacrifice yourself
  empathy
  having children makes it so it starts to make sense to fight and die for them  how are these actions not deeply entwined with morality why would not procreating necessitate moralitywhat youre implying by saying its the opposite
  why would less empathic people follow the rules of those with different emotive states if they cant fulfill a natural desire by doing soonly placating it with masturbation or casual sex     without god the propagation of genes is the last piece of objective morality people have and god only exists because we needed to strengthen our faith in procreation as well as better facilitate procreation
in a group devoid of reproduction one can have morals but theyre of a different sort one good comparison to make is the difference between jehovahs witness and other fundamentalist religious groups such as the orthodox jews and the amish    historically jehovahs witness have been against their members reproducing as they were certain the end of times were near their morality was less family orientated and emphasized the coming death demanding a purification and renunciation of material desires before the coming end but even without reproduction the group expanded by missionary work bringing in new families to replace the dying ones procreation was limited but the group still expanded and prospered by acting as a spreading parasite finding new hosts to leech off gnostic christianity often acted like this as does many parts of hinduism and buddhism    the amish orthodox jews and other traditional societies are less hierarchical and dominant than the barren jehovahs witnesses and other doomsday religions the loyalty of the members in these societies is to their close family first and then to the religion at large and the strong family bonds and close ties each man has to his many brothers and sisters aunts uncles etc is unable to be broken by a charismatic leadership and rather the leadership of these religions must in turn service and be wary of the strong loyalties each man has to his extended family     to answer your question op its morality of a different sort people are drawn to a sense of duty and obligation when they have a family structure and perceive a future for themselves and family but when people are old and they have no family and they see the coming death they quickly turn to utter fanaticism in the face of death renouncing all
  procreation doesnt need rational reasons or logic to make it a grand basis of morality for most people and society at large were hardwired to think so arguing against this wont ever change that fact    if people stopped valuing procreation then it stands to reason that all morality would be gone taking care of your kid is important because thats your genes and thats objectively correct in our minds taking care of other people or other kids is only subjectively correct and done only if it helps us breed or helps our children breed how could a society devoid of this sense of objective morality ever have strong morals at all the little time it has will be utter chaos
 here  and done only if it helps us breed or helps our children breed  i should say its done only for people who only have this sense of objective morality guiding them if it helps us breed of helps our children breed though you could argue that subjective morality would still prevail i would argue that theres little evidence for that people are only taught subjective morals because of their unique family structure and the family structures of those around them thats something thats extremely flimsy and varies from person to person too much to ever have agreed upon definitions of right and wrong
  presumably because they dont want blowback someone who doesnt want kids presumably wants more time for themselves and presumably most of those dont want to spend that me time in jail dead or otherwise unable to use that time the fear of consequences is a powerful thing
  theres not much good a person who just wants to avoid blowback will do compared to someone who wants to make the environment and community best for their offspring or to ensure that they will have offspring
what is with all these nonsequitor posts lately
  human beings are generally wired to feel compassion for other human beings and avoid harming each other unless driven by survival instinct or conditioning
  without god the propagation of genes is the last piece of objective morality people have  no not being a piece of shit is the source of objective morality
  k a n t   a  n  t    muh categorical imperative
  kant when you cant make an argument
  meant to be to 
  youve still got morality derived from the social contract    you know the basic idea that people individually dont want to be murdered or robbed so they collectively agree to refrain from those actions in exchange for a reciprocal promise on the part of others
why do commiehaters create so many false documents and false data to back their claims  to name a few examples sissons documents and black book of gommunisms killcount    on the contrary ive never seen soviets and other prosoviets backing their position with fakes
  human rights watch and other scholarly sources are lies  lmao   the black book is bs though
/pol/ and stormfront constantly resort to lying in order to make their totally not failed ideologies look better while simultaneously screaming about jewish lies
  human rights watch and other scholarly sources are lies  that wasnt said in the oppost im just concerned with use of false accusations and fake data
  but its not just stormfags its opinion journalists moderate rightwingers from prageru even some academics may fall for it
  im just saying that not all documents about communisms deaths are faked such as

  i always have fun wondering how hard of a time they had to draw something for romania
this is simon abneyhastings 15th earl of loudoun /his/ a british aristocrat currently living in australia    he is not the rightful king of england as some yrkish scum claims but he is in fact the rightful king of castille and thus of spain    say something nice about him
death to royals  long live the republic
royalty who pretend to be average joes by dressing in tshirts jeans etc like slobs are fucking disgusting  they all deserve the guillotine or worse
  all royals need to be sent to the guillotine because they are cosmopolitans who lack national character
    kek yeah like your merchant ruling class would be any better
  i agree with this
  imagine having this bolsheviks literally did nothing wrong in destroying the romanovs because they had grman blood in their veins
  her progeny will never come near the throne
  they still have grman blood
  royal german blood its not the same thing the royal houses of europe are above the average pleb
  loudoun  hey thats my last name   i guess some of his relatives were our lords back in the day
    he litterally is an average joe though
    harry  royal blood    lol no
well congratulations you got yourself reelected so whats the next step of your master plan  crashing this world with no survivors
  he wasnt evil he was a naive moron who got used by the jews on banking by the british and french the czeck nationalists turks commies chinks romanians serbs poles at versailles while fucking up everything
  most based president of usa ever i have no idea why /his/ hates him so much
  cause he wasnt adamant enough about what he wanted to do he got rolled over at the treaty of versailles and kowtowed to congress on the point of not joining the league of nations instead of pushing for it by trying to win the american public over to his side
be isolationist  be remembered for turning america into an interventionist power    be niggerhater even by the standards of the day  be remembered as a progressive icon and loved by the left today    be first southern president in 50 years  only popular in the north today    be perfectly well aware war was inevitable by nov 1916  lie anyway to win reelection  literally everyone forgives you  he was indeed based
  lists reasons to not like the president  based  anon are you ok
shit was going just fine after the civil war now we can never recover
daily reminder that eugene debs was right
  alt right retards who are ignorant of history hate him because they think hes a jewish banker who started ww1 and created the new world order with the illuminati they hate him for supposedly being a war monger while they also think war is good and natural btw
  i dont see any of those retards here
    lets run the list of why he is disliked  1 created a police state   thugs beat and kidnapped americans that they suspected didnt volunteer for the draft they were approved by wilson   2 arrested political opponents with no trial  3 insisted on sending green horns soldiers to fight veterans by themselves   4 wouldnt listen to medical advisors about stopping the draft so the influenza doesnt spread   5 completely suppressed the news and made it his propaganda tool   6 refused to send any help to african areas were whites were killing them and when blacks got the upper hand in one of them he send the military to crush the blacks   7 refused to consider the probability of war so when war happened the us had only greenhorns for soldiers who didnt even want it then he insisted that those soldiers fight veteran germans by themselves  8 fucked the peace talks in versailles and ruined europe with his democracy autism   9 fucked south america because they didnt the right men   10 pushed japan against the west   11 pushed the innocent south narrative making southerners start shit up again   12 wouldnt comprise with anything destroying any chance for peace after ww1   13 made segregation go full swing  14 nearly got the us invaded if it wasnt for the british spying on america then who knows what would have happened   i can keep going wilson was utter shit and any one who likes him is lying to himself or is ignorant about that pompous asshole
  11 pushed the innocent south narrative making southerners start shit up again   i have no idea how wilson can rationalize this when hes basically just an even more corrupt and awful version of abraham lincoln
be nguyen sinh cung  live in a french oppressed colony and trying to be free  hear some big american guy wilson talk about selfdetermination  oh shit lets petition him for our selfdetermination  completely gets ghosted  wtf thats it fk aerican well show them  become ho chi minh
  14 nearly got the us invaded if it wasnt for the british spying on america then who knows what would have happened  im not interested or informed enough to go over the rest of your list but there was absolutely zero way mexico was ever going to attempt to invade the united states not even in the most outlandish alt history scenario
  yeah his current reputation among the mainstream is at least bizarre/contradictory to his actions if nothing else thats what happens when you make an intellectual lifelong professor who got a lucky break running for governor 2 years and then another lucky break when teddy sabotaged taft a world leader
   japan and germany would have been the invaders mexico would have been their base of operations the kaiser already had plans drawn up years before but was abandoned because of supply lines issues and his advisors talked him out of it   if mexico and japan agreed ca would have got invaded
  kaiser already had plans drawn up years before but was abandoned because of supply lines issues and his advisors talked him out of it    source this is one of the most outlandish claims on willy ive ever heard
  japan was with the entente in ww1 so im not sure what youre going with that germany was under a blockade they had zero way to actually get there and mexico was a mess at the time
  source this is one of the most outlandish claims on willy ive ever heard  sure    this was plan 2 there were 3 in total  n march 1899 when it was clear that the us was about to take control of the hopedfor caribbean bases of puerto rico and cuba the kaiser ordered the invasion plans redrawn by von mantey2 rather than the reduction of important shipyards the new plan involved a twopronged land invasion of new york city and boston some 60 warships and a massive train of 40 to 60 cargo and troopships carrying 75000 short tons 68000 t of coal 100000 soldiers and a large amount of army artillery would cross the atlantic in 25 days following a major naval battle to obtain superiority over american surface vessels german troops were to be landed at cape cod and armed with artillery the ground units were to advance upon boston and fire into the city the allimportant attack on new york required high speed for success it would begin with a troop landing on the peninsula of sandy hook new jersey while warships worked to reduce the harbor fortifications especially fort hamilton and fort tompkins next the warships would advance to shell manhattan and other areas of new york hopefully causing american civilians to panic2
  germany was willing to pay to have them switch sides japan wanted some us controlled areas and attacking the us would have gave them more than attacking germany japan and the us disliked each other for a while even hitler saw how the 2 were going to butt heads in the future   as for germany they planned on ending the war with britain within months once japan turned and the attacked the french lines to force peace from high positions when the americans joined in they rushed their offensive and screwed up their plans read the zimmerman telegraphby tuchman to see germanys plan on dealing with the us
  germanys first plan was to attack naval power on the us east coast and thus gain a free hand to establish a german naval base in the caribbean and to negotiate for another in the pacific naval lieutenant eberhard von mantey later admiral and a naval historian was assigned the task of drawing up the plans mantey then 28 years old began the work in late 1897 working through the winter into 1898 the secret plans were referred to as manteys winter correspondence6 with support from the kaiser tirpitz formed a plan to create a navy worthy of germanys imperial ambitions called the tirpitz plan the kaiser directed a series of naval expansions collectively called the german naval laws to bring his goal closer to fruition7 the imperial german navy had already started building powerful new battleships such as the kaiser friedrich iii class which was to be completed by 19028
  the first german invasion plan of the us called for a great german fleet to sail across the atlantic ocean and to engage and defeat the us navys atlantic fleet in a major battle german naval artillery attacks would then be directed on the established norfolk naval shipyard the expanding newport news shipbuilding center and all other naval strength in the hampton roads area of virginia9 von mantey called this area the most sensitive point of american defenses the reduction of which would force the us to negotiate10 another attack was to be aimed at the prominent portsmouth naval shipyard at the junction of the states of maine and new hampshire the new york harbor facilities von mantey thought were too much reinforced by fortifications holding powerful antiship guns to be considered a prime target2 once americas most important naval shipyards were reduced the german naval task forces were to remain in commanding blockade positions while a german negotiating team met with american government officials to wring from them whatever demands were determined appropriate by the kaiser11  the kaiser found funding to be difficult for the expensive ships he wished for and plans were delayed or shelved for the longrange armored cruisers necessary for supporting the fleet in a major engagement8 meanwhile the spanishamerican war broke out in 1898 with the us in action in the caribbean and the pacific
        cont of plan 2  in december 1900 the kaiser decided that plan ii would best be carried out from a base on cuba rather than sailing from germany this surprising development was alarming to his own general staff as such a base would first need to be taken by force admiral otto von diederichs reported to the kaiser that the german navy was now stronger than the us navy so it was up to the army to solve the problem of the land strategy general alfred von schlieffen was doubtful of the whole venture he reported to the kaiser that 100000 troops would probably be enough to take boston but that many more would be required to take new york a city of three million2 von diederichs thought that von schlieffen was being very clever with the kaiser offering a seemingly positive answer that was impossible to carry out as there was not even enough german shipping to carry 100000 troops and their equipment2
  germany was willing to pay to have them switch sides  pay them with what germany by this point late 1916 had few financial resources really nothing to offer japan  and attacking the us would have gave them more than attacking germany  didnt they get a few german colonies in the far east its not like japan couldve taken the philippines at the time  as for germany they planned on ending the war with britain within months once japan turned and the attacked the french lines  what japan had zero way of attacking france  by tuchman to see germanys plan on dealing with the us  im not asserting that germany didnt plan for an invasion of the us im asserting that it had zero chance of success and was never seriously considered
  by the jews  the fucking aldrich and rockefeller families along with the morgans and countless other elite white families who outnumbered the warburgs and schiffs supported the fed as ardently as paul warburg did you massive midwit     they think he personally caused the economy to crash in the following decade sold us to the jews created ebil taxation of based entrepreneurs income and single handedly destroyed the kaiser reich its gay and you should be ashamed of posting on the same board as them
  1 pay them with promises same way they got other allies you side with us and we help you take those places   2 japan had its eyes on bigger prizes again that is all what if but wilson was letting it happen under his nose  3 i screwed up and forgot to add y after the the i meant after germany attacked the french lines my point was after japan turned to the central powers and germany made gains in france they could have made peace from a strong position which was their plan at this point   4 whether it had zero chance or 100 chance is not the issue here the point i made is he nearly allowed the us to be invaded we cant say what would have happened because that is a what if
ah foockinait kafflicks    opinions on henry viii and subsequently his effects on england today
i lold
  anglicanism is just catholicism with divorce though
ate catholics  ate austrians  ate spics  ate frogs  ate chins  ate me wives    love me kids  love me armors  love pints  simple as
  you rang
  based as fuck redpilled as fuck chad as fuck
  one anon here mentioned that anglicanism kept every part of catholicism in a theological sense as well as anglican rites being similar to latin rites and that the church effectively struck a centrist position against the protestants of europe
  then why do the majority of churches have frescos painted over
  except henry literally crushed the norf as a viable political base for centuries pilgrimage of grace was a huge curb stomp to norfern interests
  the norf meme needs to die mispronouncing th as f is a soufeast thing not a north thing
gotta eat big to get big
  ah didnt know that so when people say da norf is it from the southern perspective or is it a misunderstanding as you say
  its possible it was originally from a southern perspective but its def been misunderstood by many as being northern although the plague of mispronunciation has spread throughout the whole country now  in the north youd see the mispronunciation most likely around hull iirc
  nawthern berds
  mispronunciation of traditional accents you mean
  basically build the royal navy  get remember for being a fat fuck who wanted a divorce      thats what makes it good
  anglicanism had some of the strictest divorce laws until the 1950s brainlet
  das roight enry you tell em go on your maj
  post hadrians wall meme
  more wives your grace
  great lovers of themselves  think there are no other men but themselves  no other world but england  i think we found the ancestors of the first americans
  fat fuck
  are you retarded
  how am i retarded
  this is so funny because it really is an accurate depiction of northerners    t southerner
cobbetts history of the protestant reformation is essentially correct
        i love this shit lol
  oi be a lad and fetch me anotha wife from da fridge
  imagine posting this and thinking you sound smart
  based mlord
  i think we found the ancestors of the first americans  if you talking about the first us americans then why did it take you this long anon
    thats the reason why its incompatible with the bible or what historical christians believed anglicans didnt even know what to believe its literally just a religion for the king of england
    blocks your wrestling skills
  a wise and noble sovereign trying to save the english from papist slavery
  damn  big if true
  woahwhat if    nah couldnt be
  theres really no proof though only anecdotal stuff  we may never know where americans came from
  is this true surely there is some doctrine or something that makes it more legitimate theres no fucking way that all the conflict in ireland and the likes is because england wanted them to join such a nonreligion
  shit  theyre onto us
  oh fug hes on to us shuddid down ddd
  nah its literally just  fuck the pope the king is the pope
  puffa  that german not knowing what to do with a pasty  these are brill
  t /his/ theologian
  failed crossdresser  shiggy diggy  successful crossdresser  check it out anglo servants im made of gold  absolute unit  i dont give a fuck no mo
  the irish conflict has more to do with scottish presbyterian colonists nowadays anglicans actually assimilated into irish society somewhatish
  damn i guess the fact that they both speak english is related too
why didnt he just legitimise henry fitzroy
  legitimizing bastards  what next universal suffrage
  this may change everything  fuck
  cuz he died
the ruling class of ancient civilizations were indoeuropean and northern europeans have the most ie dna  does this prove nordicism that northern euros ruled rome and greece
we
  no argument
  no there is no trace of haplogroup q in italy or greece
we
  so    literally no argument the ie were a distinct ruling class see brahmins in india and northern euros have the most ie  phenotype descriptions dont change this fact
  we
we
    lmao at your desperate denial of science
  you mean the science that shows bronze age greeks had less steppe admixture than modern greeks
wir
  we
/pol/tard gets butthurt that people only reply to his thread with ironic /pol/shitposting  we
  weird how this haplogroup map shows up more in southern sicily i assume the answer is normans than in much more heavily normanized southern italy malta or even normandy itself    what does this mean can anyone interpret this for me in a way that reconciles this
  except this shows that finns and even sami are more indoeuropean than swedes or norwegians the reason for this being siberian ancestry yamna were only slightly mixed with farmers so people with a similar amount of farmer admixture will be more closely related to them thats why uralic populations are generally closer to yamna than others
  orja cope
  ruling class        so mad that nordics ruled ancient civilizations     anomaly germanics have high ie
  ruling class  yes ruling class bronze age greek samples also had less steppe admixture than modern greeks
  prove it
  no just google mycenaean autosomal dna study or something
  no  prove it yourself
go on keep ignoring what you dont like to hear
  turks are more ie than greeks  huh
    no but it suggests that the region had environmental factors that selected those markers in a higher frequency
  exactly so they are more ie  the mycenaean elite were also ie
  werren
  köninge und scheise
  we
  advanced ancient uraloeuropean khanz taught these primitive yamnaya niggers how to bathe and build libraries
bump
bump
we
  no because for the time greece and rome empires begin were already mixed to be what they are now
  mixed  ie forbid miscegenation look at the brahmins in india
  indo european mixed with the local from the first moment they arrive to the heart of europe
  you wish if they didnt mix in india they probably didnt anywhere else
  theres genetic evidence of steppe and farmer populations intermingling in corded ware
  there wasnt much to mingle with as it was unpopulated  also source
  what the fuck are you talking about central europe was very much populated  source any genetic study about corded ware
  what about germanic europe
we
  yes fucking retard mycenians the first indo european civilitation in our continent elite people has the same amounr of steppe as the rest of the people and in same case even less
we
  scythians are mixed with east asians   sintashta with elamites  in europe with western hunter and farmer  indo european were the biggest race mixers of history even the inception start race mixing with iranian farmers
  not iranian farmers chg in the mesolithic
  probably even earlier than that and probably not even with chg   chg is from georgia i doubt pure chg ever existed in north caucasus
  they mixed in india even the brahmins indians dont cluster with east europeans or any europeans for that matter
nordicism is unironically true
we
wtf i hate scotland and ulster now
  prove it
  fuck this is painfully deluded  the only place where this racial apartheid you described happened was in india  there is no proof that it hallened elsewhere but there is proof to the contrary first of all ancient writers wouldve noticed if all peasants were swarthy but somehow all nobles were 68 blonde nords and secondly dna evidence proves otherwise

ethically spanking what is the worthiest of all charitable causes
30k is affordable to the middle class  heh not in the usa where 99 of the middle class live pay check to pay check what aloof person made this meme 
  what would make a charity worthy
  the same type of person that admits hes getting fucked in the ass by virgins yet still claimed to be a chad
  usa doesnt have a middle class
  just take a loan communist cuck
ethically speaking the good charity one can give is to those that are better than themselves im not talking just money the greatest among us must be furnished with all that we can offer our work our loyalty our blood and our children they are truly our only hope for tomorrow

  i wouldnt expect an autistic to be familiar with the virtue of charity

  what do you even have in common with a you that has had 100 years of experiences you have not the next 20 years mean a lot more to me than the next 40 after those
  aging is disease right
  she was just exploiting the system she despised its like murdering a murder
the ethiops say that their gods are flatnosed and black  while the thracians say that theirs have blue eyes and red hair  yet if cattle or horses or lions had hands and could draw  and could sculpt like men then the horses would draw their gods  like horses and cattle like cattle and each they would shape  bodies of gods in the likeness each kind of their own     xenophanes    were original ethiopians flat nosed and black and why do thracians sound irish
the greeks called all blacks ethiopianscharred face people so nubians in this context    thracians were indo europeans who commonly had red hair it was common for all celtic peoples and among italic peoples as well
  so the originally the word ethiopians is a greek word used for all blacks so its not the modern day ethiopian of today    they had red hair and blue eyes the thracians
  fairly sure only a minority of irish have red hair yet its extremely characteristic of irishness the same goes for thracians they probably didnt have many redheads just more than the greeks did
  were they tan and red haired with blue eyes cuz ive never seen that before
    they described the thracians as having red hair but the word refered largely to tones of blonde its a known mistranslation as tacitus in germania for instance also describes the germans as being all redhaired    they didnt have classifications based on red hair blonde or black hair but different tones
  black ethiopians are an ancient civilization  light eyed and light haired thracians are unwashed barbarians  what does /pol/ make of this
  can someone please answer this question fuck
  there werent all that many blacks in contact with the greeks who werent also ethiopians so i think it just meant both from the start

hey /his/ i dont post a lot but id like your opinion on something as we all know bears are nigh unkillable bulletbroof living tanks some friends and i have been debating the ramifications of a world where instead of domesticating wolves people domesticated bears    weve been looking at it over time but lets start in ancient times and go forward from there would ancient bear infantry be useful in warfare or would it be outclassed by archers on horseback or chariot anyway would it be cost ineffective from how much it takes to feed a bear     a discussion of this would be appreciated as well as the effects of domesticated bears into later societies thanks a lot /his/
hmm
bears arent really good for anything humans need they could pull stuff but other animals are better suited for that anyway
  bears used as heavy shock cav would be cool but theyd already have to be really close otherwise i dont think it would work
  bears eat too much to be of use in a common household   bears as shock cavalry  horses are more resilient cheaper and less dangerous to their handlers  id rather have 5 horsemen than 1 bear rider also the bear body isnt made for riding  you can find fodder for horses on the road you can have mares for milk and young colts to replace your wounded horses
if we had a tribe of humans wrestle baby bears every generation and then the next generation slightly bigger bears are introduced for men to wrestle and keep repeating until a fullgrown bear would humans eventually evolve to become superhuman
    we are going on a bear market or is it just some stupid ass nsa shit 
  if women only mated with the males that won
  which they always did anyway
the south african republic aka the transvaal was the best country in history and english should suffer to this day for ruining it  japanese imperialism was mostly fine and taiwan and korea definitely deserved it but things did get iffy in manchuria  the irish contributed more to humanity than the english  the united states of america was lost after shays rebellion and the whiskey rebellion and thomas jefferson and thomas paine were the only founding fathers who actually held to their ideals  the mexicanamerican war was mutually beneficial  ideologies are not always right or wrong in any given conflict and all are capable of evil and good actions and motives
  half of these statements are unpopular because they are plain wrong
  nice argument bro
  japanese imperialism was mostly fine  anime pictures  youre an npc bro
  nice /pol/ meme bro  remember to lurk 2 years before posting
  im serious you are one of the braindead morons who can only think in internet memes and cliches dont call me a fucking /pol/ meme when youre posting about transvaal
  transvaal wasnt /pol/ at all as there were virtually no native peoples in the land the dutch colonized  rhodesia was /pol/    taiwanese aborigines benefited from japanese annexation as did korean savages they were taught to read and write and given medical care when their only culture prior was tattoo themselves for every person they decapitate  anime being great escapism and the japanese being right to colonize taiwan are unrelated but i suppose youre just really simple minded and lump things together you need to broaden your views bro
dumb weeb
  not into the anime stuff  the irish contributed more to humanity than the english  yes

  great man history is sometimes true  the british empire was one of the most pathetic empires in history not even remotely comparable to rome or the ottomans  austriahungary could have survived if they didnt lose the war  western civilization basically just got lucky its not inherently superior to others  sparta is overrated as a military power  civilization as we know it is still just an experiment on an evolutionaty scale its possible it will eventually fail due to the inevetable environmental collapse and humans will go back to living in primitive tribal communities
  the nuclear weapons use on japan is entirely justified by preventing the lives that would have been lost in operation downfall  dresden is okay too   colonialism wasnt worth the economic cost to the countries who practiced it  the united states winning the cold war is one of the better outcomes   the european union is politically meant to be a long term alliance between france and germany everyone else is just along for the ride   a united europe would actually be okay   moral development is proportional to technological development   the british empire was vastly superior to any other colonial empire established at the time and the most successful of its era the fact that exbritish colonies are the most successful in every sense of the word is a clear indication of this   ottomans are shit byzies are shit too but more fun to meme about
  the south african republic aka the transvaal was the best country in history and english should suffer to this day for ruining it  unpopular opinions   the only reason you fags even care about south africa is because they were le baste racists against the local niggery americans only seem to squeal and get obsessed with foreign cultures when they involve racial segregation
  the irish contributed more to humanity than the english  irish american hands wrote this   by irish do you mean anglo irish aristocracy scottish colonists or the catholic peasantry americans rarely know the difference
   united europe would actually be okay  becomes yugoslav esque chaos after their first economic recession hits
  theyll get there eventually
irish americans
stalin was not a great guy
  irish contributed more to humanity than the english  1 word refutation newton i dont even need to mention anybody else
  the french and germans are the only ones who can actually claim to surpass the english ireland isnt even in the same tier as sweden or poland

the holocaust did happen just 6 million jews didnt die at most 1 or 2 million  the angloirish treaty itself was tool the antitreaty only wasted resources and good men by rebelling   sean macdiarmda was the hottest out of the leaders of the 1916 rising no homo  image related

rome never fell at least not in the way normies assume it did the roman state lasted until the fall of constantinople and in the west the roman empire survived in other ways mostly connected to the roman catholic church and roman law throughout the middle ages and even arguably to the present   roman catholicism is true religio romana the reason emperor justinian failed to codify paganism was because a codified spirituality unifying the many aspects of mediterranean religiosity had already been revealed and it was christianity   institutional religion isnt antiscience  the holy roman empire was holy roman and an empire   peak german culture was the middle ages   the entire colonial period needs to be revisited without the antieuropean and antiimperial biases which were rampant in the midlate 20th century   americanism has glaring flaws that americans dont want to admit because they are so invested in it   whenever there are technological advancements something is always gained and always lost thus neither ludditism or technophilia is accurate   lived experiences are more valuable than statistics  epistemology is important   subtle nordicism still exist in the mainstream   a central powers victory in wwi would have been preferable   communism is bad on paper but good in practice   collectivism in the duginist sense is superior to individualism  the things people derive the most joy from are independent from material wellbeing  islam is a good religion but still is an asiatic rival to europe which should be opposed   slavery is neither good or bad only abuse of people under slavery is bad whether slavery inherently lends itself to masters abusing slaves can then be debated but atm i tend to think it doesnt   there is no shame to being a slave or servent but american ethos has made people think its shameful which is the origin of most hostility towards slavery people have
  1 i know nothing about transvaal  2 korea deserved it seems highly suspect  3 agree   4 usa was lost when they decided to base a country off of enlightenment ideology   5 agree   6 agree     1 agree  2 kinda agree but same would apply to dutch scandies and germans they were more interested in money making than empirebuilding   3 agree   4 disagree that western success was based on luck however i agree that its not inherently superior   5 i know little about sparta but to my knowledge it was their warriorethos based society which gave them their reputation not their power   6 disagree imo civilization always existed and cant not exist just like culture     1 probably but the bomb drops were still travesties   2 dresden is a travesty  3 maybe but colonialism had other benefits   4 disagree ussr victory would have been better   5 agree thats what eu was suppose to be but not what it is  6 disagree blocization of europe is better than one giant europe   7 disagree   8 disagree   9 disagree ottomans were evil in europe though
  tfw you will never be a zealous boer roaming the beautiful landscapes of south africa with your enormous hoard of cattle basically being a cooler cowboy   tfw you will never live an easy puritan lifestyle and fight the british like individuals    the boers were the best
            complaining about anime on an anime website  can i get a big yikes
  scottish colonists and catholic peasantry      the antitreaty only wasted resources and good men by rebelling   is this really an unpopular opinion  i figured it was commonly accepted that chimping out and killing fellow irishmen over a treaty de valera originally accepted was a waste by all but the tankiest tankies      fucking this  boers were the true cowboys

  austrian archduke dresses up in his most regal military garb and totes around his beautiful wife in an area with violent secessionists not happy with austrian rule and only the man driving your vehicle as protection  have a bomb thrown under your vehicle that fails to detonate and instead of going home continue the pompous parade until justifiably shot  suicide by serb
  why do you post giantess pictures on /his/
  transvaal wasnt /pol/ at all as there were virtually no native peoples in the land the dutch colonized  the establishment of the south african republic had its origins in 1837 when the commandos of potgieter and piet uys defeated a matabele raiding party of moselekatse and drove them back over the limpopo river potgieter declared the lands north and south of the vaal river as boer lands  why do faggots think the entirely of south africa was some unpopulated wasteland the boers built a fucking memorial to btfoing the coons during the creation of the boer republics
  there wasnt really any fitting image for the topic and giantesses are cute
   communism has actually truly never been achieved

  scottish colonists  soooooo not the irish good thread op
  thanks be sure to upvote
  then go to leddit nigger
  the thing with the civil war is that it seems stupid now with the knowledge that ireland did eventually peacefully detach itself from the british commonwealth but from the perspective of 1922 it would have seemed to many that they had thrown away their greatest chance of full independence and that ireland might remain a dominion
  posts pic explaining how 4chan isnt an anime website  hurrrrr go beck to redut niggahz  embarrassing

the dark ages are a thing    with the exception of the dark ages period and before when non mediterranean europe were savages western civilization has mostly been the cutting edge of humanity nonwestern civilizations are gassed up out of insecurity china was not superior to western europe in the 1400s    ancient middle eastern civilizations like egyptians were white or close enough to it for discomfort    environmental determinism is the one true thesis    maybe not unpopular on certain places of 4chan but in real life  there is something seriously strange/suspicious about jews the mainstream story of diaspora to today doesnt check out i dont know if the khazar hypothesis is right but something is off about narrative of premedieval jewery    much of antisemitism was not exclusively mindless hatred but resentment brought on by antisocial behavior of jewish communities
  with the exception of the dark ages period and before when non mediterranean europe were savages western civilization has mostly been the cutting edge of humanity nonwestern civilizations are gassed up out of insecurity china was not superior to western europe in the 1400s  except for when western civilization wasnt at the cutting edge of humanity western civilization has always been at the cutting edge of humanity  we have found a genius
  unironically using an image making fun of retarded leddit normalfags and how they think 4chan isnt an anime website  y  i  k  e  s
  why do anime fags always say this do they actually think this is correct
  people like to claim the china india or islamic golden age blew europe out of the water before 1800s and it just isnt true is what im saying    and since i believe in a dark ages and that western civilization essentially slowly transferred from rome to germany and etc 500 ad  900 ad you can say the tang or rashidun were better for a period but only because a massive apocalyptic disaster was happening its a case of the leader of the race stumbling
  caesar shouldnt have crossed the rubicon  the crusades were good in theory  trotsky shouldve leader of the ussr so people could have true fear of communism   hitler could have objectively won the war with allied support  the soviets destroyed eastern europe but saved it from the wests liberalism  the red army were rapists not liberators
  what the fuck is up with that anatomy her ankle is thicker than her torso
  glorified cheerleader
  im pretty sure that was brazil
  so youre saying hitler would win if he had the support of all the people he was fighting call the newspapers

was holocaust denial mainly a postwar era trend or were there much reports of people vehemently denying the german genocides at the time if it was post war when did it start to become popular     image is a still from  4419
  were people generally aware of the scope during the war
  be german  get told the holocaust happened  say nuh uh that didnt happen  get executed   hmmm
public knowledge of the holocast didnt become a thing until very late in the war but once people started to learn about it the nazi propaganda wing began disputing it immediately
    you know who didnt deny the holocaust the nazis at nuremberg
  thats because they were jews and needed it to establish israel
  why is the truth so persistent   i dont know anonhuge mystery
    the nazis were going to war for jews the whole time    please die
  claims to ride bicycles around alleged gassing rooms  those alleged gassing rooms werent even sealed  the court accepted that joke as evidence  without actual evidence or even context  calling that a trial  son got jokes
  never happened
  why would you need to see a room that you pump poison into anon you do know the difference between inert gas asphyxiation and death by zyklon b right
  seal
  no evidence was presented at nuremberg  youre not even trying at this point
  just making shit up  dont know how you can get upset about the holocaust allegedly being made up when you do the exact same shit

welp great thread
human life is priceless and should be preserved at all costs
youre so cool and edgy
  only intelligent advanced matter molding organism on the planet  hurr they arent valuable i swear
  give me a single reason why intelligence is objectively valuable
  its rare dumbass
  teratogenesis is also rare does that make it inherently valuable as well
  7 billion  rare  the majority of which are room temperature iq subhumans who will achieve nothing but further polluting the planet
great job admitting that you believe in fascism or communism this belief is literally how we got millions killed in the 20th century
  so we can agree that your life is less than the rest of this boards then
human life is worthless and should be destroyed at all costs
  physicalist calling me a brainlet
  give me a single reason why you should so highly valuate objectivity
violence is never the answer    i bet a jew came up with that to subvert others
  becoming a superpower 2020 via the development of an alternative natural organic fuel thatll power their industrial revolution to space
  if an extremely lethal plague is rare should we keep it around or even fester it
  because objectivity is how you ascertain the truth something most people here dont seem to care about but if you ever give a shit about something in your life you will discover how useful it is also how difficult it is you will feel like casting your deepest spooks to the wind just to clear space in your head
  its a prerequisite for the only thing which is unequivocally good 
  valuing truth as an end in itself and not a means to attain aesthetic appreciation and affirmation of life  not an ubermensch
  valuing truth
valuing value    this is how i know youre retarded
  if you dont value the value of valuing nothing youre a retard
  truth is inherently valuable    explain
  i agree lets start by eliminating you
  yeah except niggers
human life as a whole is priceless but individual ones arent there are many people who are counterproductive to the continued existence of humanity just by virtue of their own existence their lives present an unacceptable risk to the species chances of securing itself against planetscale extinction     then again my desire for humanitys longterm survival is entirely out of self interest but hey
  and if i gave a quote by a prominent thinker of jewish origin stating the exact opposite what are the odds of you denouncing them as a socipath
use reason to determine your actions  the only justification you have for trusting reason is that this appears reasonable  this is circular logic and reason cannot be verified by some outside source  reason is therefore selfjustifying and selfcontradicting at the same time    why havent you reasonfags killed yourself i personally live my life by impulse and emotion indulging in rational inquiries only when i find it entertaining or i place some arbitrary faith in it without caring whether i should or not
  hes a sociopath but hes honest which would be really hard for a jew to do
  violence is never the answer is subversion  violence is the answer is sociopathy  im getting tired of your pathological obsession with jews which are simultaneously everywhere and nowhere are inferior and master manipulators infiltrators and selfsegregators /pol/

has china always had a sub par military
  how many states drove the american military out of a land the size of north korea and permanently kept america out of it are you mentally handicapped which not subpar asian military can accomplish it malaysia
  vietnam
  only since the qing dynasty
  chinese forces outnumbered us and un forces and still suffered like triple the casualties
  on another note other countries have been raped by dozens of different colonial powers malaysia was conquered by portuguese dutch british indonesia by portuguese dutch spanish british portuguese left bastard children born to malay women called kristangs and holy shit we dont see obsessive threads on how these countries militaries suck and how they are weak britain colonized the entire gulf arab states egypt iraq india
  americans always refuse to count south korean casualties with the un america also had technology advantage
  portuguese and dutch left indo mixed race children in indonesia britain screwed over half the world america invaded and bullied over half the world
  everyone talks about how arab countries usually have shitty militaries six day war persian gulf war iraq invasion etc
  americans always refuse to count south korean casualties with the un  citation needed
  pretty much human wave attacks can only do so much
  its entire history is getting rape babied by progressive hordes of invaders  you hate china because chines annoy and threaten you not any of the other nations raped continuously by hordes of invaders egypt and iraq have been raped by hordes of foreign invaders for over 2000 years without a single native ruler in between there is no hatred because egypt and iraq do not threaten your country nor drove your countrys army in humiliation down north korea and crushed them you do not hate malaysia and indonesia because they after being colonized are military puppets of the west and accede to your countrys dictates you hate what annoys and is a threat to you and this is why you bitch about china all the time and why these treads appear on 4chan not threats about x country
  still caring about k/d ratios    i bet you unironically believe the usa never lost against vietnam
  no american makes fun of spain for being rape babied by arabs because america crushed spain in cuba and the philippines but america was crushed by china in korea no american makes fun of balkans for ottoman rule because turkey was an american puppet obeyed america in the cold war including korea and america even approved of turkeys invasion and rape of cyprus america is the only nation that turns its defeat in north korea into a victory the amount of whining about china is directly proportional to how much space china occupies rent free in your minds
  chinese have basically every advantage at chosin  still lose more troops
    hate to break it to you but westerners dont even think of china except when some cheap household good made by one of your sweatshop slaves breaks easily and we remind ourselves to buy domestic next time    the only shit you produce is cheap knock offs using stolen ip so its pretty forgettable you know the shit samsung is basically how people know a zte
  china is on the minds of you parasites 24/7                          
when americans briefly thought iraq flew their planes into the world trace center in the attacks the hatred was immense the thought that iraqis killed thousands of americans on american soil enraged them and they wanted to kill and murder once they realized they were lied to iraq was barely on their minds and it became nothing again
  the memory of hunnic rape of the west is still deep in western consciousness after 2000 years        
  hungary germany and beyond were already raped by huns and avars do you need someone to teach you how to read the word hun turks raped hungary later too
  whites got raped and wrecked by huns bulgars avars long before mongols and later by the turks
  hungarians themselves are descendants of nonie steppe nomads who raped europe magyars had muslim turkic volga bulgar tribes like kubars with them when they invaded and raped europe who became böszörmény hungary later accepted turkic pecheneg and turkic cuman kipchak migrants into their country
    germanics ended up defeating the huns and extincting them in europe retard    and dont tell me some bullshit about russians losing to mongols slavs arent true whites    a true born aryan warrior need never fear an asiatic
    hungarians were nonie magyars and had turks with them when they invaded europe        
    sounds like you hate americans get to  you mental case
  /his/ is /int/ with dates didnt you get the memo
  well considering the fact that the chinese have always had a massive advantage against all their opponents in terms of numbers resources and even technology the fact that they have so many losses to disproportionately smaller forces is embarrassing and shameful
   and even technology  china used a mix of bolt action rifles of mauser or mosin nagant provenance semi automatic sks rifles sub machine guns and mortars in the koeran war with the americans all had semi automatic m1 rifles and machine guns  the fact that they have so many losses to disproportionately smaller forces is embarrassing and shameful  china won the sinoindian war with smaller casualties
  my apologies tsing pao i meant prior to modern times
  some of the chinese used captured japanese arisaka rifles the mauser copies mosin nagants and arisakas were all of different calibers and the chinese had to have separate ammunition for all of them chinas own factories were only tooled for making mauser rifles and ammunition while the mosin nagants were from soviet stockpiles
  the turks from central asia were outnumbered by the arabs whom they invaded in the middle east and had inferior technology in nomadic societies every man is a fighter and they train for fighting every day by riding on horseback and hunting farmers dont train by farming
  technological disadvantage   thats called having a subpar military
pretty much
            china defeated the portuguese and dutch in the ming dynasty multiple times and defeated cossacks in the qing dynasty at albazin dutch women got screwed on taiwan china in the tang dynasty defeated the entire western and eastern turkic khaghanates conquering mongolia and central asia in the protectorate general to pacify the north and west centuries before the mongol empire china in the han dynasty defeated the xiongnu and chased them all the way to central asia at the battle of zhizhi the same turks were chased west after the defeat of their khaghante by china and raped whites
  source plz
  thx    now it is a much better proof
  is op always retarded has 4chan always has a bund of shitpsoters
  is belittling china can compensate whitoids sinophobic paranoia is trashtalking against china can stop chinese topple down americans homosexual hegemony has usa always had a genderfluid military
  turkish lira crisis dragged down western markets the economy is global now and you will feel the consequences 1997 crisis crashed almost all of southeast asia
  is american army lost in chosin to a socalled sub par military yes   that sub par military once fucked up entire usun collation army in korea and then helped vietnamese to fucked us army up in vietnam again its some simple fact that easily makes whitoid supremacistsrevisionists seething  and it feels great 
    japanese were mocked all the time in western media with slit eyes and buck teeth smiles            
  why do you live in white countries  no i dont live in white countries you fucking hontytard i just come here to insult you and antichinese shiptosters such as op thats what you want yes and 4chan is owned by a nonwhite btw _
  every advantage at chosin   except armourair covermechanical unitsheavy artillery  yes
  still outnumbered the yanks nearly 5 to 1 and they didnt even know they were at war with china if you cant manage to destroy your enemy in those conditions your army is bad     the fact that the un wasnt expecting a land war with china is the sole factor leading to any chinese success in that conflict
  quantum american coping mechanism  the only advantage pla had was personnel numbers in contrast us/un allied forces had better weapons better equipment more guns more ammo more tanks more air supports more ships more cars more suppliesetc basically advantages of every thing yet they still lost to chinese in chosin this makes honkies butthurt as hell just like the reaction of vietnam war otherwise you wouldnt be endlessly seething/shitposting about it as compensation i lost count how many times i witness such shitposts   btw mere k/d ratio dont dictate the outcomes of war no matter how reluctant you are _      and chinese still won the battle and retook the soils sorry to break bubble 
  china could have had a united prosperous nation on its southern border  instead they have an unstable nuclear state that is more of a hindrance to them than a help    sweet sweet victory eh hope you enjoy those north korean refugees lol
  china won us lost simple sweetie 
  we are not 80 iq bugmen    we are free we were never slaves    breathes in hahahahahahahahahaah
  你看到他是伊拉克人嗎
  half a million chink soldiers died for this    why do chinks have such a low value of their own soldiers
  btw i just rechecked the wikipage of chosin battle in various languages including chinese japanese vietnamese spanish french even koreanetc all clearly address chinaprc won that battle as result only english page doesnt dare to write it down specifically its quite obvious who is trying be evasive here it sure is not chinese 
     warrior need never fear an asiatic    thats why your masterrace slaves away for some small tribe from asia since the birth of rabbi yeshua        meanwhile the jews in the region of cyrene had put one andreas at their head and were destroying both the romans and the greeks they would cook their flesh make belts for themselves of their entrails anoint themselves with their blood and wear their skins for clothing many they sawed in two from the head downwards others they would give to wild beasts and force still others to fight as gladiators in all consequently two hundred and twenty thousand perished in egypt also they performed many similar deeds and in cyprus under the leadership of artemio there likewise two hundred and forty thousand perished for this reason no jew may set foot in that land but even if one of them is driven upon the island by force of the wind he is put to death various persons took part in subduing these jews one being lusius who was sent by trajan
  im glad you think it was worth it lol its nice to see that chinese people look at their fellow countrymen more like ants than actual people
    some centuries later    jewish merchants prospered under charlemagne and even more under louis the pious by supplying the court with wine spices and textiles and they enjoyed wideranging privileges these included the right to be tried only in accordance with their own law to have christian employees and to practice their religion even within the imperial palace 17      proooteeect the jeeeews    t 80 iq masterrace

  yes its worth it it makes honkies butthurt and saves korean peninsula from completely being swallowed up by american imperialists 
  those poor south koreans if only they were more like their friendly northern neighbors right
  those poor south koreans  how about those poor north koreans   
  poor north koreans  indeed
  starves to death
    yeah even in poverty and starving they still insist to resist us imperialists truly shows how despicable us imperialists are 
  the imperialism it hurts    please help these people get to north korea where life is better you didnt finish the job chinaman there are still koreans suffering just look at this pic
  the king listened to this dumb eunuch instead of his generals
  its funny that americans somehow think they can be spared from their own idiocyno you cannot
  even a 6 year old kid who plays total war cant be as dumb   nah you honkies truly show otherwise subvirus meme is real
  greeks  white    lmao
whats wrong with chinks  why are they so insecure
  if chinese forces were so strong why couldnt they take the rest of korea at best it was a draw and north korea is a way bigger hindrance to china today while south korea is a strong us ally one of the most prosperous nations on earth
china is weak china is so weak its laughable
  because they werent strong thats the point the fact that they were able to stop even push back an enemy that had such a ridiculous advantage in literally everything but men is the impressive part
          mental illness on display   hope someone bans you all fuck off back to   
you fucking amerimutts why dont you pick up a map and just look at china east to the pacific ocean south to the malaria ridden dense jungle west the impassible pamir mountains north to the mongolian plateau thats as cold as siberia every arable and hospitable land that was available to the premodern chinese is under chinese control you just dont do that by being weak
  no copious amounts of grey smog covering the entire skyline  these people arent living correctly
tfw sexpat in china  why cant chinese whores resist the bwc

  being this butthurt  lol
make way for the tvrkic bvll
why does american protestantism feel so artificial everything from the architecture to the traditions to the followers feels so shallow and non spiritual i cant completely explain the feeling but when i look at a catholic or orthodox church i can see that there is a cultural and spiritual history when i see a protestant church in america i feel nothing it might as well be a mcdonalds
  cuz you let cucks sell your churches
  because youre not religious and you dont understand how much faith means to those people over shiny golden trinkets
i cannot worship god unless im in a decadent larp fort
    whats wrong with shiny gold trinkets
    op here i kind of agree every other religion has cool designs and stuff american churches are boring its like comparing some amazing minecraft build to a 10125 block box made entirely of wooden blocks
  whats wrong with a religion which professes caring for the poor and modesty filling its halls by luring in dupes with vain shows of wealth
thats because protestantism is heretical
  but when i look at a catholic or orthodox church i can see that there is a cultural and spiritual history   a history of satanism you mean
  god loved shows of wealth in the bible he had moses deck out the tent and ark with lots of gold and then later god had the temple decked out too
obviously thats a subjective feeling but the more evangelical side of protestantism is basically tailored to the individualism that pervades american culture this occurs also in other christianities like catholicism but evangelical protestantism is especially susceptible to this thanks to sola fide and sola scriptura this combined with charismatic speakers led plenty to go join great tent revivals in the 19th century and many to join megachurches in the 20th century and the present these two put on a good show and are charismatic but are largely nontraditional and are either big and tacky for the sake of spectacle see osteen or otherwise focused less on the space of worship but the pastor parson or whoever is giving the sermon this doesnt a pretty church make at least not unless you like the billy graham cross barn
  this gold is for godnot for people
  because most things in america are artificial
  churches like the op image look charming in fact i dislike joel osteen style megachurches though i suppose that most people might consider me evangelical but even i am uncomfortable with the term i just want to be a christian and try to live respectably and answer christs calls for my life above any notion that i should live a selfcentered life aimed at money like osteen and the rest of the prosperity gospel kind advocate whether directly or indirectly
  why does american protestantism feel so artificial   im guessing its because you arent a religious person yourself you cant relate to genuine religious sentiment so you latch on to aesthetics    the entire point of this style of is to remove distraction so that all focus can be on the preaching of the bible there are no fancy things to look at sounds or smells to overstimulate the senses or distract its why even in the orthodox and catholic traditions monastics have extremely simple cells     if you cant appreciate the beauty and the profundity of simple christ focus worship you will forever be unable to appreciate them     it might as well be a mcdonalds  how old are you
  protestantism still contradict the early christians
  which kinds of protestants it depends some such as baptists are very close to what the early christians were like except for some rituals which the greek orthodox church has done a better job of upholding
  its because people do it for the sake of god not for the sake of being good
  baptists close to early christians  pathetic
  since then these things are manifest to us and we have looked into the depths of the divine knowledge we ought to do in order all things which the master commanded us to perform at appointed times he commanded us to celebrate sacrifices and services and that it should not be thoughtlessly or disorderly but at fixed times and hours he has himself fixed by his supreme will the places and persons whom he desires for these celebrations in order that all things may be done piously according to his good pleasure and be acceptable to his will so then those who offer their oblations at the appointed seasons are acceptable and blessed but they follow the laws of the master and do not sin for to the high priest his proper ministrations are allotted and to the priests the proper place has been appointed and on levites their proper services have been imposed the layman is bound by the ordinances for the laity    source st clement bishop of rome 80 ad to the corinthians    our sin will not be small if we eject from the episcopate those who blamelessly and holily have offered its sacrifices    source letter to the corinthians 444    huh funny baptists reject this
st justin martyr was born a pagan but converted to christianity after studying philosophy he was a prolific writer and many church scholars consider him the greatest apologist or defender of the faith from the 2nd century he was beheaded with six of his companions some time between 163 and 167 ad    this food we call the eucharist of which no one is allowed to partake except one who believes that the things we teach are true and has received the washing for forgiveness of sins and for rebirth and who lives as christ handed down to us for we do not receive these things as common bread or common drink but as jesus christ our savior being incarnate by gods word took flesh and blood for our salvation so also we have been taught that the food consecrated by the word of prayer which comes from him from which our flesh and blood are nourished by transformation is the flesh and blood of that incarnate jesus    first apology ch 66 inter ad 148155    moreover as i said before concerning the sacrifices which you at that time offered god speaks through malachias one of the twelve as follows i have no pleasure in you says the lord and i will not accept your sacrifices from your hands for from the rising of the sun until its setting my name has been glorified among the gentiles and in every place incense is offered to my name and a clean offering for great is my name among the gentiles says the lord but you profane it it is of the sacrifices offered to him in every place by us the gentiles that is of the bread of the eucharist and likewise of the cup of the eucharist that he speaks at that time and he says that we glorify his name while you profane it    dialogue with trypho 41 810    totally baptist
americans arent really christian just heretics
  protestantism still contradict the early christians    pretty much all modern christians do as all of the traditions of the past are not followed cause this isnt the fucking 1st century
  now get on the floor and wriggle
  purgatory and marian devotion and papal primacy were hardly part of the earliest teachings my friend
because religion in the us is a business
  it is the result of trying to rationalize faith same can be seen in north european churches when people bend divinity to their will they also stop respecting it
  youve been deceived by icons and idolatry my nigga
  yet fancy things sounds and smells were all part of worship that god directly commanded to moses
  yeah moses    for the jews
  what has that got to do with anything in my post        same question my post was just on the beauty found in simple worship and how none religious people or the young cant easily appreciate that
thats not just an american thing dude churches all over britain look like that     churches have been built like in op pic for 400 years here tho
  the church has no business alleviating the conditions for the poor since it is supposed to save souls if they love the church they will live forever anyway so it doesnt matter obviously you shouldnt let your peasants starve but works of wonder to god are a million times more important than giving coins to feed the belly of the peasant who probably doesnt even understand the doctrine of the church let alone believes it
  what the gay charity has been part of the purview of the christian church since its earliest days
  not for material reasons but to avoid individualism and pride you dont give alms to the poor because muh hunger that is an absolutely retarded materialistic burgeoise even concept of charity this is what made american christianity the ultimate cuck religion     gold and wealth exist for great works for god and country not to be shared with the poor
  the bible tells you to give everything you own to the poor you fucking larper
  this is what sola scriptura does to your brain
  shallow  american history is very short and the us lack a real culture other than guns and racism
  the protestants hate the cross in particular considering it to be a symbol of the evil pagan catholic god as early as about 1300 ad a certain john wycliffe preaching near châlons called for the smashing of crosses and religious images in the sixteenth century thomas hitton made bonfires of broken crosses until finally he himself was burned by an angry mob the protestants consider churches to be heaps of stones and divine services mere pagan rites they reject religious images deny the intercession of the saints and the efficacy of prayer for the departed a book by the inquisitor thomas aufield himself a heretic for seventeen years states that the protestants were not forbidden to plunder churches
fuck
  cool but thats not what im talking about you mongoloid
  what are you talking about then
  this is a beautiful church u fucks america is a young country that flourished on the rims of vast frontiers wood buildings and rural life is its own thing entirely different from the obsessive decadence of the great catholic churches its humble human down to earth and ultimately practical open your noggins brainlets
  yes the god of the hebrews also loved genocide and hated shellfish jesus wasnt exactly prowealth in the bible though     weird how so many of the men of god happened to become fabulously wealthy due to their position in the church
  ahh yes the old the church is right because the church said the church was right
  religion  which professes caring for the poor  pick one retard religions are companies they make money not give it away
vomits  how can you justify this shit are evangelicals retarded
  ive been to those its an industry a complete maximum of the most capitalist traits of religion the goers are truly mindless sheep and i mean that with as little edginess as possible
  no evangelism went to shit after dl moody and ra torrey died
  how long til one of those megachurch types go over to something like twitch to cut out the costs of operating and employing people in such a large facility
  never i mean theres been distributed church since radio but the power of the enclosed space acoustics and most importantly the mob of fellow pious peoples are its greatest attributes
  ive never been to a megachurch but honestly why would they need to justify it to a bunch of atheist european teenagers on the internet anyway
  tfw you go to a beautiful mainline protestant church on sunday
  christianities
  based as fuck and an icon of american civilisation  forget muh liberties muh slavery and muh drumpf these sort of churches will be what america is represented by in history books 500 years from now
rreligion in the us is a business full capitalism
  except they venerate martyrs just look at martyrdom of polycarp
      chapter 17 the christians are refused polycarps body  but when the adversary of the race of the righteous the envious malicious and wicked one perceived the impressive nature of his martyrdom and considered the blameless life he had led from the beginning and how he was now crowned with the wreath of immortality having beyond dispute received his reward he did his utmost that not the least memorial of him should be taken away by us although many desired to do this and to become possessors of his holy flesh for this end he suggested it to nicetes the father of herod and brother of alce to go and entreat the governor not to give up his body to be buried lest said he forsaking him that was crucified they begin to worship this one this he said at the suggestion and urgent persuasion of the jews who also watched us as we sought to take him out of the fire being ignorant of this that it is neither possible for us ever to forsake christ who suffered for the salvation of such as shall be saved throughout the whole world the blameless one for sinners  nor to worship any other for him indeed as being the son of god we adore but the martyrs as disciples and followers of the lord we worthily love on account of their extraordinary affection towards their own king and master of whom may we also be made companions and fellow disciples
find it funny how americans think of themselves as devout christians   meanwhile as a nonamerican catholic all i see is the degeneracy the debauchery the materialism the consumerism and the fake christians who preach greed and hatred literally the land of satan
  sorry forgot a few things  the violence in their country  the foreign wars  the sexpositive slut walking sjws  the hatred of the poor  the racism and classism    yeah thats about it i think
  you are pagan whore of babylon
  meanwhile you spit on the actual christians who were persecuted
  its ugly building for an ugly religion
  you pretend to be a good christian but you debauched the definition of christian to mean selfish individualist asshole   remember what jesus said about sacrilege its the worst of sins
  its not their fault america truly was one of the most devout societies on earth until the 20th century and somewhat into it but the corruption and rot has spread from hollywood and broadway and washington you shouldnt blame americans for what jews have done
  its the natural evolution of the old charismatic traveling preacher thing jumbotrons and stadium seating
  its not its just degeneracy and decadence
  3rd great awakening was a mistake
  whats wrong with a lot of people in the room you know the cone shape is beneficial right
  this looks comfy
  this is just colonial architecture whats the problem
  the bible tells you to give everything you own to the poor you fucking larper  no it fucking doesnt jesus tells one guy a sure fire way for him to get heaven is to do so to extrapolate that as a universal commandment is fucking retarded and even impossible considering someone will end up with the stuff is it obvious there are lessons to be drawn from that which are more widely applicable yes but you are missing the point by taking such a facile reading
  this is what soul and community means
  rich people will burn in hell
  solomon was rich and is in heaven
  no doubt some of them will it is certainly difficult for a rich man to live virtuously given he has the ability to indulge many lusty urges but does simply being poor make someone virtuous no some poor people are utter scum
    while precise definitions of a mcchurch also differ mcclory attempted to list the following common elements which he found at willow creek and other similar churches     presentations and sermons with an emphasis on entertainment use of modern theatrical technology and a heavy feelgood tone at the expense of religious experiences such as guilt and selfsacrifice1 mcclory described the overall sermon content of such churches as the basic salvation message in contemporary dress and without any of the bitter side effects   the incorporation of revenuegenerating businesses within the main church building1 this included bookstores nurseries and daycare centers gyms and cafeterias   majority of attendance and offerings come from meetings that according to the churchs own theology are not valid church services1 for example the pastor of willow creek bill hybels emphasized that his popular weekend and sunday services attendance at the time of the article 16000 are not intended as worship in any formal sense and are officially designated as informal meetings to attract the unchurched the church held its official services attendance 4500 on wednesday and thursday nights   primarily located in suburban and exurban areas ostensibly to attract higherclass attendees and boost donations1 mcclory noted that willow creek is located in a remote wooded area and all attendees required an automobile to attend he also reported that the churchs attendees are almost all drawn from the surrounding upperclass subdivisions of northwest chicago suburbs   nearcomplete lack of religious symbols in and outside the church1 except for a crossshaped cork bulletin board no religious symbols could be found either in or around the willow creek complex likewise traditional church elements were replaced eg instead of pews attendees sat in cushioned movietheater chairs    fucking burgers
  you dont go to heaven by being a good person or giving money to the poor
  not by themselves no whats your point
  ur a idiot
  it precisely is they literally do the opposite of what jesus said the byzantines had it right with cesaropapism
  1 protestant theology and customs    2 frontier culture    they didnt have time or resources for fancy shit when they built most of those small town chapels
their religion would have rendered them the firmest and most cordial allies of the portuguese but the inquisitors soon discerned in the christians of st thomas the unpardonable guilt of heresy and schism instead of owning themselves the subjects of the roman pontiff the spiritual and temporal monarch of the globe they adhered like their ancestors to the communion of the nestorian patriarch and the bishops whom he ordained at mosul traversed the dangers of the sea and land to reach their diocese on the coast of malabar in their syriac liturgy the names of theodore and nestorius were piously commemorated they united their adoration of the two persons of christ the title of mother of god was offensive to their ear and they measured with scrupulous avarice the honors of the virgin mary whom the superstition of the latins had almost exalted to the rank of a goddess when her image was first presented to the disciples of st thomas they indignantly exclaimed we are christians not idolaters and their simple devotion was content with the veneration of the cross their separation from the western world had left them in ignorance of the improvements or corruptions of a thousand years and their conformity with the faith and practice of the fifth century would equally disappoint the prejudices of a papist or a protestant
  really varies i think i generally feel the same but there are some in the south in particular that are really passionate and genuine just very much in a minority
  probably because most of them are practically shacks  this guy is right    the buildings themselves dont elicit any particularly strong feelings and it doesnt help that they all have stupid names first baptist etc  so while they may be legitimate houses of worship they arent going to be impressive to anyone who is just looking at them
  american southern catholic church is just as infected with prison/garage/public school style architecture as most other protestant churches my parish has made strides in this area though
whats to expect from a hyper rationalistic outgrowth of an already rationalist development
  you need to go to a giant cathedral that had over a million dollars poured into it and paid for by selling indulgences to worship god  spiritual culture   faith in god is decided by the design of the church  saint peter and every last early christian are literally rolling over in their holy saint graves right now op
  on the bright side their ministers dont seem to be quite as randy as catholic priests
because american protestantism has been just giving out divine stamps of approval on peoples base appetites god will never challenge you or otherwise stop you from what you want to do     this isnt just a problem with the shitlib churches that have entirely surrendered to progressivism conservative protestants just jerk off over their tax cuts fantasize about criminals and people not like them getting tortured and dont question the corporatemilitary babylon that is america
   god will never challenge you or otherwise stop you from what you want to do   to be fair god does literally tell you to be yourself but not to bitch and complain when you get punished for everything bad you did once you die
  respecting that we have free will does not mean he isnt calling us all to be saints
  some of the reason for this might be the relatively short history of nonindigenous cultures in north america another reason might be part of the culture and aesthetic of early american settlements buildings tended to be practical modest and comfortable lacking the obvious luxury or ornamentation of contemporary architecture in baroqueera europe
  theres a certain comfiness to buildings like that to me it brings to mind community bonds summer picnics and drinking hot cider with cinnamon after service on a chilly sunday morning
depends on the protestant sect desu a church in new england with first in the name might lack the sort of elaborate decorations catholics and orthodox favor but has plenty of history and usually a plaque or something to remind you and doesnt feel artificial at all even if the architectures different and less impressive a megachurch in the south on the other hand
  weird how christ scolded the pharisees for giving their wealth to the temples instead of their mothers and fathers    really makes me think
  its the price they paid for iconoclasm
  and the building of the wall of it was of jasper and the city was pure gold like unto clear glass  and the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones the first foundation was jasper the second sapphire the third a chalcedony the fourth an emerald  the fifth sardonyx the sixth sardius the seventh chrysolyte the eighth beryl the ninth a topaz the tenth a chrysoprasus the eleventh a jacinth the twelfth an amethyst  and the twelve gates were twelve pearls every several gate was of one pearl and the street of the city was pure gold as it were transparent glass
why didnt it devolve into all out civil war like in rhodesia/zimbabwe  how was it able to peacefully transition
  the whites in south africa were working with a much more robust base than those in rhodesia
  the apartheid government had an upper hand in negotiations
  because people surprisingly dont like civil war
 op  what would south african civil war look like  would it be unironic race war between english/afrikaners/boers against bantus
  that wouldve been my wet dream come true
  if whites won wouldve they been able to deport all blacks out of south africa
  true and they gave their authority to the wb imf who pulled a fast one on the incoming government    
  there wouldnt have been any blacks left to deport
free rhodes rhodes belongs to the rhodesians let my people go
how exactly did saudi arabia succeed in becoming a realworld dystopia that is seemingly impervious to foreign influence beyond securing lucrative business deals and purchasing weapon systems from western governments
  
    shit loads of oil    why invade them and get stuck with all the hassles when theyll just sell you the oil
  no one knew there was oil in saudi arabia
the same people who say the holocaust isnt real but it should have been are convinced the german army din do nuffin  why are you surprised this is a thing
  but these people are saying the holocaust did happen but the german army din do nuffin
  its just to push the narrative that the german people were victims of hitler and not happy to have him in power and willingly did all of his crazy shit german people were mad hitler was executing disabled people but were more than happy with the nuremberg laws clean wehrmacht is about as big a lie as clean german citizens they were all nazis
  now that the clean wehrmacht myth has been debunked its time to debunk the clean imperial german army one  remember belgium
  ignoring the war crimes is it true that the wehrmacht was the cleanestin terms of hygiene army
  remember belgium    more like remember namibia
  yes thank to the use of zyklon b to kill lice
the need to rearm germany due to cold war situation and also most of german victims were in the eastern europe and balkans and since westerners didnt care much about those they were glad to help germans whitewash their crimes by pinning them all on ss or hitler and his inner circle or just pushing them under the carpet soviets poles and others were now the main enemy and showing any sympathy towards them was bad while painting them as subhuman cavalry charging tanks every second guy gets a rifle exaggerations about blocking detachments was actually useful      you can see the effects of it today while holocaust did permeate the western public psyche due to efforts of the jews they dont really know much about german war crimes in the east or the scale on which they were committed thats why you have so many wehraboos and hitler apologists and why they push the idea that hitler was fighting to free europe and other inane bullshit     in reality primary goal of ns regime was to colonize eastern europe and enslave or exterminate its population slavic and baltic people were the primary targets for annihilation jews were just a cool scapegoat to fill the role of internal enemy
  ok guys you rebelled so were exiling you to the desert dont worry we wont hurt you  oh also we poisoned all the water sources in the area have fun
why shouldnt the wehrmacht be whitewashed  every other army is
being liked is good  being not liked is evil
  where did he say that
  father figure
  thats basically his point
  in some way yeah evil is being selfish good is some degree of selflessness
  selflessness makes you being perceived as weak which makes other people not like you so thats evil bucko
  no one claims that jordan peterson is evil because he isnt liked few people even claim he is evil since he really doesnt have much of an impact also he is overall pretty wellliked on the internet he is one of the most watched political figures on youtube and is the court philosopher of leddit
  well lets see if youre not liked youre unlikely to get hired youre unlikely to get promotions youre unlikely to live a healthy life that involves social interactions youre unlikely to get a girlfriend that eventually turns into a wife being unliked and antisocial leads you down the road to shitposting on /pol/ every saturday night instead of living your life   seems about right
  imagine talking about ethics but failing to lay out the necessary moral foundation good and evil is the way i say it is because uhhhh look the sjws have worse answers ok     literally every popular 20th/21st century philosopher
  macintyre is pretty popular
  he also said being agreeable is not good for you so the trick is to find some way to be critical and independent while respecting other people as an individual who might have differing opinions from you
  being liked or disliked is irrelevant to rule just dont be such a dick that the people want to get rid of you
  his moral foundation is obviously some kind of neojungian virtue ethics
  people directly and indirectly shaped someone to become an unhealthy human  the resulting person is evil not the people who caused the person  nice reasoning m8
  bbbut free will
  some kind of    lmao the absolute state of modern pop philosophy everything they say may be rejected with a waive of the hand because the foundation is absent and their opinions worthless beyond their practical significance their works lack any deep insight or value
  this argument is recursive  what about the people who made the people who made that person  are they not more responsible  its absurd  you are responsible for yourself  the buck stops with you
  what makes any of that evil
  and here you have the dagger through the heart of all 20th and 21st century pop philosophy its proponents are all too ignorant gutless or distracted to lay out an account of metaphysics and morality they do nothing but focus on ethics applied morality which essentially boils down to voicing their belly feels on a bunch of issues
  he doesnt claim this  his metrics of good and evil seem to be something like did the actions taken by the individual make the world make the world more like the ideal of heaven or hell  it is entirely possible to go about making the world a worse place and have people cheer you on while you are doing it this would be something he would vehemently oppose
  difference and repetition is a book of metaphysics
  being more like hell is evil  being less like hell is good  forgets to cite the authority for this proposition and its details
  so the kim family are saints by the standard of their people
  yes
  i dont understand what you are asking for  a citation of one of his lectures or a further explanation of the idea
  obviously by that i mean his own thoughts on it morality is practical though by saying that their works have practical significance you basically admitted that there might be some merit to what they say in their respective books perhaps even more than the majority of academic philosophers now
  a citation for the claim that being more like hell is evil and being less like hell is good also it would be nice to have an authority for what hell is but lets start with actually trying to lay out a moral foundation for the assorted pop philosophy ethical judgments       no ethics is practical it is literally applied morality to talk about ethics you must first lay the foundation theology/morality deals with the divine principle that defining entity regarding what ought to be without it ethics is just muh belly feels because there is no ought to be only so many individuals voicing their subjective opinions absent universal authority
  being liked also means having to conform to societal norms many of which are outright unjust and enforce following trends whose only justification is that everyond else follows them
  were too stupid to be good the best we can hope to is to understand our motivations and act selfishly the people that try to be selfless and good almost always end up causing the most damage in the world
  he is saying that antisocial people can be and are usually bitter and dangerous something about that if a 1000 people dislikes you theres a large chance that it is not a conspiracy against you but rather your own shortfalls you should sort yourself out instead of reeeing against the system like a bunch of bitter revolutionaries
what can we do to fix /his/
post more    sageru
  name one thing wrong with arranged marriage tho
  well can you refute that image
  otters are cute
nothing theres nothing you can do  /his/ is ours
  yeah i can ask him to send me something more than a thumbnail
  whats the most convincing refutation to an image like this  get that into the archive
/his/ is a very special place
  who dat guy
why was there so many weird cults and religions that started in the 50s 60s and 70s like scientology peoples temple heavens gate etc and why did this phenomenon die out in the 90s
  50s 60s and 70s  retarded boomers  90s  retarded boomers in cults like jonestown or branch davidians dying putting off other boomers from cults internet    though zoomers are just as bad with internet conspiracy theories
the war and the decades leading up to it introduced a lot of innovations in the area of influencing groups of people new religious movements were basically the intelligence agencies and other glow in the dark types having a field day with all the new techniques originally cooked up by the oss reds and operation paperclip gang
read history  become a nationalanarchist    who else
read history  realize everyone else and their beliefs are nothing in comparison to close familial relationships  the only thing that matters is ensuring your direct family relations succeed
  ive been looking for a term that describes me in a nutshell thank you op    its really difficult trying to sum what i am when i hate niggers hate women love guns but also hate any form of government and most forms of capitalism
  read history  become obese from sitting around reading history and eating    did this happen to anyone else
  read history  realize history majors have lower iq than philosophers and mathematicians  have trouble appreciating prose because theyre just not very creative or bright  realize that boyfucking and genocide are most of history  territorial restructuring and military strategy political intrigue about the only things worth mentioning  history majors are all definitely alcoholics and incels  cant get over these people are on the same level as my apush teacher  read poetry instead  if i had to pick any system it would be laozis monarchy but otherwise id just like to be left alone     based and filial pietypilled
  no because getting up to get food is too much energy and takes time away from reading history
read history  learn new stuff from history    who else
  pretty sure all majors are alcoholics or speedfreaks anon
  sad if true
  cannot relate
  read history  become national socialist     hitler literally did nothing wrong
except lose
  read a history book  forgot about it the next day  who else i hate being a brainlet
  ugh i never thought i would agree with a anime poster
is there something about shia hadiths that make them not act like prideful assholes
  superior big indoeuropean persian cock
  when he said to his father and his people what are these images to which you are devoted  they said we found our fathers worshipping them  he said indeed you and your fathers have been in manifest error  quran 215254
  prideful asshole detected
  iran has smaller average penis size than the western middle east and north africa
  geei wonder who could be behind this post
  whatd you say whiteboi
  retarded faggot
  is this supposed to be a joke what do you think irans imperial project is all about
  its shiatard
  turks are literally mongol and iranic rapebabies lmao
  what differs a shia from sunni anyways apart from ali vs abu bakr succession what are sufis and ibadis and druzes
  sufis are sunni ibadis are a third sect and reject the later part of uthman and alis caliphates druze are an offshoot of ismaili shia which dont allow converts
  historically theyve been more tolerant to minorities than sunni muslims
  thats an uncertain thing turkics persisted in north eurasia for quite a while intermingling with ies and mongols for a long period we really dont know exactly what befell them when either group swept actoss the steppe its probably they were raped and thus admixed forcibly with other races genes but at the same time there does seem to be a turkic type that is quite ancient and likely relatively distinct and undisturbed by either groups presence i dont think significant destruction of human types on the scale youre depicting was common post iron age
  shia were a subversive jew plot from day 1 to hype up ali as jesus part 2 who continued on about it even after ali accepted the ruling of the community believe in magical hidden dead imams who the imam is depends on who you ask  sunnis larp as 7th century hijazis and also made a ton of shit up wrt to madhabs and hadith collections they accept the succession of the first 4 caliphs as legitimate something the shia refuse to let go of after 1400 years as if they can change it  sufis are gnostic cultists who outright reject quranic doctrine regarding the uniqueness of allah we are all divine emanations bullshit and claim to know the secrets of the quran freemasonry for muslims  ibadis are surviving kharijites who initially sided with the shia and then started chimping out when they didnt get what they wanted no rule but allahs  druzes are a weird cult that think some fatimid caliph was the messiah and some other tawhid violating gnostic bullshit   inb4 allah is muh demiurge from the mentally retarded  im interested to see what others say lets have fun with this
also the shitting up of islam is analogous to the shitting up of early christrianty by (((paul))) and the later shitting up of the church by the (((jesuits)))  those antisemitic verses are there for a reason
  show me the flourishing christian communities in central and southern iraq please shiites are more tolerant of their minorities because they reduced them to non threatening numbers centuries ago so that they dont pose a threat anymore
  christianity was not pauline from the beginning  the entirety of the founders of christianity werent jewish  jesus wasnt jewish  ignatius loyola was jewish  you guys should all kill yourselves youre so weak willed and self hating
  ali was clearly intended to be the first caliph born in the kaaba grows up with the prophet first male convert to islam marries the prophets daughter hadith of the pond
   because they reduced them to non threatening numbers centuries ago so that they dont pose a threat anymore    proofs
interesting
he is completely unfunny in fact he seems to be so autistic he cant actually use memes properly despite the whole point of his channel supposedly being based on tank memes almost everything he says is either recitation of wikipedia or regurgitated dumbeddown versions of something thechieftan already said when he does actually try to form his own opinion like his latest video on british tanks its so illogical full of misrepresentations and generally awful you want to hear him plagiarize things again he contributes nothing of value and his popularity genuinely baffles me    if you want your tank buff ytber to be funny just watch david fletcher ffs
  semirelated question do actual historians go out and look at old shit to come up with how something happened or do they just look at what other people had written and make a judgement based on that
  depends on the ethic/integrity of the historian    since most normies wont bother looking at the sources you can get away with repackaging other peoples research and sell it to the public if youre writing in an academic journal of course you cant get away with not doing primary research
  name a worse historical/political channel than knowing better
  adam ruins everything    talk shit about knowing better all you want he deserves it but someone needed to call out adams horseshit
  the cynical historian
  because theyre hoi4 playing normalfags that only care about the most surface of surface level shit like ww2 tank comparisons
pretty much all the major youtube history channels are cringe af ultranerd shit  metatron with his edgy ass intros and constant video game head down eyes up posing in his armour  lindybeige i was larping dnd and thought this was better so this is obviously how they did it in history also climate change isnt real folks  shadiversity just pure fucking nerd just look at him also lame meticulations shit  skallagrim looks exactly like the sort of person that would collect knives and swords and not in a good way  american krogan just a lame antisjw/antileft channel that presents bad history to show how the left is ruining history ignore that pretty much all major historical revisionism campaigns in the west especially in the curriculum come from the christian right    i think the only major history channels that dont have a major cringe factor are overly sarcastic productions and the great war also forgotten weapons i guess
  i dont think any educated person seriously believes the claims of are
uses tons of shitty memes  90 of his vids are shitting on krauts  the rest is deepthroating the us and justifying dresden  youd think /his/ would love this guy
  /pol/ doesnt like are so hes wrong    adam ruins everything is legitimately one of the best and most accurate history shows mainstream television has produced in the past decade even /r/badhistory a sub of historians that shit on everything think its a good show   they even have threads of the /pol/tard youtube channels that try to debunk are debunking them        for example
  he was legit wrong about columbus though he jumped that gun because he has an agenda so he didnt care to check who his source was
  matilda and churchill were great vehicles  what the fuck is this guy smoking
      he does fuck up the episode not that much though
    directly linking to reddit  straight up talking about some shitty subrddits  not even trying to hide it anymore
  watched too much lindybeige
  but muh armor  who cares that your tank has a top speed of brisk walk and no he shells
  whats wrong with knowing better please dont respond if your answer can boiled down to he has opinions i disagree with
  i love how during his panther video he spent half of the video talking about rapid suspension breakdowns but during this video he barely mentioned that churchill also suffered from the same problem and even the soviets who were the main users of the churchill tank until 1944 made a report in which they deemed churchill to be a capable but very flawed machine
why dont people just read a fucking book
what do you think about kings and generals  his presentation is often iffy but i like the subjects he chooses like the alexanderhellenistic videos are great
  this even the best youtube historians are only parroting information they gained from reading the scholarship of actual academic historians on the subject they are discussing very rarely youtube historians will cite or quote actually primary sources likely pulled straight from the same secondary works referred to earlier why is reading so hard for so many people
  tik
  cuck
  tik is bad at politics not history
  no hes terrible at history too
  whats wrong with knowing better    hes a jewish marxist and unironic zogbot
  the only historical youtube channel worth watching is historia civilis because he visualises the history very well maybe primitive technology too if you count him as a history youtuber
    besides the nazis are marxists thing hes not that bad
blocks your path
  besides the nazis are marxists thing hes not that bad  implying hes wrong
  hes not that bad and his only poorquality video is the jordan peterson one in which he claims that peterson stumbling and saying 4th reich as opposed to 3rd reich is a dogwhistle to the altright
  t triggered werhaboo
  nice boomertier facebook meme
  whats so bad about him
  the video where he tries to downplay kill ratios on the eastern front was pretty bad too
  columbus thought the world was a pear with a nipple on top and not that asia was significantly larger and extended much farther west than it does in reality like most educated europeans of his day did  completely misrepresent his views of the natives  blame him for shit that happened after he died  it was a train wreck of basic bitch columbus bashing memes
  not even hiding it
  how about you read responses to you your post every single time you ask whats wrong with knowing better theres always a few people responding in detail how his knowledge is superficial and based around his own biases rather than academic books
  the panther having a flawed final drive means the churchill is a great tank  god youre as retarded as he is
  that is literally the first time i have ever typed the words knowing better i discovered him like 4 days ago 4chan is not one person
eternal reminder that lindybeige almost literally said the lee enfield was the best rifle of ww2 because its british
            this makes me feel bad for the original subscribers of kb that had to deal with the flood of newfags youtube gave them
  they were good infantry tanks that had stellar reputations with their crews    tank designed to advance with the infantry has the same speed as the infantry   issuing he shells that offer barely any increase in antiinfantry performance over ap    who were the main users of the churchill tank until 1944  what is the italian front
  the very concept of the infantry tank was bunk and the idea of fitting your tank with a gun that has he shells too small to be useful is fucking retarded
  the very concept of the infantry tank was bunk  inefficient not bunk   fitting your tank with a gun that has he shells too small to be useful  so almost every tank in the early years of wwii
  just have him play british tanks in warthunder hell soon reverse his opinion if he doesnt kill himself first
  almost everything he says is either recitation of wikipedia or regurgitated dumbeddown versions of something thechieftan already said  that sums up pretty much every history channel on youtube
who the fuck cares about tanks
autistic history youtubers are no where near as insufferable as youtube film video essayists if they arent over analyzing things to an absurd degree then theyre making the most blatant observation and passing it off as profound
  i like cultured thug but i am biased i dont know about his videos on the jewish question though
  so almost every tank in the early years of wwii  what is the panzer iv stug m3 and t4  the very idea of an infantry support tank that cant effectivly deal with enemy fortifications and infantry because lmao no he is fucking retarded
  why do you leftypol subhumans want an anti white sjw safespace
  an anti white sjw subreddit like an anti white sjw channel   wow
  couldnt never watch skallagrim seriously or have respect for him because of those reasons he made a video one time about him always walking at night and being a night time because the temperature of the weather is cool like fuck outa here ya basement dwelling autist
  cannot believe people like this exist
  extra credit
trey is still the best history youtuber i see
  watch history tome for a good channel on history
  time
  i remember watching americankrogans video on wolfenstein and being all man how dare they put communist symbols into this game about an alternate history of ww2  i remember thinking to myself nigger the allies in ww2 were literally communist and republican/democraticstyled governments putting aside their differences to fight a common enemy
  nevermind krogan didnt make the video i was talking about it was some other guy couldve sworn it was him though
  why are you ignoring all the anti white leftist imagery in the game
  /r/badhistory  a sub of historians    absolute state of reddit
  because the games trying to make a point that the real resistance groups during ww2 had real ideological differences they had to put aside to win the war the us uk and everyone else in the allies were pretty quick to forget all the fucked up shit stalin did and started calling him uncle joe
  anti white shill literally trying to cover for the anti white propaganda in wolfenstein  why do you leftypol subhumans hate the white race
  but the main character is white and inseminated a white woman who had twins its the opposite of white genocide
  i dont go there ive probably visited /pol/ more than /leftypol/
    hes a jew who has an anti white leftist gf he calls his enemies evil white fucks allies with anti white leftists communists jewish and black supremacists against a homogeneous white nation
  hes a jew   id forgotten that retcon
  faggot redditor doesnt know shit about anything  whyre you surprised in any case its kind of sad that britain has never really built a great tank other than arguably the centurion despite inventing them    kb is based and redpilled dont talk shit
  im pretty sure in the old series he was still the son of 2 polish immigrants so still an untermensch back then
  i thought he was on trutv
  playing hoi4 should make one realize that equipment comparisons are useless because all the country specific equipment have the exact same stats meaning that strategy and industrial capability is more important that the design of a tank sadly though strategy in hoi4 is just put infantry and artillery on the border and have the enemy endlessly rush you
  yeah its only a challenge if youre playing mp
  hopefully at some point theyll implement the new naval design system for aircraft and shit so it isnt everyone using literally the exact same shit
  challenge if youre playing mp with someone who knows what theyre doing  ftfy  
  hoi4  play darkest hour you fucking faggot
  why are antiwhite /pol/ subhumans justify genocide of white poland
  poland  white
  antiwhite /pol/ subhuman shills for white genocide  why do you pol subhumans hate the white race

  mercenaries tend to chimpout when their pay is in arrears    imagine fighting a grueling battle of the 1600s and then your employer hands you an iou id chimp out too
  1 event in hundreds of years  so this is the power of protestant propagandawoah
    fuck you and fuck the persians     scaphism also known as the boats is an alleged ancient persian method of execution the word comes from the greek σkάφη skáphe meaning anything scooped or hollowed out it entailed trapping the victim between two boats feeding and covering hima with milk and honey and allowing him to fester and be devoured by vermin the primary source is plutarchs life of artaxerxes ii where he attributes the story to ctesias a notoriously suspect source123   the king decreed that mithridates should be put to death in boats which execution is after the following manner taking two boats framed exactly to fit and answer each other they lay down in one of them the malefactor that suffers upon his back then covering it with the other and so setting them together that the head hands and feet of him are left outside and the rest of his body lies shut up within they offer him food and if he refuse to eat it they force him to do it by pricking his eyes then after he has eaten they drench him with a mixture of milk and honey pouring it not only into his mouth but all over his face they then keep his face continually turned towards the sun and it becomes completely covered up and hidden by the multitude of flies that settle on it and as within the boats he does what those that eat and drink must needs do creeping things and vermin spring out of the corruption and rottenness of the excrement and these entering into the bowels of him his body is consumed when the man is manifestly dead the uppermost boat being taken off they find his flesh devoured and swarms of such noisome creatures preying upon and as it were growing to his inwards in this way mithridates after suffering for seventeen days at last expired
  believing anything the greeks said about the persians persians were the most civilized civilization of antiquity however much you want to believe alleged torture methods especially when the source is from someone who saw the persians as barbarians     stay mad op and stop believing propaganda from this age and the past
  hurr execution method  police state secret repressions  what a moron
the inqusition  op is brainlet dark ages believer
  only idiots ever try to argue any empire as a whole was pacifistic and benevolent the point is no one has a moral highground including you muh brutal persians absolute evil is nonsense when you take into account blood eagle lingchi and other shit other empires engaged in mankind as a whole is brutal faggot
  the inquisition    lol no
would future invasions of scythia and carthage have been feasible was his vast empire bound to collapse on itself due to the speed in which it expanded if he had lived long enough to die at an old age with a legitimate heir was everything bound to collapse anyway how was as an administrator/bureaucrat

is that true karl marx was a neet who lived thanks to the money of his friend
he was a remarkably prolific journalist and writer but he wasnt financially successful and did rely on engels support especially later in life     but hardworking poorfag who can barely keep his head above water because thats what happen under capitalism isnt as good a narrative for anticommies as lazy neet
  is that true  no  /thread
  so his life was   write an article implicitly advocating for literal genocide   ask engels for more gibs  sleep  repeat
   never ran a company   true     never held political office  he was a major part of the international workingmens association and held numerous posts in it marx was also driven out of germany and france good luck holding political office when youre a prisoner and could not speak english very well so its unlikely even if he attempted to hold political offices there hed have much success by virtue of not actually knowing how to speak the language      never even held a job  any job  as noted by another anon this is untrue     supported throughout his life by his friend friedrich engels the son of a wealthy factory owner  engels was himself a wealthy factory owner its undeniable that marx was financially unsuccessful but considering the consistent need to move and the fact he never held citizenship he died a stateless person its unsurprising that finances were hard to come by his poor health marx was always marred by it especially later in life due to his constant smoking and drinking also impacted his finances      considered by many to be the greatest social political and economic philosopher of all time  even devoted marxists often only focus on one aspect of marxs writings its undeniable whether you like marx or not that aspects of his theory were deeply influential in a positive manner the man dedicated most of his life to study and was doing so right up until his death     all applications of his theories have ended in failure   while its undeniable the marxian inspired soviet union and its satellites collapsed marxs theories were deeply influential upon the worlds second biggest super power china and remains a key influence upon their entire world view     theres much better criticisms of marx than dumb neet who didnt have a job
  constant smoking and drinking  more neet characteristics
  does he look like a neet to you    also rip keep forgetting he fucking died
  write an article implicitly advocating for literal genocide
  hes got giblets on his faces
wow this is so historically inaccurate   were medieval people too stupid to learn how people looked in 1st century bc  why are they getting away with this
  how would they have known how people a millennium before them looked archaeology
  you give a good example like holy fuck couldnt they be bothered to do their research  the irish of all people had been known to literally use centuries old weapons scavenged from the bogs when the need came
why the fuck did he have to die so early   resquiescat in pace laiglon

the french revolution was an event in which urban intellectuals jealous of the aristocracy used the masses to grasp control they govern society with theory instead of principle substitute quantity for quality just as the military need well trained leadership so does society irreligious rational materialistic men sterilize everything by analyzing it including themselves children are considered in terms of pros and cons art architecture clothing furniture music lose their form becoming ever changing popular fads    lacking discipline to reform themselves intellectual world improvers constantly propose theories on how to govern society all forms of social distinction good manners honor authority rank are ceaselessly attacked and deconstructed this process will continue until the idea exhausts itself nihilism and chaos     destiny has put us in this era of decay we can face our fate with courage or be cowardly optimists     
every culture has gone through its own form of nihilism and skepsis where skeptics question everything how long then does a culture survive after a certain number of generations each culture transforms into civilization what was formerly alive becomes rigid and cold expansiveness of mind and spirit is replaced with a lust for expansion in the material world life guided by ideals is replaced by life guided by politics and economics the power of these ideas becomes strong so much that it leads to imperialism a sign of transformation is a socrates buddha lao tsu rousseau they enunciate ultimate but earthly ideals with practical and terminal ideas the materialistic ideas of mass and number begin to dominate the culture governments try to appeal to the most plebeian catchwords are used equality the common good the working man    in this era of transition a man like alexander the great emerges for the west it is napoleon his immense military success is due to ignoring chivalric military traditions materialist thought guides military strategy technology and mass are used to win armies shrink in size soon after into voluntary professional armies most join for money or love of combat armies gradually become privatized pacifism becomes popular in reaction society becomes increasingly litigious money is an idea which slowly becomes more abstract until it itself becomes a power it buys state power and over time the lines separating politics and commerce slowly fade away business and government combine forming an imperial government
nice spooks dork
  can i ask you how many girls you ever haf sex with
  what did my property mean by this
    so what for do these ideas that you cited exist
  underage virgin cope indeed youll get over it once you get your first girl    what do you mean with what for
  im a little too old to believe in ghosts kiddo
  then why are you so scared
  what do you mean with what for  most ideas are interlinked with practice and are objectively validated by having a practical purpose and fulfilling it without it there is no way to differentiate ideas that contribute to our understanding and empty world play and scholastics    so are these ideas anything more than empty word play and scholastics to boost its authors ego
  they have a precise aim let people probably the typical smart people know what really awaits them wake them up from their dreams only then their real creativity can be expressed their real live lived and their meaning found
  doomsaying is a state of mind rather than knowledge and an unproductive one at that
  the french revolution was cancer  thanks for stating the obvious
  i hope you know this is a form of coping only by accepting reality you can have a choice  living in comfortable dreams and escapism will rob you of the little power you as a single human have   if you get asleep while driving or pretend there are no other cars on the road you die or get crippled and so get the ones who are in the car with you  worse you can also get other people injured people who paid attention to the road

do you think well ever see mendicant eunuch clergy under the service of cybele begging for alms in north africa again
ugh so superficial so materialistic just like christianity would come to be
  im grateful the stupid nip artist had enough sense to give a med goddess brown hair and eyes fuck anime btw
histard here again now i really want to know what this coin is all about how old is it what country is it from is it worth anything

  does that say hong kong its either colonial or fake
if african civilisation was so advanced how come it took until the white man for them to get aids  logically africans in the regions where siv was common must never have had a high enough population density for the hiv std to evolve into a serious threat
  logically africans in the regions where siv was common must never have had a high enough population density for the hiv std to evolve into a serious threat    up until the 1980s we do not know how many people were infected with hiv or developed aids    maybe hiv existed in few parts of africa but we do not have any records or it simply didnt spread a lot a this time to be noticeable    the most urbanized parts of africa were west africaespecially the gold coast and sahel east africa and north africa there were few examples of urbanization in central and southern africa but they never achieved a very big population density with it and it was mostly next to the coasts in 1700 west africa had a population estimated at 50 millions which then started to stagnate because of the slave trade so maybe the most vulnerable parts should have been in west africa    hiv seems to have first appeared in central / equatorial africa after an increase in bushmeat practices created by a displacement of rural populationsthis is an hypotheses tho it then spread everywhere easily thanks to truck drivers    other than hiv there are examples of epidemics in precolonial africa epidemics of trypanosomiasis and smallpox were very common    but this is like asking why wasnt h7n9 reported in china until 1988 or why wasnt marburg reported in germany until 1967     there are many circumstances for the spread of a virus and for it being reported at all maybe postcolonial africa had more routes for the spread of hiv with the prevalence of truck drivers and prostitutes selling themselves to the drivers i dont know
  why wasnt marburg reported in germany until 1967  ignore this bad example
was hitler a jewish plant
  hitler was a homosexual jew of african descent
why the fuck would you think that
he was a jew his father changed his surname from schicklgruber literally shekel grubbler to hitler    the schicklgrubers were once prominent amsterdam jews so it is possible he was a distant relative of anne frank
  yes
hitler was a commie plant the conspiracy that he killed himself or left to south america is soviet propaganda he died in 1971 on vacation in iran
    probably because he captured 4 four rothschilds one died of disease a few weeks before the end of the war another was in a detention camp and survived another was let go after paying a random and another was just let go
  how progresive it was
  no you fucking retard     he was a jewish mammal
  sparked the biggest european war ever  killed tens of millions   said all whites east of germany are subhuman  ensured the prosperity of israel  destroyed ethnic nationalism in europe forever    it seems so
are there any materials on the history and instances of black nationalism like what happened to antiracemixing sentiment in the afroamerican community was an ethnostate ever a goal for black nationalists what was the ideal black family in the eyes of black nationalists and whats the difference between american black nationalists african black nationalists and black nationalists in other parts of the world
according to my grandparents everyone already acknowledged the absurdity of getting pissy over it considering all of us are mixed race anyway
  why do you need to ask this board you could get most of your answers by reading a malcolm x biography
  lol at this retard  why ask anything ever just research yourself  why are you even here cocksucker piece of shit  you subhuman baboon you literal dog commit suicide
  mobutu was a black nationalist   the only thing he cared about was getting foreign aid and embezzling government funds
a true african / black nationalist is probably someone like gaddafi not mobutu
  its wrong to say black nationalists as a single group there were many opinions within it but really quickly black nationalism doesnt exist as you conceive of it in africa they have just as many ethnic tensions as any other continent its mainly an american invention there were some american black nationalists who wanted to set up a notofficiallyaseparatecountry within the united states that could finance and support itself but the fbi really fucked them up look up cointel
  lol is that why he supported idi motherfucking amin against nyerere is that why he despised the berbers and their historylybicoberber garamantes gaddafi was just an hypocritical narscistic individual who had great projects
  what was the ideal black family in the eyes of black nationalists  unmixed pure black monogamous family for garveyists african nationalists may consider polygamy and even miscegenationnkrumah was married to an egyptian copt woman black integrationist will of course go for race mixing      garvey also wrote something about racial purety that is the natural order that god wants but i dont find it one of his most hardcore shit    and whats the difference between american black nationalists african black nationalists and black nationalists in other parts of the world    black nationalists in haiti and the new world in general were usually free masons black nationalists in africa were usually influenced by the diaspora as black identity wasnt really a thing on the continentnkrumah probably wouldnt have been panafrican without his education in the western world black nationalists in africa were usually socialistsnkrumah nyerere etc while in the new world they were mostly conservativemarcus garvey dubois though there were some socialists tooblack panther party    tbf there were multiple types of black nationalists in the americas integrationistsmlk dubois etc and separationistsgarvey cooks etc integrationists were usually proponents of miscegenation and integration with white society while separationists were for the separation of blacks to whites
  its rreally not that hard anon most threads here can be answered by a 2 second google
  study and live to better yourself  intellectually  physically  spiritually  mentally  and then love dont be violent  tit for tat with forgiveness based on financial valuation of return on such investment is the best market deliniation strategy        
  african black nationalist  there is no such thing as a black person in africa only other humans
  uh there are arabs in africa too anon
  there are very very very very very few arabs in africa you have a few semitesdescendant of phoenicians and amhara but no arabs at all africans are either negroids cushites or north african nativesegyptian/berber
  still not all blacks negroids
  he said   there is no such thing as a black person in africa only other humans  and is correct negroid doesnt mean anything to an african there is no negroid identity in africa
  i doubt egyptians consider themselves of the same stock as the congolese in fact i would wager that egyptians would consider the congolese black
  i doubt egyptians consider themselves of the same stock as the congolese in fact i would wager that egyptians would consider the congolese black  it seems that you are really confused when did i say that an egyptian would consider himself the same as a congolese do you realize that im actually decontructing this flawed notion please reread what i said and think again
  yes i doubt it too as much as i doubt that a bakongo would consider himself the same as a yoruba it seems that you lost the point of the discussion
  there is no negroid identity in africa  i doubt that an egyptian would consider himself the same as a congolese    is exactly like     there is no sauce identity in the fridge  i doubt that the ketchup consider himself the same as the egg    what is your point do you understand mine
  ah yeah my bad thought you were saying that they didnt consider themselves black because they all were not that they dont consider themselves black because nonracial identities are more important sorry anon
  its all good anon
  mobutu wasnt a black nationalist he was a belgian agent
  my girlfriend is algerian she considers herself african
whats the greatest school of philosophy and why is it skepticism
  how many times today alone did you think about how much of a useless faggot you are
  its postmodernism anon
skeptics are mostly right wingers too afraid to say they are
  skeptics started out as and still are liberal left leaning atheists you git someone to the right of stalin is not necessarily a right winger
    even the name skeptic should indicate that they subscribe to some degree to frankfurt schools critical theory
  the only liberal thing about them is usually their stance on homosexuals they espouse nearly everything right wingers say in some case the far right especially in regards to economics and of course le cultural marxism  folks like sargon unironically believe that people like bernie sanders are communists
  what are you even talking about being skeptical and critical werent invented by 1920s germans
  stalin was a right winger even lenin was a right winger lenin hated leftism and stalin was more to the right than him
bump
when your philosophy is so retarded you cant even say for certain its real
  why is sargon with those fuckers hes still relevant
was he the first pro wrestler
  there were plenty before him its just that he blew off his other much more important job to pursue it
genocides armenians   genocides assyrians   genocides greeks   gets away with it   how did they do it
  what do you mean they  the ottomans
  alliance with the greatest nation on earth has its perks
  why do niggers keep wewuzzing as turks  fuck off
byzantium is rightful european clay and i have zero respect for europeans until it is within their hands again
  just because they arent all white doesnt mean they are all black
  the people that live there today are literally descendents of people that lived there 1000 years ago
  we
  he doesnt know about the kara boğa   kek
  irrelevant its in the hands of asians and that is vile caria should be reconquered too
  this   they say greeks look like trks but its the exact opposite   real trks look like mongols what you see in modern trkey is a mix of greek arab and native anatolian
  turks are 100 turkic warlords from central asia  listen to yourself retard just because theyre muslim doesnt mean they magically transformed
  native anatolian  wouldnt that be lake van kurds in the east is there really anyone else thats anything close to native there
  what do you even mean by native  asia minor has many ethnic groups that have settled over thousands of years
  thats what im saying the only thing i can think of thats been there since the dawn of history are the kurds hugging that lake
  kurds are mede nomads that settled the area and mixed with native mitanni
  greece reconquers constantinople  is forced to sell it to germany to cover debts  germany fills it with turkish refugees  is renamed istanbul again
  based
      the people in istanbul are totally different from the peopme 1000 years ago the ottomans massacred the natives in 1453 and forced deported people in anatolia and the balkans to and from constantinople anatolian peasants have moved in since the 20th century and now turkey allows sunni immigrants from central asia into districts like zeytinburnu
  wtf no they didnt   most just converted to islam and became turks
  unless the victim is muslim black or jew nobody cares
kara boga
  its like how homeless people get away with shoplifting theyre so filthy that people would rather let it go than touch them
  blacks cant be rascist
  they are black
  why do you hate armenians so much
  the turks expelled and forced relocated people between constantinople and anatolia after 1453 people of istanbul now are not the same as before 1453
  ethnically they are pretty similar  and over half the actual population remained
  the ottomans massacred the natives in 1453    cringe    go back to /pol/ or /int/ this is a history board
  lolno
  because theyve had too much contact with turks
  and over half the actual population remained  and was drowned in a deluge of blood from the east turkey has no claim to anything pre conquest
  heyre so filthy that people would rather let it go than touch them    and yet here you are making multiple treads a day about turks
  and yet here you are making multiple treads a day about turks  he probably isnt op turktrash
  keep being obsessed lmao
  lmao  seething
  turkroach
i suppose just as how any other nation in power or existence did  they simply won you nitpick this region but really every nation is the same china mongolia italy spain the us russia the list goes on
  what part of modern day italy and mongolia was genocided of its natives neither of them are currently occupying non italian or non mongol lands
  nato     need turks to buffer the ruskies
  valid point the modern borders of italy and mongolia are shadows of what they were originally and have since retreated to their native inhabitants with the exception of few  what i was trying to point out based on ops question was that the winner decides who stays or goes certainly looking at the nations of the world today these places all have a dark history the us and the americas with its displacement of the natives the legacy of the catholic and protestant sections of christianity and their influence is largely based off religious wars that happened in the 16th19th century as well as the on going wars of sunni and shia muslims my point being that regardless of the crimes committed turkey much like the above mentioned are on the side that won or made very precise actions that lead them to their current postion what i see however is that turkey is just one place out of many and feel as though op is biased in a way
  memes aside the rest of the world was preoccupied with other more pressing problems ie war debt spread of communism rise of fascism etc   regarding the armenians as eastern armenia was occupied by the ussr who had signed the treaty of kars heavily in favour of the turks so they wouldnt follow up their successes in the east as part they had no desire to antagonize the turks since they were busy with the civil war and in eastern europe and had little want for a fiasco in anatolia when the ussr stabilized especially under stalin they changed their minds and began to demand compensation namely in the cessation of pic related     regarding the greeks since the asia minor catastrophe they had no desire to antagonize the turks further since they were struggling quite a bit after a decade of war almost tripling their population through annexation to the north and refugees from the anatolia and bulgaria and did not want to endanger the greeks allowed to remain in east thrace they tried to maintain good relations for trade and to not return to diplomatic isolation which had caused them their loss to the turks     regarding the assyrians as they had no state and formed a small population scattered throughout french syria and british iraq they had little power to convince their colonial rulers to take up their cause
  kek
  theyre also genociding kurds as we speak
  get fucked butthurt armenians we will continue to genocide your entire race
  italian borders  shadows of what they were  italian borders have been basically the same for 150 years or were you implying that italy is new rome ishyddt
read about the masonic jewish young turks and you will see why turkey denies it still
dress up in your most royal military garb while bringing your beautiful wife into a secessionist area not happy with austrian rule and only your driver of your car with a revolver as protection  when a bomb is thrown under your car by a secessionist but fails to detonate refuse to go home and continue the pompous nose rubbing parade until justifiably shot dead along with your show wife later that same day  to say he was asking for it is an understatement he essentially committed suicide

is that their skin is not white enought for the steppe
  windburn isnt sunburn
  you mean too white
  windburn is a myth
they are brown because it gets very sunny up there at times
  crows feet at age 10  damn no wonder the mongols were so tough
  the steppe is the birthplace of the aryans and all the element mark the invaders rejecting them
lots of red meat and thus hyper iron rich blood
  redhead are even more needed of the steppe even in ireland their skin degrade really fast
  central asia is where caucasoid and mongoloud racial types divergered where different races moved east and west and where a great genicide and absorption of european types by mongols took place     those ppl being mixed up is no surprises even gengis is described as being a redhead
  you will never have a qt mongol daughteru you can teach to ride a horse    why live
  try it sometime
    all of these descriptions of him having red hair and green eyes originate from a single persian jew they all cite him and no one else that persian jew was executed by genghis khans descendants for poisoning one of them    the only one who claimed that genghis had red hair and green eyes was the persian jew rashid aldin hamdani who converted to islam and he was trying to draw a parallel between genghis and the persian hero rustam who had green eyes and red hair rashid aldin hamdani was executed by the genghisid mongol ilkhans he served for poisoning the mongol ilkhan öljaitü a descendant of genghis khan genghis khans other descendants in the yuan dynasty like kublai khan commissioned paintings showing him as a dark haired dark small eyed mongoloid rashid didnt even try to claim all mongols looked like that     actual portrait of genghis khan commissioned by his descendants            genghis khan as portrayed in a 14thcentury yuan era album the original version was in black and white original size is 47 cm wide and 594 cm high paint and ink on silk now located in the national palace museum taipei taiwan  circa 1260

why did german concentration camp guards and jews get along well and smile together as in this photo
  jewish prisoners of gęsiówka and polish resistance fighters of the zośka battalion of the armia krajowa after the liberation of the camp in august 1944
  theyre wearing german uniforms dumbass
  those are polish resistance fighters
  where is the photograph from and whats the context how did you come to the conclusion that what youre describing is actually whats going on in the photograph and assuming it is that it can be extrapolated to the relationship between interned jews and nazi camp personnel in general
  oh shit so if i dress myself in a german uniform ill automatically get a german citizenship
  listen to the pilpul  believe the pilpul
  the polish resistance used german equipment dumbass the fact that the person on the far left has a polish armband should signal this to you
    you guys are really bad at your jobs and its weird because you all purportedly believe in physiognomy but cant tell a slav from a germanic if erikas virginity depended on it    
   mobilizing more than two brain cells at a time is jewish subversion
        all this armia krajowa posting is giving me the feels
how credible is this as a source
a wikipedia is as credible as the sources it lists    ive used wikipedia on basically every paper ive written in uni but never referenced wikipedia just the sources it uses
  its not credible because its not a source however the links one wikipedia are sources and most articles are informative
  ive used wikipedia on basically every paper ive written in uni but never referenced wikipedia just the sources it uses  holy cow  what are you studying
not at all a reliable source for anything remotely related to politics which unfortunately includes a lot of historical stuff
wikipedia articles themselves are just a summary of the sources the authors have cited some are great others are shit you need to judge for yourself how well cited and how well summarized an article is
  poli sci    but wikipedia for background information  for example i had to write a research paper on my congressional district historyrepresentative so wikipedia article on those two were very useful as they listed a lot of different articles discussing the history and such     and i dont really see why you say holy cow wikipedia is fairly good for an overview of a topic and as long as their are proper sources you can find more in depth stuff or get a better idea of what do specifically look up
          this is my problem with history i find it totally interesting but the second i find differing accounts usuallly the further back the more contention it really turns me off i could just read it like fantasy but its hard when a vast majority of it is real but not necessarily accurate i dont like mixing
  i find it totally interesting but the second i find differing account  if in court only one party was able to tell their side and judge would make sentence only based on that you couldnt know the truth    you hear both sides and all eyevitnesses then use other psysical evidencearcheology for example and use you own logic to understand what the truth is
  history just isnt the subject for you anon    every event has at least two different tellings
  incredibly tiny brain
  yea but that gets settled in a short amount of time a whole genration of people could live and die thinking of history in a certain way till its disproved not god man very problemtic we have to chnage the way we consider history keep the objective shit close and the contentious shit to the side like if its technological advancements keep that the science and the math will help and figure itself not worth risking who invented and start shit flinging but at the same time were more modern now and everything is met with skeptism so its all bullshit anyway
  naw mate ill stick to math and science you women can gossip about the biggest cocks i just want the end product the music food dress etc
unironically good enough for 95 of anything you brainlets need
  keep the objective shit close and the contentious shit to the side  you simply cant especially prehistoric things are disputable and cant be answered with 100 certainity thats why not mainstream opinion is not automatically wrong and put to other side then there are also personal interests like glory and wewuzzing and logically most people that study for example tuvan history are tuvan which might cause the bias
  yea but that gets settled in a short amount of time
as everyone else is saying its just fine if you use the sources it cites for each entry of course it depends on the actual entry napoleons page is obviously going to be full of better sources than something like the emu war    the hurrr wikipedia bad narrative literally just comes from frustrated high school history teachers that are cheesed that they actually need to instruct their nigger students to not blatantly plagiarize shit and to do actual research
  and why do you cite those books if your professor asks you for example
  yea not worth it only if its used for cinematic adaption we need more stories
  hostory is the most retarded thing to go to school for  questionwhat happened here  answer read book and regurgitate
  yeah fuck having a high school diploma right
  no post secondary dumbass
  this was meant for
  so youre just a stemautist
  im not autist
wikipedia is a pretty good launchpad to whatever research you might be doing you glean from there what the generally accepted version of events were courtesy of their moderators keeping revisionists at bay and youre even given sources from further reading at the bottom  anyways how many times have we had this thread 
reminder that wikipedia says pinochet was a dictator but castro wasnt
  if only there were a way you could change this
  go ahead and try your edit will be removed within 5 minutes and if you try to dispute it youll get banned by drmies or another one of the leftist admins
neither the inca or maya developed the wheel  yet they curved this wall out  we call this history  holy shit people unironically believe that the inca or mayans carved these walls out with stone hammers wtf hahahahahahahahahahahhahahaha
  based and ayylamopilled
carves out a stone wall so precisely that not even water penetrates through it  hahaha yeah bro we just used stone tools hahaha
people in the past were smarter than me and that makes me insecure must be aliens
  must be aliens  nice god of the gaps fallacy    bro we didnt even understand basic metallurgy but look we used keystone cuts  how can people believe this
  stones erode in nature all the damn time from simple forces ingenuity and exploitation of these forces was more than possible     plus what the fuck else where they going to do all day but try and figure this shit out
  who was it then my dude atlantians lizardmen the jewish conspiracy
  be inca or mayan  carve this out with stone tools      stones erode in nature all the damn time from simple forces  stones erode into geometric shapes  hahahahahaha
might be pre/atlantean or w/e    also yonaguni underwater japan      looks like they were gold plated burns at 1kc which is what happened here probably since looted or w/e just a matlet guess    
  if i had to guess and again friend this is a total guess because we simply do not know i would say that there was an intelligent species on earth that probably evolved millions of years before humans and wiped themselves out somehow        it takes at least 30 million years for wood to turn to coal
cant even do trigonometry  build this  my guess is all of this stuff is much much older than we think it is
be inca   carve this out for no reason then leave it
  cant even do trigonometry    citation needed you have no clue what people knew spacial calculus is just recognizing patterns anyone can do it     there is simply no evidence of prehuman super beings and there would be no reason to hide that evidence we must then assume that things are what they appear to be until evidence challenges that assumption
  what is ritual practices
  not even water penetrates through it  lmao    keystone cuts  impressive  lmao
be forth millennium bce  drill holes in stone  for history to be correct we have to ignore archeology am i wrong do you really believe the maya and inca produced this with stone tools and no knowledge of metallurgy
  lmao  proven    impressive  they didnt know metallurgy so why the fuck would they need a keystone cut
  yes    humans are fucking incredible my dude and will do insane things if they believe it to be worth their while imagine that those holes had to be there otherwise you and everyone you know would die now imagine you had thousands upon thousands of people willing to die to make it happen    youd get that shit done
  be ancient architect  carve this out with stone tools  lmfaooo you can see the machine marks
  we cant even do this with todays technology
  yes we can
  magine that those holes had to be there otherwise you and everyone you know would die now imagine you had thousands upon thousands of people willing to die to make it happen  so they were forced to do this then they did nothing with it they just left it there like its waste    puma punku literally kills the historian
  forced to make this  never did anything with it  thanks boss you made me waste my life carving a rock for nothing
  thanks boss you made me waste my life for nothing  thats literally how employment works retard
  nigga you have no context for why they did these things them leaving them there could have a myriad of reasons beyond our comprehension working out why is literally the point of archaeology     why did the greeks make statues of people and just leave them there    why did the egyptians stake a bunch of rocks into a pyramid and leave them there    read any introduction to archaeology jump to the section on ritual practices have fun
randomly change structural design to a dramatically less advanced one in the space of less than 100 years  makes sense    bbut they had sekret knowledge they knew stuff we didnt know
    so why did they change their design from more advanced than we are today to this shit     go on explain why they changed in less than 100 years
  because the budget didnt allow it
be inca  carve out and move hundred ton blocks with stone tools  get wiped out by the spanish because muhhh spears and clubs  hahahahahaha yeah we can build walls that last for thousands of years but we cant even fight a fucking war
  source
  1 not more advanced than we have today not sure why you think that    2 numerous reasons political upheaval that resulted in shifting professional skills and loss of knowledge stalin fucking died since he killed the most competent doctors architectural styles not be simply functional and instead holding some further symbolic meaning aesthetic tastes changing neoclassicism    youre coming at this from a very functionalist perspective and need to open your eyes to a wider possibility of beliefs acting behind the scenes
  also cost obviously sometimes overthinking is bad too
  budget  you dont even know history the inca didnt have money    why are you pretending to know anything about the incas when you dont even know how their economy worked
if anyones ever read jean auels clan of the cavebear earths children series and knows about clan gatherings maybe every human got their sail on for one post younger dryus meeting around x then natives crawl back into old ruins dunno why else abondone
  its from heliopolis at baalbek
  budget is just money    youre a fucking idiot personhours resources political capital are all parts of a budget
  thanks anon
here is a list of the arguments for why and how the inca and maya were able to build these structures that have been presented thus far in this thread  people in the past were smarter  stones erode into geometric shapes  ritual practices  humans are fucking incredible   thousands of slaves  simply beyond our comprehension  big budget  political upheaval    im literally dying right now
it takes a long fucking time to develop metal tools and its important enough to not just disappear like some fad if they did indeed have metal tools wed find them and where and how they made them
im 90 sure this entire thread is bait but on the off chance it isnt op is a complete retard and should be ashamed of himself
  randomly change structural design from building houses out of stone and bricks to houses out of plywood in the space of less than 100 years  makes sense  19th century whypipo were aliens
  aliens  god of the gaps fallacy  what is the london hammer what is this       you simply cannot comprehend that another intelligent species could have evolved before us can you
  bbut anon its (((naturally forming)))
(((screws are naturally formed in coal)))
bbut zahi hawass said that the sphinx and the pyramids are only 30000 years old    he wasnt caught selling ancient artifacts on the black market that never happened hes a good man      
    kek
  here you go op      an intelligent species on earth that probably evolved millions of years before humans and wiped themselves out somehow  this is more plausible to you than the possibility incas were able to build tight stone walls
  what is the london hammer  an accretion developed around a hammer than somebody dropped 40 years earlier its not magic
  but incas had metallurgy
ancient aliens visit earth 300 trillion years ago  they build a whole bunch of random temples around the earth for no particular reason that humans later made religion about  the only evidence these aliens left is the equivalent of jesus face appearing on toast    if you think incas are weird for making stupid stones and leaving them why tf would aliens make stones and leave them
based and redpilled
  needing trig to use 90 degree angles
  are you an expert on masonry of have you just been reading retarded blogs about aliums there is nothing supernatural about it    /his/ is full of fucking brainlets
lefties in this thread could not wrap their head around the concept that progress is not linear not even if you show pictures of how the megalithic architecture o peru is obviously a remnant of a more advanced civilization that blew itself up    they need to believe that trannies and fags are indeed the epithome of civilization otherwise their ideology falls apart this means theyll never accept the obvious and aparent fact that civilization is cyclical
  ok lets not discuss masonry to find answers like we should just turn it into yet another boring ass altright v sjw thread
  its hard to ignore that you are arguing with an hiv infested puertorican antifascist when you have to hear my dude over 9000 times in a thread     degenerates have no choice but argue for a linear progression of civilization since in that epistheme any action that succeeds will be by definition a progress and therefore there is no possible way a behaviour could ever be anticivilizatorial that means their degeneracy gets a free pass and they can pretend that their bullshit is not what is bringing the downfall of civilization over the next century    just imagine that we will reach peak oil over the next a hundred years and by then 3 out of 5 living humans will be illiterate africans living in slums who cant plant cant build have never been taught the intricacies of modern infrastructure or basically anything that can be used to maintain civilization    lol 10 000 years from now people will be arguing in a korean image board over wether or not the hoover dam is 10 000 years old as the conspiratards claim or if it is merely 1000 years old as all the carbon dating of the remains of cavemen seems to imply
    you dont need machinery to carve things like that op if you put an abrasive paste of water and sand between two stone blocks and wiggle them back and forth for a few days they will form a perfectly smooth matching surface between them    these ancient civilizations had a nearly infinite supply of slaves/peasants allowing them to use techniques that arent practical today due to labor costs
  heil hitler based incas tbqh
you underestimate the amount of time people had back then
  
  unironically believes in astrology
  that wasnt the inca though they were another south american group that died out waaayyy before the inca rose to prominence    like heres the thing technology doesnt work on some kind of even curve where different societies invent techniques or machinery at the same time for the same reason you can be really advanced in one area and be hilariously incompetent in another the fact that the south americans didnt have wheels doesnt mean they couldnt make glorified legobuildings which is what those are remnants of
  precession of equinoxes is astrology  yeah sure the solar system is a hoax
  these ancient civilizations had a nearly infinite supply of slaves/peasants  lol no peru didnt had the population density of eurasia by no means
historians btfo
  ancient atlantean survivors fleeing the cataclysm who were small in number but highly technologically advanced obviously settled amongst the natives and ruled over them as gods    duh
itt brainlets dont know how stone is cut with copper tools
cyclopean architecture is unironically kino as fuck
  capricorn and aries are in the wrong places
  its literally astrology though why the fuck would patterns of bright dots in the sky have an impact on history
what the fuck is this thread  apply abbrasion to a stone and you can shape it even drill holes big fucking deal
    capricorn and aries are in the wrong places  yeah whats up with that why go through all the trouble of making astrological charts if you dont even know capricorns the goatfish and aries is the ram
    constellations in the wrong places  the stars are not right  oh now i get what op is on about
  the london hammer is a perfect example of scientists not knowing what the fuck they are doing either way they are wrong
  history is a million times more complex than archaeologists say it is and theres also either a problem with the techniques that they use to date the age of stone or human civilization is older than they say
  either and/or both
  you somehow managed to make astrology and the cyclical universe theory in to a left vs right politics situation you didnt even bother to use an accurate astrological chart fucking hell what a tard
    does this seem interesting/plausible to you
  no mate he is not saying that satya yuga has anything to do with it necessarily being happening in the age of leo or whatever the fuck in that case he is justaposing the maha yuga cycle to the precession of equinoxes because the hindu scripture ascribes the start of the kali yuga with the end of the mahabharatta war in whatever year it was the great year of the precession has to do with whichever sign is at whichever arbitrary direction he picks as a geological time marker since most ancient peoples built structures in alignment with certain stars and therefore a rough dating can be achieved    thats why the constellations are in the reverse order libra being after scorpio instead of before    im not saying i necessarily agree with his calculation of what era we are today since the concept of cyclical history is in my opinion much more flexible than whatever the vedas say so that shouldnt even be pertinent but the precession of equinoxes is an useful calendar regardless of the arbitrary signs used to represent constellations
  eurasia  do you mean asia and the middle east
  the inca knew about wheel technology they made childrens toys with wheels but because of the mountainous environment wheels werent practical    op is just a whtoid cucked by brownies from hundreds of years ago who were smarter than him
  wheels are useful in all environments and terrains what a load of bullshit
the global floods set humans back quite a bit
  stones erode in nature all the damn time from simple forces  over thousands of years you absolute clown
  the inca knew about wheel technology they made childrens toys with wheels  youre thinking of the aztecs
  you can with sand and copper make accurate cuts into stone and minerals  stop underestimating human craftiness  
  ya know op while i dont agree with you at all i think people would be much more willing to listen to you if you wernt acting like an autter faggot right now
cutting stone is really hard lol  this thread
  no
  therefor aliens
  dont see why you need copper there mate8088
wow theres actually people falling for this shitty troll
  thanks 
  ayy lmao
aliens confirmed
    cringe and muttpilled
why is /his/ so filled with faggots   isnt a good explanation for the structures found in peru
  stones erode into geometric shapes  yeah they do actually you fucking moron  where do you think geometric shapes come from you think that shit is just imagined no many molecules form bonds in geometric shapes because they are the most stable
that london hammer shit is fucking absurd and you have to be illiterate in concept of metallurgy to believe it iron oxide does not protect iron from rusting even one atom of it causes whole iron item to rust into dust i am an archaeologist specialized in medieval europe and i have found myself iron items which were 500 even 200 years old most of them are inrecognizable scraps of rust by now thats why we invented and use steel and you even have to fight that on your stupid car if you make a dent in it otherwise it will rust away in few years    about that shit with more regular blocks in building being older than less regular well guess what you dont even need a societal collapse for that its the same with medieval stone churches in europe we fucking date them basing on how regular masonry is and more regular is older because at first people were more invested in it and later building village churches was common thing and done the fastest and cheapest way
  apparently the guys who carved  used bronze or copper tools and the incas made up some rediculous story about gods building those ruins because they were supposedly the first great civilization or something and they didnt want to admit that there were groups before them
  so whats more likely some variant of stonecarving technique that we have observed in other ancient civs or alien reptilian lazors
  the inca didnt build all those structures although they built things in imitation of them and the constructions in question significantly predate their rise simple
  what is this building style called i would like to have my home modeled like this beautiful such amazing detail that cant end to amaze me if cities looking like this existed then it was in a pure libertarian society as not even now we are able to have such quality building in our cities
  you underestimate the time it takes for stone to erode what will remain after 12 years from now mount rushmore the great pyramid nyc
  what amazes me with people the most is how utterly stupid they are i have a strong feeling that this is one of the only boards that is full with npcs   riddle me this you soulless monkeys why is the idea of time so complicated to you why can you not play with the idea that there has been a civilization on this earth before us the concrete jungle we live in will erode away in an instant just because there is no proof of the civilization existing does that mean they didnt exist what if the remains of the civilization is buried under another 12000 years of sediment and melted glacial waters the idea is not as crazy as you might imagine in your monkey brain what if our blue dot passed trough a meteorite shower from outer space and wiped out our best and brightest   do not close your mind for new ideas as an earlier poster in this thread mentions trannies and fagots are not the epitome that we strive for there are different ideas and possibilities that we all can take
  the constructions in question significantly predate their rise  proof
  prove that they dont 
  just because there is no proof of the civilization existing does that mean they didnt exist  just because something isnt impossible doesnt mean its a good idea to assume that something exists without evidence you retard its called russells teapot now go read a book and never post here again
  thats not how the burden of proof works
    no no you dont understand  its just the most likely explanation the inca didnt do everything and in fact their own folklore attests to this    tiwanaku for example is well known to predate them significantly and has the same kind of stonework    see the problem is im not really sure anyone actually knows how old that place is    the age of the site has been significantly refined over the last century from 1910 to 1945 arthur posnansky maintained that the site was 1100017000 years old78 based on comparisons to geological eras and archaeoastronomy beginning in the 1970s carlos ponce sanginés proposed the site was first occupied around 1580 bc9 the sites oldest radiocarbon date this date is still seen in some publications and museums in bolivia since the 1980s researchers have recognized this date as unreliable leading to the consensus that the site is no older than 200 or 300 bc101112 most recently a statistical assessment of reliable radiocarbon dates estimates that the site was founded around ad 110 50170 68 probability13 a date supported by the lack of ceramic styles from earlier periods14
  occams razor
  you know that stone drills have existed for centuries right
  is that the only viewpoint what do their peers say    find 5 five other independent sources with differing viewpoints and make comparisons
  somebody in the far future will come to the same conclusion as people in this thread when they see the archaeological remains of these buildings kek
  no u
if they had say metallurgy then where are the remains of the infrastructure necessary to build such tools where are the mine remains the slags garbage dumps full of metal and the tools themselves    also have you ever tried stonemasonry like at all do you have any knowledge about it did you do any stoneworking experiments or just make claims based on fee fees
  im failing your paper then for confirmation bias
  it simply doesnt fits what we know we have stone tools used by ancient hominids going back hundreds of thousands of years we have their skeletal remains going back millions of years we have the fossil record where we can trace steps of evolution  so where does this intelligent species fit in such intelligence and civilization would imply lot of specimens and lot of remains sure some stuff gets buried deep but its just random distribution and large numbers that eventually we should find traces of most stuff that lived on earth even if this preglacial civilizations major settlements are all under water did they just avoid everything inland did they not have trade routes outposts did they only have settlements on shores were they incapable of moving inland away from a sea rising perhaps a few centimetres per year    these ideas are ridiculed because theres nothing tangible to back them up all these nutheads have is claiming certain ancient people must have been influenced by someone else else they couldnt do this or that frankly this strikes me as little more than ignorance that these people have little idea about what we already know and also lack practical skills to contextualise finds im sorry but if you claim they couldnt do this kind of stonemasonry then i have to wonder what kind of stoneworking knowledge and experience do you have to make such claims you claim that these people who had all the time in the world couldnt through trial and error work out methods you dont need high theoritical mathematics to do amazing things the romans couldnt either yet we still awe at their constructions they arrived at them through trial and error also said buildings tend to be very overengineered and able to carry much greater burden than what they do then they just made guides for proportions and thats it any provincial engineer then could design the same
related article  nasa scientists looked into whetever ancient civilizations could exist before us    in short yes there would be evidenceif the civilization existed in the past couple million years beyond that harder to say professor adam frank gavin schmidt suggest that a shortlived civilization of 100000 years would be easy to miss using our current methods if it rose and fell before the paleocene epoch pre 66 mya    
  personally i would love to see someone recreate even a small portion of sacsayhuaman with copper saws and wet sand and river cobbles    but i just dont think its possible
  the thing is these cultures and civlizations made these tools and building methods through lot of tries perfected them like an of evolutionary algorithm until they either got what they wanted unlikely teological assumption or found out the stuff that dude made can be used for this and that and proceeded to mass adopt it they didnt just magically started to make these perfect cuts day one and the shitty ones they demolished for their stones simple survivalship bias
even if we didnt recover a single metal artifact wed still have dated evidence of metal smelting in lake sediments i refer you to the example of the metal smelting record in the andes where centuries of sporadic on and off metal working is recorded layer by layer in the lacustrine sedimentary record    these records document the use of metal smelting through the rise and collapse of three civilisations the wari the inca and the colonial spaniards the information is detailed allowing to pinpoint evolving changes in technology and also ore sourcing the existence of a metal using civilization 13 000 years ago would be blatantly obvious and our study of such recent strata would have noticed them by now better still each individual layer corresponds to a yearly cycle and can be precisely dated by counting backward as it stands the oldest evidence we have for metal use is a 7000 year old copper awl found in israel    see    cooke colin a et al a millennium of metallurgy recorded by lake sediments from morococha peruvian andes environmental science  technology 4110 2007 34693474
  i would love to see someone recreate even a small portion of sacsayhuaman with copper saws and wet sand and river cobbles  you can you dont want to because youre a moron who doesnt know how to search for evidence outside your schizo aliums blogs
  faggot      see what youre getting at is all right and good but that doesnt mean the inca are responsible for everything theyre credited with
  cringe and spiritsciencepilled
  dumbass those crude side walls are colonial as well as a small portion of the fineworked inner section in the top and the left sides you can see mortar was used in the joints and stones corners werent worked to give that sense of depth incas liked so much    probably an earthquake demolished most of the building in the colony and the doorway was one of the few things still in place/one of the things worth saving
    i took some lectures on prehistoric times and one professor said he often offers students they dont have to write a paper for the course if they can manufacture a hand axe and document how they did it but he only got a bunch of people with injured hands does that mean making hand axes was absolutely impossible back then
  haha no however it does suggest to me that even very basic knowledge and fundamental technologies are lost to time and that our civilization is very fragile
its amazing how many people like op there are who think humans were useless naked featherless bipeds before bronze or even the wheel came around  disregarding the fact they grossly underestimate the insane time and manpower it took to create these humans were just as intelligent back then as they are now and just because it took longer doesnt mean they didnt build monuments or relatively great architecture
  just because people were incompetent now means they were incompetent back then    anon i worked at a community college garden and whenever we have demos 90 of the students had never used a shovel    same goes for things like perspective drawing there was a time when that technique was learned then forgotten then relearned     now was the walk built by the inca empire they did have one of the most efficient civic programs in the world but i could have just easily have been an ansestorial people    but youre honestly no better than the ancient alien fags who think the structures in egypt couldnt be done just because modern day people are poorly organized and dont want to work 12hrs for years we are way weaker in character and work ethic than ealier people
    in the upper right section you can see they used some of the fallen stones to rebuild the wall
  people like op there are who think humans were useless naked featherless bipeds before bronze or even the wheel came    pretty sure op is actually suggesting people were way more advanced in the distant past than weve recently assumed to be the case    they grossly underestimate the insane time and manpower it took to create these  no they say the mainstream explanation is an unfathomable underestimation of the labor needed to actually construct these with the technology they were supposed to have possessed and that the explanatory gap requires a extreme reinterpretation of the available facts
  they are credited with  they didnt build 50 fortresses they built actually 49  big deal they are responsible for sacsaywaman and the popular fortresses    tiwanaku structures are older yet the sofistication and dificulty are not even comparable    cry me a river schizo
  they obviously did a great deal of work on it that you can see here  but the lower levels of construction are older faggot  no real argument or ability to actually advance your position so you just ad hom and believe whatever the authority people tell you like a little baby    you say the inca built all these sites within a single century but you cant actually substantiate this you just expect people to accept it as true or youll call them tinfoil it looks bad like you still have something to prove    as if it was impossible for the predecessors of the inca to do such things you deliberately uplift the inca massively above the rest of these people but with little justification        in fact youre so fucking obsessed with the inca having all the credot that youve revealed you actually dont know the first fucking thing about this subject    killke culture flourished in highland peru in the late intermediate period around what is now cusco they built the massive fortress saksaywaman during the 12th century later the fortress was used by the inca following their occupation of the region  the killke culture occupied the south american region around cusco peru from 900 to 1200 ad prior to the arrival of the incas in the 13th century1    btfo  t  f  o    now suck my big cock you fuckfaced dumbass
    wut thats just shitpost incas certainly attested older sites as preinca but also claimed their own as inca they even told us sacsaywaman cyclopean architecture was built under the reign of tupac yupanqui    aside from carbon dating one can easily discern between preinca sites and inca ones as inca architecture is fucking well discernable it has its specific shapes and scales characteristic composite forms such as kancha walls are always leading sightly inward doorways niches windows are trapezoidal etc you would have to be fucking blind in order to be unable to distinguish between inca and noninca/preinca architecture in words of alexander von humbolt who in 1802 visited many now gone inca ruins in northern peru and ecuador    what seems to me worthy of the highest interest is the uniformity of construction that one perceives in all the inca monuments it is impossible to examine attentively a single edifice of inca times without recognizing the same type in all the other monuments     so people are pretty damn sure when a place is preinca or inca even early chroniclers who visited sites like tiwanaku or wari clearly saw them as noninca at first glance unlike they did with inca sites like sacsaywaman    after the early colonial era some later chroniclers would ascertain the opposite claiming incas brought civilization to the andes and nothing of worth happened before them late colony chroniclers would speculate mere men couldnt build thighs such as sacsaywaman and thought perhaps natives were aided demons these beliefs clearly contrast with earlier ones made just after the conquest of the inca earlier chroniclers ascertained thousands of men built sites such as sacsaywaman incas even told them stories of how sometimes those poor conscripted workers died crushed in the transportation of the huge boulders
  yonaguni is a natural formation the bedrock there is made up of slate that breaks up in even sided rectangles pic related is from the cliffs of the nearby yonaguni island see how it breaks off into steps now imagine that its a strong ocean current causing the erosion instead of winds
  they had copper chisels where the fuck did the meme that maya and aztec were stone age come from
  tupac  disregarded this is /history/ not rap /mu/sic
  two diiferent constructions for two different purposes the other is a simple enclosure wall while the building is made from larger more permanent blocks
  inca sites like sacsaywaman        inca architecture is fucking well discernable it has its specific shapes and scales characteristic composite forms such as kancha walls are always leading sightly inward doorways niches windows are trapezoidal etc    all youve done here is looked at all the structures that have those traits and defined inca architecture as having those traits beyond that it ignores the examples of inca architecture that dont have those traits    incas even told them stories of how sometimes those poor conscripted workers died crushed in the transportation of the huge boulders    which huge boulders the fuckhuge ones at the base or the regular huge ones on top of the base the thing about inca sites is there are usually obvious levels of construction where different methods were used as if the inca were building on top of an older site
  more step formations from yonaguni iskand
  where the hell did this misunderstanding that the walls of sacshayaman were built by the killke culture come from the killke formed the earliest fortress there but the stone walls were made by inca in typical inca fashion later its literally just a misreading of the source
  it literally says this on the first heading of the wiki article  sections were first built by the killke culture about 1100 they had occupied the area since 900 the complex was expanded and added to by the inca from the 13th century they built dry stone walls constructed of huge stones
  the thing about inca sites is there are usually obvious levels of construction where different methods were used as if the inca were building on top of an older site    no they just used different levels of sophistication for specofic needs the stonemortar walls you lorded before us as proof of different levels of sophistication were not saa upporting structures so they didnt need to be made from large blocks
  it means you attend a shit tier university    also thats like saying i tried figure drawing for the first time but was bad at it does that mean drawing people in the past was absolutely impossible back then
saying stone tools over and over doesnt make it true retard
  btfo by   incans built and knew how to make those structures with giant trapezoidal polished rocks    now cry me a river schizo
  faggot
  insult  great
  thats homophobic against faggots like you
  insult  nice
    btfo
      killke culture      these are the killke ruins in sacsayhuaman not even fully killke as they continued to be used and modified in the inca era as temples the huge boulders in sacsaywaman are late inca as they had the resources to pull off something like that millions of subjugated peoples preinca expansion cultures in the valley of cusco were rather small in population and unorganized seriously read a fucking book i recommend the inka empire a multidisciplinary approach    plus killke usually referred as early inca previous to the inca imperial expansion is just a catchall term for all tribes inhabiting the cuscos valley before inca expansion it refers to the at least 6 groups inhabiting the area previous inca consolidation kanchis kanas kavina kuyos pinagua and ayamarca maras and tambos the inca ancestors settled around midera and are also considered to be part of them late inca considered those previously noninca folks kanchis kanas etc to be an extension of themselves as they intermarried them and needed them for administrating their empire because now ethnicinca were a very small minority controlling an enormous extension of land i believe it was during the reign of pachacuti who proclaimed all the people in cuscos surroundings to be considered inca since they had an almost similar culture language architecture etc due to close contact unlike more distant foreigner natives
      this shit makes much more sense if you see electric universe and planetary scarring as viable explanation   idea that earth could seen some extremely shit that could potentially change continents in matter of days or weeks burn whole ecosystems transform surface etc hell it could easily fuck up all mainstream dating methods
  neither the inca or maya developed the wheel  thats not true at all we found toys with wheels they knew about wheels they just didnt want to use them for unknown reasons
  they are doing it wrong deliberately to fool viewers into thinking it is a mystery professional masons can split solid granite into a near flat face with just a few precision taps of a hammer        bronze is 3/4 as hard as iron so it wasnt impossible it just took a little more elbow grease
  i seriously hate this asshole and im all about /x/ shit
    thats just wrong literally anyone can put shit on wikipedia  give a quote from any reputable inca scholar rowe shimada urton anyone
  thanks for this killke is always invoked in this bullshit but it was very hard to find anything on them
  hail atlantis
  anyone can write graham hancock tier pseudohistory bullshit in a blog too
  thats like not granite though and theyre using powerdrills and steel not really comparable  hell ive done about as good a job with a sledge back when i worked on some stonewalls    those chisels/saws were copper too    doing it wrong deliberately  how like what could they be doing better
  for the record eroding stones by grinding them against each other in order to produce axe heads is a fundamental technique of neolithic tool building     a society that can make a stone axe understands more or less everything it needs too in order to produce piedra maciza in the same way a paste of water and abrasive material inserted between two stones which slaves are made to push back and forth     native americans invented the wheel btw they also werent uniformly stone age either what they couldnt invent was a beast of burden fit to carry a wheeled cart up the andes     inb4 llama  lamas are kikeniggers who hate being told what to do and dont have the strength to walk up a mountain day in day out with 100kg of cart and 200kg of load strapped to them a llama cart is almost exclusively hobbyist bullshit still    inb4 bison  a bison is a 2 ton monster than will rampage and kill you theyre aggressive as fuck     all in all chemtrails/10 consider suicide before the reptoid dinodudes get you
  native americans invented the wheel  haha no
  why would the inca leave copper chisels and pounding stones at the site if they didnt use them to fuck with us
  prove my claim wrong  burden of proof schizo
  a bison is a 2 ton monster than will rampage and kill you theyre aggressive as fuck  how do you think that cows dogs and horses were before we domesticated them
  cows  no such wild auroch in precolumbian northamerica  dogs  they had dogs  even patagonids domesticated a new species of wolfs unfortunately white settlers massacred them off  horses  horses were domesticated by herders who already had contact with domesticated cattle and knew about it from other cultures 6000 years after the neolithic revolution    horses got extinct in north america before natives even had sedentary agriculture    bison  not even europeans domesticated their own bison of europe which is the best analogue for the american bison    and we dont even know if natives managed to tame the american bison there is no evidence they didnt domesticate them
  call everyone schizo you must think everyone with a contrary opinion is the same person  youre retarded
  typing schizo magically makes you a schizo  amazing
  wolves are smart and social enough to be tamed if you get them young   bison are highly aggressive territorial and more than twice the weight of cows and horses
  graham hancock  right about anything
  mere projection
  it is a hoax
  literally retard  being mad and desperate is not an argument quit acting like a leftist
  with retards like grahams worshippers itt i think so
  an atom of iron oxide
  didnt say that youd need copper only that you can do that as early as the time man discovered copper and perhaps even earlier than that  point is the contrarian op here underestimates how autistically dedicated the craftsmen of the olden days may have been  even more importantly who said it had to be hammers for all we know those blocks could have been meticulously polished or sanded to fit together hammering only to get the rough approximate shape first
  forgot to say that steel or maybe even bronze may have been the first time people could actually brute force a material into a desired shape or use so to speak
  hulk hogan
  they did use them at the site nobody is disputing they did a ton of work there    they just didnt do everything you know
  they didnt build 50 fortresses they built actually 49  big deal they are responsible for sacsaywaman and the popular fortresses    tiwanaku structures are older yet the sofistication and dificulty are not even comparable    cry me a river schizo

    its called hand fitting you retarded mutt people have been doing it since time immemorial you take oneoff parts and file/chip them into shape until you get the desired fit it takes skill time and effort yes but no advanced machinery or mathematics     where dimensional accuracy becomes impressive and scientific is in interchangeability and mass production those walls have neither hand fitting is time consuming but conceptually simple what is complicated is getting millions of parts that could all fit the same tight fit     t mechanical engineer
  we dont know some fiddly detail therefore aliums  their immediate predecessors built it using the same technology fuck off back to /x/
   ed man old as coal conrad
all of you are retards        the mesoamericans used wheels on toys and for potttery production and may have used them on siege towers we only know tthem from a single mural so its hard to say they used and understood wheels they just didnt use them for transportation      wheels are useful in all environments and terrains what a load of bullshit    not extremely so if you dont have beasts of burden as was tthe case in mesoamerica or lived in a literal mounain range the andes it may have had uses but they were less obvious with those factors in play even in eurasia you didnt see the invention of wheelbarrows and other carts without animaldriven elements till 0ad    on the flip side you had a better understanding of tensile physics in both the andes and mesoameriicaa then the old world with the andes making extensive use of suspension bridges and mesoamerica having the worlds first ttrue modern stylee suspension bridge with vertical suspenders supports which is something europeans wouldnt invent till hundreds of years later                  heres a 12 paragraph breaakdown with links to scientific papers detailing the exact construction technique used for this style of masonry in the andes     its less impressive then it actually looks the super tight fitting stone is basically just a decorative outer layer to the more haphazard structural interior          this site is called puma punku and is from the tiwanku not the inca as  pointts out and  it predates them by a little under 1000 years and were contemporaries with the wari    they didnt know metallurgy  metallurgy has a long history in the andes appeaared in mesoamerica around 600ad both regions had bronze smelting as of contact with europeans
   did the incas not ally with the spanish
    bro we didnt even understand basic metallurgy but look we used keystone cuts    native americans north to south did know of basic metallurgy    spear points necklaces halbreds maces jewelry etc
  the incas cast stone anon of /his/ is actually a redditpleb  well colour me surprised
  ancient civilizations were way more advanced than we think they were were kidding ourselves all the secrets are locked away by the elites we are basically goyim slaves fuck this gay earth
  underrated post
  heil hitler way ahead of their time desu
  halbreds  lol no    the rest it depends which natives youre talking about    only the inca had bronze and that was largely restricted to the elite  most of their men were outfitted with copper star maces / axes or stone    to my knowledge only the occ and related na groups made widespread use of copper spearpoints
  i never claimed aliums were necessarily responsible although the inca do talk about beings suspiciously like them    all im implying is people who existed before the inca were probably more advanced than weve assumed
  euromutts cant into dont worry about em
  lol what the fuck is this
what is wrong with stealing what makes an object the rightful property of a particular person
  nothing wrong with stealing if you can get away with it
  your ability to defend it  if you dont hold it you dont own it  chris duanne on precious metal investment    likewise via an extension of self ownership you own your actions you also own your ignorance
not respecting property just causes chaos so overwhelming majority will have way less stuff simple as   not that i dont agree with you theres nothing sacred about property its just an useful concept without which civilization can hardly exist
  stealing not being suppressed would make society suck more its really one of the basic foundations of civ
  cook food to eat  someone steals it  do nothing about it and just try to cook more  same person steals it again  repeat  starve    in a nutshell
we are social animals that work synergetically together stealing breaks the trust between us hindering the cohesion
  because if you steal from me ill raise up a mob and quarter you
categorical imperative
  its just an useful concept without which civilization can hardly exist  thats what they want you to believe      stealing not being suppressed would make society suck more  if you have an economy and someone is rich that is basically already stealing from others because money and goods are limited  the reason he is not punished is because he is playing their game    the concept of stealing only works with property rights and when those rights are done away with is when society will move forward  civilization tries to hide human nature it doesnt create order
  stealing in and of itself is not wrong for any objective reason but if you desire to have/live in a functional society you should uphold laws against theft
  what kind of haha morale doesnt exist im so evil boohoo shit is this
  civilization tries to hide human nature it doesnt create order    thats quite the claim lol
  why not extend your hypothetical to body parts what if they wanted to steal hands and feet what if someone wants your feet on their desk
  suppressing human nature is how you create order you moron unless you want the natural order  running around and flinging shit at your neighbors to assert dominance
  i dont think he expressed what he was trying to say very clearly    sure human nature at its most basic level is tribalistic we form bands based on blood/language/beliefs etc and everyone who isnt us can fuck off we can kill and steal from other tribes for survival because us is more important than them    but civilization and how its progressed is itself natural because humans come from nature and this is how we have organized ourselves over the course of thousands of years its more or less just a more broad form of tribalism in that we limit the every whim of the individual to better the whole of the civilization
  good argument
nothing inherently stealing is only wrong if youre tough enough to protect or recover your property or if youre protected by someone who can    my family got rich ages ago by terrorizing people and stealing their stuff too bad so sad
  suppressing human nature is how you create order  thats a path that leads down to destruction because one day human nature will break free tenfold when it is addressed by others like it was once  you cant have true civilization without embracing human nature  the true body of human nature will find its way through cracks in the false civilization and manifest itself regardless
  basically     even among warlike tribes who enjoy pillaging the rules are clear     stealing from people within the group is evil     stealing from people outside the group is clever righteous daring or simply an act of recovering property which the gods originally gave to your people
  yes that is what i was trying to say sorry if i wasnt clear
it does not make other people happy and it does not benefit society     therefore it is immoral
  if you have an economy and someone is rich that is basically already stealing from others  oh my fucking god leftypol every thread get a better job or a job
  kant was a shitty philosopher and constantly contradicted his own statements
  what if it makes me unhappy that someone believes they have the right to something because it fell into their hands first
  nothing
  do you think there is any country that has ever existed where stealing someones food or clothes is acceptable why would anyone be ok with that who isnt mentally ill
  stealing would render our trade system pointless as we would just rob each other
  you own your mind and your body so you own that which comes from the mind and the body that simple if you argue that nobody truly owns their own mind and body then all of human interaction and systems created by us are bizarre contradictions which is incredibly unlikely and unsatisfactory to my intuitive sense of existential justification
  its not about you though its about others the object has a connection to the first person as they had it longer this system leads to benefiting society the most as more people will be making stuff purely from the fact of knowing it wont be stolen anyways
what is wrong with stealing  nothing if you dont get caught
its mean anon if someone works their butt off to grow some corn or buy a new vidya they deserve to benefit from that in some way because without them creating things there wouldnt even be an option to steal if you steal youre usually lazy and cant make stuff yourself it doesnt really make you smarter because if thieving was actually viable longterm and smarter than doing all the physical work everyone would be doing it and then no one would create and there would be nothing new to steal
  what if they didnt work for what they have
  well you could steal from them and maybe itd be less immoral but its the same end result theft defeats itself by leaving nothing new to steal and nothing produced if you steal a nice car from some stupid trust fund baby dude who hasnt worked a day in his life and has more money then god anyways then certainly id say its practically less immoral/damaging then if you were to mug a poorer guy for the 50 bucks in his pocket that he needs to feed himself idk but someone worked for that money at some point in the lineage making money with money through investments etc is where im not really sure about but im sure you can continue applying similar standards
  all that really exists even in modern society is might makes right ultimately the reason people sometimes choose not to commit crimes is that they fear some great might will strike them down for doing so  whether thats the law god the person they committed the crime against their own conscience/selfimage or whatever the only reasons anyone ever does anything are because they had no choice or because they chose to so it follows that an incentive is needed to favour not crime over crime and that incentive is fear of reprisal not always a scared fear it can be a more logical fear  without the laws god etc i mentioned all we have left is a freeforall where individually strong people do what they want at the expense of everyone else with laws even strong people realise they cannot overpower the whole of society and so they are deterred from theft is less theft a good thing well theft reduces the incentive to strive towards making or producing great things since it is likely that they will be stolen if theyre actually any good it also stifles attempts at trading since why shouldnt the stronger person in the trade just take what the other person has and trade quite clearly leads to increased wealth and by association prosperity many people are also going to be injured or killed in theftrelated struggles further weakening the society so overall i would say that less theft is a good thing and outlawing it and making those who would normally be capable of getting away with theft wary is a good idea
    what about stealing from thieves mobsters and so on
  t kant
i will harm maybe kill you if you try to steal from me  i have banded with others who also adhere to notions of private property and we act in mutual defense
  come and take it
   why should i cook if someone keeps stealing my food   decides to steal someone elses food    no one cooks   distrust among everyone
  capitalism property society
  if you allow this you will quickly find out many millions of people are more skilled thieves than you or simply much stronger than you and you wont much like what happens when they extend the idea of property to your family and body
  you replied as if you disagreed with me but you wrote a post that agrees
  our trade system is largely based off ripping off consumers and workers already
  implying    how do you explain decades no millenia of societal advancements which have only increased the repression of our nature and with no sign if stopping surely this all would have catastrophically failed at some time in all those years
was india the only known place where indoeuropeans had a racial caste system that permitted only ethnic ie into high roles
bump
bump
there are dravidian brahmins you moron
  only recently
  why would civilised aryans mix with barbaric spear chucking abo dravidians
    every brahmin family can trace bloodline to 2000 bc or some shit including dravidians         you tell me
  no persia and sparta were pr strict on it too same with egypt pretty much everywhere
  the chastes are not based on races they are based on competence its not the aryans fault that dravidians are subhuman animals
it didnt everywhere the pie went they bred with the locals in some form modern euros are a threeway cross between pie anatolian farmers and neolithic huntergatherers    india is just a bigger clusterfuck and includes dravidians
the pie social structure was organized with kings at the top not priests    and varnas are a reflection of your spiritual nature aside from that theyre irrelevant jati has always been more important than caste     i mean the sages valmiki and vyasa were both from lower varnas but their spiritual prowess obviously had the greatest impact on their place in society brahmins kshatriyas vaishyas shudras and dalits exist wherever vedic hindus exist even lord shiva and lord indra themselves noted that varnas arent very relevant    all indians are a blend of 34 ancient populations jati is what concerns most of us
    south india is objectively superior to north india in basically everything    what are you smoking
  what the  the aryans were steppenigger nomads that had never seen a farm  they invaded a 2000 year old civilisation of towering structures sprawling urban centres and complex sewage systems  have you never heard of the indus valley civilisation
  relax bro its just delusional whitespic people from /pol/ who think northerners are white like them and by extension want to live vicariously through us in fantasies about blonde haired blue eyed swedish atlanteans
  egypt  indoeuropean  the fuck
  the pharaos
  no  wtf
  thats why they married their family there simply were no other aryans around to mate with
  bro you would not believe it i just got back from a trip to 800 bc in northern india and shit was so crazy i was expecting a sociocultural reality much different to our own with concepts customs aesthetics etc that would seem completely alien to ourselves but guess what it was literally just modern white people lording over a bunch of streetshitting black people like they spoke english and everything     i asked whether they had any sort of sagely knowledge about the secrets of the universe or how to harness the power of nature for ones benefit or anything like that but nope they just had a couple of temples to thor and odin and other than that just worshipped the fact that they were somehow as white as modern scandinavians despite starting out tanned themselves and interbreeding with brownskinned locals for hundreds of years i asked them if they knew about moksha yoga siddhis samadhi and so on and they just laughed and called me a basedboy cuck     confused i decided to ask the dravidian underclass who were literally just modern day australian aboriginals what they thought of their aryan masters and they told me that before the aryans had arrived they had no idea about language agriculture religion sex the ability to feed themselves or how defecate in any place other than the communal pathways they literally existed in some terrifying selfperpetuating morass of consuming energy from th earth and defecating endlessly     eventually i decided to return to our time and bring back knowledge of what i saw but not before one of the aryans ran up to me and out of breath yelled out heil hitler
  holy based
what about colonial spain
  indus valley was white
  stop believing every uncited fart that comes out of vargs assmouth
  lol
  dravidians are white
can anyone prove that ancient civilisations like greece had an ethnically distinct ie nordic ruling class and by ruling class i mean anyone that ever did anything cool
  yeah here are some ruling class nordic persians
  not all nordics are blonde
  no because this was not the case in fact the leaders were probably more mixed than the commoners like all steppe populations female exogamy was common in indoeuropeans this means they were looking for wives outside of their tribe
  we even have some examples of this in indoeuropean myths such as romans kidnapping sabine women
  holy shit
  indus had degenerated already when the aryans came
  prove it shitskin
  because of a shift in the course of the indus river and a bunch of other natural disasters
  not according to white aryan literature
    biology seems to indicate that egypt is distinct from the indoeuropean bloodlines to say the pharaohs were indoeuropean is literally we wuz kangs
  r1a isnt the only marker for ie
  what others are there i wish to learn more
in 3000 bce the blue eyed blonde haired whites arrived in india to build mohenjodaro actual name mary de jared     did you know this no of course not the history of the world has been blacked throughout by (((them)))    for example we know about the chinese philosopher sun tzu he was not chinese if you look at his depictions they show blue eyed blonde haired nordic people his real name was son of zeus    another one after the fall of mary de jared another nordic man arrived in india with his armies aryans and his name was paul john heet pajeet for short he wrote the rigveda actual name rigged vagina  his treatise on how to live without sex ie by writing hymns    little does anyone know the kamasutra is actually named kikelslutta slut of the kikes in protoindoeuropean talks about how black men were able to have sex with white nordic women thanks to the kikes    all these civilizations we read about were actually blonde haired blue eyed whites now lets see how other races about    2000 years ago in the land of africa there was a black man he had 4 black children he asked the 4 of them to choose anyone of the following  1 money  2 spices  3 sandpaper for scribbling  4 nothing  the one who chose money evolved into the jews the one who chose spices evolved into indians and the one who chose sandpaper evolved into arabs then these people spread away from africa where they destroyed and pillaged white civilisations now only blue eyed blonde haired nordics are the purest form of the original white race all the rest are mutts      this
  varg did this
  persia and egypt were pretty strict    they are based on race lol but its almost exclusive to india and incidental in other ie cultures     thats not an indoeuropean you subhuman faggot
    r1b was pressent in egypt not a high pressence but a pressence nontheless
  actual name rigged vagina  you bastard
  thats not an indoeuropean you subhuman faggot  the funny thing is there is no way to prove he is or isnt sinc ethere is no known dna results for him other than that he is a red head and red heads are r1b and r1b is ie so ur an faget
  they look exactly like your standard abdul and hamed
  its almost exclusive to india and incidental in other ie cultures   prove it  its not like the nordic indoeuropean showed up in shitskin anatolia and thought to himself im going to marry that inbred roach
  every brahmin family can trace bloodline to 2000 bc  i nee proof without pajeet quora links
  he thinks brahmins racemixed with brown people
  lmao i used to get upset in sight of it but at this point its mostly comedic to me though the decline of our civilization both of past and in present makes me very upset and it is irritating to have to see these vultures also seeking to distort it for their own
  prove it wrong shitskin  yamnaya were nordic northern europeans have most yamnaya ancient civilizations like hittites and greeks had an apartheid nordic ruling class that did everything relevant and only failed when they racemixed to make modern roaches and lolwhite gayreeks
  red hair is also a northwest semitic and north mesopotamian trait
  i just realized    stormfags are the white equivalent of afrocentrists so ashamed of their own history that they try to steal others
  i cant wait until black men breed these crackers out of existence
  heil hitler  except we have proof  ie were nordic and were a racial ruling class in ancient civilizations   prove me wrong
  
  not all nordics have blonde hair  greek ruling class was still ethnically yamnaya
  there are dravidian brahmins and ie sudhras caste system originated to pass on group privileges of certain occupations to their children caste system does not have the modern racial element to it these ideas came much later to justify colonialism
  good fiction you got here
  go back to /pol
  the white equivalent of afrocentrists  i once described varg this exact way
  lets change the definition of nordic
  ie werent nordic they were east euros
  north europeans have too much lbk shitskin component to be the closest to pie    inb4 haak et al  it will prove me right even though its outdated germanic retards should stop stealing eastern european history
  heil hitler    be lbk farmer germanoid  claim you are aryan  actual descendants of aryans rape your farmer women  your e1b farmeroid ruler comits suicide  based
  eastern europeans have too much shitskin med component uralics are true ie not mutt slaves
  true ie doesnt even mean anything ies themselves were just mutts of the previous inhabitants of the area that developed a common language     literally every human on earth is a mutt its awesome
  imagine being this retarded the cope of uralicfanboys is getting hilarious
  i guess you could make an argument that the ptolemaic dynasty were ie
  cope harder shitskin nordics have most ie dna  prove that the ie didnt practice racial segregation in greece
  slavs and balts do not scandinavians     east euros raped their way into scandinavia not the other way around
  slavs and balts do not scandinavians  he says without any evidence
  so did you scandinavians have too much enf and tan like meds
  and tan like meds  real convincing argument
  it is the more enf you have the darker your skin is germanics dont tan like white people they get orange/brown now when it comes to steppe ancestry norwegians can be closer to aryans than east euros because of their higher enf component     but cope harder germanophile your people always steal history first you try to steal from meds now from east euros
  cant be
  indians are mixed the whitest brahmins cluster with pakistanis caste system emerged hundreds of years after the aryans moved to india and mixed with dravidians from the indus valley civilization   but the story is much more complicated than that as there were also many primitive hunter gatherers living in india during the aryan conquest they were probably very dark without neolithic iranian dna
  why do 90 of anglos burn in the sun and go pink when according to you and your image they should all tan well like the french clearly there are other factors involved copelet
new presentation about south europe  balearic isles first settled by steppe people  literally the most primitive fucks described by the greeks as borderline retards walking naked and preferring women and alcohol over metals  iranian/chg ancestry in sardinia   suddenly nuragic civilization  are iranians the true creators of civilization every time this ancestry appears a civilization emerges   indus valley  bmac  mesopotamia and sumerians without a doubt  very likely egypt  minoans  mycenaeans   nuragics   maykop best metallurgists and inventors of bronze metallurgy
  iranians along with anatolians yes conversely the appearance of steppe ancestry seems to be associated with destruction
  blablablabla nordics will always look whiter than slavs and i have been to russia poland and to every nordic country    most slavs look like dirty asians even the light ones
  i bet sumerians were basically preie georgians i wouldnt be surprised if kartvelian and sumerian languages are from the same family its quite obvious now that caucasus is the key to understand the emergence of complex societies and civilizations   hell even gobekli tepe was probably created by them evidence from paleolithic and eneolithic anatolia
  sounds to me like you are asshurt at facts
  not at all its just funny to me that you truly think that slavs are superior in any way to nordic people or that you think that anyone in the world besides slavs themselves probably not even them sees slavs as the best/the whitest
  that was not the point you stupid bastard dont project your points on me
  from the abstract  population movement that brought iranrelated ancestry to the aegean also impacted the western mediterranean around the same time the first civilizations started to develop
  the whole idea of steppenigger aryan migrants is likely simply because of butthurt the truth is the yamna based wave had already encountered civilization in the bmac region and there are indications of the interactions not being a bloodbath and instead an instance where the aryans took a lot of cultural aspects from the bmac people the ivc was already dead for a few hundred years before the first aryans reached the former remains of the ivc sites so if anything they would have been a force of bringing more bmac and their own original cultural influence into south asia if anything now since the ivc had already collapsed while before their arrival they might have just found warring tribes and split apart to side with many of them thus resulting in the outcome of the battle of the ten kings where the trtsu and bharata alliance establish a new vedic kingdom so the vedic culture and the later hierarchy would be based on the original aryan culture  bmac culture  remnants of the indus culture
my goodness the stupidity in this thread is quite frankly astronomical firstly there is implicit statistical evidence for all castes mixing here and there until about 1800 years ago secondly we do not see any indications of an organized brahminical caste until the very late vedic/early puranic period and the rahmins didnt gain the social powers they did until the gupta age in the vedic period the only distinction between people was the aryadasyu system now for anyone who claims that brahmins are the most aryan among the modern indian populations think again since the link provided at the end of the sentence indicates that low castes like jats have more northeastern european and caucasian admixture than north indian brahmins link  the links data is very rough as the resolution of the populations is not very clear so maybe a k8 style reanalysis of indian populations along the lines of ihg native indian hunter gatherers chg  neolithic and chalcolithic iranian the group that clusters close to caucasus hunter gatherers whg yeah there is barely any of it in india but you will likely find some trace amounts of it then again even the eastward migrating yamna populations barely had any whg ancestry ehg important component of the yamna descended populations and various ne and se asian components is needed
fucking indoeuros were the biggest racemixers in human history from a new paper about bronze age germany from beaker and postbeaker period  strontium isotope ratios of tooth enamel identified significantly more nonlocal females than males and children together with a diversification of mitochondrial dna haplogroups over time this points to regularly practiced female exogamy
  germany  is that suprising
  so ies were basically incels that couldnt get laid with their own women and had to go for outsiders could this explain why they migrated in the first place if so thats pretty sad
  post beaker period    bell beakers were already 1/3rd yamna and the cordedware were 73 yamna also there is no preyamna haplogroup r1b in europe so any place with substantial r1a and r1b ydna haplogroups got stepped upon
  yup this study was also presented at jena they started as very steppe cwc then bell beakers with more farmer ancestry and then around the middle or late bronze age farmer ancestry started dominating maybe they were riding southerners for women or maybe they were trading women
  i mean think about it the average yamna male without having access to milk was about 59 or 510 on average idk the average height for the specific warrior classes though and that was without milk imagine how tall their descendants would have been after having infants with native euro milk guzzling females on the other hand the average funnelbeaker and native euro basically had a pajeet tier build at a height of 165 cm that is in spite of having access to milk and meat the 10 cm possibly a lot higher mogging alone would have been catastrophic natives in europe and south asia
  incels that enforced their language on the most relevant parts of the world
  would you rather be a tall but ugly mongrel abomination or a short but beautiful aryan funnelbeakers would have mogged ies hard with their superior facial aesthetics ies were only successful because they were violent savages who were able to take advantage of others misfortunes
  not until ptolemy
  australian hand wrote this post
  literally the same shit nigger we wuzzers do   yo holla wite boi look at dis portrayt henry da 8f wuz black  hhey medshit look at this portait alexander was a nord
  doesnt change the fact that im right i bet you think looking like an ogre is the ideal meanwhile farmer chads with godtier facial aesthetics ruled europe with their beauty charisma and intelligence ies took europe from them with their savagery
  ugly  what are you saying modern nordicgermanic and baltic populations are more yamna than any other yet they produce several handsome men also   funnelbeaker  aryan  aryan literally refers to a specific eastern subclassification of yamnadescended individuals the indoiranians
  you cant be that dumb
i wish these threads were more neutral
    forgot to add in the picture that i wanted to link with the post
  roman armies and greek settlers have historically had a precense in greece
  left looks nothing like a horseface on the right
    modern nordicgermanic and baltic populations are more yamna than any other yet they produce several handsome men  all handsome germanic/baltic men have farmerinfluenced faces ies would have looked like the result of a pale ogre and a churka/iranian having children
  farmers were ugly just like scandinavians and germans
  farmer chads with godtier facial aesthetics ruled europe with their beauty charisma and intelligence    farmers had smaller cranial capacities than the yamnaya migrants though however the whg noncivilized individuals had larger cranial capacities than the yamna migrants so brain size may not properly correlate to intelligence and as an extension to this the yamnayarich populations in modern day europe tend to have higher iqs than the non yamnayarich west eurasian populations    also are you the same aussie lad from the /int/ thread yesterday
  churka iranian    more like siberiancircassian mutts but hey they won out in the end and that is what matters the most
still waiting for leftists to prove ie mixed with shitskin barbarians in anatolia greece and india
  muh brain capacity  literally irrelevant    and as an extension to this the yamnayarich populations in modern day europe tend to have higher iqs than the non yamnayarich west eurasian populations  if you ignore balts and slavs maybe but i dont think you can just do that    also are you the same aussie lad from the /int/ thread yesterday  yes leaf 
  italians east asians and jews have higher iq but have low yamnaya
  siberiancircassian mutts  populations forming pie and prapie cultures had nothing to do with siberia for thousands of years     you should be permabanned
  based the only issue i have with the yamnanative mixing is that the yamna were darker than the native women so i normally tend to focus on the bleaching in south asia
  too bad its not happening
  yamna were darker than native women    thank gd youre allowed to hide posts wish you were a tripfag so i would just filter your crap
  actually quite rude and he is right that steppegrels were darker
  funny thing is not a single population with big brain formed a civilization even today siberians and mongolians have bigger brains than the chinese and japanese
  north italians with a higher yamna admixture do better than southrons though also i specifically said west eurasian populations so i shant be dealing with the point about east asians as far as jews are concerned that is only true for ashkenazim jews and they happen to be intelligence possibly due to high selection pressure and possible inbreeding both of which are very recent and the benefits of these do not extend to the nonashkenazim jews       i mentions circassians since they have a lot of chg admixture and siberians since they are close to the ehg people look up the maltaburet culture and the yamna people were varying combinations of chg  ehg possibly some whg traces
  the pie social structure was organized with kings at the top not priests  i mean theres some evidence that in pie society the kings were priests
  they werent darker than enf
  when i say native i am specifically talking about the farmer  shg mutts who were blonde haired blue eyed and fairly white skinned compared to yamna peopl who were largely dark haired dark eyed and slightly lighter than olive skinned      tfw too intelligent to be civilized   they obviously had the issues with civilization sorted out by not civilizing in the first place duh/ s
  north italians are still mostly farmer they cluster with spaniards not with any germans
  shg had brownish skin compared to yamna
  germans are high in enf
  niggers and women have small brains this is why theyre dumb  siberians have big brains but not relative to their large faggot bodies
  heritability means the gene is inherited exactly  inbreeding increases iq
  damn thats some serious cope just accept that brain size isnt everything
  i think big brains are related to geography northern populations have bigger brains and more primitive lifestyle finland today do better at pisa than any other european country and it was one of the most primitive regions of europe for most of the history
  pisa  relevant
  are you sure about that cuz based on what i have read and excavated shg lad from 7700 years ago was full on white      still doesnt change the fact that they have more yamna admixture than southrons and also tend to do better than them oh and finns have more yamna admixture than anyone else and they do a lot better than italians on pisa tests       cope northern celts and northern slavs both average at close to or over 50 yamnaya admixture same goes for germans youd have to go as far south as iberia southern france and the balkans to find more enf than yamna dna
  nordics have the largest brain size relative to their body  this is why hitler recognised them as aryan ubermensch  they get their dna from the nordic ie ruling class  prove me wrong  you literally cant faggot liberal
  just like the iq study made by a fin nationalist and supremacist    shg  full white  should have known that i speak to swede from /pol/    germans are more enf than any eastern euro population and by eastern i dont mean balkans
  according to lynn its a good proxy to measure intelligence but pisa results show that admixture rarely correlates with intelligence slovenians did really well in 2015 and they cluster with hungarians who did terribly and croatians who also werent that great
  inbreeding can increase iq if the high iq gene is present in both parents hence the likelihood of passing the high iq genes is higher the reason why inbreeding is fucked up in most cases is because it also increases the likelihood of passing down undesirable genes      well yes and northern populations also tend to have proportionally more intelligent individuals than southern ones of course this is a general observation and the contemporary highest iq individual is from greece so outliers do exist
  be mostly farmeroid german  claim you are aryan  your country gets raped by actual descensants of aryans  your farmer women please aryan slavic dick  your e1b farmeroid leader comits suicide
  they also have less enf than southern europeans and more yamna dna than southern europeans and tend to do a lot better i wonder why
  not him but youre still a mentally disturbed rape fetishist
  this is idiotic thinking finns and estonians do well yes but lithuanians and latvians who are closely related to them dont hell the czechs do much better than slovaks and they are literally the same people
  also portuguese did better than icelanders
  thats nothing compared to german fetishes
  well not really there can be great variations among related populations depending upon what the populations value perhaps the lithuanians valued brawn more than brain hence there are so many strongmen coming from lithuania while the finns and estonians value intelligence more than strength hence we see a proportionally higher number of intelligent finns than lithuanians it is dependent on selection of characteristics which in turn defines populations over thousands of years and species over millions of years
inteligent finns and estonians  contribure virtually nothing ever
  its also likely that admixture proportion has little to do with intelligence and more recent event are probably more important
hahahaha lmao at these pathetic shitskins coping  people with more nordic yamnaya dna have genetically higher iq  ancient civilizations had a nordic ie ruling class why would they mix with inbred goblin farmers  everything relevant from greece was by nordics  no one has proved me wrong yet you leftist degenerates keep ignoring me hoping i will stop  hahahahaha blondes like me literally have highest iq you trk rapebabies and shitskins
  well consider this the different admixture groups came from different populations which were selected differently due to living in different environments i never implied that population groups are inherently better or worse than other groups because of some universal command but rather it is because they evolve to be that way take australian abos for example they have a dismal iq but if you specifically select only the most intelligent ones for reproduction consecutively for many generations after identifying the genes responsible for intelligence then the final population will end up being surprisingly more intelligent than the nominal aboriginal population the same can be said about other characteristics like reaction time strength endurance to various environments and whatnot it is all about selection along with an important factor luck due to random mutations which may or may not be beneficial
  accepting the superiority of the nordic germanic man based trying to link the nordic germanic man with yamnshit mongrels not based
  this post was written by a swede and swedes have low iq
  too intelligent for civilization also finland is the only country where girl do better at science and math than boys this also makes finnish girls more intelligent than any european boys
  well to be clear that is not a norm the reason why nords today ended up being the way they are is because of natural selection as i have explained in another post of mine just a moment ago here     now simply having more ie admixture doesnt make you better most jaats in india for example have more indoeuropean admixture than even the brahmins and yet the jaats are typically seen as lower castes by brahmins the same goes for pathans and brahmins selection and more specifically relatively recent selection over the last few thousand years is more important than some long lasting name
    fucking leftist shitskins keep coping hahahahahaha   nordics like me have high iq because we have high yamnaya dna  we formed the ruling class of greece and rome  their gods were blonde because they worshipped us why would a genetically beautiful people racemix with non whites   you still havent disproven me fucking faggots
  prove it subhuman
  finnish girls are cute there was a finnish girl in my grade 12 hs calculus class but i couldnt talk to her cuz i have a nerdy loser incel but hey it doesnt matter since i was one of the best student in the class even though i fucked up the finals and my mark went from a 98 to a 95 hehe now i have dropped out of college cuz i didnt go to 90 of the classes due to crippling anxiety and plan to either be a neet or kms soon enough
  nordics are the most leftist people on the planet
tfw according to pisa score poles are the smartest slavs
  they have brown eyes and are shitskin arabs
  they can thank their east germanic genetics and german cultural influence for that 
  selection doesnt matter  which is exactly why populations where intelligence is valued selects intelligent individuals to breed more than the dumb ones hence the intelligent individuals become more common in the main population    are you legitimately mentally challenged i just explained exactly how evolution works with desirable people being selected over the undesirables but there is an element of luck due to random mutations ofc but these only affect the extreme outliers and in the short term have little to no affect on the overall average cuz well you know they are outliers
  germans have no culture
  yes thats because of enf
  stu germanic wewuzzer poles are cool even without german influence      slavs are barely an ethnic group poles are unironically closer to balts and finns than they are to southern slavs
  lol
  ingrate
  us nordics naturally have a genetically high iq because we are the ie ruling class that had illustrious figures like the blonde augustus and aristotle
  this is getting really sad
  slovenians are
  slavs are more of a thing than germanics are
  and how did the ie ruling class get that high iq it was because they were selected for traits like intelligence/cunning and strength ofc my point is that scandis being the way they are is because of a reason long term selection and not because of magic
  ruling class of starving freezing fishermen shitholes
  so are you claiming that poles are closer to bulgarians than germans and danes are to one another because i highly doubt that
  forms the nobility of 90 of europe and rules over east slavshits
  jesus fucking christ
  germans in general arent a thing they cluster with everything from the french to poles
    subhuman arab inbred shitskins  you cant even formulate an argument to prove me wrong that aryan ie ruled greece
  greeks were indoeuropeans but genetically they werent closely related to their steppe ancestors
  its literally a fact that all of relevant europes medieval nobility was ultimately germanic in origin and the slavoids were ruled by the germanic rus 
  ah well yes when i think of germanics i tend to think of germany  southern nords like danes partly my mistake i guess      this is a troll and most likely a brown troll trying to make nords look bad you never see nords bragging like that irl they are just smug every now and then since they know they are better meanwhile brownoids pretending to be nords possibly out of delusion can easily be found out for this very reason
  germanics with dark hair and eyes like habsburgs and bourbons
  you know its ie you know it
  youve still yet to prove me wrong that ie were a distinct ruling class you leftist kike
  i dont get it according to wikipedia basques have the most r1b of the whole world
  its probably not
  just fuck off retard
  thats because youre stupid just like this twat 
  lets take urdmurts for example
  bronze age replacement of male lineages this was probably a single event thats why basques retained their farmer ancestry there werent many further admixture events unlike in other places
  what in context of which region like in nonie places like india well low castes like jaats and pathans have more ie blood than brahmins though the brahmins often make claims of being more aryan than them ie based populations started off as a ruling tribe and indeed even today most ruling classes have a higher ie admixture than most lower ones but because of some infighting it looks like some ie ruling classes were demoted to being peasants so there you go the ie people made some of their own people equal to the natives in social rank what a glorious history    ie people didnt pull off such schemes in europe and i think that i made my position clear by saying that yamnachads trounced native euro manlets the same way they in conjunction with chg associates like bmac trounced the native south asian protopajeet manlets
  yamna men killed the native men and fucked the farmer women
  disturbed
  but failed to enforce their language so they lost
  prove it  people like aristotle were pure or near pure ie  way more than modern lolwhite arab gayreeks    i cant prove you wrong so im going to cry  hahahaha die shitskin
  i am nordic faggot
    yeah but why isnt it showing in this graph apparently it was yamnaya who replaced the males in iberia so they should show a high share of yamnaya in them and according to that graph it isnt while according to wikipedia they have the most r1b of all world
  if you kill your enemies you lose  
  this graph i mean  
  keep larping shitskin turk
  so they arent indoeuropeans and are dominated by haplogroup n
  if you replace nearly all males but still they retain their mother language thats an anomaly maybe they hit and ran
  i didnt argued against the idea of ie elites in ancient greece
  they are dominated by yamnaya who is mainly r1b
  i have blonde hair and blue eyes and predominantely nordic facial features 
  not a full blown iecist but that must have been true at some point no way ies skipped greece or even italy why would they
  because it was a small group of warriors that bred with local women there wasnt further steppe admixture there
  my theory is they left them be single moms thatd make sense
    simple spaniards cannot into hunting and gathering cuz of afternoon siestas /s    anyway the clear overrepresentation of yamna haplogroups in iberia in spite of only having relatively small amounts of yamna admixture is almost certainly because the yamnabased men outcompeted the natives as they usually do but in this case it was to a much more severe extent      idk why the mother language stayed that way maybe the native women were so numerous and the migrant men so few in number that the men adapted to the language of the women cuz its easier that way  i mean you kinda see that happening in sweden  jk
  ies didnt skip italy and greece how else would the native preie greek religion be forced to take in iereligious themes and completely change the structure of their language to an indoeuropean one
  /int/ bantz  kys    im getting so many connection errors anyone else
  none whatsoever
  this is autosomal dna uralic males with haplogroup n bred with steppe women
  getting leftovers that no one wanted    yamna men were too busy breeding native qts to give their own descendants lactose persistence so the brutish steppe women took smol uralic men as their sex slaves duh
  fucked up the greentext mark    reeeeee
hahahahahaha no one has proved me wrong yet cry more butthurt slaves    you probably have inbred jewish nose
  n men made them pure breed redheads  coolest of stories yet
  deranged fetishist
  yes maybe some bell beaker warriors attacked few villages killed most men raped women and left bell beakers attacks could be similar to much later vikings attacks
  nice cope my nose is pretty much the ideal nordic nose
  gobekli tepe was 7000 years before sumer i doubt theres any connection
  short but beautiful aryan  soa med
  but this is literally what happened udmurts are absolutely dominated by haplogroup n some 80 of them have it at the same time all siberian groups seem to carry a lot of west eurasian mtdna
  no imagine nordic people with zero mongoloid influnce but short
  lmao at this gayreek thinking he is a nord  y u trying so hard faggot nigger
  80 n    let me guess those were the peasants while the richer individuals belonged to other haplogroups or am i wrong
  no uralshits living in frozen wastelands bought used up slaves/whores from the steppe
still waiting for actual evidence against the nordic ruling class theory
  i doubt it because it would mean that the elites barely bred leaving little to no descendants bronze and iron age societies especially primitive steppe societies practiced female exogamy
  two elite female samples from the mycenaean period had less steppe than modern greeks
  you wish faggot arab
  ywn be a steppe lad breeding exotic beauties like short and beautiful funnelbeakers and tall ehg mongrels    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
  we were kings
  he doesnt want to be the funnelbeaker
  wanting to be a manlet who sees tall brawny men fuck his beautiful women
  why do you always try to conflate chg  iranian neolithic iranian and chg separated earlier than 12000 bc theyre only dustantly related like chg and ane youre either a kurd or georgian am i right
  this is getting ridiculous  you keep asking for evidence against a claim you have made the burden of proof is on you  you assert that the yamnaya had some illdefined nordic aesthetic and that they imposed a caste system of racial apartheid everywhere they went  besides the fact that you cant substantiate these claims how about i debunk them  first dna testing of yamnaya samples show that they had predominantly dark hair and eyes darker than many of the people they conquered they did have lighter skin than whg but darker than tge average modern euro they were also shorter     the genetic basis of a number of physical features of the yamnaya people were ascertained by the ancient dna studies conducted by haak et al 2015 wilde et al 2014 and mathieson et al 2015 they were genetically tall phenotypic height is determined by both genetics and environmental factors overwhelmingly darkeyed brown darkhaired and had a skin colour that was moderately light though somewhat darker than that of the average modern european264 despite their pastoral lifestyle there was little evidence of lactase persistence27      secondly you cant extrapolate the example of india for all ie areas as you lack evidence and indoeuropeans werent all exactly the same by the time the indoaryans actually reached india they had already mixed along the way there is no evidence they discriminated based on modern percieved ideas of race thats a 19th century misunderstanding that refuses to acknowledge linguistic and cultural explanations this mixing ocurrs also for the hittites and mycenaeans  to be continued
  chg in sardinia  wtf are you saying nords have more chg than sardinians sardinia has anatolian ancestry and prehistoric anatolian are clearly a very different people from the chg populations chg were more or less isolated for a while until they mixed with ehg to make the yamna populations  egypt minoans mesopotamians and other near eastern civilizations came from the prehistoric anatolians chg and the related cluster are responsible for ivc bmac and the caucasian civilizations that and sending over their women to get bred by ehg bulls to give birth to the yamna people
  yamnaya never enetered india you retard india was invaded by protoindoiranians like andronovo and sintasha who were light haired white skinned and blue eyed
    towards the end of the atharvaveda period new class distinctions emerged the erstwhile dasas are renamed shudras probably to distinguish them from the new meaning of dasa as slave the aryas are renamed vis or vaishya meaning the members of the tribe and the new elite classes of brahmins priests and kshatriyas warriors are designated as new varnas the shudras were not only the erstwhile dasas but also included the aboriginal tribes that were assimilated into the aryan society as it expanded into gangetic settlements90 there is no evidence of restrictions regarding food and marriage during the vedic period91  brits literally re drew caste lines  colonial administrator herbert hope risley an exponent of race science used the ratio of the width of a nose to its height to divide indians into aryan and dravidian races as well as seven castes160    now fuck off faggot and stop making these shitty threads
    in 2009 a genetic study of ancient siberian cultures the andronovo culture the karasuk culture the tagar culture and the tashtyk culture was published in human genetics ten individuals of the andronovo horizon in southern siberia from 1400 bc to 1000 bc were surveyed extractions of mtdna from nine individuals were determined to represent two samples of haplogroup u4 and single samples of z1 t1 u2e t4 h k2b and u5a1 extractions of ydna from one individual was determined to belong to ydna haplogroup c but not c3 while the other two extractions were determined to belong to haplogroup r1a1a which is thought to mark the eastward migration of the early indoeuropeans of the individuals surveyed only two or 22  were determined to be mongoloid while seven or 78  were determined to be caucasoid with the majority being light skinned with predominant brown or black hair and dark or green eyes1933  literally northern indians
  ies were also notorious homos and pederasts
  andronovo clusters closely to east euros like russians and poles not to indians of any sort
  also    4567 it was believed in the 19th century that aryan was also a selfdesignation used by all protoindoeuropeans a theory that has now been abandoned8 scholars point out that even in ancient times the idea of being an aryan was religious cultural and linguistic not racial91011
    (((wikipedia)))  didnt read your faggot leftist drivel
  that is simply because the nonie admixture among the extreme far north indians is in the form of chgrelated people and they do not cluster very closely with ehgs genetic relatedness pcas can be misleading for example look at the kalash who are like over 50 yamna and yet are not closely related to european populations on pcas that is because the other component of their ancestry is most likely a bmac related group
  absolutely btfo  based med bull
  thats simply because they werent north indians but eastern europeans they had smaller enf and whg component than modern russians and poles ill give you that but they have nothing to do with pakis and pajeets
  the andronovo have corded ware admixture theyre a much younger group than the yamnaya and basically a different ethnicity entirely theres no strong continuity between them and the north indians of the vedic era were andronovobmacdrav mutts not yamna steppe pastoralists its just stupid to equivocate them with other steppe groups theyre of the same subrace of noble steppe niggers but they would not have seen each other as kin or ethnically homologous if you somehow put andronovo and yamnaya together
  no they were chg  ehg mutts while modern day russians are chg  ehg  enf  whg mutts chg and ehg from yamna populations enf and whg from joint farmer communities pakis and pajeets are ihg  chg  ehg  whg mutts chg comes from the ivc migrants ehg and whg comes from the indoiranian migrants and the ihg comes from native abos    neither have a lot to do with their conquerors since both are barely 50 yamna at best most pajeet castes arent even close to that since they tend to be 20 to 30 yamna while certain upper castes and pathans are 40 yamna meanwhile russians and poles are 50 yamna what really bothers me is how many ie posters forget that they are ignoring the other 50 percent of their ancestry    on a side note are you forgetting that yamna populations were like 1/3rd to nearly a half chg the folks at eupedia have an interesting piece of cope written on the subject
  i didnt get btfo  hes a shitskin with jewpedia as evidence
  there he goes again both sintashta and andronovo had small enf and whg input they didnt look like pakis and had nothing to do with australoid indian filth they came from belarus expanded to central asia and beyond where they finally gained the dirt admixture
  why did you change the quote it was changed just recently in wiki too probably afyer the last time itvwas posted here some swarthy manlet changed it to fit his cope originally it said light hair because the andonovo genomws had the blond hair mutations found in norther europe     this is the study they still use as the source in wikipedia even after they changed the citation to brown or black haired    our autosomal ychromosomal and mitochondrial dna analyses reveal that whereas few specimens seem to be related matrilineally or patrilineally nearly all subjects belong to haplogroup r1a1m17 which is thought to mark the eastward migration of the early indoeuropeans our results also confirm that at the bronze and iron ages south siberia was a region of overwhelmingly predominant european settlement suggesting an eastward migration of kurgan people across the russokazakh steppe finally our data indicate that at the bronze and iron age timeframe south siberians were blue or greeneyed fairskinned and lighthaired people and that they might have played a role in the early development of the tarim basin civilization    swarthlets have no shame even editing wikipedia to suit their cope
  northeastern europe you nordnigger
  let me just invent a quote  why are you so desperate
  the paki and pajeet filth have ihg/asi admixture which is why they are the way they are meanwhile the chg component in both the andronovo and the sintashta was larger than the anatolian farmer and the whg component while ehg was the largest one in all of the aforementioned groups it is interesting how almost all of the yamna larpers completely ignore this point
  i hate nordnigger subhumans but hes right about andronovos and sintashtas pigmentation they were light
  yamna is fetishized only by west euros that are desperate to be the center of attentionmust be from that high enf femalelike admixture there are indo european cultures older than yamna and its confirmed at this point that cwc did not come from yamna but from a different older source probably sredny stog meanwhile yamna is a trimutt of repin sredny stog and khvalnysk
  its from the study they use as source for the citation you probably edited to say btown or black hair you retard ancient dna provides new insights into the history of south siberian kurgan people
  must be from that high enf femalelike admixture  cringe
  yeah thats is because the andronovo populations are postnative euro muttification people they have a whg and enf component but they are still mostly chg  ehg they would likely have plenty of light haired and light eyed individuals but they would still look like the lighter circassian churkas of northwest caucasus
  brown or black hair  lol
  skin pigmentation
  source
  well didnt the preyamna eneolithic population have some chg admixture as well according to the k8 analysis the cwc people were like one quarter to one third chg
  ancient dna provides new insights into the history of south siberian kurgan people 4chan thinks springer links are spam google it yourself its the source used in the wikiarticle
  incel funnelbeaker be go and stay go     khvalnysk had some chg yes but not nearly as much as yamna you cant remove chg from indo europeans you can however see the difference in ehg to chg ratios
  true i have a question does the chg admixture among early indoeuropeans possibly point to interactions with circassian and northwest caucasian folks i have heard that the word indra could have been derived from ancient northwest caucasian language but idk how true that is
  you paraphrased the tarim basin quote it seems i havent slept today so im not going over it a second time they at no point equate them as being nordic at all caucasoid could literally just mean europid looking central asians which there are already extant examples of today and they could never be mistaken for nords
  the chg in yamna is different from the chg found in caucasian cultures like maykop theyre not related the chg in yamna had already been north of the caucasus even before yamna was formed
  i didnt its a straight copy paste from the study here you go open your eyes    
  look andronovo cluster with modern northeast europeans if you know anything about genetics you can try it out yourself there are multiple public andronovo genomes like rise505
  how long ago did the yamna eneolithic chg diverge from the maykop chg was is like 10000 years ago
  something like that
  im tired and just going to assume you paraphrased  open your eyes  fuck you    they cluster with northeast europeans  yeah with balts and slavs not with scandinavians lol
  yeah fuck you for assuming shit     balts are overwhelmingly light haired so are the russians they cluster with other slavs are not that close russians are because they have baltic and finnic admixture
  next youre gonna claim corded ware were uralic
  no im just claiming that the rest of slavs arent really that close to them since they have too much south euro admixture originsl slavs were probably very baltlike but exist no longer thanks to mixing unlike balts
why do people claim the ancient caste system was based on race
  most of the haplotypes in the study cited and literally all of the andronovo sample haplotypes were only found amoung eastcentral northeast and eastern european populations there were like 24 specimens with links to nordic yhaplogroups and a freakishly broad range of locations linked to the other siberian samples the idea that this means they were nordic these haplotypes come from northern europe or that theyre at all representative of the progenitor yamanaya culture is insane nords come from shg whg eef and steppe populations mingling together during the yamnaya expansion into corded ware theyre not representative of light haired steppe people and if you think modern nordics and germans looked anything like people as far afield as kazakhstan and iran youre incapable of thinking empirically there is zero evidence at all that nords even existed as we know them now during this period
  nordic haplogroups  you mean r1a most common among eastern euros    perhaps west slavs have a central euro beaker component in them so
  bump this question
one thing confuses me though im gonna post both maps r1a and r1b so we can discuss this further here goes r1a
inb4 irish redhead wewuzzing
  r1b map here      whats the deal with india both of them visited it but r1as were more notoriously settled there what do you think was the situation between both of those groups r1a and r1b being in somewhat the smae territory      we wuz irish n shieeet now with extra udmurts in the mix
  irish have nothing to do with udmurts or scythians
  thats what you say all of them are r1b and red heads
  and different genetic components and ancestry among other things
  makes sense since right around that time the zagros farmers would have started to move eastward towards south and central asia perhaps this may be because of a post ice age population boom
  you mean r1a   no i mean haplotypes specific to northern europe the only andronovo specimens ive seen in any studies dont evidence shared haplotypes with nords at all the southern siberians that do its infrequent and logically these are from a common source not from northern europe so theres no reason to even begin to bring up nords with regards to the andronovo horizon or afranasievo and sintasha cultures there are already existing populations in southeasterneurope and central asia of people with blonde or light brown hair pale skin and bluegreen eyes that arent nordid phenos at all if dutch spanish italians north africans syrians and greeks can have blonde hair and blue eyes with different but similar craniofacial features then so can ancient caucasoid west asian steppe pastoralists its fucking stupid you rely on people not knowing how migratory patterns or gene flow works
  poles are unironically closer to balts and finns than they are to southern slavs  southern slavs are basically med larpers
  those people are irish not udmurts
  native preie greek religion  where can i learn more about this
  you can find out more about it from someone who is well versed in neareastern religious traditions either that or stumble across google for answers
  
  red hair is still found infrequently in western mena and west asia it was almost certainly more common in med mena and west asia before turks and arabs browned everything

  finns arent closest to any ie population and they arent ie in any way its fingols that cope with each study published i love how latest one crushed cwc was uralic fantasies there is more to come
  you sound like youre 12
bump   still waiting someone to prove me wrong that greece was ruled by 100 yamnaya
  no one cares lol
  if yamna was j then yes
  cope harder shitskin  aristotle was more phenotypically similar to me
  new study from a conference at vienna    steppe and iranian ancestry among bronze age central and western mediterranean populations basically  balearic islands settled by steppe heavy people more farmer ancestry arrived later in sardinia they detected iranian ancestry but no steppe ancestry even if beakers appeared in sardinia in sicily both steppe and iranian ancestry appears since at least the early bronze age   this iranian ancestry is very likely chg ancestry which expanded to anatolia in the chalcolithic minoans had it
  it seems like they think that the greeks came from the caucasus through anatolia because mycenaeans also had this ancestry  a little steppe there is also similarity between early mycenaean artifacts and bronze age artifacts from the caucasus
  excellent
  r1b  different genetic components and ancestry  doesnt compute
  google claims otherwise they are udmurts from georgia according to google that is
pic related  even in india the aryans mixed with harappans but brahmins do tend to have more aryan dna today
  ydna is only 2 of your entire dna how many times people have to tell you this
  wtf i need links for this claim like the rest of southern europe was being populated by anatolian farmers in the form of enf while minoans were the odd ones out whose closest relatives lived in the caucasus mountains like the minoans possibly being genetically closer to bmac who came from the chg migrations than to general southern europeans is weird
  bullshit same haplo same fisical apearance  they must be related
  you are beyond retarded
  just looked it up and they are like barely 1/4th chg and the rest is anatolian
  irish udmurts tarim basin scythians and ramses ii this one is not confrirmed yet are all r1b and all red heads if you cant se the relationship there it isnt my fucking fault faggot
  they had different genetic components you dumb fucking piece of shit irish dont cluster nowhere near udmurts get that to your bastard mick head irish arent scythians egyptians or whatever the fuck you want to be irish are simple cumbucket slaves for anglos you dont even speak your own language anymore and if ireland stopped existing no one but american 1/64 mongrels would care now fuck off you stupid fucking bastard unable to even catch fish starving mick fuck
  they had different genetic components  source my anus  be more mad at irish people please celtic warrior stronk
do we need an /indoeuropean/ general for /his/
  we could use one
  so uhh are you going to make the first one cuz i do not have enough resources to fill the op of a general with useful links
  ive had a second thought itd be hell and extremely full of shitposts lets not
  yes but they carry haplogroup j2 by the time this group reached south europe they already mixed with anatolians
  udmurts are mostly n more than 80 udmurts with r1b are less than 3
  irish dont cluser anywhere near udmurts irish are more enf less whg and less steppe than udmurts get it
  j2 is a very common anatolian farmer haplogroup as well g2a is a much more common ydna haplogroup among the chg rich populations like northwest caucasians
why were they so retarded
all the sane heirs kept fucking dying on them
  augustus was a goat tier emperor and claudius was pretty great as well tiberius wasnt all that bad either nor was nero for that matter only caligula stands out as the particularly bad egg
  they were all incredibly autistic in any case
  none of them were the first choice though apart from claudius but thats its own story and tiberius and claudius didnt even want to be emperors
they werent that bad  in any case our perception is mislead by the santorial and the christian historiographical tradition  the real problems started when the first whoknows from nowhere backed by an army started claiming the power
  implying they werent assassinated
  augustus was all out great  tiberius was a competent ruler before he started to become paranoid and withdrew from the capital he should have just abdicated in favour of someone else when he grew tired of the office instead of delegating it to underlings that way his selfexile would not only be deserved but also be a boon in his favour  caligula was just a fucking mess even if we grant that 90 of the things we know about him is senatorial propaganda especially after he fell ill  cladius made a mockery of the justice system and lacked the gravitas necessary for rulership but was otherwise competent  nero was bad in the sense that he didnt actually rule and prioritised his own autistic pursuit of selfindulgence granted that did make him popular amongst the masses
  implying claudius wasnt in on the plot to kill caligula
we romeposting
how would history be different if germanicus became emperor after tiberius instead of caligula
pretty different
  thats the problem with people having total power things can change drastically depending on whose got the strap germanicus was probably not as cunty and crazy as caligz so many it would have given the julioclaudians more stability as a dynasty but probably not
  everything
in the long run nothing would really change maybe theyd have a few fewer war early one and gibbon could move his good emperors wankfic a few decades earlier

      the second sumatran expedition was a punitive expedition by the united states navy against inhabitants of the island of sumatra after malay warriors or pirates had massacred the crew of the american merchant ship eclipse an expedition of two american warships landed a force that defeated the malays in two short engagements     result    united states victory      in august 1838 the american trading vessel eclipse was visiting the village of trobongan on sumatra when 24 malays approached the ships second mate allowed the malays to board after they relieved themselves of their weapons a few moments later the americans returned the malays their weapons as a sign of friendship the malays now rearmed with knives and other bladed weapons attacked the crew first they killed the second mate and then one by one the remaining men some of the american sailors jumped overboard but the malays hunted them down and killed them this was the second of such incidents the massacre of the crew of the merchant ship friendship by malays had given rise to the first sumatran expedition in 1832 news of the massacre reached commodore george c read in december 1838 while he was sailing off ceylon in command of the east india squadron immediately commodore read in the frigate columbia set sail southeast for sumatra together with the frigate john adams columbia and john adams were in the process of circumnavigating the globe in conjunction with though not part of the united states exploring expedition of 1838 to 1842 coincidentally the expedition to sumatra required no detour columbia held almost 500 men on average and mounted 50 guns during the expedition john adams carried about 220 men and officers with 30 guns
  the expedition arrived off southern sumatra on 1 january 1839 the two american vessels first headed for quallah battoo once they had arrived the two us navy vessels formed a line of battle just in range of five earth and wooden forts that protected the village and opened fire over an hour later all of the forts were destroyed or in shambles the chief of the village surrendered and agreed never again to attack american ships with this commodore read set sail for muckie the next american objective columbia and john adams arrived off muckie the following day the americans landed a force of 360 officers marines and sailors all under the command of commander tw wyman of the navy wymans men attacked muckie while columbia and john adams provided covering fire with their cannon although most of the inhabitants fled their village upon the outbreak of fighting some of the malay men attempted to resist the attack but were overwhelmed within a short time muckie was in flames the landing party then returned to their ships and sailed away the punitive expedition ended after the muckie engagement and commodore read continued his cruise around the world the second sumatran expedition achieved what the first expedition had not never again did malays plunder an american merchant ship casualties are absent from records

  china and singapore laugh at you
  reject and despise the tyranny of the red and the goosestepper    freedom or nothing
  economic freedom is the key political freedom is meta ideology and a meme
  economic freedom cannot really exist without political freedom live in china and youll learn that the hard way the moment you fuck up guanxi connections with party officials
  having to pay the occasional bribe is still less restrictive than massive taxes red tape hurdles etc

  self professed agent of the nwo      one of the most evil men of the 20th century and not only ruined america but ruined the entire world      this is correct however
  americans are unironically dumb enough to think that a ww2 veteran ex ambassador to china ex american un representative ex vp is somehow inferior to le baste reality tv star that gets triggered more easily than a teenage girl     you guys really should know how badly trump ruins americas reputation and soft power 10 years from now hell he like bush junior and the 2003 iraq war all over again everyone denying they ever voted for him or supported it everyone pretending they always knew it was bad
  wheres my sticky

  immigration act of 1990 oneupped reagan on evangelical pandering cia spook    supported the rise of the second klan infringed on freedom of speech more than any other president in history started the draft and killed 100k americans    gave up the panama canal let in the mariel boatlift
  supported the rise of the second klan    is that supposed to be a bad thing
  if america was doing fine wed never elect trump hes the man of the hour because he wouldnt be elected if america wasnt hurting as for americas reputation who cares soft power can never replace hard power but this time america doesnt have to secure the worlds oceans it can pick and choose its security and trade relationships without a coherent policy
  hw bush was a rich guy who was so out of touch during his presidency he thought electric cashiers were a new thing
  cia nigger bush triggered the collapse of yugoslavia
  only correct answer
sending americans to die for saudi arabia    fuck him and every other president
  but this time america doesnt have to secure the worlds oceans it can pick and choose its security and trade relationships without a coherent policy  but trump is literally just following the old alliances and throwing his weight around in the international arena hes doing everything youd expect the us republican president to do but much more embarrassingly and ineffectively so
  what are you talking about bush sr lost to clinton because he was seen as out of touch with the american voter if the media wasnt so focused on the presidents image then we wouldnt have degenerates like clinton who paved the way for trump to get elected using media appearances
what if rome just let the legionaries expand the empire colonizing other regions more or less by themselves while the interior provinces were handed over to the bureaucrats to administrate collect taxes and pay the military for the campaigns the emperor of course should just be the highest commander overseeing the campaigns instead of busying himself with nonmilitary issues hes also the one responsible for speaking with the govt do you think its a good model could the empire survive with that
  the wealthiest region would be in the interior so the legions would just march inward
so if the legions had carte blanche to operate as they see fit and autonomsly from the senates directives knowing they would always be paid whats to stop them from just setting up a garrison somewhere comfy and just dick around forever its a permanent state of welfare to sign up for the legions and if youre a general then youre really living good     bbut the emperor    okay so now you go and tell your boys this fuckhead prick in rome is cutting off the trust fund but hey we all made it through boot camp right lads we all got swords and armor and pilums for days were not gonna let some cunt take away our good times right boys     tthe other legions    are all thinking the same thing and now youve got another civil war on your hands except this one isnt even dresses in the trappings of we support this ideology over this other ones its straight up greed so basically op youve just triggered the crisis of the third century like two centuries earlier thanks you idiot
  reeeeeeeeee traitors
  its not like armys havent sacked their own cities before
  well shit what if you only pay a sum of money needed to colonize the region to the legion the settlers and to make a deal for the native barbarian tribes there so its like a form of property investment the legion can keep any profits gained over there so that there are incentives to be made by preserving the system
  who decides what a region is worth what legion goes where why should constant perpetual warfare even be the natural state of the empire whats going to happen when you hit up against parthia india if the taxes from the province that the legion conquered go directly to the legion why do they need to answer to the emperor of rome at all
  who decides what a region is worth   the scouts stationed near the border and the merchants trading there gather some information then the bureaucrats and the military assemble a meeting to discuss the feasibility of it  what legion goes where  the legion stationed near the area  why should constant perpetual warfare even be the natural state of the empire   the empire needs to expand to avoid stagnation ok it doesnt need to be all the time just when the situation is secure enough to do it the goal is not perpetual warfare but a gradual expansion   whats going to happen when you hit up against parthia india   exercise caution for parthia establish a massive network of espionage logistics and infrastructure support for the legions stationed near there its a rich region anyway therefore the military can operate with its utmost potential while encouraging the best candidates to succeed building up their career for their own selfinterest  if the taxes from the province that the legion conquered go directly to the legion why do they need to answer to the emperor of rome at all  the emperor doesnt just sit there back in rome he acts like some sort itinerant hq moving from places to places relaying info toward each legion from the nearest interior while having the authority to summon a small council consisting of provincial bureaucrats and commanders to discuss some stuff if needed he is also obliged to report the situation to the senate
  underpay legions in certain regions like the border between gaul/britain and force them to regularly patrol and raid across the border for slaves
  people arent that smart or effecient they need to be organised
this was tried and then the legions thought wait a minute we do all the dieing and the faggots do all the fucking of whores lets just march on rome
  you a stupid nigger
  they are incentives to be made the senate has no authority on deciding matters on the colonies nor does the legion have to send money back towards rome why bother marching towards rome if they can just bribe some senate members
  kek  that effectively turns your standing army into a bunch of autonomous warlords which is obviously a fucking awful idea for a number of reasons
  because im roman and i want my latifundium when my time is served and i dont want to retire in bumfuck nowhere surrounded by savages raping my land
the legions would just create their own national identities and claim secession
  underpay legions  o i am laffin
    not different from being religious you just choose to believe anything some people say cant check the trueness and cant even practically use that knowledge though analysis as an equivalent of spiritual practice is obviously good for you
was the internet a mistake
is this babbys first day on deviantart
all industrial and postindustrial technology was a mistake
  maybe you all can correct me but ot seems that the internet was a name given to somthing that already existed bulletin board systems were already popular and the infrastructure was the current telecommunications equipment it probably would have turned out better if it was left to those in the know to perpetuate it i dont think it is making us smarter because of all the disinformation but that is the way of the world now any idiot can publish a book too
no

  was it really though

who is dong zhuo was he really that fat how did he become a warlord how did he get the young king hostage how come a combined force of many warlord did not defeat him but after being assassinated his arm forces become a lot less significant is he the most evil warlord for the time in china how did he really get killed did any of his man joined the 3 kingdoms

greatest and wisest among the jewish kings  becomes a pagan    wait what does that mean
  that the jews added that part later to justify their sick polytheistic blood rituals and child rape  hope that helps
paganism is the one true faith
no one called themselves jewish back then
    well the jews had sick rituals  but they were not per definition polytheistic unlike everyone else
teutoburg and carrhae set in motion the collapse of the roman empire because they reduced the military strength of the empire and stopped the expansion that had been fueling rome for centuries
  the roman empire is already the roman civilization in collapse    t toynbee
  except it didnt you retard the romans would go on to sweep most of whats now germany up before deciding it wasnt worth the costs involved to maintain it britain was conquered after both battles rome would reach its territorial peak in the early 2nd century ad and continue to raid outside of its borders for ages afterwards
  teutoburg  collapse of the roman empire  that battle happened in ad 9 rome wasnt even near its peak i dont know why everyone seems to think that the germanic migrations into rome happened immediately after teutoberg
  everyone  its literally just one shitposter pushing this nonsense
the smart and intelligent will be sad virgins and never reproduce while the fuckwits will multiply and have loads of offspring i can all ready see it happening i wish i could have a utopia of superior culture and knowledge but i doubt that will happen
  the actually smart and intelligent are gainfully employed and in relationships instead of whining on anonymous image boards or reddit about how hard their lives are like elliot rodgers 20 they are even worse than the fuckwits because at least the fuckwits know how to function in a society
  true smarter people are less likely to cheat and keep long term relationships but dumbasses cheat and have lots of kids

  modern society by its nature removes selective pressures against the stupid before the dumbest percentages of society were liable to get themselves killed end up destitute starve to death etc it was good for human society that they did too because by culling the dumbest generation after generation even if it was a small percentage would have a huge positive effect on human intelligence   now it is essentially impossible to die of your own stupidity even subsaharan africans are given sacks of rice while they crank out 70 iq kid after 70 iq kid of course people decry eugenics as evil mostly because a certain austrian who loves ruining everything made it actually seem pretty fucking evil so this might be the great filter not some cataclysm but the fact that modern societies are inherently dysgenic
  where did he say this
  it was at a speech before free men murdered those trying to enforce violence on them via taxation sb bootlicker
did he actually do all things that hes infamous for or was he fucked over by the upper class
  probably a mix of both for example he did make a horse senator but it was probably a fuckyou to the senate that opposed him rather than an episode of madness
  yeah most of the insane things he did could be chalked up as anger towards the senatorial upper class i think that declaring him insane is going a step too far but that seems to be what hes remembered for unfortunately
  did he actually do all things that hes infamous for  clearly not
  he was actually a pretty good emperor he destroyed all those potential rebellions in theeast before they could occur his feud with the senate caused his downfall him being an asshole makes sense if you know about his life
  nearly all roman historians were apart of the upper class so make of that what you will
english people literally prefer war with france and thousands of deaths instead of a king even sympathetic to catholicism and irishmen  literal fucking autism in its purest form
  hurrrrr why did they defend their faith and way of life  must be autism lol  kill yourself
  wtf this dude doesnt hate catholic people better get a dutchman to rule my country and begin a war with france
french people prefer war with britain and thousands of deaths to not going bankrupt
  it wasnt really about catholicism it was about parliament like charles i james ii wanted to neuter parliament and just like charles he was deposed only this time parliament brought in a protestant king instead of letting a military dictator like cromwell take power
  i just dont see how anyone can sympathize with charles i or james ii charles i had fucking endless opportunities to save his hide and squandered them all james ii had to have known exactly how things were going to play out were he fictional the whole thing would have seemed like bad writing
  paddies can sympathize with them
  
  cringe
  english people  get this in your head    goverment is not the same as people  a lot of english people get killed for the protestantism
  english people literally prefer war with france  sold whats the pretext again something something catholicism whatever so long as i can kill frnch people
  brp
yes but the catholic english remained and indeed are among the islands most esteemed citizens

  supporters of the house of stuart are the worst
good thread
  sympathetic to irishmen  he wasnt he had the same opinion of the irish as most of his countrymen      foolishly every single one of the stuarts fucked over ireland james i established the planatation of ulster charles i and his supporters screwed over the confederates and owen roe charles ii refused to grant the land seized by cromwell back to the irish and introduced the navigation acts and james iis defeat caused the penal laws
  1688 was about religion  pretty brainlet tier stuff religion was the justifying excuse like pretty much everything in those days the real point is that the middle classes were not happy with the rule of the stuarts because they preferred absolutist models to constitutionalist monarchial models
  dutchman who was protestant agreed to parliaments stuff and was married to just deposed kings daughter  retards forget that he wouldve been king of england anyway due to that marriage until james second wife had a son which is also what caused the crisis to blow up
  paragraph with zero context   whats it from
  ireland and jacobitism  richard hayes  studies an irish quarterly review  vol 38 no 149 mar 1949 pp 101106     
  so youre saying were going to get a king who wont tolerate backwards papists and their shit see inquisition or backwards bog savages and we get to kill frenchmen sign me the fuck up    t every englishman in 1688
1688 was as much about james trampling on the english constitution as it was about religion    i dont expect you continentals to understand

  whats his end game   jesus is considered one of the prophets in islamic theology thatd be like a prochristian prime minister claiming that history makes no mention of moses
  there are lots of them who slight or even insult jesus to goad christians the only one they will never insult is محمد it doesnt matter that he is a prophet they dont get enraged by jesus being depicted or insulted unlike محمد
  shias take jesus more seriously than sunnis though jesus is a prophet in the koran sunnis have takenen to denigrating jesus mostly cause if their relation with christendom
  jesus isnt real  therefore quran is false and muhammad is a liar/crazy person  based
  do you go into every thread about islam and just spam about how shia 1 sunni  camel fucker its so obvious who you are across threads and its kinda sad senpai
whoever came up with these dumb goofy bicycle designs why couldnt they just invent a normal bicycle in the first place with two even wheels
because fuck trying to manufacture chains  shit used to be hard as fuck
  the normie bike as we know it did come first it was known as the hobby horse and had no pedals you sat on the saddle and pushed your way like a scooter     however prior to vulcanization of rubber that design was super fucking uncomfortable when you hit ruts and bumps on the road so the solution was to make a bigass wheel for comfort     when dunlop created vulcanized rubber tires riding became more comfortable and the old hobbie horse design came back the star bicycle however was important in introducing the pedal and the design was thus incorporated to hobby horses
precision engineering allowed reliable light strong ball bearings and spoked wheels but not chains and gears so instead of a gear they had a big ass wheel
  early bicycles still had solid rubber tyres so im not sure about this
  untrue this is the reason 
  how dare you
  i meant vulcanized inflatable rubber tires solid rubber doesnt spare you from shock its like riding a bike with deflated wheels
  me in the back left
  early bikes did not have gear systems so the pedals turned the wheels directly meaning to get the wheel to make one full rotation the pedals had to as well so if you wanted to go fast you either needed a bigass wheel or you had to pedal like crazy
    were do people get this nonsense from  these are accurate 5743366 5743476

  everlasting friendship with your bros
  it was a resort town primarily so i imagine most of the economy was focused on servicing extravagant bathhouses and entertainment resort towns are interestming because they were like las vegas or monaco in antiquity there is another town called baiae that was a resort town but was pretty much 24/7 mardi gras meets a nero style fuck fest i remember a quote about baiae from seneca that roughly paraphrased says baiae is filled with women who play at being young girls old women who play at being young girks and even a few men
    
tbh its less morally acceptable to kill an animal than an abo
  wtf abos are your fellow human beings bro at least in the congo there was some moral outrage
  they were shit cunts the gubbas anglos that is
  until youve met one of these subhumans ya cant say it was wrong
  visit an abbo village like nyirripi and find out for yourself
  how else are you supposed to treat wild animals
  did the abos ever defeat the europeans like how the khoi khoi defeated the portugese
  100 of these guys vs 100 abo warriors who wins
aboriginals are actually intelligent if youve ever actually been around them they are extremely shy this is what americans dont get they see the dark skin and automatically assume they are like american negros loud and obnoxious its not the case they are very self conscious people they only get loud an obnoxious when they drink and thats because they dont have a genetic tolerance to alcohol like other races    maybe this is wrong on my part but i automatically assume shy people are intelligent and i feel like alot of aboriginals have alot more going on in their heads than most people care to admit
  the guerrilla crop destruction campaign almost defeated the first fleet and of course theres a bunch of company / subcompany sized actions where the boongs won      abbos are too fucken smart to talk in front of white cunts in part because the lessons of contact/invasion have been to keep your mouth shut and let the white cunts fail for themselves    booze can be a serious problem but so can right wing community members auctioning culture to governments for mining deals as opposed to when the entire community auctions themselves for a mining deal    otoh if you can prove youre a skinless piece of shit with no heritage and no stolen generation risk you can be in like flynn    stay gin ladies
  literal subhumans that are unironically intellectually underdeveloped due to historical reasons are actually shy intelligent people    citation needed
  but those are sheep
  kongo wood isnt very effective against steel
  nah its just there is a definite difference between abos and africans aboriginals have an indian sort of vibe i bet you under different circumstances they could have been successful as a people
  northern amerindians  be revered as noble and tragic heroes    abos  be seen as nothing more than a nuisance and are hunted like wild animals
  youre an american whos probably never seen an aboriginal in your life if you had you would know what im saying theres a distinct shyness to the aboriginal people even back during in colonization era it was noted that the aboriginals couldnt look the white man in the eye and you see the same thing today they are a highly conscious introspective people
  its fun
  american indians  revered as noble and tragic heroes    this is a modern reinterpretation aboriginals are today seen in a similar way at the time everyone thought they were a nuisance that required hunting same
  germaine greer  professional contrarians opinions shouldnt be taken too seriously
  holy fuckin kek the people among whom alcoholism domestic violence and child abuse are endemic are actually shy intellectuals
  actually it was problem were white settlers would go native
  of course an average white man was basically a god among the abo being god among abo is still better than being a convict
  go tongue kiss your labradors ass hole white american man
  it was like america  they all died of typhus er smallpox
  part of tribal warfare is enslaving and incorporating captured enemies mostly women in to your tribe its less going native and more a result of vicious and cruel treatment and having nowhere else to go native americans and how europeans viewed them should definitely be done tribe by tribe but to say that europeans thought they were noble savages is a pretty big meme that was created in the 60s
  i wish they did then methed up jimmy wouldnt start shit with all his erstwhile mates out the front of my fucking house after leaving the pub at 1am on a saturday night when i have work the next day
  im talking about the indians
  did they set petrol traps for them
dont sleep in the road
  trolling aside many indigenous comunities deal with seriuos alcoholic and domestic problems i hope in the future they can overcome and become a better comunity in the future
  serious
  to say that europeans thought they were noble savages is a pretty big meme that was created in the 60s  the noble savage concept has been very popular since at least the 1800s
  i think it really took off with the traveling wild west shows
  if i didnt know any better id think abos were like the missing link or some subspecies theyre quite ugly and dont seem very bright
  theyre quite ugly  not once theyre mixed
ever notice how we just threat people like shit when they look ugly   i wonder how much of the racism against abos is due to lookism they look uglier than most nonwhites so we threat them even worst than we threat other nonwhites
  maybe in america in europe it was earlier than that admiration of nature and glorification of tribal life was a staple of the romantic movement which started around the time of the french revolution as a reaction against the increasing industrialization of society and demystification of our understanding of the world
    the 1850s a full 250 years after europeans had begun to colonize north america it should also be noted it was only popular in areas where native americans had been entirely removed/subjugated or never existed american settlers moving west in the 1850s onward werent talking about noble savages the native americans terrified them it was americans on the east coast and europeans across the ocean
  its the proper european greek way ugly things cant be good and virtuous
  huh not bad but i cant really see any abo features in here desu besides maybe the darker than normal skin
  real talk put an abo between a human and a gorilla and they legit look like a missing link      this to be honest senior student
  only for poontang
  oi mate got sum chips o petrol  socks you in the face before you can respond  moi land cunt  rapes you and proceeds to fall asleep in the middle of the road    intelligent
  we call the leaders of ngaanyatjarra lands  you dont sniff petrol from a can
  lots of the early settlers to australia were welshmen and that picture shows the abbos killing sheep if someone came in and just broke your onahole you wouldnt take it lying down either
unfortunately marketing is very effective some of my family have become addicted to shopping they waste their paychecks on stupid trivial shit i hate to see it its just as bad as a drug addiction its very sad and i feel helpless
  that isnt how boongs speak its more like  gi me back me land you fucgin dog cunt
  the only solution is to abolish capitalism unironically
  damn niggers kek
  part of the whole appeal of socrates was that he subverted superficiality many greeks including plato were highly critical of that mindset even though they valued beauty
  fuck no man not when there are perfectly good deer in the woods
  we should abolish things because stupid people do stupid things that only harm their own long term happiness     how does it feel being a stupid person
jew here i hunt white people for sport then we eat at buffalo wild wings fun sunday activities with my synagogue
  based
  same we spray ourselves with corn syrup to blend in then set out opioid traps never fails to catch a flock
  holy fuckin kek the people among whom alcoholism domestic violence and child abuse are endemic are actually shy intellectuals  stop talking about protestant whitey cunt
  i havent heard much about using the indigenous as hunting game but early settlers absolutely had no chill when it came to even small stuff like livestock theft and whatnot and there were the usual precursors to wars and massacres like access to resource and land and just straight up not liking or trusting those outside of settler norms and society
my favourite sport is cleansing tasmania
  because they thought it was fun
  quit drink the fookin petrol
  whole ethnicity got punished for the lower ends acts ironically would have benefitted from massive socialism blocing
  europeans are the devil
  sports are healthy
abbos kept acting like dumb nigers murdering europeans then whining when they got hit back harder
  working on sundays  lol get a real job wagecuck
  sundays off  no penalty rates  have to leave the house early to make the few stores that are open  nothing to fucking do  sunday is the worst day off
  they thought that abos were part of the australian fauna or an missing link
  at least in the congo there was some moral outrage  no there really wasnt it barely hit the news even compared to other african conflicts
  white australians are descendants of convicts muderers thieves and prostitutes it was a convict colony
    being unattractive doesnt mean youre a different species
  im sure its because they are ugly cant be anything to do with them roving up and down the street asking for gibs in between getting drunk in the park and shouting abuse at strangers
its okay to kill abos because theyre ugly
  intelligent enough to overpower you
    are there any attractive abos    i can usually find at least a couple attractive people from any population but the only time i see a good looking abo they are mixed
  intelligence and appearance basically governs what we kill though its usually applied to food
  this but unironically
  didnt they basically destroy the australian landscape for years before white people got there because they would just set fire to the forest and wait for the animals to run out places to hide
  how is that a difficult concept to grasp  if i may interject the not as human bit doesnt make sense a saint bernards not a chihuahuas not a german shepherds not a pomeranian but theyre all dogs none of those is somehow less dog than the others
  the men can sometimes look like a cool neanderthal nibba but no they almost universally look better when mixed with whites weirdly they are the only race on earth with more recessive genes than whites
people didnt used to realize hunting intelligent animals was wrong    chimps have the intellect of a four year old and abos are even a bit more clever and both have close emotional ties with kin    pretty fucked up to think about now but hunting other great apes used to be accepted
  they are very self conscious people   what the actual fuck abos have no self awareness at all
  noble savage meme started with rousseau
  they are genetically closer to indians than niggers
  in settler states/colonies settlers basically turn into monsters overtime the more entitled they feel to anything during expansion and often the governess themselves often phial to keep them in check whether due to being incapable supportive or way to much pressure
  there are drunk white thots on the main street in my town every friday and saturday night doing all this and far more without a single second thought because theyre young and attractive
  i automatically assume shy people are intelligent  see theres your problem maybe theyre just quiet because they know they dont have much to say
  the aboriginals couldnt look the white man in the eye  could be aspergers within the founding population that was amplified by 50000 years of founder effect
  they thought that abos were part of the australian fauna  to be fair you could consider most human populations a part of the fauna
  what its true they are
  edgy and also that is a myth that apps were considered fauna one activist back then did say that they were basically treated like such but no government law actually made them considered fauna
  and because the vast majority of whites encountered by city dwellers daily are polite and sober more than can be said of aborigines
  youre thinking of new zealand
  porqué no los dos
  why did blacks hunt whte for sport
  aboriginals are actually intelligent    straya literally has to do public service announcements to tell abos not to sleep in the fucking road    
  virgin abos vs maori chad
  all of those things indicate shyness imho
  that describes way too many places allover the world
  nah theyre pretty fucking dumb even the halfcastes
  i think some people believe this in an aussie in joke but fucking seriously they sleep on the road  
  sleeping by the side of the road in tick country also has consequences
  we didnt fuck head    we killed them because they didnt understand what ownership is
  aboriginals are people dont dehumanise them
  we also have to do public service announcements to tell people not to drink and drive something universally retarded poor decision making isnt dependent on race
  impose your culture into a new land at the point of a gun  be surprised when the native inhabitants of that land dont magically understand your culture
  what drinking and driving has nothing to do with race but no other ethnic groups here have had issues with sleeping on the goddamn road i think we can agree thats almost incomprehensible levels of stupid
  as long as you drink and drive in a safe controlled environment and not on public roads its fine
  and north dakota has human trafficking billboards you really want to make a mountain out of a molehill
  the eyes and nose are clearly abo
  cant forget about their tendency to huff petrol which got so bad the australian government had to organize petrol manufacturers to make opal fuel or their tendency to try and steal trucks by intentionally running in front of them hoping they will stop and not get run over then threatening the driver with a spear knife or other kind of basic weapon
  is that where youre from  i dont blame you honestly but you havent been around these people
why not
  moors   black
  i refuse to believe wa is a real place
  he was a yemeni not a moor
  moors dwelled in thickets and caves  arab muslims thought black people were subhumans and enslaved them long before evil whiteys colonialism
  abos are human    thats where youre wrong
  but no other ethnic groups here have had issues with sleeping on the goddamn road  thats because aboriginals have had no concept of road in their culture until much later than everyone else its a paradigm thing not necessarily an intelligence thing
  hardly an improvement
  i mean black is a good descriptor of skin color technically moors ethiopians etc are black caucasoids and not negroids like ssas
  indians invented hinduism and buddhism though
  caucasus and negroid are useless as terms
  no abbos arent exceptional and i get tired if aussies here speeding out over them
  why did europeans hunt abos  for sport  answered your own question there m8
  its true you dont see many abo women and in fact they are so alike in voice and appearance that they are often mistaken for abo men  its the beards
    there is complete security in the country mali empire neither traveler nor inhabitant in it has anything to fear from robbers or men of violence they do not confiscate the property of any arab man who dies in their country even if it be uncounted wealth on the contrary they give it into the charge of some trustworthy person among the arabs until the rightful heir takes possession of it
  they look like the lovechild of africans and south indians
                  cringe
  yes cuck drinking and driving is the same as sleeping in the fucking road abos sleep in roads because they dont realize the cars will kill them while they are asleep they are that dumb
    when the moralfag cant even make a comment right
  you ever try it its tons of fun if youre a drunk hopeless loser
retards with no experience with abos who dont even live in australia are trying to tell others that abos are actually smart     shut the fuck up you pc idiots
  id love to see what you consider to be a safe controlled environment when youre pissed out of your mind in the drivers seat of a vehicle going over 60 mph
  when was the last time you actually communicated with an abo in the outback living their traditional way of life of course its easy to make fun of dysfunctional drunken wrecks the same way its easy to make fun of bogans
  what else would you do with cattle stealing wild animals
  almost any african army would roflstomp abos
  bruh you really expect me to believe they couldnt figure out that sleeping on the roads is not a good thing to do in at least 3 generations and that has nothing to do with intellect
  go suck dick for petrol money
  your reasoning only applies to sensible people with healthy lifestyles degenerate riffraff want to have sundays off because they get intoxicated on saturdays and need 24 hours to recover
  why did white people paint these scenes was it an early bbc cuckold fetish

why do people pretend ireland had kings they didnt they had clan leaders nobody on ireland was ever king of fucking anything until the english created a kingdom and became king of it
  a king is just a leader of a bunch of other leaders semantics
  this
  so a fucking prime minister is king a mudhut dwelling retard who tells other mudhut dwelling retards what to do is king brainlet
  why do people pretend england had kings they didnt they had clan leaders nobody on england was ever king of fucking anything until the normans created a kingdom and became king of it    this is what you sound like
  except anglosaxon king shad excerciseable power and were kings they had control of their territories irish kings were literally just warlords who started larping as kings
  a prime minister isnt a leader like a king is dont pretend that it is  mud hut dwelling retard  who was shaka zulu
  would you say the same about every gallic/germanic/hispanic king before the romans got hold of them    they had followers that gave them homage and agreed to pay their taxes to   just because they dont fit your specific view of monarchy doesnt make them any less kings than any other
  before the romans  nigger the irish didnt have kings right up till the fucking 10th and 11th century the literal first person to be king of anythin in ireland was henry
  way to entirely miss the point of the post being a comparison with similar tribal cultures on the continent they had kings so cant the irish    the irish didnt have kings right up till the fucking 10th and 11th century    most sources tend to disagree with you
  some asshurt monk calling someone a king doesnt make them a king
theres differentiation in medieval irish sources between the kind of clan leaders that youre talking about and kings a clan leader was called a taoiseach while a king was called a rí    irish kingship is actually quite a substantial field in medieval irish studies it was a position that was quite legally and socially complex pic related is a good jumping off point
  shhh be quiet hiberno saxons are the saviors of western civilization and if you dont agree with that youre just a filthy fucking seething anglo jealous of their achievements and might
  implying op cares and isnt shitposting
hugo ricciardi oneill is the rightful king of ireland
  god bless ireland
  bring him home
    it was all a dream  i used to read an phoblacht magazine
reminder that if he won irish people would not have been oppressed
  incorrect the main reason ireland was so fucked during that period was him failing to deliver promises of concessions to catholics
  out of print  also any other ecs
redpill me on brehon law
  his identity is revealed lads embrace your peat digger overlord
  maximum comfy tier  for a start the law was handled via compensation for damages made when the law was breached instead of a simple punishment for a crime while the laws were the same from north to south they were never applied on a blanketbasis and every case was seen as individual    law was carried out by brehonsjudgeswho usually lived in settlements and the career of brehon was often something passed on to sons and daughters both men and women could be brehons  the king did not have power to make or alter laws but was expected to enforce them the closest kings came to being able to change law was basically to have a very close relationship with brehons to the point where any change can be made  safeguards were in place to prevent the abuse of this because again once that king was gone the brehons could again just change the lawand all laws and then some applied to the king  brehon law had many more freedoms than their continental or british counterparts and was weirdly advanced for its time    irish law even had an extremely early 7th century equivilant of a genevaconvention esque document designed to reduce needless bloodshed in warfare it basically forbade the killing or maiming of noncombatants the looting or damaging of churches or holy men and other stuff like that    tldr brehon law was rad desu
they had a rightful king of their isle all these isles that doesnt change with the times
hannibal   spartacus   boudicca  zenobia  pyrrhus  cleopatra and mark antony    did i forget anyone
  rome is a stand in for authoritarianism and tyranny
  oaahhhaaahhaahaha
  not an argument
mark antony  enemy of rome  pls leave
  because the romans wanted it that way    look at these people who fought us  look at how badass they were  look at how we beat them  roma invicta
  the romans themselves often lionized defeated enemies after all having defeated them it proved they were even greater
  because their were right and their goals were noble
  you forgot arminius but i dont think he was as romanticized as the others
romans themselves portrayed their enemies as complex nuanced and sympathetic in their own literature
  because he won
the good rebels vs the evil empire trope a is pretty standard thing    also cleopatra is romanticized because of she seduced both caesar and antony and because she died tragically
because they were often fighting the celts who were essentially the white race this was the latin world meeting the celtic world most roman writers describe a beautiful noble and courageous race these words may sound romantic but accurately describe the celtic peoples in all their glory the romans were often humbled
  romans like to believe they conquered more than just backwards snowniggers and island monkeys
    what about vercingetorix why isnt he as romanticized
  rome is a stand in for authoritarianism and tyranny    oh snap
  he isnt  never been to france have you
  i guess the question is by whom is an enemy of rome romanticized the romans themselves wouldnt need to romanticize vercingetorix since he never really threatend rome and his demise was somewhat pathetic while of course certain movements in france will and do romanticize him similiar to how arminius was hailed as an icon of germany for a long time so why would roman sources dwell on him when he really wasnt a threat to the roman way of life ops question is simply too vague and anglocentric
why isnt he more known by people
  you forgot caesar
  because he was a cunt
  he was never a threat to rome
  the zealots and bar kokhba are romanticized in israel id say the romans are definitely bad guys in the historical jewish narrative for conquering judea ruling it poorly which made rebellion inevitable then when the jews did rise up they knocked them down even harder with millions dead the temple destroyed and jews expelled from their traditional homeland    while the romans themselves were incompetent and needlessly added fuel to the powderkeg realistically the zealots and bar kokhba were terrorists who courted these disasters yet many today view them as heroes who stood up to oppression and are a fine example to emulate
  barbarians out
  pic  ayo hol up
    ok lets get it straight  hannibal was not white in the /pol/ sense nor was he a subsaharan african  he was north african and would most likely look like other mediterraneans   no different from a arab or a southern italian
  thats what bothers you and not the chi rho on his helmet
  no different from a arab or a southern italian  so he was white
  kills 80000 romans
  based anon btfo rman fanboys
  no different from a arab     cringe
  he probably looked more lebanese or palestinian desu
  you can be bothered by both inaccuracies
  hannibal fought for the byzantine empire against the romns anon
  palestinian    no hannibal did not look like a quadroon dumb redditor
  carthage was a phoenician colony
  phoenicians were pure levantines palestinians are gulf arabs with 20 negroid admixture
  what the fuck lmao no theyre not
  that hooknose
  you are bedouins you are not levantines hannibal did not look like you
the same reason good professional wrestlers talk up their opponents while trashing them who cares if you beat a corrupt little wimp of course you should crush them but to crush an equally powerful brave and noble opponent is a true accomplishment    also    i came here to post him too
  you  im not palestinian but you are blatantly wrong  first of all bedouins are a nomadic arabic people that wander the sinai desert and arabia and secondly the islamic caliphates didnt cause a mass arab migration
  looked more like them than europeans
  they did they also negrofied the middle east ancient levantines did not look like arab/negro mutts
  why isnt he more known by people  rome at the time was being reguarly torn apart by the optimates and populares and was thus incredibly self absorbed moreover they also had a massive rebellion in spain around the same time and that had most of their attention    mithridates vi could have done better against rome had he not failed to consolidate his power in the aegean specifically his failed siege of rhodes rhodes was a major roman ally and holdout in the area and his defeat there caused all of his allies in the aegean to lose faith unfortunately the latter half of his life was spent on the run through the caucuses after pontus was wiped out and he was a destitute vagabond until he died in the crimea for the time he was relevant he was basically romes osama bin laden once he was defeated for good and the romans had his body they threw him a party and promptly forgot about him        not an argument      he was never a threat to rome  murena and the people killed during the night of the vespers would like a word with you
  sorry ahmed but no he was a pure caucasian pure caucasians dont look like quadroods
  no
  phoenicians arent even related to indoeuropeans
  so they were still caucasians
  what do you mean by caucasian
  kys brainlet
  they are viewed as some kind of underdog against a huge unstoppable empire in reality it was rome that started as the actual underdog
  anyone who isnt a burger is a brainlet  i think youve got that backwards
they did not believe their enemies were doing anything wrong if someone hurts you but has not broken an oath of any kind there is no reason to hate them
  hannibal   pyrrhus  very successful got defeated because they didnt possess the resources the romans had   since romans slapped everyone around their achievements only got more famous  spartacus   somewhat successful freedom seeking is a very popular theme ever since romanticism and the birth of nationalism furthermore amerimutts love everything slaveryrelated  boudicca  worthless but anglos love to larp as britons or for that matter any other celtic peoples as long as germanic tribes dont get into picture a woman  zenobia  a woman and a middleeastern whore  cleopatra and mark antony  fall of the republic is kino so its forgiven    also you forgot queen mavia and king jugurtha although they are more obscure and were more romanticized by the romans themselves than us
  boudicca gets called worthless but spartacus gets a pass  wew
  vercingetorix was heavily romanticized by french nationalists  which is funny since they got meded so hard they probably have more roman than gaul in them today
  he is more known by people europeans    he isnt known by mutt creaturas muricans
  arabs are mediterraneans
  hannibal lived centuries before the umayyad conquest of north africa he was not arab
  but he was still phoenician therefore semitic
  hannibal  he was an incredible general    spartacus  he was an exceptional leader    boudicca  muh anglo pride    zenobia      pyrrhus  pyrhic victory mostly   very few people can say they invented a military tactic    cleopatra  she was an exceptional woman for her time and very skilled in politics she also knew how to get what she wanted and was willing to do anything something few people in history have truly been able to do     mark antony  hes really not that romanticized
  well than can i please sign up for some authoritarianism and tyranny please because rome was based and carthage sucked nuts
  caesar didnt need much seducing desu
  spartacus managed to defeat the romans several times while boudicca only ever managed to slaughter local garrisons
  slave boy defeated poorly organized guards in the most poorly equipped part of rome when faced with an actual legion he got his shit slapped and his troops put on a cross for their troubles at lest with boudica the romans treated that province a hell of a lot more better afterwards
    is pic related a bait punics came from phoenicia modern day lebanon
  mavia and king jugurtha  redpill me on them
      hes not wrong he never said that the romans were the bad guys modern american culture loves the idea of the underdog fighting against large empires because in a sense americans see themselves sympathizing and relating with them look at star wars
  ncr is the revenge/rebirth of carthage and canonically defeats cl
  hannibal  let his string of victories go to his head and lost it all  spartacus  nothing special however slave revolts were a big deal and they did not want another   boudicca  retarded brits couldnt find a better person to use as a national hero  zenobia  no clue honestly  pyrrhus  rome chased away a really impressive general  cleopatra and mark antony  mark antony shared the position of most powerful man in rome with octavian octavian couldnt call antony a roman an enemy so attacked antony using cleopatras name like he would said to declare war on cleopatra instead of antony
  but america is a large empire
  yeah no germanicus exists
  youre not wrong but most americans dont think that way going back to the star wars example george lucas intended the empire to be an allegory for the united states in vietnam
  he was a phoenician what do think punic means
  calling carthaginians barbarians was one of the more retarded parts of that series
  no different from a arab or a southern italian  just because he is a phoenician or a semite does not mean he is an arab  they are two very different things
  no one ever remembers the illyrians
  you forgot sharpur atilla and alaric
  implying ncr is not the roman republic  implying that house is not caesar and new vegas is not rome  implying that the legion are nothing more than the savages that the romans fought and that edward is a larper    legion is trash tier faction
  pppassively aggressively includes mark antony but not sulla and pompei
  attila
  hannibal  black
  why are enemies of rome so romanticized
  no crystalization  evidence of casting    forgery
    not knowing zenobia    the absolute state of /his/
  people like a good underdog story
  brainlet
  its honestly this
people like to see the black gods succeed and breed white bitches after their conquests
  oh yes baby   tell me how tough you are   with youre perky nipples and smooth hairless chest and youre natural big lips   youre a naughty little black boy arent you   but i still love you
  cringe
  based
  hannibal   he was brilliant general and at the same time a tragic figure because rome was too tough and he didnt know what to do outside of the battlefield  spartacus   classic slave revolt story but with a sad ending  boudicca  british 19th century nationalism that turned a minor rebellion into a national symbol  zenobia  shes not romanticized  pyrrhus  he had that an iconic catchphrase  cleopatra and mark antony  shakespeare also just a tragic love story and those are always popular
  forgot the worst one  jesus christ
  he was romanticized plenty in the era of german nationalism  they even renamed him to hermann the cherusker
  render unto caesar what is caesars  enemy of rome
  because he won  one battle then proceeded to get his ass kicked in every engagement in the resulting punitive expeditions
  thats not him being romanized thats just history channels usual lazy incompetence
  if only he knew later his own people will dedicate its entire existence to larping the very enemies he defeated he would have probably left them
whtes we wuz kanging and bleaching every historical character that did something of value
  chi ron was greek symbol and hanibal was phoenician origin who traded a lot with greeks so in sense hanibal was greek weibo also considering byzantium was greek empire it makes sense
  based
  is that a chi rho on his helmet
  thats a greek statue though
  phyrric victory  military tactic  shoulda put your  here as well anon its the name of a victory won at such great cost it can hardly be called victory he defeated the romans in a battle but was forced to return to epirus after thisamong other more minor incidences that took place though greater detail on such escapes me now because his victory was such that he could not continue his campaigns
  lebanese or plastine   yeah no they were nothing like the pheonicaians remember the muslim folden age hadnt happened yet and persians controlled arabia with ma y helenistic states migration from east africa india hadnt reached carthage since egypt was in its way
  thats why he put tactic in quotation marks
  its more of a strategy but even then its just terminology for a failed strategy
  i wouldnt say strategy or tactic are a very good description of pyrrhic victory but thats not really the point the usage of question marks in this case was anon indicating a pyrrhic victory isnt an actual tactic
  because rome represent an autocratic empire oppressing everything that moves normal people always romanticize those who oppose tyranny colonialism and imperialism    but also       one of the greatest military strategist of all times probably the greatest of all phoenician in all of history before gaddafi     this was a major accomplishment because spartacus was able to lead and train thousands of inexperienced slaves to fight in many battles against the romans who were known to be one of the best armies around during this time period not only did spartacus free himself and other gladiators but he was also able to find the time to train the slaves who joined his army once they escaped spartacus was able to teach them how to fight and use the weapons properly i definitely believe that this is one of spartacus best accomplishments because of the short time frame that he had to prepare the slaves for the many battles that they would fight against the romans       the british will romanticized everything about their history even a pile of megaliths or king arthur nothing really surprising especially considering that she protected her people against the romans and will thus be reused as a tool by british nationalists      she isnt romanticized      he was a real one what else     and mark antony  the handsomest couple in antiquity

hello /his/ im looking for a good edition for the works of avicenna could be a complete works type thing or any specific translation that you think is particularly good any help appreciated i dont see that area of philosophy discussed much here
bumping because i was about to make a thread asking for the same thing does anyone have a digital english version of the book of healing if not what translations are best for someone new to avicenna
  guess people here have no clue
what do you think of this  
im especially interested in opinions on this bit  as peter j k park of dallas university argues in africa asia and the history of philosophy racism in the formation of the philosophical canon 17801830 2013 curriculum lists from the early 19th century onwards began to be emptied of women and noneuropean thinkers leading european scholars chose to create a canon based on a new eurocentric version  better suited to their imperial racialised and patriarchal era
  sounds like antiwhite bullshit to me
sanskrit texts were not translated into european languages until the late 18th century the exact period the author pins as imperial racialised and patriarchal
  just a bunch of old codswallop and wishful thinking
    sounds like critical theory race obsession bullshit
  europeans include european thinkers in a mostly european collection of works
  greeks living in the near east during the hellenistic and roman periods arent europeans because of muh feels   how did these people survive college and go on to graduate school i dont get it bros how do they have such major gaps of knowledge also why is it that the people who scream eurocentrism the loudest are always the quickest to generalize and simplify everything out of europe to fit their narrative i cant think of a single instance where roman catholic historiography excluded the many female saints and church doctors even those of noneuropean origin
  critical theory ruined academia and made it and intersectional battleground
  aryan nordic euros
obsessed with finding troy  finds it and blows its ruins with dynamite  was he based or not
what was his problem all he had to do was follow a simple plan
has there been any account in ww1 of germans lowering their head and running into the enemy has an act of last resort
  it was a calvary helmet meant to ward off sabre blows
did the t shirts ruin this guys chance of being appreciated as a really interesting historical character in my lifetime despite being dead before i was born it seems the default position for many is to be a contrarian actively dislike him rather than appreciate him from a more neutral perspective of being an interesting historical character    his time in the congo alone is a literal comedy of errors befitting a british tv comedy series script treatment
his time in the congo alone is a literal comedy of errors befitting a british tv comedy series script treatment  do tell
  i know nothing about his time in congo what happened and can it be delivered in green text form
  contrarian actively dislike him  yeah how contrarian to dislike a psychopathic murderer who fucked an entire country wow what contrarianism
  cool it with the moralfaggotry
   hi my dark comrades i come to lead your anticolonial revolution   go fuck yourself cracka we dont need no commanda   my god youre so fucking backwards marx was right youre inferior
  equating moralfaggotry with contrarianism   it is the opposite cupcake contrarians deny holocaust and call everyone who disagrees with them a moralfag
    guevara was by this time a veteran insurgent who along with a contingent of mostly few afrocubans spent their time trying to herd congolese militia the mission was meant to be secret guevara having his face altered to hide his identity but the us found out straight away and the local government forces figured it out as soon as there was a battle as everyone but the cubans fled local leaders often spent their time drinking and feasting their troops that the cubans attempted to lead in the field had shocking morale and training fleeing and not only at times leaving the cubans as the only forces in the field but also abandoning vital materiel the militia and leaders alike were convinced of the efficacy of a magic medicine that stopped injury from bullets the witch doctor being blamed when it proved ineffective one time they were headed for a rendezvous and spent weeks marching to the wrong town another the militia were taking forever to march down a hill back to base che ordered them to leave every superfluous item behind which in the wisdom of the militia also included the key understandably guevara became disillusioned with the complete lack of discipline of the militia and morale was compounded by each of the cubans being severely ill at one time or another        this is exactly the sort of shit im talking about reactionary showboating about people a time and a place that they would otherwise not give a shit about thanks to service industry workers in a fucking tshirt no doubt this poster would not hold other historical characters
  oops goofed that a bit      this is exactly the sort of shit im talking about reactionary showboating about people a time and a place that they would otherwise not give a shit about thanks to service industry workers in a fucking tshirt no doubt this poster would not hold many other characters from to account for morally reprehensible actions in the same way due to the lack of shirt wearing pinkos to push against history is littered with morally repugnant but fascinating figures that we happily read about its the same shit pinkos do with projecting the morals of today onto persons in history just the other side of the coin

  stfu i have white friends you trash  lmao chinks crack me up
why is this the meaning of life
  you choose the meaning of life anon and in turn you fulfill gods meaning ultimate experience
  to play games
  why is this the meaning of life  the purpose of all life can be deduced from simple observation the pattern common to all life is  to be born to survive to try and reproduce and then die every action taking by every living being can be mapped to the purpose of life described above    altruism preservation of self by preserving the group   self interest preservation of self by ignoring the group  large scale technological wonders all for pussy   humans do what they do because they act unconsciously most of the time otherwise the purpose of all life is clear     the meaning of life is a fake and stupid question it is semantically incorrect and is used by pseudo intellectuals for mental masturbation
  42
the meaning of life is liberation from the cycle of becoming into the beginningless state of being     this is done through adherence to the dharma
  2018  religious
  liberation transcends religion dude im not asking you to pray to some magic sky fairy and to hoping you dont get sent to some infernal abyss
  whether its a magic sky fairy or a magic life cycle doesnt matter its made up shit with no evidence
  the point omega
  not survive and breed
  i know half the answer it depends if there are aliens out there if not then it is our duty to spread life throughout the galaxy evolve as a living being and to help everyone get what they desire
allow me to clarify something for you op it isnt the meaning of life the concept that there is a grand intrinsic meaning to life or anything for that matter is long debunked teleology as a whole was thrown wayside after two retarded ideologies based off of teleological purpose assertions lead to the murdering of millions of people in wwii and the subsequent 30 years afterwards  survival and reproduction are things that just happen to occur with a relative consistency throughout the existence of life homosexuality disease suffering and suicidal tendencies also happen with relative consistency but to make any of them arbitrarily become a purpose is frankly illogical  we hypothetically assume certain purposes in science but only because we are prepared to test them in an ethical manner and even then we never fully confirm that it is an absolute truth just as situational one in a controlled environment
  the meaning of life is unironically your love  2 parts  your  and love  your is trained through self identiy training of mental intellectual physical spiritual capacities psychadelic drug use exercise work and profression  love i wont define but it is unconditional    maximising a volume of these 2 variable weightings through time subjectively is at least a positive notion to your existence both definings in truth cannot be at the expense of no other thus they are pure       
  unironically math and science    just look at the stars the most common reactions in the world are ones that renew themselves this is due to simple math
all of these anons that lack reading comprehension trying to answer a why question with a what answer  anyway to answer your question survivng to evolve and evolve to survive is just half of the answer the other half is a test from a higher being putting us through hard situations to see if were worthy of its attention the whole evolutionary loop is just a cog to make sure the test continues
  there is no meaning
  to be honest humans can choose between animal living divine living a snowflake amongst nature
  jokes on you that means i can just skip all and end it now
  math is a measurement you might want to find a new word or people will take you as a pseud
what went wrong
  belgium its always belgium
  coup it
he was a retard who couldnt make even token compromises to hold the country together
african dna
  not at all it was completely impossible congo as nation has never existed before what compromises were thee to be made
  is that tyler1
  the game was rigged from the start
  he wanted change shit for the better so he had to delt with
  yes
  he was a childish impatient retard that thought turning his country into a cold war flashpoint could work to its benefit
  allow different regions civil autonomy while maintaining a centralized national army with officers from every tribe mixed and trained together and the white officers of the force publique compensated to train their replacements not alienating belgium or the west to receive their support while visibly exercising authority to demonstrate independence    this would have been the absolute raw basics for keeping ethnonationalists and the army placated but lumumba was a demagogue who wanted a fully centralized antiwestern state he thought opening the gates to the soviet union would magically give him the military power needed to accomplish his goals without even needing to pretend to be moderate to buy time he was more of a puppet than any of his political rivals even mobutu the selfinterested kleptocrat was a step up from this quisling however because he was a soviet puppet that makes it ok or so lftists tell me    as the situation deteriorated he tried to flee to his benefactors the full depth of his treachery was revealed and he was quite rightly summarily executed before he could cause more damage however the damage had been done and the opportunist mobutu did the hobbesian strongman thing which was tolerated by the us because africa was unstable enough as it was and this shit had to be laid to rest    and so the drc suffered decades of pointless stagnation and war and everyone lived miserably ever after the end
  he didnt want an anti western state at all fucks sake he wanted in support and western assistance but he was denied it
  fucks sake lumumba was the most moderate of the nationalist factions
  infact the independence was a farce because belgiim still wanted its balls shaft and everything else deep inside congo    they wanted a 30 year delay until independence ffs thats like extremely probe to abuse
what the fuck was belgiums problem

i have to do a presentation on how law came to be how it appeared and stuff like that from the egyptians/mesopotamia/indus valley civiliziation/ romans etc to napoleons code civile and so on     but i cant find any books about it it seems like no one was ever interested enough in legal history to right books about it     do you know any books that talk about it or atleast could you give me some tips /his/ 
do holocaust deniers earnestly believe in the nonsense they parrot themselves or are they fully aware theyre deceiving people to the benefit of their own cause
  yes stupid people believe stupid things they shouldnt be taken seriously and the continuous posts about holocaust denial just gives them a platform to speak from quit posting these things and theyll quit coming out of the woodwork even questioning the holocaust deniers helps them spread their lies
  are they fully aware theyre deceiving people to the benefit of their own cause  are jews
  usually theyre just trying to get a reaction out of leftists the worst is when they are called out on their bs and go awell i don pretend to be real edumacated and booklearned im just askin questions golly garsh
why was india partitioned into 2 unified states instead of a bunch of smaller republics to represent each ethnicity  the idea of a unified indian people had not existed until then
  the jews
  british autism
  there was a retarded panindian movement which pakis stopped
  it would be like africa with telugu being congo
so does cultural india include pakistan bangledash sri lanka and india
  if it includes south india it definitely includes sri lanka bangladesh and pakistan are iffy since theyre muslim
  so does there exist this concept of an indian cultural sphere like there is a chinese sphere and a european sphere
  yeah and it arguably extends through southeast asia in the same way the chinese sphere extends to korea vietnam and japan
  the main independence movement that everyone got behind the one gandhi launched was panindian also worth noting that gandhi was living in south africa when he wrote most of his stuff and had not been home in ages had a very very idealized and romantic view of india and the movement that led to loads of problems later
  what was the extent of the spread of indian culture to southeast asia is it as deep as the chinese one where korea vietnam and japan became mini chinas
  a lot of them based their scripts on the indian scripts their languages heavily borrow from sanskrit and their philosophy and religion are very inspired by indian philosophy and buddhism
  pakistan and bangladesh are also made of several ethnicities free pashtunistan and balochistan
  epic
because the way indian nationalism developed was divided along religious lines not ethnic lines
  why
  gandhi
  indian people are defined as indic inoaryans and dravidians pashtuns call hindkowans by that name because the hindkowans are indoaryan
    indonesia was very heavily indianized before the later arrival of islam and arabic
what do you guys think of this philosophy test i put together are the results at all accurate or am i a pseud    
yes you are pseud because you are guided by binary constructs and try to quantify unquantifiable
  its futile i know but a general idea of how people think can still be constructed
  i think the results were accurate
this is a cool test anon good work the questions are well thought out
some of these isms on the two poles of various axoims arent really opposed to each other they are more like monadic systems of their own how is rationalism the opposite of romanticism or why is skepticism placed vs absolutism   another issue is that the isms themselves are usually very vague and you have to explicitly state what they mean  the questions are about peoples psychology and minor preferences rather than philosophical beliefs and ideals the result just gives you some fashionable name to identify with because of some preferences you knowing the reasons behind goes completely out of question  all in all if this catches on it will just contribute to making more of a whore out of philosophy like those facebook meme pages are doing zero substance and thinking just names and labels and memes      7 axis each an spectrum  reeee binaries  muh quantification this is not btw  you are more of a pseud than op
  in ops defense i dont think things need to be exact opposites for them to make sense being opposite of each other
  im not particularly committed these tests generally rely on a gut instinct reaction the problem is that when the topic is philosophy our thoughts tend to be a lot more nuanced the way questions are phrased doesnt really allow for much distinction between private/subjective preferences i would rather live in x society which could reflect any temperament altruism egoism etc and absolute/objective x social order is good
good work op thats pretty close to reality
  and those questions arent very accurate one should think about what the author wants to ask or just have a pleb understanding of thos topics    despite of that its the best personality test ive made
huh
is there a way to view all the possible results
  i just try to ignore the nuance and know that the question is asking for a general answer on a broad level there are important specifics that   wont tell you about me but as he says here  its still a good general description
how based am i
  99 nihilism  accurate
  platonism uses the chainlink logo  interesting
  moralist  extremely bluepilled  real world is gonna hurt you
  what do the icons mean
  objectivism  hobbessian

cute
damn how boring am i
  nice little test op well done    i am the neet philosopher king
this many nihilists  no wonder this board is shit

  this is why most wise men werent atheists
  if by wise you mean mentally handicapped youre right
  youre a top lad anon
nope no way im dead center between the idealism of the dictionary and the pragmatism of the dictionary  op went out of his way to come across as thinking the only positions in moral philosophy are either stirner or jesus where da community at senpai
  see pic related

50/50 idealist pragmatist  damn ive been a faggy radical centrist all along
  centrist chad
  very reddit
what does this say about me
  you like rick and morty
  ive never watched it
the only philosophy ive read is the entire works of plato
  i hate when these quizzes pad their question count out by just rewording shit this is just the inverse of the ends justify the means question it gave me 2 questions earlier
gives me a 404 on the results page 
this website doesnt even exist fuck off
  error 404 did you cancel the website
  it gives me a 404
  the high asceticism makes up for the rest
sorry lads it got taken down because of too much traffic  ill see if i can get it back up
new url for anyone just seeing this thread      only a temp fix but ill have to buy more hosting
          new link 
  this sort of shit just doesnt and will never work with philosophy since the field is about fundamental assumptions for example egoism and altruism cant be measured as characteristics because they dont refer to personal qualities but certain understanding of the social fields on which personal qualities are played out    tldr you are a brainlet and these tests always suck even astrology is unironically better because it is spiritual hoodoo upfront
tfw intp fencesitter  feels good not feeling too extremely about anything in particular
  you havent seen nothing yet
  you are infp
            you all sicken me
  the link isnt working for me is there something wrong
  see 
  this
  you seem like a chill dude
its no longer up
can someone tell me what this means  i said i dont know to a lot of them
  philosophy test   am i a pseud  as if you have to fucking ask
  see 
   t brainlet  those two questions are clearly distinct
meh lacks nuance on many points
um
what am i other than a faggot
for this i think you got the first two words mixed up or you forgot a question mark
  
intentionally go out of my way to avoid the neutral option  fencesitter nature still comes out    fuck how come i dont get icons at the bottom like the rest of you guys
  i dunno why i did this or what it proves but here it is
would expect my skepticism to be higher but otherwise i feel its about right
no wonder i dont fit in on /lit/
  those results seem pretty /lit/tier to me
  op the link is down    please make it available again it was a good test i want to send it to some friends
shitposting is sentient
  please look harder next time  
i guess i dont know where to stand
  i think you should try to understand platonic thinking a little more itll carry over into spiritualism     also maybe try understanding the necessities of human emotions you seem to work with logic for your world view which isnt bad but you are essentially only using half your brain power when you do that emotion is an objective way of viewing phenomenon so use it
getting a 403 whats the deal op
  link is down
link is rip
it works for me 
        op here old link 404d because of traffic  new link is   im going to try and see if i can reregister the old link
  stirner as opposed to altruism  no he just felt you should be altruistic for reasons other than societal pressures like national pride
  nice spot fixed it
intresting test but the questions definitely need to be less generalized and abstract not that its a bad thing but for a 2 binary scale it just doesnt work
pretty accurate good job op
not sure how accurate this is i mean i dont watch porn or drink but i still browse 4chan i cant be that ascetic
  accurate
  link isnt working
  refer to  
i got a cross at the bottom    what does this mean anons
seems legit although i consider myself more of a materialist and skeptic than this indicates
  very similar results anon  do you like jordan peterson
  it means youre based and redpilled
  the cross symbol just means monotheist
id put people in death camps if given the chance
  i feel like this is the most based spectrum
i dont really know what to take from this do these near 50/50 splits indicate im a realist or something if it helps anyone to know im not religious
  probably more infp get trt before its too late
  we dont think of you at all
  were actually really close besides nihilism    this is me and i share your sentiment
  if you guys enjoyed this i suggest you check out buzzfeed lots of cool and fun stuff like this on there 
  wah le edgy selfaware humor  people like quizzes you nigger
  chill and funpilled
  it was fun      you wanna be a monk or something
we are all insignificant in the eyes of the universe  i hate questions like these the universe doesnt have eyes or to not take it too literally the universe as a whole doesnt have a subjective experience or qualia we as a species have these eyes so to speak and we are a part of the universe and we are significant to one another so from that perspective you could answer in the affirmation but without this context answering in agreement or disagreement implies some sort of spiritualreligious sense of significance or insignificance that neither of which represent my beliefs well
  seems to be a hit op
  theres no such thing as unquantifiable you just have very poor understanding of neurons brain chemistry and mathematics
  im a pretty neutral fella
  mine was very similar
  62 tabs  what the heck anon
  thats the case with some of the questions like   life is suffering and fundamentally meaningless  what if i consider life meaningless but not suffering im enjoying it but i dont consider it having any particular meaning or what if i consider life suffering but not meaningless   there is an underlying morality in everything that we do  morality means different things for different people whether youre a hedonist or utilitarian wouldnt your own actions will always seem moral in your framework  without music life would be a mistake  music or art in general how do deaf people play into this i find music enjoyable but i find reading much more   life is despair  etc theyre not really questions with clearly defined yes/no answers but its good enough given that anything more accurate than this would have to be a personal 1 on 1 analysis you cant really get too deep with massproduced surveys aimed at thousands of people at the same time    itd be interesting if people also posted their results to this    alongside their chart
dang im so extreme for some of the categories
  yeah every time i want to use the web i just open a new tab when it reaches 100 open tabs i usually just close everything and start the cycle again
  trust in him
  not a bad thing
wtf it crashed
do you want a lamborghini or do you want to feed poor starving pathetic 3rd world kids  70 altruism  i think these questions need a bit more tweaking in the nuance department im a piece of shit but im not gonna want some poor runt to die so i can drive a fisker

how close to being the overman am i

how about this
  testosterone replacement therapy dont listen to anon noninfps feel threatened by infps because they show that its okay to be emotional and vulnerable something most guys struggle dealing with
im too much of a skeptic for these tests
  tfw conflicted and inconsistent
i dont like it had to stop 5 questions in keep trying  also the purpose of this test is redundant anyone with any real knowledge of philosophy already knows what the believe
what am i
  ty d yeah ive never thought of it like that i still figure most people on this board are probably in tune with themselves have a higher degree of empathy thanks to the great writers and are comfortable with all the irrationality that comes with being a human

cool test op
  holy shit what a parasite i guess to your benefit the only reason someone like you wouldnt kill yourself is that youre so busy sucking your own dick that you arent even aware of how disgusting you are as a human being
  thanks it seems emotions are my blindspot the subject is too prevalent in my life for me to ignore it anymore ill have to accept them and use them dumb robotic autism is not a good way to emote
      i think you guys are overreacting a tad i just answered the questions honestly rather than pretending to be living some sort of idealized life i like to have a good time but i dont think im 100 hedonistic
fun test 
    cool
a quality addition to my collection of online personality political alignment and iq quiz results  thanks op

seems like a fine test anon well done
test misrepresents morality as altruistic generosity towards other human beings in a typically christian perspective which is ridiculous because theres nothing morally good about helping a planetary cancer in the form of 76 billion naked apes filled with nothing but vice and and base animalistic desire to reproduce and stripmine the planet extinguishing species of fauna and flora with every passing day so they can turn the earth into a shopping mall true morality is extinguishing this simian plague     couldnt answer any of the questions pertaining moral values because of this

  whats so bad about it being gay
r8 m8s no h8 plz
    we got some radical centrists in our midst
im a moralsfag but morals are shaped by society and i inherently disagree with the society of today because it makes sense to be an egoist and to be a hedonist in modern society so i also have rationalism and shit
  i used to be a real realzfeelz type of guy and maybe i answered those questions a little hyperbolically but you gotta realize your instincts and emotions have been evolving far longer than your ability to reason you can reason yourself to suicide to ruin to lifedenial human rationalism is still being fleshed out your animal instincts are your ultimate compass in life leading you to love leisure maybe even wealth if you use it in conjunction with your reason
neat

nice im doing it right now
  
  can confirm cannot access it anymore
  the big five is the only valid test  t peterson
so im a materialistic egoistic idealistic hedonistic nihilistic rational skeptic    i already knew that     actually come to think of it anyone with any self awareness knows what they think so why the fuck do we need a test tell it to us
  anyone with any self awareness knows what they think  not in my book the individual can never truly understand himself    i like that test its fun
  the individual can never truly understand himself  youre not fooling anyone peterson
  do you consider your reality objective
  i experience it subjectively but i have no doubt there is an objective reality
  unless that objective reality becomes conscious and explores itself it might aswell not exist
  it doesnt matter if you think it has no point  it exists anyway theres no discernible reason it just does
  if we cant experience it how do we know it exists
  we do experience it
  so then why not experience others subjective reality if you cant experience objective reality
  uh thats not possible
is egoism and altruism mutually exclusive

  redpill me on the situation
didnt happen they were rebels
  they were invaded and annexed by indonesia against their will indonesia is an artificial state and the result of colonialism
  indonesia is filling west papua with colonial settlers against the natives and killing civilians
  they  the dutch  indonesia is an artificial state and the result of colonialism  yes and all states are artificial you have to be retarded to think otherwise most states in this world are also the result of colonialism whats your point really      which settlers a bunch of migrants finding jobs over there papua is shit everything costs more over there due to the shitty infrastructure why would the government want to send people over there they already got their own autonomy even more than a regular one which is already significant in some respects if you go there you have to adopt their local languages and culture and your kids will eventually pick up those stuff by themselves the only things that are left behind are tribalshit tradition which even papuans did away with compare indonesian papua with papua new guinea     if anything the law is totally skewed in favor of the native papuans take freeport for example they have to hire a specified number of local papuans in order fulfill some sort of affirmative action contract with the government furthermore its almost impossible to become a civil servant if youre a migrant or a migrantborn unless youre a protestant probably now theyre even lobbying to create a gospelbased state aka christian sharia and nobody in the central government is willing to stop them because muh diversity muh local wisdom etc
  the government sponsorsed transmigration program sent javanese colonial settlers to west papua
  why does the nobel savage trope permeate the global culture so much  yeah they were their first but they also abandoned their old ways in favor of new ones
  papuans are part denisovan
  transmigration program is colonization  youre a diaspora arent you traitor      postcolonialist marxist studies often assumed that before the newcomers came in everything was alright even now you still have tribes that eat people and ritually rape women in new guinea you dont have those anymore in indonesian papua although in large part because of governmentsponsored judaism v20 missionaries aka christianity almost as worse as the reboot version from arabia but thats because theyre a minority
  all states are artificial
  mainland sea states are not the result of colonialism they existed before western colonization island sea states are all the result of western colonialism
uyghurs rohingya west papuans    mongoloids being mongoloids the yellow peril is inescapable unless the insectoids are culled
  uyghurs are mongoloid caucasoid mongrels
  rohingya arent native to myanmar they are british colonial era illegal immigrants from bengal
  mongoloid  outdated generally the indigenous people that reside in nea ea and sea can be divided into four racial categories according to their ydna chinese north asian japonesian and austronesian these are all completely different people also austronesians have always been in papua since prehistoric times
  also austronesians have always been in papua since prehistoric times  not javanese the austronesians on the northern papua coast are over 80 genetically papuan
  yeah they werent javanese but mollucans you mean the northwest
implying nigger genocide is bad
  melanasian australoids are the furthest genetically from sub saharan africans
  t hartono
i am papuan and i will tell you there is not a single papuan anywhere in sea who doesnt pray for an earthquake to swallow java into the ocean
  kill yourself subarko
  where do you live
  australia
  did someone say moluccans                
  how much do you know about the condition of papuans in indonesia do you have some relatives there how did you end up in australia
  many rohingya were there before that period
  even now you still have tribes that eat people and ritually rape women in new guinea    that only happens in the extremely rural disconnected places vast majority of png folk are christian
  my family is from the png highlands but we have connections across the border i was born in aus and am an australian citizen but i keep in close contact with family and friends up there    i know enough about the conditions of papuans in indonesia to say that while there is at times an illusion of mobility and security for those who have migrated to other provinces and found work those in the villages in their homeland are being horrifically exploited innocents murdered every week    personally i think it is inevitable also that australia will at some point come to a head over resources or ideology with indonesia probably in my life time
  not natives bengalis are indic migrants and only expanded east recently
  gadaffi in libya supported west papuan fighters against indonesia
would you agree with this /his/ this will solve everything
  unfortunately the western globalist order will never allow subversion in a friendly market of 250 million people
  any traitor to the javanese empire is a friend to liberty and justice
  correct also pic related this is just a map of oil and gas corporations
  indices were in that area way before colonial era
  as prisoners of the rakhine natives during wars against bengal
  how did dong son bronze drums from vietnam end up in papua in the bce
  way before that
  you are going into wewuz territory
  idk perhaps they were part of trade with the native papuans who lived in the area for 40k years before dong son was a twinkle in his dong fathers eye
      indonesian military implicated in murder  two american teachers were murdered in remote west papua province two years ago with the full knowledge and cooperation of the indonesian military a respected human rights campaigner says    survivors were airlifted to australia for treatment  john rumbiak the exiled papuan chairman of the institute for human rights study and advocacy elsham said on tuesday the confessed triggerman in the case 32yearold anthonius wamang told fbi investigators that indonesian soldiers provided him with the weapons and ammunition used in the august 2002 ambush        goodbye indonesia  people  power investigates one of the worlds most forgotten conflicts  the west papuan struggle for independence        papua a war with no enemy  indonesian military keeps tight grip on easternmost province        indonesian army helicopter shot at in papua      military photographs showed a bullet hole in the helicopters windscreen  a military helicopter came under fire from unknown gunmen in indonesias papua province as it tried to retrieve the bodies of soldiers killed in a previous attack the army says    at least one member of the pumas crew was injured and it had to return to its base without collecting the bodies    seven soldiers died on thursday when they were ambushed by armed men as they patrolled in puncak district    another soldier was killed in an earlier attack nearby on the same day    it was unclear whether his body had already been returned to jayapura or was among those being retrieved          indonesias papua province children starving in a land of gold
        the papuans say this land and its ores are ours        the company has also come under scrutiny after admitting to paying military and police officers to oversee security operations despite accusations that the indonesian military has been linked to human rights abuses against local papuans        an indonesian war of unknown persons      jakarta  it is a seemingly unending conflict in a part of the world famous for both its awesome remoteness and the incredible wealth on and beneath the ground    for half a century indonesian troops and police officers have fought a shadowy and sporadic war in the vast forests and highlands of papua as the western end of new guinea is known after taking control of the former dutch colony in the 1960s it is a longrunning conflict that is poorly understood by even those involved    on one level the fight is between security forces and ragtag groups of indigenous separatists armed with guns spears and arrows    sometimes it is alleged it is factions of the security forces fighting among themselves drawn into competition over the illgotten spoils of a region of vast natural resources including some of the worlds richest mines often official references to those doing the killing go no further than unknown persons leaving their identity  agents provocateurs business rivals or guerrillas  the stuff of conspiracy theories    but after an outburst of violence in recent months that has killed dozens indonesia is coming under renewed calls to solve a conflict replete with economic misery and human rights abuses that has tainted the countrys image as an emerging democratic giant
  that aint no genocide that woman has fucking gucci sunglasses and a big ass gold ring on
  those are samoan protestors in samoa supporting west papuans they arent papuans
  i heard indonesia was taken over by a un special envoy because they had legal cannibalism and didnt like the bad rep
  yes
  countries like pakistan have no laws against cannibalism of corpses
  indonesians still circumcise girls and complain about backwardness
  they have the biggest rate of mutilating them in southeast asia
  because thats an unthinkable scenario in a muslim country
  indonesian rule over west papua is a violation of border aesthetics
  indonesia malaysia philippines are all the result of western colonialism   myanmar thailand laos cambodia and vietnam existed before western colonialism
  its not a genocide when they had it coming
  do west papuans under indonesian occupation want an independent west papua republic or to merge into one country with papua new guinea
  and the artificial states created by colonialism need to be split up into ethnic components to prevent genocides from happening this is what happens when people draw lines on a map without any consideration for human life
  gaddafi in libya supported west papuan opm fighters against indonesia with weapons and training

  yeah pretty much actually since theyve been there for ages      there were minny influxes of various south indians into what is known as burma for ages    arakan is called rakhine because the burmese state wants erase the history of the area and promote the idea that arakan was always a rakhine area despite facts to the contrary with other peoples in the region settling and migrating to and from it
  arakan came under strong indic influence from the indian subcontinent particularly the ancient kingdoms of the ganges delta arakan was one of the first regions in southeast asia to adopt dharmic religions it became one of the earliest indianized kingdoms in southeast asia buddhist missionaries from the mauryan empire traveled through arakan to other parts of southeast asia
  arakan is the native rakhine name for the region you dumb dumb dumb idiot myanmar renamed all its ethnic minority states after the ethnic minority native to them thats why mon state is called mon state not hanthawaddy state and shan state is called shan state not muang mao state  the natives of arakan are the daingnet chakma maramagyi mro thet   daingnet chakma and maramagyi speak indic languages but are mongoloid buddhist mro are austro asiatic they are natives of arakan not the rohingya bengalis  native americans are native to the americas not black africans
  indianized  not indian indianized in order to be indianized you have to be nonindic in the first place arakans natives were austro asiatics like the mro the daingnet chakma and maramagyi barua are native austroasiatics of arakan who adopted indic languages other indian influence
  still doesnt justify the mass abuse also its funny because chinese totally dominate burmese society in such an extreme matter the archetypical jew conspiracy is legit a reality there but the military government will never touch a single hair on them because of you know who next door
when did this board become boring as hell
  also its funny because chinese totally dominate burmese society in such an extreme matter the archetypical jew conspiracy is legit a reality there but the military government will never touch a single hair on them because of you know who next door  you spewing shit like this is exactly how i know you dont know shit about burmese society politics or culture

how significant of an impact did the vikings have on the world and what would you say were their achievments  please lets keep this serious    founded russia  conquered england  conquered southern italy and sicily  raided the shit out of everyone and sacked paris among other  varangian guard kept the byzantine empire alive  discovered america
none  end up abandoning slavic traditions and embracing byzantine and later western culture  beat a weary army after half of the soldiers were let go for the harvest and after killing the king in the first minute  lost sicily the second they had to fight a real enemy  only slowed progress down by raiding and raping  no one knew they discovered america
all the pillaging meant people moved into larger fortified towns like burghs     the danes had quite the cultural impact on england as a whole had it not been for the normans frenchifying everything then anglosaxon culture would have just been an extension of danish culture considering england had been a danish colony for like 40 years a bunch of english words actually stem from norse words which are often used    norwegians fucked around in the irish sea for a long while and dublin became the most relevant irish city because of them then you have the kingdom of the isles and the gallowglasses which descended from norsegaelic clans together with the danes they created the normans and extremely influental people and the two most relevant norman families the house of normandy and the house of hauteville directly descended from norsemen there were some colonization and exploring toward the west but how influental this was in the grand scheme of things is debatable    swedes fucked around in eastern europe and primary chronicle does mention that the rus was created by some norsemen who were chosen by the local tribes to govern them     really people not admitting the influence vikings had on european history are just butthurt for some strange reasons

  why dont you scroll down to the part of that page about arabs        the sexual use of children in the near east is as widespread as in the far east historically all the institutionalized forms of pedophilia which were customary in the far east are documented extensively for the near east including child marriage child concubinage temple prostitution of both boys and girls parentchild marriage among the zoroastrians sibling marriage quite common among egyptians sex slavery ritualized pederasty and child prostitution masturbation in infancy is said to be necessary to increase the size of the penis and older siblings are reported to play with the genitals of babies for hours at a time mutual masturbation fellatio and anal intercourse are also said to be common among children particularly with the older boys using younger children as sex objects the nude public baths hammam are particularly eroticized in many areas being especially notorious as a place of homosexual acts both male and female
  girls are used incestuously even more often than boys since females are valued so little one report found 80 percent of near eastern women surveyed recalled having been forced into fellatio between the ages of 3 and 6 by older brothers cousins uncles and teachers the girls rarely complain since if there is any punishment to be meted out it will always end up by being inflicted on her arab women know that their spouses are pedophiles and prefer having sex with children to having sex with them their retribution comes as follows when the girl is about 6 years old the women of the house grab her pull her thighs apart and cut off her clitoris and often also her labia with a razor thus usually ending her ability to feel sexual pleasure forever one egyptian woman relates her memory of how it happened to her after being used sexually by the men in her family during her early childhood she says    i was six years old that night when i lay in my bed warm and peacefuli felt something move under the blankets something like a huge handanother hand was clapped over my mouth to prevent me from screaming    they carried me to the bathroomi remembera rasping metallic sound which reminded me of the butcher when he used to sharpen his knifemy blood was frozen in my veinsmy thighs had been pulled wide aparti felt that the rasping knife or blade was heading straight down towards my throat then suddenly the sharp metallic edge seemed to drop between my thighs and there cut off a piece of flesh from my body
  i screamed with pain despite the tight hand held over my mouth for the pain was not just a pain it was like a searing flame that went through my whole body after a few moments i saw a red pool of blood around my hips i did not know what they had cut off from my body and did not try to find out i just wept and called out to my mother for help but the worst shock of all was when i looked around and found her standing by my side yes it was her i could not be mistaken in flesh and blood right in the midst of these strangers talking to them and smiling at them    a recent survey of egyptian girls and women showed 97 percent of uneducated families and 66 percent of educated families still practiced clitoridectomy nor is the practice decreasingun reports estimate that more than 74 million females have been mutilated with more female children mutilated today than throughout history    clitoridectomy like all sexual mutilations is i believe an act of incest if it is incest when a father rapes a daughter it is also incest when parents assault their children by cutting off sewing up burning flaying or gashing their genitals in all these cases the child is being used for the sadistic sexual pleasure of the parent in fact circumcision ceremonies are often followed by drinking parties that end in intercourse so sexually arousing is the circumcisionin some areas the traveling circumcizer is actually accompanied by some prostitutes who know how sexually excited villages become after the ceremony therefore the practice of sexually mutilating childrens genitalsone of the most widespread rituals in the worldby itself makes incest a nearuniversal trait

  ashkenazi jews are pretty inbred though they evidently heavily did it before
first cousin marriages were common in britain until the end of the 19th century when the risk of birth defects began to be recognised but the practice is traditional in communities around the world  although british parents of pakistani origin account for 34 per cent of all births nationwide they also account for around 30 per cent of children born with recessive gene disorders  while only 15 per cent of the population in bradford is of pakistani origin an estimated 55 per cent are married to their first cousins  the city has the second highest number of infant deaths in england and birth disorders involving recessive genes are 10 to 15 per cent higher than the general population according to a study by st lukes hospital bradford  phil woolas the oldham mp who is now immigration minister caused outrage among muslim groups in february when he called first cousin marriages the elephant in the room but he was supported by bradford mp ann cryer who called for more public information about the risks of such marriages  research published last week pointed out that the risk of birth defects  up two per cent  and infant mortality  up 44 per cent  was similar to that for mothers over 40

  there are more fundamentalist mormons in the us then muslims
  more common than nowadays nothing is better for the family than the family itself
  fpbp
  how dare you remind me of my sins with that image op  you make me sick  i make me sick
  how do people even become mormons  if you read the origins its obviously some dude making a cult to accumulate money/a harem of girls to molest they dont even have the opacity of thousands of years to hide behind like other religions  then if you look at the leadership nowadays its not really different
  i know that feel anon i know that feel

  but whats the difference when the average paki looks like that already
  whos talking about the us cousin shagger
  uhh so whats going on in slovakia
  ashkenazi jews arent a cohesive unit especially today the religiously extreme communities usually referred to as haredimwhich literally means zealots are culturally degenerate they still partake in the tradition of arranged marriage and in family marriage isnt exactly unheard of they used to be the majority of the jewish community but secularization started to dwindle their number by the beginning of the 20th century and the holocaust ran them to the ground further nowadays most of them are confined to israel with small pockets in other countries    the more secular groups of jews view them with justified contempt
  they have a massive proselytizing campaign always going on keep this squeaky clean image and breed like rabbits
  this is an international site
  this map is retarded
  looks like a paki same poo skin and huge ass north indian nose
  legality / prevalence most countries dont need to criminalize it since its so rare any case nice try but over half of muslims are products of incest
  i wasnt talking about the prevalence you triggered dipshit that map spells it out for you  the law     also its impossible to record cousin marriage anyway hell you can marry your sister if youre smart enough its not like you can tell couples on the street are cousins or not     the south which has like 100 million people has a reputation for incest too kek stereotypes exist for a reason
  finally the one time new jersey is right and everyone else in the us is wrong
  stereotypes exist for a reason    most arent accurate or are based off lies slander or social manipulation see jap yanks in ww2
  why do people ajways bring up the exact same case
  cant wait for jar of jizz january
  gypsies
  then its fap fest february
  realize my first gf was basically gwen  what have i done
  are you trying to trigger people with a picture of two whites kissing  this is truly 4 dimensional baiting
  the guy isnt white hes a trk
  messy masturbation march
  having a reputation is different than having a studied high prevalence like muslims do
  they have a small founder population but they dont partake in incest theres a difference    the consanguinity rate among the couples was 23 including 08 first cousin marriages with the highest consanguinity rate among eastern jews 71
        seething
  abundant autoeroticism april
  the map is false its legal in austria but only turks arabs und gypsies do it
  not him but you actually dont believe incestuous interbreeding increases the risk of genetic defects
  just remember that europeans were such prolific inbreeds that the spanish empire literally died out because they put their pure european inheritence on the spanish throne    gj habsburgs
      can i get a source on this
  arab  islamic      theres at least a good million arabic christians arabs are converting to christianity these days more than islam as well african muslims are especially prone to christian conversions ironically though these are some of the worst christian groups for conservative opinions like female genital mutilation and persecution of people for being gay
  the arab christians are not the ones marrying their cousins though
    first image is charles darwin    damn euros btfo    oh and theres this nugget        so if muslims are getting married to their cousins they can probably move to america where they share their beliefs    also youre conveniently ignoring that a lot of cousin marriages in the middle east are extrapolating data to make it out like muslims are inbreeding when the reality is a lot of families marry close for economic reasons a statistic worth considering in addition to the cousin marriage stuff is the frequency that married couples have sex in the middle east its far less than in europe or north america so there could be a lot of marriages on record where its purely platonic and not about sexual relationships     although one issues that does come about from this and partly due to flawed immigration laws is a lot of cousins will marry their relatives to help move along their immigration to a preferred destination is this their barbarism or is it our own at being unable to accommodate basic human movement to a better economic realm
  again having laws that permit cousin marriage does not mean they are common an estimated 02 percent of marriages in the united states are between individuals who are second cousins or closer thats a bit less than 4060 rate of muslims     just think about it chances are one of your parents was product of cousin incest and 1/2 chances that you were too
  middle east has pretty high birth rates of course they fuck are you serilusly telling me that 4060 of muslims never have sex
  arab states have also the highest rates of birth defects what a weird coincidence if they dont actually inbreed that much wouldnt you say
  something magical
  pretty common impregnating a woman over 40 is still more dangerous than fucking your cousin
  doesnt seem like it 
  palestinian 5 766  israeli
  israelis are mostly secular have high rates of exogamy and are a mixture of 3 diffefent jewish ethnicities jews havent been extremely cosanguinous for over a century and have a huge portion of european dna already most arabs and west asians are the pure stock of their ancestors and have continued cousin and sister fucking for thousands of years
  that flag is tunisian
  potentially epic fap thread reduced to race baiting  comd on guys when i click an incest thread i want to jerk off not hitler salute
  they fuck more to have babies not as much for fun americans by comparison will admit to having sex more often for pleasure than strictly for copulation islamic woman pride themselves on being a bit prude about having sex because they feel like it keeps them cleaner compared to what they find to be degenerate american style sex
  this
  arab here  they definitely do
  you talking about copts jordanian or general levantine its against eastern orthodox and catholic rules for those levantines who belong to the church although they may violate it if you say so
  its against  no it isnt
  those two churches forbid cousin marriages copts arent eastern orthodox they are oriental orthodox
  pretty sure they allow fag amrriages so what wouldnt they allow also see   retard
  looks like an american to me
  what an asshole they just believe man

       after their death the siblings became symbols in france of brave and tragic love paintings were made depicting them and plays were written about them
  the siblings were entombed in the church of saintjeanengrève bearing the epitaph here lie the brother and sister passing does not inform you of the cause of your death but go and pray to god for their souls    actually kinda sad
  they dont allow fag marriages
  fuck you they do
  most humans in history married their first cousins it just went out of style in the west the whole world looked like the middle east a few centuries ago the stigma of cousin marriage is a reason the enlightenment even developed by the way
  i mean id fap to it but its not sad at all just incestual degeneracy
  very
  the stigma of cousin marriage is a reason the enlightenment even developed by the way  anon could you go a little deeper into that point
  this is a really good case study in cognitive dissonance and general pathological reasoning take note how they concede the point and then try to warp its meaning after being backed into a corner
  children that are the product of cousin marriage are known to have slighter lower iqs controversial theories suggest that wahhabism in the middleeast was able to flourish in the 50s to 70s because the population had a large population of slightly duller iq ppl who were disproptinately products of incest conversely westerners were more open to enlightenment ideas because the population was a higher witted since incest marriage became more difficult to attain from the church in the 1500s and onwards
  the enlightenment is at least partially the result of the church instituting policies that made a larger portion of the population higher iq  the eugenicist in me buys it desu
  do you have dates on when the specific antiincestual doctrines were put into place
  kek
  i dont think there is a convincing argument for a singular cause of the iq climb we saw postrenaissance anon some people believe its due to execution of violent criminals others believe it was nutrition and higher g loaded environmenta selecting out brainlets others think forcing the peasants to become shopkeepers and factory workers incentivized assortative mating and still others like you argue for reduced consanguinity i think i agree it should have had an impact but im not so sure it was even the primary driver would need to see actual studies done on societies that industrialized which had low cosanguinity like china and others like iraq or syria which have high but also higher iq its difficult because arabs and nignogs are so fucking stupid and havent really seen the benefits of european enlightenment style skyward cognitive boosts
  thread about incest in the modern world  doesnt want the largest group of people still practising it to be mentioned    its impossible to talk about incest in the modern world without focusing on muslims since they are by far the largest group still actively practising it
  americans find incest a bit filthy too you know to each their own i guess
    on december 2 1603 julien and marguerite arrived at the place de grève for execution   they were each given a chance to confess and marguerite in a desperate attempt to save her brother confessed she was solely guilty and she had bewitched him   julien refused to confess nor implicate his sister as the execution was beginning a crowd of people began gather ironically to support the siblings and pleaded for them to be spared nevertheless they were executed by decapitation   julien was 21 and marguerite was 17
  again id fap to it but its not sad at all just incestual degeneracy
      actually believing this pew poll meme
  you keep saying muslims through this entire thread as if arab christians dont do exactly the same thing take it from someone who lives in a middle eastern country with a significant christian population they do it too now back to /pol/ with you
  the op explicitly says throughout history you irredeemable /pol/nigger can you not go one hour without shouting about those damned dirty sand niggers
  why do they i never saw the appeal
  thats the dumbest shit ive ever ever heard also cousin marriage only fell out of fashion post ww2 never post here again
  did you seriously not notice the and/or in there its either illegal and/or less than 5 practice
  go fuck your cousin ahmed
  thats because they have grown up in muslim cultures where its the norm but it most certainly is an influence of islamas even indonesians do it
  because fundamentalist mormons are a very small heretic subset of mormons and have been excommunicated from the church
  t mutt
  its a shitty map    see
  iiits the muzzies  the christian and muslim sects in my country are fairly separate with the christians holding the most power for the majority of the countrys history heres a rhetorical question are mutts so retarded
  the majority of the arab world and arabs in europe are inbred
  yet another faggot not seeing the op explicitly say in history i know you election refugees have a lot of trouble adhering to board rules but at least have 3rd grade reading comprehension
  historically they were inbred too
  look christian arabs also often abstain from alcohol and pork too as theyre not comlon in theur country its no surprise that the muslims with the lowest prevalence of consanguinity are from europe among christian neighbors in the balkans
    face up to reality pluto theres a reason people can hear you breathe from a hundred meters away  hhhhgggghhhhhghghghghghhgwhitoidhghghghghcope        hes a butthurt muslet who thinks that the white slave on /his/ are going to defend his sewer mutant people  it makes me laugh how /his/ has gone so hard against /pol/ that they are now the muzzled house slaves of minority chauvinists
  everyone and their pet dog was inbred historically
      christians in arab countries are influenced by the majority copts adopted fgm from shafii sunni muslims because fgm is mandatory to shafii sunnis who are the majority of egypt fgm cannot be found anywhere in coptic christian theology but it is found sunni shafii theology and hadith
    did you miss the part where i said christians were the majority and held the most power in my country and despite this they still practiced cousin marriage regularly    heres a fun fact less developed nations and rural nations practice cousin marriage more regularly because people are much more spread out is it any wonder why cousin marriages went down in western nations as they developed and moved into cities
  the only country that would be is lebanon which existed as a protected entity by westerners only since the 19th century before that ottomans treated nonsunnis horribly
  that has nothing to do with the argument and thats also wrong the entire ottoman empire wasnt the young turks
  ottomans incited druze against maronite and persecuted twelver shia before the young turks
  what country is that as far as i know consanguinity is not common in any christian majority nation in the world
  wrong    it has been estimated that 55 of marriages between pakistani muslim immigrants in the united kingdom are between first cousins where preferential patrilateral parallel cousin marriage ie a boy marrying the daughter of his fathers brother is favored
awwahu aghbur
  lebanon main problem is the terrorists loyal to lran
    its the shiites  its the sunnis  its the christians    its the lebs
  where did i say people stop practicing it when they move into western nations i said it goes away as countries develop and people move into cities
  sunni terrorist detected all three sunni            
  the only case of gang rape comitted by lebanese abroad was not by shia maronite orthodox druze but by sunnis            
    they are moving into developed countries they are moving into cities  why do they continue to practice it are you saying that muslims in developed urban societies will not adapt unless they control those societies
it was fairly common in pharaonic egypt and zoroastrian iran    apart from royal families  the problem is that we dont really know much about the nonelite of the distant past after all only the elite were educated and left records
  how does it affect you other than making you upset
    you should read nativist prophets by patricia crone it only came out in 2013 so its pretty fresh material   she has a very interesting theory about the mazdakites socalled suggesting that the idea of zoroastrianism as an elite cult only reflects the religious practice of that elite while the mazdakites and later khurramites reflected the religious beliefs of the lower orders   its not a perfect theory but it is far more fecund inasmuch as it prompts further investigation than the alternative
    it raises property prices it puts disproportionate strain on our already overtaxed healthcare system it makes serving halal mandatory which means nonmuslim butcheries lose contracts and makes observing christian or jewish prohibitions difficult if not impossible it introduces a class of parasitic clergymen who extract mandatory charity from inbred bumpkins too belligerent and stupid to know any better who reproduce an ideology tailormade to protect their right to get all the tendies and molest your daughter during quran lessons  not to mention the most honourable ghazis incorrectly labeled as terrorists by munafiq bedwetters like you
    oh also it means im competing for jobs with people who only seem to hire one another whenever they are given a sliver of authority it means i have to accept the lies that my government tells about your religion it means i have to tolerate muslims lack of selfawareness their eagerness to criticise everyone else while never being criticised themselves  it means that i have to accept that a bunch of bug eyed semiliterate stoners and whoremongers are better spokesmen for islam than either people willing to kill and die for islam like isis or hezbollah or the quran itself is
    lol /pol/tire meme shit as predicted  this board isnt for you hill mutant
rare footage of sayf addawla negotiating release of captives with tzmiskes    
anything to say for yourself you fucking leb rat or will you just creep away to repeat the same shit tomorrow  you all deserve islam
  because its well documented and it shows that there is an issue with a small subset of the population
  lebanese are not the problem sunni terrorists are
  hurrr just give me more huffpopium and let me stupor in peace
  would be funnier if the numbers didnt add up
  that isnt the historical background of haredim at all and im not even jewish
what if u shag ur cousin but dont get her pregnant
    islam depends on peoples deflecting its problems onto one or another sect  the problem is anyone who attempts apologetics for it and since muslims seem eager to waddle into an abattoir and take us all with them i say they are the problem without distinction
    the issue with /his/ is that retarded guardian readers and eyerollers jump on the bandwagon and think that they become smarter by being on the big brain side        then your seed is watery and you should kill yourself infa 631
  i meant like wear a condom or anal or summat like that
    condom     why not just go the whole hog and get a chastity cage you faggot    anal     gaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
  shia dont commit terrorist attacks or behead hostages
  am just proposing a hypothetical amigo dont be mean on my board
  my parents were 45 when they lost their virginity and i have no defects retard
    shia dont commit terrorist attacks        yes they do your favourite muslims are the ones who arent targeting you at the moment  but what about sufis  responsible for the stagnation of science in the middle east thank the greatest muslim thinker who ever lived alghazali the occasional man for that one  they are all shit because it is all derived from shit  what is good in the middle east exists despite islam the totalising thought destroying matrix of insincere and laughable amateur theological farts rehashed over centuries by people smarter than muhammad into something that almost passes muster as disgusting in the 9th century as in the 21st
    not your board cardassian it never was
    both of these are wrong in america the legality of first cousin marriage is up to the state
  what do i have to say you made no arguments and just spewed typical /pol/nigger muhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh muzzzzziiiiiiieeeeeeesssssssssss
  i never defended sufis who are sunni nonsunnis like ibadi and shia dont commit terrorism or behead hostages
      inb4 not real terrorists
    i made no arguments    typical muslim block out everything that contradicts you and then say but youve made no arguments lol  tell me again how you are more qualified to speak for islam than people who spend their lives fighting for it who consider its laws to be the only acceptable ones  tell me why all of the evidence of muslim inbreeding affecting your children would not lead to those evil harbis being taxed disproportionately to care for your deformed spawn  tell me how a jew or a christian can keep their law when they have no idea if the food they are eating is halal or not  you say i havent made a single argument the best youve come out with is le ebin meme jpeg  fucking polluted animal
  hezbollah dont want to take over the world sunni muslim brotherhood wants worldwide caliphate
    dont bother i already posted it hes going into islamode where he can only process certain words in a sentence   its a survival mechanism so that muslims who show a divine spark of intellect are weeded out before they inwardly apostatise and lead others astray like the mutazilites did
    spy doesnt want to take over the world but spy wants a worldwide caliphate
  ibadi muslims follow mutazilite philosophy they are not sunni and still exist they dont commit terrorism
  you are completely incomprehensible half of what you said doesnt make any sense and written very poorly your first claim makes no sense and doesnt even really say anything youre second claim is that first cousin marriages stresses out the healthcare system yet you provide no sources that muslims/arabs draw more from it how does halal meat have anything to do with jews or christians are they not allowed to eat it     learn the english language before you come at me with such garbage posts
  they are still a terrorist organization that commit terrorist acts you retard thats the claim you made and the existence of hezbollah proves you wrong
  twelver shia do not believe in or have the institution of caliphate since ali died
  hezbollah participates in the internationally recognized government of lebanon
  congratulations that means nothing they are still a terrorist organization that are traitors to the country they say they are defending
  hariri built a giant ottoman style sunni mosque in beirut bigger than the biggest church in lebanon to display sunni dominance after pomising it wouldnt be bigger
    you mean those people who think contact with kuffar pollutes you   those people who have to periodically remind the rest of you that they are kharijites  their existence excuses the entire filthy pack of you sure s        you are completely incomprehensible    to someone who speaks english as a second language fitting that you are arrogant enough to presume you are more familiar with the language than i am but i should be used to arrogant muslets by now    1 what qualifies you to speak for islam when the most dedicated muslims kill and torture people what have you sacrificed for your religion lately  2   although british parents of pakistani origin account for 34 per cent of all births nationwide they also account for around 30 per cent of children born with recessive gene disorders  while only 15 per cent of the population in bradford is of pakistani origin an estimated 55 per cent are married to their first cousins  the city has the second highest number of infant deaths in england and birth disorders involving recessive genes are 10 to 15 per cent higher than the general population according to a study by st lukes hospital bradford  thats just pakistanis a global map showing rates of consanguineous marriage will demonstrate that they are not unique among muslacs we the evil harbis pay so that your mutant offspring will survive past day three of its life  3 no you fucking idiot you people wax on about how ignorant we are and you dont know anything jews cannot eat halal meat it is not kosher christians cant eat meat that has been dedicated to other gods something most christians dont know about but it remains incumbent upon them as christians  of course atheists are presumed to be cattle so it doesnt matter what they think they can put up and shut up    i am using colloquialisms and figures of speech maybe you should learn english as it is spoken rather than using it like an autistic person would
  no source provided still makes claims
    if we call our universal ruler something besides caliph its qualitatively different lol    i know all about the retardation of the shits
        wriggle for me
  ibadi oman has hindu temples and not a single terrorist came from oman
  the 12th imam is the leader and in occultation in twelver belief for nizari ismailis aga khan is the leader
    a tiny minority which is considered heterodox by everyone else demonstrates the tolerance that all segregationist societies do  outrageous my worldview is coming apart at the seams   my world is upside down having learned that they let their serfs worship whatever kuffar idols they want
  stop conflating nonsunnis with sunnis
    i know you condescending little rat that is why they have a deputy for the deputy   you are puking up trifles and then complacently telling yourself they negate everything else i have said
    i will when they show there is a difference between them  the only people who ought to care about this difference are muslim to nonmuslims you act the same way whenever you have the whip hand that means a position of advantage okay you understand that dont you  you started out asking how does this affect you i explained how it affects me and now you like the stereotypical muslim degenerate into bleating about sectarian conflicts nobody except you lot actually care about because they revolve around disputes which are only relevant to muslims  watch how he calls me a /pol/tard for using the word degenerate
  a telegraph article that doesnt link any sort of study    come on my election tourist friend post an actual peer reviewed source to substantiate your claims
    what qualifies you to speak for islam when the most dedicated muslims kill and torture people  heres the fallacy you cant see across a group being more violent does not mean its more islamic alqaeda is in some ways less violent than isis but that does not mean that they are less sincere in belief the muslim brotherhood in turn is relatively less violent than aq but again they consider themselves to be true believers and isis to be misguided so on and so forth onto conservative and   actual moderate muslims who are not violent but are sincere in belief     another problem with holding isis or alqaeda as the true believerstm is that you would basically have to accept that 99 of muslims are apostates including the other group which is a fairly ridiculous view made even more laughable by the fact that a nonmuslim is the one arguing in favour of it
            im not your friend small man im a harbi  dont pretend to be the friends of people you see nothing wrong with murdering in their sleep
  shiw me a single armed nizari ismaili or ibadi group hindus in oman are citizens not serfs stop talking about things you dont know or you are a sunni false flagger
  congrats on finally posting proof friendo and ill admit youre right pakistanis in britain marry first cousins a lot
    oh no ive seen far beyond that your conceit is that you think being less violent makes someone more islamic  in reality you can kill and maim and be a good muslim you can live totally peacefully and earn violent death extreme violence can make someone a better muslim it can make you a worse muslim   only someone claiming to be a muslim would see no problem with this  also sincerity is no excuse when you dont keep the law that is antinomian    you would basically have to accept that 99 of muslims are apostates    i do you havent yet proven youre a muslim as far as im concerned its a harbi arguing with an apostate who thinks hes a muslim because no muslims are around to tell him otherwise  you think that true faith belongs to the majority    is a fairly ridiculous view made even more laughable by the fact that a nonmuslim is the one arguing in favour of it    its true that thoroughness is a foreign concept to most muslims
        there is an important cluster of countries with high levels of consanguinity observed in most communities of north africa the middle east and western asia a transverse belt that runs from pakistan and afghanistan in the east to morocco in the west  noticeably many arab countries display some of the highest rates of consanguineous marriages    it doesnt matter what you admit mate what is and what muslims and socalled muslims will admit are two completely different things   as youve shown you will kick and scream and wriggle every step of the way to avoid admitting in front of harbis what you already know is true
  hariri built a giant ottoman style sunni mosque in beirut bigger than the biggest church in lebanon to display sunni dominance after pomising it wouldnt be bigger  what does that have to do with if hezbollah is a terrorist organization also note hezbollah assassinated a lebanon president
  your problem is with sunnis not nizari ismaili shia not mustali ismaili shia not ibadis not twelver shia none of them will do apologetics for sunni practices or terrorism those sects did not originate from sunnos but from the beginning of islam the only group that does apologia for sunni terrorism are ahmadis because they are a heretical sect which branched off sunnis and are desperate for sunni acceptance
    leveraging animosity to one sect is a common tactic to bleed sympathy out of retarded harbis  its whataboutism of the most blatant sort but a lot of /his/ posters are predisposed to be as generous as possible towards these fuckwits to show theyre not a /pol/ or b fedoras
  hariri was a sunni supremacist who wanted to nationalize sunni palestinians in lebanon to boost the sunni population maronites didnt like hariri
    my problem is with muslims yes ismailis yes twelvers yes ahmadis yes on a boat yes with a goat yes here or there yes everywhere  i do not like the cult islam  i do not like it samiam
  what the hell are you talking about no shia or ibadi poses threat to europe look at a map and see the sect of the muslim countries who border the west and invaded the west for centuries your problem is with sunnis or you are one
  hariri was killed because he was going against hezbollah and the syrian occupation too bad that backfired on them and caused the ceder revolution to kick out the syrians now all we need is to kick out hezbollah and then maybe lebanon can stabilize
  all the sanctions imposed by the west against the only shia majority nation kinda contradicts the whole only sunnis hate west narrative
  the sanctions are over nuclear energy not religion
  sound like a good thing to me accepting refugees supposed to mean the refugees become nationalize
    eat shit the fatimids persecuted christians and jews as well alhakim had them wearing iron crosses round their necks to distinguish them from the muslims he destroyed their holy sites  the shits went after the sunnis because they were nearby  had the fatimids triumphed over the abbasids you know bloody well that they would have been going after the byzantines   more importantly how in the hell does the fact that shits tend mostly to kill sunnis make them any better you think im that parochial that i only care about this shit when its white people what is done to one can easily be done to another if killing other people who profess islam is alright then where the hell does it leave someone who considers muhammad a halfwit who thought mary was part of the trinity  the fact that they dont pose a threat at the moment does not mean they will not in the future
    accepting refugees supposed to mean the refugees become nationalize    since when you mean immigrants expecting someone who didnt come by choice to integrate is a bit much isnt it
  youre starting to ramble my man i never said that being less violent made someone more islamic just pointed out the fallacy in believing the opposite    islam does indeed have doctrines of war but their applicability and justifiability is debated among muslims most muslims believe in their defensiveness and reject the calls of fanatical groups i know its a cliche but the point about different interpretations is true nonetheless    when you dont keep the law  the kharijites argued as much before they killed off 2 caliphs the ibadis are a moderate splitoff from them btw as mentioned before isis believes that alqaeda doesnt keep the law and so on how does one objectively say which group keeps it    btw the way you call yourself a harbi is similar to how /pol/ uses the term goyim for itself when trying to bash jews hatred is easiest to justify when you believe its reciprocal
  germanfag here one of my best friends parents are both the children of a cousin marriage the mothers ie his grandmothers are also second cousins to each other and both these grandmothers were also themselves products of a cousin marriage theyre all from an originally large 13sibling rich family in the same village somewhere at 4 or 5 generations back he has a doubled set of greatgrandfather and greatgrandmother    cousin marriage is pretty rare though and he definitely keeps this info secret nowadays    seems to be in ok health hes a pretty smart guy studied math works at a bank he did have a weird facial paralysis a while back where the right left of his face and neck were suddenly paralyzed for no reason for a few weeks then just as suddenly went away on its own doctors couldnt diagnose it it wasnt a stroke or anything they even called it basically random unexplained facial paralysis on his sick note
  they did us a favour
  nizari ismailis permanently abrogated most previous fatimid ismaili shariah at alamut when their imam hassan ii declared qiyamah they abrogated hadith prayer fasting hajj their current imam aga khan iv abrogated even more like lifting the quranic the ban on muslim women marrying nonmuslims you dont know anything about their theology abrogation is the defining feature of nizari ismailis after they broke off from the fatimids they dont kill anyone except in defense
  some of thats all the depleted uranium we freedomd them with
  palestinian and israeli
  nizari ismaili women dont weir veil or hijab either
    islam does indeed have doctrines of war but their applicability and justifiability is debated among muslims    that its debated isnt an answer you dont say anything about that debate or its predicates you just say its debated     most muslims believe in their defensiveness    i want the opinions of educated muslims i want scholars opinions not the opinions of imran the pothead from shoreditch he doesnt matter  most muslims are cattle waddling as i said into an abattoir i refuse to let their ignorance drag all of us in there with them simply because we want to believe the best in others    how does one objectively say which group keeps it    he examines their conduct and their beliefs and compares it with scripture and the hadith  which is to say its almost a total pick and mix yet however eclectic you want to be you cannot navigate around the quran itself which does condone aggression against infidels muhammad himself was a ghazi    the way you call yourself a harbi is similar to how /pol/ uses the term goyim for itself when trying to bash jews    not really if a jew wanted to mock a gentile hed be better off using the term akum  harbi on the other hand is a well established category enemy of mine ours is the house of war isnt it please deny that show me your dishonesty  the hatred clearly is reciprocal its demonstrated every time muslims excuse this or that terror attack with but what about iraq  ive seen enough sniveling apologists of the mehdi atheists are cattle hassan stripe to know that what a muslim says to your face does not reflect how he thinks i dont trust you you have given me no reason to as you denied and denied and denied things you admit you knew were true  if you think this is unfair act otherwise dont oblige us to change how we see you while you continue to act exactly the same way and do nothing to counter those false muslims you see as defaming your religion you cry as you take
  high chances of defect occuring doesnt mean it always will brainlet  cleopatra was the result of generations of sibling incest yet she had no defect
    forgot to mention that gold delivered in a rambling style always trumps sweetly phrased horseshit
  the aga khan is viewed as a living quran by nizari ismailis he tells them how to follow their religion not the written quran
    she had no defect    she was a whore
  hey isnt that girl like 10 years old
    clearly you are new to arguing with muslims  its half bro why are you so mean to us   and half lol were going to rape off all your skin off
    brrrrrrrrrrro
  you dont say anything about that debate  your very next quote of me invalidates your claim as i said muslims believe in their defensiveness be loyal to your muslim government or your muslim imams in nonmuslim governments you do realize that the hardest fighting against these extremists are being done by muslims themselves ofcourse takfiri isis and you dont consider them the 99 as muslims a ridiculous view i must reiterate but thats another story    i want the opinions of educated muslims  there are many imams from all over the world who denounce islamic extremist groups its true that they may not perfectly fit into the mound of western liberal beliefs for example those living in muslim countries but fatwas or just general condemnations of extremist groups are fairly common    you cannot navigate around the quran itself  i made the point about multiple interpretations true you cant play too fast and loose with the text although some groups like the nizari do with their own justification but the quran does mostly mention defensive fighting against pagans even the violent verses make mention of this according to this view aggression against infidels was against pagans who exiled the muslims from their city    ours is the house of war isnt it  the house of peace/war dichotomy isnt even scriptural and most versions of include the house of truce as well    in the end there isnt much one can do to convince someone who has a pathological hatred for muslims you criticize mehdhi hassan no fan of him for calling atheists cattle but have referred to muslims as cattle and other vulgarities numerous times in your previous posts youre completely hypocritical and paranoid to boot
    invalidates    that wasnt outlining a debate that was making a generalisation    the hardest fighting    a fight being lost    takfiri    i dont recognise this term since anyone using it in the sense you intend is a takfiri themselves    there are many imams from all over the world who denounce islamic extremist groups    and just as many if not more who do not the fact that its up to the individual muslim to choose between two equally valid interpretations one saying crush their skulls and the other saying have a nice cup of tea is ludicrous the left hand hides the right    according to this view aggression against infidels    judging by his later actions they were right to do it  that said what of the killing of munafiqun  that you cant play fast and loose is exactly the problem the interpretations validated by the quran are myriad and there is no real reason why you should condemn a violent interpretation and exalt a pacific one unless you had motives ulterior to being a good muslim which seems suspect    dichotomy isnt even scriptural    i admit that is true it isnt in the quran however    jurists trace the concept to muhammad  whose messages to the persian abyssinian and byzantine emperors demanded that they choose between conversion and war  so again it is a legitimate term and the onus is on you to show otherwise contradict their sources and you undermine the entire religion    in the end there isnt much one can do to convince someone who has a pathological hatred for muslims    you could show me that the people who kill and crucify others are clearly not muslims you have failed to do that  muslims have earned my hatred many many times over muslims have killed my friends relatives muslims have been raping and slaving in towns not far from mine muslims have come to my country as beggars taken our charity and stabbed us in the back  why should i love you
    as an antisunni islamist takfiri is the best term because alternate terms like khawarij are the worst calling isis khawarij is an attempt to pin the blame for isiss distinctly sunni inspired theology upon the original khawarij sect from the 1th century who have nothing to do with isis sunni radicals takfiri on the other hand is a neutral term for sunni radicals which accurately describes what they do declare takfir    muslims have earned my hatred many many times over muslims have killed my friends relatives muslims have been raping and slaving in towns not far from mine muslims have come to my country as beggars taken our charity and stabbed us in the back    ibadis nizari ismaili shia mustali ismaili shia and twelver shia arent the ones who have killed your friends relatives raping or slaving in towns far from yours coming to your country as beggars and stabbing you in the back the only people who do that are of sunni background there are ibadis in north africa and sunnis in north africa but only sunnis in north africa come to europe rape girls blow up civilians
  1th century   7th century
a fight being lost  so you think isis or some other group is going to accomplish all their goals and take over the whole world    takfiri  a takfiri is someone who declares other muslims to be apostates like isis does i dont   think other muslims are apostates so how am i one in the case of isis i think they are misguided     the fact that its up to the individual muslim to choose between two equally valid interpretations one saying crush their skulls and the other saying have a nice cup of tea is ludicrous  christianity has had fucked up interpretations too but they have died out over time the interpretations that witchespagans and heretics should burn do exist but are no longer practiced by christians despite the fact that they were validated by religious figures in the past     there is no real reason why you should condemn a violent interpretation and exalt a pacific one  no real reason for the opposite either however the behaviour of isis can be theologically discredited by comparing them to   groups like the kharijites a group which like isis considered most muslims to be apostates there are other arguments against isis as well for example them rebelling against muslim states the main point is that these views and arguments do exist     the onus is on you to show otherwise  dar alharb has been affected by historical changes and with the fragmentation of the muslim world into numerous states the concept has little significance today    you could show me that the people who kill and crucify others are clearly not muslims  when i first chimed in my point was to show that considering isis to be true muslimstm was a fallacy i never denied that they had sincere beliefs what i argued was that moderate muslims and other groups have equally valid sincere beliefs something you denied    the muslim world is in a way undergoing a civil war which includes a war of ideas you have chosen a pretty pessimistic view of the entire situation
  
  isis terrorists follow sunni theology revere the rashidun caliphs and follow sunni madhahib khawarij followed entirely different theology and were against the last two rashiduin caliphs
  which is exactly what the second map shows you idiot
  all of that is bullshit and even if it was true who cares you have to pay for hivaids and tranny surgeries who gives a shit anymore
  could have blamed his sister and lived  didnt  holy shit this has to be the basedest guy in history you hear about people supposedly dying for their faith but this is a real documented instance of someone being told call your sister a whore and you can live and he refused
common if you are a follower of peace
  oh yeah sorry mea culpa as they say in paris
  it is  autistically so here in romania
  there is a difference betwen steriotypes created as state sponsored slander in propaganda purposes and steriotypes that are created naturally by regular interactions
  europe / arabia
  those defects are the result of centuries of repeated cousin marriages though  so muslim first cousins are more related to each other than european first cousins if that makes sense  so in the west impregnating a woman over 40 is still probably more dangerous than fucking your cousin
  on march 20 1600 thirteenyearold marguerite was married  by the following year marguerite gave birth to a daughter  fugg i really was born in the wrong generation
  what about your mom if shes under 40
  its been taboo it pretty much every society through history
  did you even bother reading the thread or are you too scared of pulling your head out your ass
  are both the children of a cousin marriage the mothers ie his grandmothers are also second cousins to each other and both these grandmothers were also themselves products of a cousin marriage theyre all from an originally large 13sibling rich family in the same village somewhere at 4 or 5 generations back he has a doubled set of greatgrandfather and greatgrandmother    why the fuck are you lying desperate muslim pos less than half a percentage of native germans practise consanguinity the odds that both his parents were are astronomically low i know youre desperate to shift the blame but this is your problem not ours
  but british pakistanis live in the cities not the british countryside you doofus
  the thing is theres no room for interpretation with the quran its pretty straight forward just looking at the life of muhammad who all muslims should imitate will make you into a terrorist tell me who lives a life closer to that of muhammad a westernised muslim in a secular country or a religious fanatic like isis in the middle east slaughtering unbelievers and conquering the desert with a sword we all know muhammad was a violent warlord so what is there to misinterpret
it was during the time when game of thrones happened
  do you ever get tired of being a paranoid loser
  the thing is theres no room for interpretation with the quran    interpretation maybe not but there is certainly room for implementation the quran is a short book and many of the rules it enumerates are vague for example it states that women should cover themselves and their face with their mantles for modesty nowhere is it explained what exactly is a mantle if hands and feet should be covered if hair should be its up to the hadiths and various religious law schools to give more details
    the rule that all muslims should imitate muhammed as he is the most perfect human being to have ever lived is very simple and unambiguous  imitating muhammed makes you a bad person
  do you ever get tired of lying to hide your incest shame i would
how did 4chan become full of moralfags  oh yeah nel
  steriotypes that are created naturally by regular interactions    those are pretty bullshit too look at japanese american in the year leading to and during ww2
    nizari ismailis dont believe in imitating the life of muhmmad they believe his life was only fit for the 7th century sunnis believe in imitating his life today
  this entire thread turned from incest to islam so quickly
  that makes no sense a massive amount of those states on that chart are not arab at all with high birth defect rates you know birth defects happen fora lot of reasons
  its so sad i came to this thread expecting to wank to epic tales of siblings secretly fucking in the face of the law star crossed lovers living together against the odds  instead i got mudslimes sleep wid dey cousin  i dont fucking care what a few desert dwelling sandniggers are doing quite frankly their cousins are a big step up from goats   fuck it im going to 
  nizari ismailis are pretty irrelevant
  what do you mean were still discussing incest and who does it the most and yes fucking your cuz is incest
  i fucked my sister im anglican
  fucking your cuz is incest  only to ameritards lol  
  story
    abrahams son isaac married rebekah his first cousin once removed the granddaughter of his fathers brother nahor and niece milcah24 isaac and rebekahs firstborn son esau married his cousin mahalah daughter of his fathers brother ishmael25 while their second son jacob married his cousins leah and rachel daughters of his mothers brother laban26 marriage of cousins was not forbidden in biblical law  in one of the tales of a wife confused for a sister abraham admitted that his wife sarah is also his halfsister on his fathers side    cains wife was his sister     
  thats the most desperate no u in this whole thread    incest /ˈjnsɛst/ is human sexual activity between family members or close relatives this typically includes sexual activity between people in consanguinity blood relations and sometimes those related by affinity marriage or stepfamily adoption clan or lineage
  madly masturbate may
  from which unholy asshole were you shat out of to be this deranged
  my sister is very beautiful and as tall as me i know the risks are high but if we practice eugenic abortion we could breed supermen
  no its because your little seething retarded antiwhite faggot who has a neurotic stupidity because you hate being routinely the truth about yourself and your race case in point why would you mention fundamentalist mormons when what they do is not even inbreeding but extreme polygamy    bet you made this post too   dumb    if you were gonna argue against it you should have argued how first cousin marriage is hardly that bad or that the effects of inbreeding are overblown because you can easily give birth to a healthy child even if you fuck your sister of course even with this point you would still lose because the problem with the middle east is that they have been engaging in cousin marriage for generations and the deleterious effects of recessive genes just keep accumulating

  hey guys wouldnt sex with your sister be salacious and tabo  fucking mudslimes heres some statistics from a particularly bad goy woop woop  yeah no
  mudslime subhuman doesnt like science  gets upset when medical science shows theyre all inbred subs  argued for days that this couldnt possibly be true despite freakish rates of asymmetrical craniofacial features drooping facial angles and horrible birth defects among islamic and jewish semites  yeah its /pol/ that ruined the thread could have talked about egyptians and greek incest and how they didnt or did destroy their elite castes but subs have to get upset about medical science because uglines hates its own reflection especially when others point it out
  have you ever been to slc on a sunday
  im not a mudslime my man im just a white guy who loves his sister
  but does she love you
  he only needs to seize the initiative
  muslim fingers typed this post
i know theres lot of christian denominations which claims to embrace the original christian traditions most of them being crazy protestant splinter groups but which one comes closer to rejecting the pauline version of christianity and is follows original petrine teachings
orthodoxy
 original petrine teachings  how do you know what is genuine original and not altered later on to fit some agenda
  if it wasnt for paul you would have to get circumcised to be considered a christian nowadays
  so nothing would change for our american friends
  rejecting the pauline version of christianity and is follows original petrine teachings
  ebionism
  well theres one christianity which was founded by peter viz the roman catholic church
  preferring some latecomer to the bandwagon over the apostle on which jesus built his church
probably german baptist dunkards    the brethren state that they have no creed but the new testament if a single part of the new testament is most pointed to as a guide for members lives it is the sermon on the mount   
  rundown of the grey wolves
  turkish ultra nationalist sunni islamist panturkic fascist terrorist group the worst combination of turkish nationalism and islamism they support chechen sunnis against russia in the chechen wars uyghur sunni turkic separatists and syrian sunni rebels against assad they hate nonmuslims and christians they hate armenians they call christians gavur they killed a russian pilot in syria in 2015 and committed terrorist attacks and bombings they were part of natos anticommunist operation gladio and murdered leftist kurdish and alevi intellectuals shooting them and burning them alive in the cold war their leader alparslan türkeş was an ugly freak he was friends with the uyghur sunni islamist separatist isa yusuf alptekin azerbaijani president abulfaz elchibey and the separatist chechen president dzhokhar dudayev
  literally the turkish alt right
  turkish alt right  what a stupid simplification
  yes an armed and violent turkish alt right with state and mafia connections
    why would muslim extremists want to kill a christian leader
how many posts can we go with zero mention of dönmeh
  undermine your support in the west to flex on catholics not even orthodox   its not such an obvious motive
  t grey wolf  please dont kill me ive so much to live for
  shoot first  ask questions later
theres only one god and his name is kara boğa    pope was lying god is not the god of jesus god is kara boğa pbuh himself
  murdered leftist kurdish and alevi intellectuals    nothing value lost nerde kürt varsa anasını sikim
  either they were working for the communists or it was a vatican inside job
did someoke say döner
  theyre major islamist they even went to azerbaijan to fight armenia in the 90s and chechenya to fight russia basically pan islamist who dont like christians much
  the grey wolves were raising money in public in istanbul mosques to sent to chechen fighters in the 1990s and the turkish government was supporting it kind of like in pakistan today where taliban supporters raise money for the taliban outside of mosques right under the nose of pakistan police and soldiers who know exactly what they are doing and approve of it
  no much much more extreme than the alt right
  no not panislam grey wolves are not islamists its all about promoting turkic nationalism i am not saying they are not muslims or dont love islam but they policies are based on empowering ancient turkic societies    and they had nothing to do with the attack on the pope some of the hardliners of the hardliners within the group blur the line between islamism and turkic nationalism but this is not a mainstream view in the group
  grey wolves view christians as gavur kuffar and support nonturkic sunni muslims like chechens and syrian sunni rebels they believe in turkishislam synthesis turk basically equals muslim in their eyes albanians bosnians and other muslims in turkey are viewed as turks
  im gonna be honest i was kinda hoping it was literally going to be a pack of wolves or that you misspoke and meant space wolves
  you cant just dismiss those groups like they have no turkic roots chenchens have turkic but not anatolian ancestry and the largest rebel groups supported in syria are syrian turkmen or at least led by them islam is a big part of all this since its such a unifying force but turkic history is what the wolves have always fought for    just look at how they are ramping up support for the uygher cause in china
  and there are buddhist turkic peoples like tuvans and yugurs and shamanist turkic people like yakut do you see grey wolves giving a shit about people they consider kuffar or christian turkic people like chuvash and gagauz chechens dont have turkic ancestry go try to tell them that to their face lol uyghurs are sunni turkic people and went on jihad in syria against assad alawites and christians
  assads defense minister was hasan turkmani and there are many syrians of turkmen sunni descent who support the syrian government grey wolves side with the islamist sunni turkmens because of their ideology
  chenchens have turkic but not anatolian ancestry    nope their language is entirely unrelated and they are genetically rather isolated
  followers of some dumb leftypol podcast of smug new york jews cum town or some shit
    ok they are oghuz turks then still have a deep relationship with the ottomans       yeaaaah and assad had to blow him up since he was planning a coup nice
  hasan turkmani was blown up by the fsa
  who are oghuz turks chechens are not turks at all uyghurs are not oghuz they speak the karluk branch of turkic and do not descent from oghuz tribes in fact china has oghuz turks called salars they are sunni muslims and they dont have any separatist movement unlike uyghurs and are not fighting against china they moved into china 600 years ago
  more like the turkish national socialist workers party
    orthodox    literally who taking out the pope puts you on the map as a serious threat
  it would also piss off over a billion catholics and make them hate turks
  mohammedans hate the vicar of christ  what a shock
  didnt the turks boast before the battle of lepanto that they would turn st peters basilica int he vatican rome into a mosque or stable
  the hatred of the turk for the successors of saint peter

  because pope john paul ii had no credentials as a catholic poland was behind a soviet bloc that forbade religion the catholic church is not even italian but adopted italy as its home due to shipping tolls and piracy between eastwest so everyone at extreme ports was highly worried turkeylevanttunismoroccospain italy is the only block germanics have towards international mediterranean plus the old germans and its slavs began liquidating the catholic church for art they realized they could rob and sell art and move timeless pieces which is great way to raise money basically i know an art piece could sell for 25m i could raise 25m in pool and still have the art however it must be prove stolen for it to work artistic pieces tend to evaluate with more crime around it this creates a crime insurance pool peoples money all tied to it lets say you hang the stolen art in your wall you have cleaning ladies worker etc coming in you can technically have them killed its a liquidation voucher if they report the art stolen you could lose all your money and their money so you have to kill people many pools are big with 25k here and there deaths with no claim nobody does anything supposedly it started as a gimmick in russia amongst white nationalist tsarists russian eggs
  thats how they wiped out entire regions georgians armenians cossacks etc all invested in eggs so one gets the other to turn on the others with a false promise until the egg is kept by one
  he protected pedophiles from being judged
  or accuses the other of stealing when going through foreign banktruptcy so instead you murder all of them instead of joining their pool when they get out the pool because too much deaths they are supposed to say they were beat up in a pool so they hate so and so they never stop and keep going back for more agony its the expansionist movement
  pedophile shouldnt exist the word because it can easily connotate peddler smuggler things usually given more time for opens up vectors for statuatory rapists to get convicted for peddling or drug smuggling ultimately given more time
  john paul the second sponsored white supremacy beatified the church clergy that couldnt be priests or were priests and failed their vows priests know why they do things so people dont tend to complain most priests that failed their vows were because they carried on sentimental love for the women followers giving them children ultimately their crimes cant be considered aggressive for the most part sprang life a friend a teacher etc
  tabanlı ve kırmızıhaplı
  so when they say they got beat up in a pool and broke their chin basically its saying they were caught in their expansionist racket so qui ja da so theyre here because they committed a crime and had to run away in order to stay safe usually they are not americans but russian familiar with latin orthodoxy meaning he already admitted his sin and that hes not a native despite them playing nativity
  what is sad here is how they only beatified clergy that broke their vows meanwhile the good ones are considered criminals and the occasional war criminal
  funny fact this is why many americans claim irish heritage because ireland was invaded by russian militants being irish means waving a white flag to russians
  russia supports christian uprisings in the ottoman empire for centuries  turkey supports muslim uprising in russia in return    its just bants bro
  and russia invaded chechen lands
  russian empire would not exist if the turkic sunnis of the crimean  qazan astrakhan khanate and nogai horde did not raid the grand duchy of moscow every year
  and the ottoman empire wouldnt exist if the romans/mongols didnt invade the middle east
  ottomans and their vassals invaded russia first
  hiv epidemic outbreaks in africa  papaj tells niggers to not use condoms  niggers listen to him  millions of niggers die from unprotected sex  based
  grey wolves  left wing  fuck no
  i dont know about the steppenigs but didnt russia attack the ottomans first by joining the holy league in the great turkish war
  ottoman vassal crimean khanate attacked moscow first and burned it ottomans attempted to dig a canal between the volga and don rivers with an army
  todor zhivkov expelled 400000 turks so they tried to frame bulgaria
  todor zhivkov expelled 400000 turks  based
  except theyre actually relevant and have major connections more like turkish nazis combined with modern terrorist doctrine
  kebab
  i prefer adana kebab
i wonder why
  more like turkish sa by the looks of it the alt right is a loose term for a range of often mutually conflicting antileftist sentiments that have for the most part already diffused and run out of steam those guys have some actual physical presence at least
  i̇skender kebap is superior
  probably were hungry thats the reason wolves usually attack humans
  shish kebab is the best
lets say 100 years ago for example  and im saying in general they always make themselves look ridiculous nowadays
  we just didnt take pictures of them winston churchill and stalin for example were straight up drunk all the time
  they didnt have 24 hour news channels internet and smartphones back in the old days
  sayes court was an elizabethan mansion which stood at the eastern end of what is now sayes court park it has historic and attractive gardens    the evelyn family were lords of the manor for many generations and its most famous member john evelyn the diarist lived there from 1652 to 1694    it was john evelyns house when opened to peter the great tsar of russia in 1698 on his tour of western europe he stayed here while studying shipbuilding at the royal dockyard    the house sayes court suited peter well because it removed him from crowded london large and beautifully furnished it was close to the dockyards where peter could easily visit ships being built he was especially keen to study the drawing of ship plans    during their stay they caused a great deal of damage and evelyn was extremely unhappy his estate steward reported that peters party which was full of right nasty people had wrecked the house and garden carpets were left filthy with grease and ink and many paintings looked as if they had been used for shooting targets locks and windows were broken and every one of the fifty chairs in the house had vanished probably burned on fires    a very keen gardener evelyn was appalled by damage to his prized holly hedges lovingly cared for over a 20year period apparently peter and his friends had played a riotous game which involved pushing each other through the hedges in wheelbarrows the kings surveyor sir christopher wren was ordered to report on the damage and recommended that evelyn be paid 350 in compensation a huge sum in the 17th century    now all that remains is a rather run down park but the layouts of fine gardens can still be seen

  why was stalin in rabbit costume
that time jefferson davis threw his pocket change at a rioting mob to make them go away

stalin drops the sword
this guy was the original meme president before trump    literally no idea what hes doing  stumbles into some pretty impressive victories  literally everyone around him constantly scrambling to cover up his actions and protect him from himself  queen victoria literally inviting him to come to london just so he doesnt go to crimea and embarrass himself and lose the war  fucking everything that moves  smoked like 3 packs of a cigs a day    what a lad
  kek at macron standing there like an autist while the cool kids socialize
  why did stately fashion become so bland all everyone ever wears now is boring tailored suits and maybe the occasional cultural dress for to make themselves look more human to their constituents gone are the days of elaborate robes military jackets medals beards fancy hats swords religious paraphernalia crowns and so on that could immediately distinguish one country from another i miss it
  because heads of state are now citizens and not monarchs or lifelong dictators it wouldnt be suitable to dress a fellow citizen in kingly regalia
  heads of state nowadays tend to reflect the urban elite of their countries because of international economic and diplomatic institutions pulling the economies of these countries closer together the culture of its urban elite and middle class also becomes more close to each other than ever before the average citizen of a major city like london new york shanghai or buenos aires will tend to have more cultural similarities to each other than those living just outside in the countryside for some cases this separation between converging urban cultures and the remaining rural peoples will only continue in the coming century

what is the greatest art movement of all time and why is it rococo
how come vikings never landed in ss africa  they had the technology to reach the americas    what if they landed in ssa africa
  but they did
  vandals / vikings youre off by 400 years
  bump
  id say its conceivable that they did though since they were recorded to be raiding seville for example in 800s by the iberian arabs
  they raided sicily so its almost guaranteed they raided north africa
      vikings raided north africa in nekor morocco but the op is asking about sub saharan africa    
  is that in subsaharan africa
  is that what i said
  too fucking warm they were afraid theyd end up in muspelheim
    why would they want to also most of europe is in their way
  i have no idea but i would guess that they couldnt carry enough supplies to get from scandinavian to past the sahara without resupplying in a hostile territory and why would they even bother when they could just raid in the mediterranean
  north america is accessible within the same latitude whereas getting to ssa would require passing the equator which would have been way too fucking hot for them
  in 862 the bjorn ironside and hastein finally reached france again before their adventures in the mediterranean sea they considered france an enemy but now it felt almost like coming home    
why did he do this
  he didnt the nose was taken off with cannon shot by a mamluk ruler in a classic case of iconoclasm he also removed bricks from the pyramids before deciding the whole venture was way too fucking hard

indoeuropean general    this general is pioneered to encourage all the anons interested in ie stuff to limit the ie based discussions pertaining to anthropology history sociology and literature/mythology etc to this general so that other threads dont get clogged up with unrelated and pointless arguments    now i have never made or organized a general before so if this one takes off then can someone please organize the next one to set a good standard for /ieg/    one last thing try to keep things as distanced from modern politics as much as possible would be a shame if the general gets nuked because of it
  stop larping as my ancestors op
  not larping as anyone just trying to see if a topic like this can be organized and contained
  perkunas thor  reeeeeeeeeeeee teuton get out
  are iranians indo european
  yrah i k ow it was a joke this general will fail ie just as too much baggage associated with it every thread will devolve into haplogroup autism
  no the ie were a different ethnic group
  anyone who has a noticeable yamna admixture and speaks an indoeuropean language is an indoeuropean      conversely having so many topics associated with the concept of indoeuropeans can keep the general alive because there are so many things to discuss though this is kind of a hit or miss thing with really little to no inbetweens
steppes nigger thread hahaha
  how and when were indo europeans formed
  the sky father
  eastern european hunter gatherers rape calcholitic hunter gatherer womans around 8000 years ago to expand all around the world after taming the horse
  thanks who are the ones closest genetically to them and all this groups
  they killed spains male population and replaced them
  to ehg latvians  to chg georgians  to the mix of those two finns and mordovians
  ehg were ugly hapa thou
  interestingly finns are probably the closest to the ancient yamna populations in spite of not being indoeuropean since they have the most yamna admixture out of any known contemporary population group in terms of population rankings with regards to the yamna admixture it goes like this  scandinavians and baltics finns included  eastern euros  certain central asian ethnicities like yaghnobis and certain south asian ethnicities like nuristanis and kalash  western europeans  afghans  iranians pakistanis north indians and southern euros  south indians indians
   south indians indians  south indians specifically referring to indoaryans of south india      this works as well
  nope they only had 5 north east asian admixture in k7
this is not a good idea archeogenetics general would be better there are already many mistakes in this thread as most people on /his/ know nothing about the indoeuropeans
  are there any stories or accounts of this invasion
the womens movements perception of the single grave culture was that they were some cruel invaders that suppressed the peacefull matriarchal original culture  drawing by claus deluran in danmarkshistorie for folket 2 del the text goes ha it was just what you needed weekling and the women replies does this means that you are not doing the dishes today    johannes v jensen picked up the ball and described how the cold and fierce patriarchal indoeuropeans arrived in denmark from the south and destroyed the original danish stone age farmers natural and harmonious matriarchal community her vision was extensively used by the 70s womens movement
  no just genetics
  no 2500 bce no one in europe knew writing
  indoeuropeans saved everyone from being ruled by cancerous matriachies where they sacrificed a man every year and ripped the poor guy to shreds  unironically heroes
  this
  no you understanding is idiotic and simplistic you know that two of these ehg carry caucasian ydna j1 like chg
  late neolithic farmers were violent there are mass graves from that time period in austria and germany
  is not when yamnya was formed all the halogroup belong to r1 that was pased from ehg like ehg received from ane even if some solitary sample had those
  yamna probably got their r1b from whg not from ane which seems to brought haplogroup q steppe maykop and lola had much more ane ancestry than indoeuropeans
  we uraloeuropeans the true pure europeans alongside the basques were your prometheus  we gave you (((indos))) the fire and the wheel we taught you how to bathe and build culture
  the uralics did then you indos came and ruined everything
  im sure farmers werent uralic
  absolutely false and everyone in the scientific comunity know r1 originated from ane and spread to ehg next
all fucking steppeniggers must fucking hang
  the oldest r1b was found in a pure whg villabruna and there is only one ehg with r1b one with r1a and two with j1
  indo lies
  whg and yamnya  aryan  can be considered native european the rest is anatolian blood foreign to europe
  theres violent and then theres violent    the last chalcolithic settlement at tell yunatsite was destroyed by a brutal attack the people who were inside mainly children elderly men and women were killed skeletons with traces of a violent death were found among the debris of the burnt dwellings6  the number of abandoned sites and the rapid termination of many longstanding traditions in crafts domestic rituals decorative customs body ornaments housing styles living arrangements and economy suggest not a gradual evolution but an abrupt and probably violent end at hotnitsa on the danube in northcentral bulgaria the burned houses of the final eneolithic occupation contained human skeletons interpreted as massacred inhabitants the final eneolithic destruction level at yunatsite on the balkan upland plain contained fortysix human skeletons it looks like the tell towns of old europe fell to warfare and somehow immigrants from the steppes were involved
  the more farmer blood the worse work a country  its incredible how poisonous the sandnigger admixture is
  yeah id much rather live in russia or ukraine than in france or germany
  indeed steppe moldova and ukraine work amazing well
  whg and ane are genetic brothers   whg native to europe and  ane  proto qryans native to russia both are closely related
  whg are more closely related to middle easterners than to ma1
    slavs has a lot of chg ancestry if you compare non slav european the more whg aryan admixture you have the better works a country
  that one male might be a one off outlier especially considering that r1b is seen to fit a westward migrating pattern overall it is thought to have originated in west asia it is certainly not a characteristic ydna haplogroup of the whg populations
  false
  its funny how useless they were in britain and scandinavia after the climate cooled and they had to get a real job lazy ayrab genes require them to lay in the sun all day doing nothing
  would you rather live in the baltic states or in western europe oh wait thousands of immigrants have already answered that for you
lets not  the faggot does it anyways  i warned you about the general bro
  lithuania also you know that western europe is mostly lbk like
  r1b was common among iron gates hg before the appearance of farmers
  were they got like a thousand or more years of shitskin rape
  
  no whg and ane are literally genetic brothers specially after afontova gora dismish her australoid admixture
could have had an interesting discussion about the culture language and mythology of indoeuropeans and how they evolved  instead we get another fucking haplogroup thread
  they can be traced back to lake baikal remains of r and r1a found there with like 20000 bc date but they take the name ies when they reach eastern europe to be more specific the are right above and in the midle of the black sea and the caspian sea most notorious ie civilization or at least the most famous one are the yamnayans
  your own pca shows that loschbur is closer to farmers than to ma1 or even afontova gora
  since they have the most yamna admixture out of any known contemporary population group  dont quote me on this but to my understanding yamnaya were red heads and ive seen that map of yamnaya ancestry and it doesnt fully click on me it seems wrong to me are there many red heads in finland
  r1a isnt from 20000 yeras ago ane with r is irrelevant because its a very old population it definitely did not speak an indoeuropean language
  early farmer were already a mixture of whg anatolian farmer
  yamnaya were dark haired
  neither are there in the baltics your point
  r1b is from siberia not west asia its found in both iron gates hgs and the botai from kazakstan but not from ancient west asian sites the botai r1b was almost completely ag3 derived with no west asian admixture
  explain udmurts with high  of yamnaya ancestry and red hair
  more probably they did looking how even in america were able to mantain their culture after mixing with paleoasians
  according to who the yamna were redheads
  they had very little whg they were mostly anatolian who had almost 50 of their ancestry similar to whg because those were sister populations but anatolia received additional basal admixture
  ganetic drift udmurts arent yamnaya and never were
  to me  they were r1b and r1b has a lot of probability to be linked to red hair except for the fact that basques have it and are the ones with the most r1b but pretty much no red head i might be mistaken but i feel like they were red heads since they were r1b
  grong
  and the money shot
  early farmer were autosomally in a middle ground from whg and middle easteners
  wrong there are multiple different red hair variants and they dont correlate with r1b at all its just a reductionist dream for people who want to imagine history as a struggle between different breeds of beings like in fantasy novels
  except ane entered the middle east and we have very few samples from preneolithic middle east from anatolia we have one
  except udmurts arent r1b 87 of udmurts carry hapligroup n
  yes udmurts are the ones with highest yamnya admixture only finns in central finland has the same amount
just to make something clear the yamna people were swarthier and taller than the native europeans
  by way of mixing with basal to create basal but thats at least 12000 years ago way too early for the subclades of r1b around youre just going to have to accept that r1b is a steppe haplogroup not west asian
  they sure shifted a lot from anatolia neolithic
  to create chg
  hungarians are more yamnaya than the english and ukrainians    lmao
  central finland  based teuvo aryan god
  villabruna whg and iron gates hg are shifted south compared to earlier european hg they also had some dzudzuana same with ehg
  why do you want to distance yourself so much from the middle east even to embrace ancestral north eurasian that were living in siberia
its because people like simplistic and grand stories and arent interested in facts
  and they dont correlate with r1b at all  udmurtsr1b since they are yamnayans  irish r1b hard core  and we lack more data in this department not so many pure breed red heads around    they arent chinks or mongols they are aryans of the variant red head r1b yamnaya
  every fucking thread  fuck of literal nigger
  holy shit dude post or elaborate a better version of that chart with more resolution and proper readings
  are you literally brain dead udmurts arent r1b they are uralics dominated by haplogroup n why are you ignoring facts
  claims to be impartial and objective but vehemently hates europeans
  yeah hes wrong but they live right next to bashkirs who are 50 r1b i wonder if turkic admixture decreased the red hair frequency there
  the yamnaya arent aryan
  more steppe than sintashta though
    because you have tained with your inferior blood the purity of europe you were lucky to be in the perfect place to depevelop agriculture and spawn your shitty genes all over our continent   die already subhuman
  are you sardinian
  doesnt that make you a selfhater given that youre an argentinian medoid
  im not
  judging by his post hes against sardinians
  hes some kind of southern european who hates himself
  udmurts and irish have different red hair variant not at all related see 
  how do you know its different
  because they are different variants hellooo
  how do you know this though
  did you not look at this image     udmurts have r160w while the irish have r151c theyre two different variants
  indogermanics were nordic )))  /thread
  and how do you know udmurts have r160w  r151c seems to be from the steppe as well and correlates with steppe admixture outside british isles
  because thats the one thats most prevalent in russia r151c is correlated with celtic admixture thats why norwegians have it but not so much the swedish
  i knew it you were bullshitting its a well known fact slavs dont have red hair in the first place nor do they have some special genetic relation to udmurts so it doesnt matter whats common in slavs from russia  r151c seems like a steppe gene which was selected for in brits for whatever reason
  im polish
  steppe people had predominantly dark hair and brown eyes  red and blonde hair survived from earlier populations and got reselected to the modern frequencies after the ie age
  so obviously the red heads in that map are udmurts then if slavs dont have red hair
  nonsense spaniards dont have these red hair variants and they are more neolithic
  doesnt really work like that since udmurts are 05 of the russian population
  finns arent closest to yamna stop posting this nonsense
  he is right though steppe people were somewhat lighter than olive in skin tone and predominantly had dark hair mostly black hair and dark eyes they got the lighter pigmentations after mixing with funnelbeakers
  youre not
  you lack the iq to comprehend recessive genes funnelbeakers werent anything special either
  funnelbeakers are the reason germanics tan orange/have dirty skin
  closeness / having the largest admixture the kalasha and yaghnobi people for example are over 50 yamna but they arent very close to yamna populations since the other 50 of their ancestry is chg mostly from bmac and the chg people are very distant to the ehg component in yamna hence the pcas can be slightly misleading at times
  finns have hapa gene which neither yamna nor cwc had in their system
  steppe people were swarthy almost every yamnaya was brown haired and eyed  neolithic farmers arent a single ethnic group and consist of many different cultures that ranged from swarthy to blonde and blue eyed
  do you have any proof that yamna people had recessive blond genes because based on the evidence i see the genetic tests indicate that they mainly had genes for black hair and eyes perhaps you have an iq of over 4000 and are able to comprehend infinitely many parallel universe versions of yamna people each with slightly different physical characteristics but the ones from the past of our universe were certainly dark haired and dark eyed while the natives in europe showed genes for lighter pigmentation
  yamna dont represent people that killed/raped funnelbeakers
  you have no idea what you are talking about  it is not about recessive genes it matters if they are there in the first place and this is not the case for yamnayans  yamnaya  swarthy
  kalash have fairly low steppe actually  yaghnobis and other pamiris have in total amount the highest steppe but they also have ena and iranian farmer which isnt even the same as chg
  yamna were chg  ehg and the ehg were hapas since they came from a mongoloidlike siberian culture if someone doesnt have the ehg input then they arent indoeuropeans simple as
  kitlg was absent in europe before steppe ancestry
  it matters if they are there in the first place  yes exactly they were present in yamna but not neolithic farmers who had black hair
phenotype of all indo european tribes
    yamnaya were 65 ehg 35 chg in average  and ehg only had 5 north east asian admixture you fuckng retard
  no  read any paper on phenotype snps in europe
   lazaridis et al 2016 for example estimated that among northern south asians such as the kalash people and the pashtuns about 3050 of their genetic composition came from early and middle bronze age populations from the pontic steppe ie the yamnaya whereas among natives to southern india 620 of their dna comes from the yamnaya    the note in the yamana culture wikipedia article listed the kalash at an average of 502 yamna they arent pajeets pajeets are 6 to 20 yamna    iranian farmers isnt the same as chg   yes but its pretty darn close the closest major ancestral group that is close to chg populations on pca charts and the modern day people in southcentral asia tend to be 50 or more chg in terms of composition now the kind of chg they had is not the same as the chg the yamna people had the central asian chg comes from a migration 10000 year ago so the yamna chg and the bmac/kalash chg separated mere 10000 years ago
  wrong pic here is chg
  you mean the one about kitlg
  5 ne asian    looool  have i claimed that they are ne asian there are many different kinds of diverse mongoloids the ehg barely have any relatedness to general east asians in the first place they were more like eskimos and native americans     so eskimo like people ehg  caucasians chg  earliest indoeuropeans
  kalash have iranian farmer ancestry which is enriched by ane from central asia   this skews all estimates about their steppe
      for rs1426654 the frequency of the derived allele increases  from very low to fixation within a period of approximately 3000 years  between the mesolithic and bronze age in europe for rs12913832 a  major determinant of blue versus brown eyes in humans our results  indicate the presence of blue eyes already in mesolithic huntergatherers  as previously described33 we find it at intermediate frequency in  bronze age europeans but it is notably absent from the pontic  caspian steppe populations suggesting a high prevalence of brown  eyes in these individuals fig 4
  that ane enrichment was from the descendants of yamna people in this case the andronovo/early indoiranians mixing with the bmac iranian farmers who were close to the generic chg cluster these are also the primary source of yamna related ancestry among southcentral asians
  yes blue eyes were rare on the steppe it has nothing to do with hair color
  they have nothing to do with skmos nor cluster naer anyone of them and of course will compart some genes with amerindians since they are a mix of 30 ancestral north eurasians and 70 paleoasians   you are mixing everything
  bmac had central asian ane admixture no iranian farmer is generic chg
    another point to note involves their culture and religion which is fairly similar to the old vedic religion there are some changes due to being isolated for long of course but that still doesnt change the fact that these people have a large legitimate andronovo based ancestry which itself is derived from the yamna people
  the closest living people to eastern hunter gatheres are latvians and then the rest of european people
  the same goes for hair color yamnayans had brown hair and brown eyes  the phenotypes are a product of population movements and selection in the case of hair and eye color mainly selection and not immigration of some steppe people whose genetic impact would anyways not be enough to transform europeans into what we look right now even if they were 100 blonde  blonde hair  selection  steppe hapolgroups  population movement
  why do you change the subject indo europeans had no naganasan this means finns arent ie and cant be close to ie easy
  no iranian farmer is generic chg    then how come they cluster so close to the chg populations then look at how close iran chalcolithic and neolithic populations are to the chg ones
  alright then who do you think is among the modern populations the closest candidate to the late neolithic indoeuropeans of the steppe lithuanians latvians
what of the mystery of the gingers     if they were shg then how come their highest concentration is the udnurts i really cant wrap my head around this puzzle
  latvians literally the whitest people as well
  genetic bottle necks and selection
  iranoid shitposter from /pol/ spotted
  btw how much preie european admixture like shg  enf do latvians have
  funnelbeakers had black hair some blue eyes from whg kitlg comes from the steppe
  about 50 latvians have the highest whg to enf ratio in europe 20 whg to 30 enf
  they didnt originally have whg or enf either so what genome wide finns are still among the most yamna rich modern populations you cant change that fact no matter what
  based
  no until ie was formed these genes got significantly reduced in the steppes
  not iranoid btw  and i do not post on /pol/ either     here is what i am saying 10000 year ago the chg population separated and some of them went up to central asia and south central asia to etablish the bmac culture then a different section of the chg population that didnt migrate stayed back and mixed with the ehg to produce early indoeuropeans then these indoeuropeans mixed with other groups to ultimately become the andronovo people who then mixed with the bmac people to result in central asian populations which are high in steppe ancestry and nonsteppe chg ancestry such examples would include kalash people and nuristanis most other populations in the region however hae a lot of native south asian admixture hence they arent that rich in the bmac or steppe based ancestry anymore
  bout tree fiddy     whg and enf were present in yamna not in high concentrations but present nontheless naganasan wasnt finns arent people closest to ie and arent ie get it through your uralic head
  well they seem to have gotten the best of both worlds the lighter pigmentation of shgs/enf mixed populations and the height and build of the yamna people the only thing that remains is the average aggregate academic achievements of their estonian neighbors how long until that happens
  the great majority of individuals fall in a genetic cluster that is similar albeit not identical to the preceding groups in turan in harboring a large proportion of early iranian agriculturalistrelated ancestry  60  in the bmac with smaller components of anatolian agriculturalist  related ancestry   21 and west_siberian_hg  related ancestry 13  suggesting that the main bmac cluster coalesced from preceding preurban populations in turan which in turn likely derived from earlier eastward spreads from iran  some of the yamna in southcentral asia is just an artifact caused by ane
  yamna  corded ware which has nothing to do with yamna mutt since cwc most likely came directly from sredny stog yamna is a trimutt of repin khvalnysk sredny stog and additional churka chg
  interesting well how much genuine yamna admixture do you think they have then
  but the corded ware individuals werent very tall now were they yamna people seemed to be the tallest ones in eurasia during their existence correct me if i am wrong
  all europeans have nganasan too how did this happen pic related is from the new study on the spread of siberian ancestry
  theyre genes say otherwise the udmurts and the irish have the same genes for red hair  jesus christ dude why would you post without knowing what youre talking about
    whg and enf were not present in yamna before they migrated into europe so they are also foreign components to yamna
  1755/176 same as yamna
  about 1/4 andronovo which would equal 1/6 yamna pamiris have almost triple that
  its me or they have a common look  the nosethe the type of face even the gaze is similar    pic from china
  stfu you mick idiot
  proofs
  mixing with finnic brides
  no they dont post a soure for r151c in udmurts protip you cant
if the upper caste north indians are indoeuropean why do they have a wheatish skin rather than white
  what does nganasan have to do with finnic ancestry theyre unrelated migrations
  ehg itself is whg  ane
  theyre mixed filth
  indoeuropeans were mad for mixing with locals
  so then the pamiris and yaghnobis are the only populations outside of northern europe and northeastern europe to have close to 50 or more yamna admixture right      okay so in that case you are saying that both cwc and yamna came from a common ancestral even older protoindoeuropean population my question to you now is about the identity of this true protoindoeuropean people who were they
  this hasnt been reported anywhere before but it appears that at least one of the latvian middle neolithic mn samples from jones et al 2017 harbors elevated postancient north eurasian ane siberian admixture    if true and it needs to be confirmed with more markers then this individual dated to 6000 cal bp is the oldest european with this type of ancestry sequenced to date consider the following qpadm models based on 22k snps with nganasans as the siberian reference population    my verdict the minor nganasanrelated signal in latvia_mn or at least latvia_mn2 is probably real and the extra nganasanrelated admixture in modernday finns possibly arrived in northeastern europe in several waves from the middle neolithic onwards including with early speakers of uralic languages during the bronze or iron age    
  she is really beautifuli would gladly create more indo mutts with her
  my ancestors 
      upper caste indians dream about being aryans in spite of having less ne euro and caucasian dna than low castes like jaats hence they are larpers
  your uralic head  wow we must be dealing with objectivity here
  tfw no upper caste indoaryan waifu
  disgusting souless eyes clearly not european
  no surprise  ie never gave a fuck about race the indian caste system is only ie in the organisation after their social strata but the caste system itself as a reproductive barrier is west asian and meant to keep the bmac spiritual elite pure
  phenotype of all indo european tribes  r1a  whres r1b though thats incomplete my dude
  wasnt it mainly linguistic but a 19th century german scholar conflated it with racial apartheid
  theres a new paper coming on finland they tested a nm178 finn with no nganasan at around 1000 ad from valkeakoski the sample was closest to narva culture and baltic hgs its looking more and more that the nganasan in finns is from mixing with sami    its not out yet but youll hear about it when it is
  yamna  blond haired  blue eyed    wrong they undoubtedly mostly had black hair and dark eyes their skin tone was also darker than the average modern day europeans but still lighter than olive
  muh ancient red head steppe niggaz
  so your claim is that the bmac admixture strongly correlates with caste rank do you have proof for this
  he looks like a cypriot fella i know
    
  i love clean and pure indian waifus they have that sorcerer look
  aryan is not equal to european retard
  its the truth
  interesting its almost like the yamna men had children with lighter skinned native european women and now the lighter skinned individuals have yamna ydna haplogroups who would have guessed fucking funnelbeaker roasties
  pakis and pajeets arent aryan
  yamnaya skin tone was the whitest of the world at that time and whiter than today italian they have a skin color similar to french
  imo thats exactly how yamnaya looked like just an opinion for now lets wait on some scientists to confirm or deny my theory
  for the last fucking time it was cwc that mixed with funnelbeakers
  holla
  french are swarthy
  davidskybergs delusions will crumble its only a matter of time
  only compared with finns
  what are they then
  and cwc are yamna rapebabies your imaginary preyamna indoeuropeans didnt exist cuz if they existed you would give me the proof that i asked for a while back
    more specifically it was the savoniankarelian specific cts1737
  you are retarded
  dravidian mutts
  tocharians  tarim basin correct
  yes
  thx
  thats south indians and lower castes
  yes but tarim basin mummies probably werent tocharian
  ive heard academics express their neutrality towards this subject they said they were ie classification that i dont recall like tocharians what makes you say they werent tocharians though
  aryan isnt a race
  tocharian was centum but the tarim mummies were related to satem speakers because they were r1a
  implying  you could argue it has at least two sub races but it is clearly a race
  archeological and linguistic evidence for me its more likely that tarim basin mummies are from the andronovo horizon tocharians possibly lived somewhere close but migrated there later i believe that tocharians came from the first yamna migration to the east afanasievo
  r1a red heads  mind blown its usually r1b who are redheads
  probably this
  jesus fucking christ you dumb mick
  its a term that indoiranian speakers called themselves  5 seconds on wikipedia
  we know what relation afanasevo had with the early chink dinasties
  they didnt have red hair variants their hair was just detoriated it was originally brown but eumelanin breaks up easier than pheomelanin so old remains ofter have reddish hair
  this is also true tocharians were probably mixed with andronovo though to this day r1a and r1b is present in tarim basin
  i dont get it yamna were predominantly r1b and they spoke the other ie language centum it is as opposed to yamna something doesnt fit      how could they be related to satem since they sope centum doesnt make any sense
  its a genetic grouping outside of the modern range
  afanasevo is before ies officially invaded europe
  r1b is there from scythian migrations i dont think much of it is actual eba
  its a term a race called themselves  its not a race though  we call ourselves white arent we white isnt white a race
  because they didnt speak tocharian
someone kill this irish nigger already
  its clear that they introduce the horsechariotsmetalurgy from western china instead of the east controlled by native chinese   the start of the chinese civilization is highly indebted to indo europeans without a doubt but we dont know much more
  they didnt have red hair variants  not what wikipedia is telling me though
  imagine having no ancient cultures of your own so you have to steal others
  r1b tocharians  sauce pl0x
  indo iranian is a race  its literally a language family  again 5 seconds on wikipedia
  im not stealing anything only that brought the element that let chinese start their civilization  even the name for wheel horse are identical in pie and ancient sino tibetan
  you gonna have to try harder than that im affraid
  2pac alive in corded wave  remove farmers
  polish butthurt strikes again  its not like their language even has anything to do with baltoslavic of course they had r1b from their yamna ancestors
  no lol skin pigmentation isnt race ancestry and craniofacial features are race
pigmentation and iq discussion should be banned prove me wrong
r1b tocharians  r1b scythians    wtf both of them were predominantly r1a who is spreading this nonsense
  u mad cuz we wuz pharoahs scythians udmurts tocharians and many more
  wiki speaks nothing of variants
  scholars point out that even in ancient times the idea of being an aryan was religious cultural and linguistic not racial91011  do you actually think you wuz ancient indians n shiet
  tocharian is centum but everyone around them is indoiranian satem 3000 bc a culture called afanasievo appears in the altai mountains they are genetically exactly like yamna and they are dominated by r1b   around 2000 bc indoiranian satem andronovo lived in central asia from this period are tarim basin mummies tocharians are attested much later thats why i believe that tocharians are descendants of afanasievo in the tarim basin they would mix with indoiranians who also lived there since andronovo but ultimately it was the tocharian language that became the dominant one
  tarim mumies were almost all r1a scythians were primarily r1a j2 and g2
  weki says they were red heads though    yes and im calling schollars wrong on this one
  afanasievo didnt have chariots
  tarim mummies may have been indoiranians living in tarim theres significant indoiranian influence in tocharian
  tocharian language was satem so they were most likely from afanasevo which was steppe early bronze age a r1b rich population from yamna the tarim mummies were related to andronovo aka steppe early middle bronze age that was r1a rich     all the genotyped scythians from the latest study on them were r1b here are the snp calls for them  scythian scy009 r1b1a1a2  scythian scy193 r1b1a1a2  scythian scy197 r1b1a1a2  scythian scy301 r1b1a1a2  scythian scy304 r1b1a1a2  scythian scy305 r1b1a1a2    
  im sure you are highly qualified and i apologise for doubting you professor
  centum not satem sorry
  im speaking of the indo europea horizon founded by them and the rest of indo european tribes that would ocupy that position afterward
  who do you consider the best r1a or r1b aryan tribes
  not a nord    distinct but too stupid to notice like most people in this thread    yeah sort of      no living european ethnic groups are indoeuropean or pie     thats called convergent evolution and gene flow my low iq friend
  tocharian was centum r1b centum r1a satem centumdescendants of yamna satemdescendants of cwc this is obviously a very simple model but it kinda works for pretty much every ie population
  what a small sample size for the scythians how about something more reliable    ancient ydna data was finally provided by keyser et al in 2009 they studied the haplotypes and haplogroups of 26 ancient human specimens from the krasnoyarsk area in siberia dated from between the middle of the 2nd millennium bc and the 4th century ad scythian and sarmatian timeframe nearly all subjects belonged to haplogroup rm17 the authors suggest that their data shows that between the bronze and the iron ages the constellation of populations known variously as scythians andronovians etc were blue or green eyed fairskinned and lighthaired people who might have played a role in the early development of the tarim basin civilisation moreover this study found that they were genetically more closely related to modern populations in eastern europe than those of central and southern asia the ubiquity and dominance of the r1a ydna lineage contrasted markedly with the diversity seen in the mtdna profiles from the scythian wikipedia page    oh and some more recently new adna tests were made on various ancient samples across eurasia among them two from scythian burials this time the modern techniques of snps in comparison to strs in earlier tests were used the iron age scythian samples from the volga region and the european steppes appear closely related to neither eastern europeans nor south and central asians based on the results both samples appear to be a link between the iranic speaking people of southcentral asia and both the people of the northern regions of west asia and of eastern europeans this fits with their geographic origin    mostly had ydna haplogroup r1a  had a diversity of mtdna haplogroups    confirmed to be ar1an steppe chads fucking everyones woman left and right
  north euros have 50 aryan admixture and finns 67 so genetically we are very close
  tbh im all for yamna being their ancestors but they dont speak the same language something is twisted here
  these tribes werent exactly friends the chinese got chariots from people who invented chariots  andronovo but it probably happened by proxy not directly
  what do you mean they dont speak the same language
  that paper is about older groups like andronovo scythians were iron age
  does mexicans larp as spaniard
  forget it we are the 56 faec of aryan genetics
  well pajeet brahmins are 44 similar to yamna people and pajeet jews gujaratis are up to 46 yamna people idk who to trust anymore i think that yamna people and hence pajeets by extension suck
  stop larping as european
  they dont
  the r1a rich popilation in the area used to be designated as scythian but they were actually sarmatian scythians descended from steppe eba groups rich in r1b while sarmatians were r1a rich
  which makes it even worse since r1bois failed to leave an impression while r1adonis ended up leaving their marks like stallions
i dont get this muh aryunz sheeit  hg and farmers were great peoples too
  i am german and therefore a 56 aryan faec
  with the diference that whg clust much closer yamnaya that any other proto race like the mix they have in india for example
  im not either so go ahead spout your fetishes i couldnt care less i just corrected you
  caste system in india prior to colonization was all over the place every region had their own caste subcastes and so on sometimes its from class/social role sometimes from kinship/tribalism and sometimes from ethnicity even then there were subclasses and subfamilies like warriors from this clan being higher than warriors from the other clan because they rode horses into battles or something like that and that particular group wasnt even hindu anymore
  they were bad people who didnt want to share their land with indoeuropeans and uralics and got what they deserved
  its probably not that simple the only r1b dominated scythians were the european ones they could be just locals were their graves rich saka eastscythians seem to be mostly r1a
  should have sent their best
  r1b has genghis khan how can r1a even compeat  members of the mongol imperial family designated the golden family are buried in a secret necropolis therefore none of their burial grounds have been found in 2004 we first discovered 5 graves belonging to the golden family in tavan tolgoi eastern mongolia to define the genealogy of the 5 bodies and the kinship among them snp and/or str profiles of mitochondria autosomes and y chromosomes were analyzed four of the 5 bodies were determined to carry the mitochondrial dna haplogroup d4 while the fifth carried haplogroup cz indicating that this individual had no kinship with the others meanwhile ysnp and ystr profiles indicate that the males examined belonged to the r1bm343 haplogroup thus their east asian d4 or cz matrilineal and west eurasian r1bm343 patrilineal origins reveal genealogical admixture between caucasoid and mongoloid ethnic groups despite a mongoloid physical appearance  
  more like 56 farmer face
  i hate to break it for you but  
  r1a has budda
  scythians were primarily r1a  nope they were r1b elites and r1a plebs r1b is quite prevalent on scythian burials
  you want sample size heres a paper with 96 genomes    in the east we find a balanced mixture of mitochondrial lineages found today predominantly in west eurasians including a significant proportion of prehistoric huntergatherer lineages and lineages that are at high frequency in modern central and east asians already in the earliest iron age individuals dating to the ninth to seventh century bce and an even earlier mtdna sample from bronze age mongolia 49 typical west eurasian mtdna lineages are also present in the tarim basin 16 and kazakhstan 8 and were even predominant in the krasnoyarsk area during the 2nd millennium bce 31 this pattern points to an admixture process between west and east eurasian populations that began in earlier periods certainly before the 1 st millennium bce 1350 a finding consistent with a recent study suggesting the carriers of the yamnaya culture are genetically indistinguishable from the afanasievo culture peoples of the altaisayan region    see afanasevo not andronovo all tested afanasevo males were r1b    the scythians of the eastern steppe were seemingly derived from yamnaya and east eurasian ancestors and not from temporally closer sintashta/andronovo populations that carried eef ancestry
  mick
  thats a lot of coming and going thanks for the info my dude i appreciate your knowledge
  i already corrected myself 
  poland has r1a of sarmatian type not r1b
  exactly because they are sarmatian related not scythian related
  no competition r1b are the ogs of the ies
  thats called convergent evolution and gene flow my low iq friend  so u be saying they developped ie traits independently fro ie i call bullshit tbqh
  forgot link     
  this is pretty much impossible we know that genghis family had a lot of children if genghis was r1b then he was completely cucked by someone with c3
  breh ive seen several burials where most of the remains were r1b not to mention the elites were r1b
  centum and satem yamnaya appears to be satem
  is has been texted by chinks thenself and published later on in nature  there is no error about it
  centum
  according to what ive seen you are right two different tribes
  no centum satem is a later developement related r1a rich people like slavs and indoiranians
  im just saying that this grave probably didnt belong to genghis khan
  r1a has the most pressence in india im assuming this is from sakas who were scythians or maybe there was a earlyer or later migration to india i dont know anyways this is confusing with sakas visiting india and not leaving a strong fingerprint as seen here 
  no scythians lacked the eef found in r1a rich steppe populations like andronovo they were from yamna related groups like afanasevo    pic related
  its very likely from aryans scythians/saka probably had both r1a and r1b
  india has r1a from andronovo and sintasha like aryan invasions that brought indoaryan languages there not sakas
  haplogroup r1a is mostly found among upper castes which constitute the minority of indias population middle and lower caste males primarily belong to haplogroup j and haplogroup h respectively
  holy shit i just got so fucking hype sauce on this i always figured that ghengis being redhead was a mith but this this bring a whole another light into it what the fuck bro we wuz khanz bless this general
  is from the royal family itself that was related to genghis khan so there is not doubt that he was r1b too
  cough sauce
  agreed
  y u soooooooooooooooooo mad bro
  based on what
  could be diluted also this is only few samples
  the royal family was around 30 europoid and 70 east asians even if it was r1b is a little misleading to treat him like that
  its found in all kind of castes also r1a is not the only haplogroup found in upper castes
  all 96 were made up of ehg chg and east asian and were afanasevo like not andronovo that had eef
  you have the link in the post
  but it is more common among the upper castes if you look at the frequency distribution then in any given location in india r1a is more frequent in upper castes while h is more frequent among lower castes
  its just their interpretation there is no evidence they were related to genghis khan if genghis was r1b it would mean that he and all his ancestors were cucked by a random mongol who passed his genes to 20 of central asian and mongolian populations oh and he lived during the time of genghis khan also genghis lineage practically died out in mongolia and in any other place where his descendants ruled lets just say that this scenario is extremely unlikely
  its mostly common on indoaryan brahmins but r2 also often appears in higher castes
  m73 is exclusive to turkic people probably not many of them claim descent from genghis though
   only a little group of elite mongols were r1b rich the royao family  the average now in mongolia is around 5 15 depending the region
im working on some oc for the general here gimme ie clothing and jews for muh steppe nigguh
so if you guys liked this general then will you be making a new one once this one get pushed off to page 8 or 9
  except this is not how it works in steppe populations the leaders can have the most women so like i said a random mongol cucked genghis and everyone related to him if this is true because this subclade of c formed around 1000 years ago
  jewels
  100 or 200 member of the royal family cant change a place as populated as china  especulially with the periodical purges and revolutions that change entirely the elite of the country
  you know that genghis was mongolian not chinese right
  is in china were they attaned they godly status and respect to mongols i supose they were like ancient aryans that banded together in mutual company to conquer and loot the rest of thecworld but have strong respect to each others  why rape your fellow mongols when we can rape the world together
im talking about mongolia and central asia not china but c is of course much more common in china than r1b and such a rare subclade wasnt genghis first son not his own maybe these people are related to him
heres my oc
  there are secondary sources or so i believe claiming genghis khan was red head or that he had a red head beard
  thanks brosky
  im liking it im not gonna make the next one it turned out far better than what i expected
what do you guys say about the sakas scythians leaving a r1a fingerprint in india isnt it weird was that another tribe i dont understand this is confusing they should have left r1b fingerprint yet there is a massive r1a fingerprint there maybe were the lower castes of the scythian racemixing idk what do you guys say
oops thread is on autosage someone make a new one already and link it here
  indoiranians were not indoeuropean  kys
  probably from people who spoke a language distantly related to uralic turkic mongolic chukotkokamchatkan and eskimoaleut
  minoans
  (((indos)))  do triple parentheses even mean anything anymore
  what the fuck are you talking about the r1s in america algonquians speak languages completely unrelated to indoeuropean
  these family is irish this picture was taken at an irish redhead festival why do people keep saying theyre udmurts
  uyghur
    your haplogroup determines whether you say k or s  guys youre overthinking this
  (((j2)))
  centumdescendants of yamna satemdescendants of cwc  where can i read more about this hypothesis
  r1b has genghis khan  citation needed
  buddha was a glorious c1b2 australoid
  say what you will about r1a but r1b is in the fucking americas somehow
  i thought slavic was closer to germanic
  freudian slip
  maybe sinotibetan borrowed it from indoeuropean
  daily reminder ie cranial capacity was 1400 while whg cranial capacity was 1600  this is the difference between europeans and negros  whg was literally a super human
  nef had over 50 whg dna in iberia and scandinavia its the flatlands like germany and england where they were 80 basal
  urdmuts dont have red hair in excess though  one can link i1 to blonde hair because some 90 of i1 is blonde  however maybe maybe 10 of r1b is redhaired
  yes they do
  polishturanid larping as nord
  r1b is higher caste and it was punishable by death to mix with them they kept records of the royal tribe and only took in women they never went out and settled outside the tribe  r1a was the underclass warrior caste that went out and could settle

how could the mongol soldiers personally slaughter hundreds of thousands and raze whole cities but the ubermensch grman soldiers couldnt just shoot jews on the spot they had to make a full industrial system to kill the jews to shield their pussy soldiers from the horrors    were mongols the real ubermensch
  german einsatzgruppen shot jews
  the mongols killed people for fun at leisure rates    einsatzgruppen police battalions antipartisan detachments had to kill large groups all day long in non fun ways they often got balts to help them as unskilled low paid labourers    contrast with wehrmacht attitudes to jew hunting where it was leisure and kept you from fighting russians     germans broke while massacring jews in 1941 because   all day every day   work not leisure
  you forget the holocaust was mathematically impossible meaning mongols are so powerful they actually break natural laws in their sheer destruction
  mongols didnt kill for fun they only massacred when the defenders refused to submit to vassalage or surrender they were ordered to massacre defiant cities
  sounds like fun to me mate as opposed to having to get up at dawn minus one to round up and shoot all day
  mongols were ordered to round up specific people in many cities to kill and spare other specific people and not kill them they did not kill for leisure sometimes they spared the civilians and rounded up royals to kill like the jurchen royals in kaifeng in northern china while civilians were allowed to leave sometimes they spared all the doctors  craftsmen and artists which kublai ordered them to across cities in northern china hulagu ordered them to spare christians in baghdad when the city surrendered on good terms without a fight like hangzhou in southern china the mongol troops werent allowed to kill or rape at all
    imagine having to massacre a whole fucking city on a tight as fuck schedule as well since you didnt have years since the whole army was waiting for you to get done killing
  one tiny city
  mongols werent at all extreme in bloodthirstiness they were extreme in scale    massacring the city is great you get to take all the fucking loot you can lay your hands on not to mention rape to your hearts content    now imagine marching besieging it sitting in shit and then not even being allowed inside
  i mean ethnic cleansing isnt that rare the jews themselves cleansed some of their land from arabs myanmar removed the muzzies just now german autism
  normally with ethnic cleansing you want to displace people from land you want to occupy in 1941 the einsatzgruppen had a higher mission of purification and racial punishment its like completitionist pokémon and even more of a grind
  were mongols the real ubermensch  they defeated nazis in ww2
all jews who were shot in ww2 were partisans all jews who died of starvation had typhus and all jews who died of poisoning in the showers was because some jews ate expired mexican food who supplied the byproduct in the congested shower spaces    try and disprove this  protip you literally cant
  the dresden bombing never happened but it should have
    most probably died from disease or starvation than direct murder desu    people forget that the biggest killer in wwii wasnt bombing or the holocaust it was hunger    as for razing cities you need only start a handful of fires and let them burn out of control

  post about jews out of nowhere  its fucking nonsense  gg indeed
why he fite germans  (((
  germans declared war on him because he declared war on ah because they declared war on serbia which was in russian sphere

  sometimes it is the smallest discoveries that have the largest impact when alexandra kleinerman and alhena gadotti found a new fragment of the epic of gilgamesh in 2015 ce it did not seem to be particularly impressive the broken tablet bore just 16 lines of text most of it already known from other manuscripts but working on the fragment andrew george discovered something remarkable the structure of the new tablet did not fit our understanding of the epic to get the fragment to make sense whole episodes had to be moved around yielding an entirely new sequence of events one consequence of this was a new sex scene the epic tells how the wild man enkidu became human by having sex with a woman named shamhat for an entire week making love for six days and seven nights but now it turns out that it took not one but two full weeks of lovemaking to make enkidu truly human
absolute legend
how to be human  the discovery makes enkidu and shamhats sexual marathon all the more impressive two weeks of sex in a row is a daunting if not unappealing prospect but the new tablet is also important for another reason the two versions of the episode are slightly different and since we now know these episodes to be part of the same story the differences become all the more important   he has understood the value of urban life accepting the fact that human society is not all about domination and strength but also about cooperation and skill each human being is part of a larger social fabric where everyone must find their own place  what is interesting about this is that the epic tells that becoming human is a twostep process first one must learn to think like a human being and second one must learn to think like a member of society after the first week of sex enkidu may have acquired human language and a capacity for reflection but he is still stuck in the world of animals he thinks only in terms of challenging rivals and locking horns to become fully human he must learn to see himself not as an individual who has to assert his own strength but as a social being who must participate in the life of the city  even the sumerians saw the danger of the untermenschen/nigger
would this be a source of white/aryan pride
  dont forget he was nordic
oh wow the lost (((globalist tablet))) of gilgamesh
  considering that these are brown peopleno
  we wuz sumerians  they had blue eyes
  whats he doing with that poor lion and dildo
  learning to be be civilized is globalist
  no redditor they didnt look like modern iraqis
  they were literally nordic
      we
are mena better adapted to cities/neolithic than euros
  1 that statue of the guy with lapis lazuli eyes is not proof  2 middle eastern people have blue eyes    brown  olive they were yet another aspect of the master mediterranean civilizationbuilding race
  one must learn to think like a member of society

im talking about the ard suffix in english surnames what are the origins and history of this suffix what is the meaning of it is it english or is is taken from france or the norse
  it isnt a suffix those names have completely unrelated derivations
  are you sure it isnt just extremely uncommon i was wondering since my name also ends in ard
  im pretty sure some surnames with that ending come from french since its a suffix in french  canard  vieillard  maquisard  picard  richard  savoyard  gaillard
  gerrard is a hugeot name lampard is anglosaxon
  lampard is anglosaxon    hmmm    lampard is one of the thousands of new names that the norman conquest of 1066 brought to england   
  ard is an intensive suffix in french it was already utilized in preroman italy france and spain
ard in gaelic means high or tall my surname is a scottish gaelic toponym ending in ard
  and are you tall
could it have a relation to the germanic hard/t ending as in reinhard/t
  i have seen it in lots of place names in scotland ardnarmurchan ardbeg etc but it appears to be a french thing in english surnames i know the name gerrard is a french version of an early germanic name meaning spear hard 
  tall enough to suck your cock

bitter carnival ressentiment and the abject hero or how white people glorify sewer mentality    you people put importance on your lives well my life has never been important to anyone i havent got any guilt about anything bragged the massmurderer charles manson these children that come at you with knives they are your children you taught them i didnt teach them they are running in the streetsand they are coming right at you when a real murderer accuses the society he has brutalized we are shocked but we are thrilled by the same accusations when they are mouthed by a fictional rebel outlaw or monster western society created the abject hero standing at the junction of contestation and conformity the abject hero occupies the logically impossible space created by the intersection of the satanic and the servile white people heroicize the abject hero because he represents a convention that has become a staple of our common mythology as seductive in mass culture as it is in high art moving from an examination of classical latin satire through radically new analyses of diderot dostoevsky and cline and culminating in the courtroom testimony of charles manson bitter carnival offers a revisionist rereading of the entire tradition of the saturnalian dialogue between masters and slaves monarchs and fools philosophers and madmen citizens and malcontents it contests the supposedly regenerative power of the carnivalesque and challenges the pieties of utopian radicalism fashionable in contemporary academic thinking the clarity of its argument and literary style compel us to confront a powerful dilemma that engages some of the most central issues in literary studies ethics cultural history and critical theory today

what if hirohito fought physical fight against roosevelt
  hirohito was an absolute manlet but roosevelt was a cripple so hirohito would probably push roosevelt out of his wheelchair and start kicking him and itd be all over
  a cripple can easily kill a manlet
  how if its a 1 v 1 with no weapons

what if montgomery dueled against rommel on the desert
  my money is on the british bvll  everyone knows that foxes are twinks
  hard to say monty could poke someones eyes out with that nose but rommel has those stylish goggles
this should be a deadliest warrior episode
  monty was autistic and therefore had tard strength so hed win
  eleanor would intervene and sodomize hirohito
  based
  the fight would be decided in one or two blows not because theyre fearsome masters of hand to hand combat but because a single kidney or liver punch would put their middle aged asses in the dirt this is stupid
  if fdr can just get his hands on the jap he beats him to death as a cripple  his arms and shoulders had to do a lot of the overtime work his legs couldnt had to be really powerful
  she was cucked by her own husband and cousin she couldnt do shit
  implying a beta jap could beat a lanklet cripple
  it would be very difficult to find a woman married to a famous man who wasnt cucked at some point most women who get married to wealthy/attractive/famous men just accept that theyre probably going to get cheated on occasionally    of course it is a bit different for women who get married to a man before he becomes rich/famous/etc they have different expectations but eleanor doesnt fall in that category
  holy shit
  im imagining fdr latching onto tiny little hirohito and putting him into an mma hold and its making me lose my shit
  someone shoop hirohito and fdrs faces on the clip at 59 seconds to to 1 minute 9 seconds
      you guys are forgetting hirohito studied in martial arts
  hirohito uses yamato damashii hes basically invincible
why are poles so buttdevastated about russian empire   they werent treated great but they were treated quite okay given the times and situation   irish population halved in uk while polish grew like four times during brutal russian rule
bump
  thats a real low standard youve set doesnt really prove your point and they werent treated well even relative to their area just across the border in austrian poland the poles were being treated much much better
mfw poles didnt even have a state while fucking balts and finns were atleast semiautonomous
  why are poles so buttdevastated about literally anything even remotely related to european history  one can but wonder
  why are ples so buttdevastated  its in their nature
  its like asking why finland wants to be a independent country when russians treated you so well
  truth is that the russian part of poland was worst from this three the prussians cared more about polish people they even let poles teach their language in some schools the austrian part were far more better than both of other ones the polish culture grew in cracow there were fully polish schools polish newspapers poles were treated same as other nations within austrohungary russian part was worst because no one knows what really goes there xdd i also dont like russian par only asutrain part
  the prussians cared more about polish peopl  pure bullshit
  aat least he didnt kill me  you sound like a battered housewife
  heres a quote from a game that perfectly anwsers your question  it is human nature to seek culpability in a time of tragedy it is a sign of strength to cry out against fate rather than to bow ones head and succumb  ie they arent cucks that will thank their oppressors for not killing them outright
  you could make the argument that the areas controlled by germany were much better off and their dislike of russian occupation was fueled by seeing that but that cant be it since theyre equally butthurt about germany
  germany had a state policy to fight against polish culture in germany tho wasnt it bismarck that said that polish culture threatens the german one
  they are retarded cucks that will do the dumbest shit so that their oppressors seriously consider killing them all just to be done with it
  yeah yeah go be assblasted somewhere else
  any good empire would at least attempt such a policy making them into germans would remove the possibility of revolts and create more productive citizens it worked perfectly with groups like the wends bringing prosperity to both sides
  im already in pland
  any good empire would at least attempt such a policy  funny how germany was the only european country that did that show me another country where kidnapping priests on the streets was part of a cultural policy
  funny how germany was the only european country that did that  how do you think any of the other countries became what they are now suppressing the culture of subject peoples in order to better assimilate them into the larger nation was a pretty standard thing until very recently its still common in nonwestern countries like china
  post examples not your opinions kulturkampf was a mandated state policy in 20th cenury europe im sure you can find other such policies in europe as you claimor maybe the best you can find arab or asian dictatorships
  because austria was an ardently catholic empire so the poles chimped out less frequently
russia and poland were rivals for over 2 centuries but when poland declined russia became massively influential in internal polish politics which allowed them to basically partition the country at will not a particularly good way to lose your sovereignty when your own government and elites seem willing to surrender it without a fight the bar confederacy and kosciuszkos rebellion were futile attempts at preventing it but neither were supported by the actual polish state russification efforts by the russians later on only served to spark animosity
  the austrians were also pretty lax with their minorities so poles werent as socially or culturally suppressed as they were in russia or poland
  heres one example  the only language allowed in primary school was french all other languages were forbidden even in the schoolyard and transgressions were severely punished  after 1918 the use of german in alsacelorraine was outlawed  in 1925 anatole de monzie minister of public education stated that for the linguistic unity of france the breton language must disappear  
  thank you for the reading material
  prussians cared  ahahahaha
  its a bit of what  said desu iirc the exact deal was the austrian galicia would be mostly autonomous and run by the poles themselves in exchange for unquestioning loyalty to the empire the deal worked very well for both sides to the point where some middle class urban poles tried to stage a revolt for an independent poland only to have the peasants immediately turn on them and either lynch them or hand them over to the authorities
  show me another country where kidnapping priests on the streets was part of a cultural policy  the british used to hire priest hunters in ireland to kill catholic priests and bishops
  congress poland was the heartland of poland and had once been the heart of the large and powerful commonwealth and to be stripped of their freedoms and democratic traditions and barred from learning their language deeply affected their national psyche especially since theyd been promised autonomy with the creation of congress poland only for it to be stripped once they revolted in the november uprising against the establishment of dictatorial powers of the viceroy and have it replaced with vistula land
  poland was the richest part of the russian empire
  finland was even your map shows that
  prussian germanization  obligatory learning of german in schools  obligatory service in prussian/imperial army  polish teachers and clerks replaced by german ones  removal of catholic priests who failed their kulturexamen  eviction of polish immigrants with austrian or russian passport  removal of polish from schools  physical punishments for speaking it  statesupported purchase of lands from poles by prussian settlement commission  prohibition of building new houses on owned land without goverments approval  gatherings in polish language to be held only in cities with over 60 polish population
  finland was not a part according to posters here but was autonomus
  do you know what autonomy means
  the prussians cared more about polish people  this is your brain on being a retard nobody gives a shit about polacks but i guess they care more in the sense that they actively germanized them and stripped their rights
  yeah youre right im wrong there was a time in 1830s or something like that when due to grain export poland was the richest part of the russian empire not a polack so i dont know how true is this
  yes 18151830 congress poland was the richest part of the russian empire and had the most liberal constitution in europe in theory the map is from 1890 so its a completely different situation due to industrialization and 2 destructive uprisings  inb4 muh polacks chimp out
  based germans do it again hans
  the answer is unironically the tsarist autocracy  after the vienna congress both grand duchy of posen and kingdom of poland were given quite large autonomy within their respective countries congress poland was given a very liberal constitution for that time had its own army semiautonomous government and its ties to russia were due to being a junior partner in a personal union in which the emperor of russia was also a king of poland many poles including the most influential nobles considered it to be a pretty good deal and were willing to stay loyal to the tsar as long as he kept his promises  but the tsars being tsars who hate anything even remotely independent or autonomous consistently disobeyed the constitution broke the agreements of the vienna congress and violated kingdoms laws and autonomy they kept doing it and rising the pressure in poland until poles have finally had it enough and chimped out it didnt end well and also gave nicholas i the pretext to abolish the autonomy and constitution enitrely as he claimed poland is now no longer a part of a personal union but a conquered country poles were now of course pissed even more  posen got kinda hit in a collateral damage as prussians seeing what happened in russia had a convenient excuse abolish local autonomy and fight polish culture after that poles were treated as secondclass citizens which of course sooner or later led to another chimpout  its mostly the case of consistently broken promises and failed hopes spiced up by historical polishrussian and polishprussian rivalry  feels like austrians were the only ones who got their ebin imperialismus right and were willing to respect local rights and treat all subjects equally up until somebody chimped out instead of supressing minorities expecting a chimpout which kinda led to selffulfilling prophecy for those reasons its hard find poles buttdevastated about habsburgs except maybe for the mere fact of partition
when the empire gives larger freedoms to a former province of sweden i kinda understand why theyd be buttblasted about their historical situation
how come christianity is the only serious religion with primary sources
if it was written two centuries later its not a primary source dipshit
  too bad panels 24 is from a collection of fanfiction written by random people
    this
      there is no evidence of it not being the word of those who saw jesus you liars
  wrong gospel of mark the earliest written of the gospels was written around 3035 years after jesus death and would have been heavily circulated in oral tradition prior
according to mary boyce zoroastrians living under christian rule in asia minor were noted to have undergone hardship89 notably during the long conflict between the roman empire and persia christians living in sassanianheld territory were noted to have destroyed many firetemples and zoroastrian places of worship90 christian priests deliberately extinguished the sacred fire of the zoroastrians and characterized adherents as followers of the wicked zardusht zoroaster serving false gods and the natural elements90     
  theres no evidence of the opposite  proving a negative
  a work based off 30 years of oral tradition is a primary source
  be fire worshipper  surprised when youre treated as an uncivilised tard
  the earliest gospel is mark and there isnt a description of the resurrected jesus in that one for the content through 168 it ends with the women being told about jesus returning and them being scared and not telling anyone else about it 16920 is widely considered to have been added later to make the story conform with the explicit resurrection account of the other later writings
  well outside the numerous errors the gospel authors make about daily life in early 1st century judaea making it unlikely they were natives of the region
  the absolute state of christian logic
      see 
  wrong gospel of mark the earliest written of the gospels was written around 3035 years after jesus death  not all of it    the most ancient manuscripts of mark conclude with verse 168 later manuscripts add one or both of the following endings  i love choose your own adventure stories
  why post has absolutely nothing to do with mine in fact mark has the most errors and matthew was probably an attempt to clean up marks gospel
    errors like
    error like  seriously do you not have one one
  well for starters you have the opening quote of isaiah in mark 12 that goes on to quote malachai then theres his geographical ignorance mark 51 has jesus and friends in the land of the gerasenes where jesus plants some bad spirits into a big herd who run down a hill and run into the lake of galilee gerasa is about 30 miles away so those pigs had a long run you also have the statement that jesus went from tyre through sidon to the galilee certainly an odd route since the galilee is southwest of tyre but sidon is north of it    mark 10 has jesus forbidding divorce making an especial point to forbid men from divocring their wives and women from divorcing their husband this is certainly odd because women could not initiate divorce in judea mark 3 has the pharisees getting awfully upset about jesus miraculously healing a sick man on the sabbath a definition of work that only would apply to the sadducees not the pharisees the trial of jesus before ciaphas and the sanhedrin breaks about half a dozen jewish laws concerning it being held at night outside a courtroom on a holiday and misunderstanding what constitutes blasphemy under jewish law    theres probably more but thats just off the top of my head
  cultivate a little patience you jackass some of us dont hover over our keyboards waiting to shitpost on a siamese fecal sculpture forum   
christian or not you gotta admit jesus was a pretty cool guy
  actually he seems a little uptight in the gospels cursing fig trees and flipping out on money lenders
cuz it got wrote down and remembered
  pharisees getting awfully upset about jesus miraculously healing a sick man on the sabbath a definition of work that only would apply to the sadducees not the pharisees  both had the same definition
  the mixing of medicines  obviously then what jesus did was not healing but just some other actuon thus work
    that is incorrect     you will notice that if you scroll through the work none of the 39 categories of work include healing the closest that does is the mixing of medicines something which jesus did not in fact do      contradicted by mark 32 where the pharisees are most explicitly attempting to see if hed heal the man as proof that he works on the sabbath
    zoroastrians also persecuted christians m80  and both behaved in a disgusting manner towards those who accepted the light of mani  bbbut he hurratic hur hur skined mani best day uv my life hur hur

    brainlet here what the fuck does that mean
  wow you really are fucking dumb
  you cant prove anything without assuming something to be true and tying the rest of your argument to that  for some fucking reason this is taken to mean faith in god is necessary for proof to exist when obviously the truth is that there is no such thing as proof
  its a godgodel pun peterson said so himself
  ad ignorantiam fallacy  there isnt any proof that jesus didnt have a micro penis therefore jesus had a micro penis
  no he was fully man as well as fully god
evidence was from 30 years later it isnt good enough    we literally infer the entire dark ages from 500 year old oral stories because nearly nobody wrote during them
you worship the demiurge the mourning of cathars still rings in the backgrounds of your congregations cathars actually possessed some wisdom unlike you retards
  the catholics hated the cathars because they believed man could and should directly communicate with god  it was also because catharism was based on the original church of jesus carried on by mary magdalene jesuss wife
  composed in talmudic israel c190  c230 ce
  what language was it written in
  english
it is the true word of god
  christianity  first texts written 100 years after jesus pbuh died  first complete compilation is 300 years after jesus pbuh died  islam  entire texts are compiled and codified within 20 years after muhammad pbuh died  every subsequent quran has the unaltered original text next to the modern variant
      you are all retards godels proof doesnt say that holy shit at least read the wikipedia page if you are going to post such bullshit
  this guys miracles are better documented than jesus and attested by people who are living right now and were certainly living when the supposed miracles allegedly occurred    why arent you worshiping him
  from a young age he was alleged to have been capable of materialising objects such as food and sweets out of thin air  holy shit this is god
  if your burden of proof is literally just some people said hes god then yes
  you may love baba you may believe he is god and i wouldnt deny itbut never defend babafor if you do you confine him who is boundless and limitless into name and fame never believe that he diedhis body was merely a part of him and not his true self because his true self permeates all creation even the hearts of people who you criticize thinking baba will support you know that for swami all are his beloved and part of him he sees the depth of your inner being and heart and not their physical delusion for this is verily maya lastly if you come here and read this please do get a taste of him from your heart ask yourself without any presumptions for 2 minutes and you will know you may lie that you felt nothing or fake but can you lie to yourselves  and if you still ridicule him well then thats just your fate
  hes been caught cheating while doing his miracles like all that comes from the indian subcontinent hes a scammer
  now this is epic
  hes probably the closest someone has come to proving magic theres no trickery involved he was the real deal
  nno you have a micropenis
  nice fedora who are you to question his powers you are an insignificant ant but do not fear if you accept babas love and way great spiritual fortune will come to you
  theres no proof that they were disciples of jesus
  christians keep saying this but its never made sense at all something cannot be completley two things at once unless there is no difference between those two things unless there is no difference between man and god something cannot be both completley god and completley man
  every time i think ive got my head around the extent of mental self abuse something like this comes along and its all completely incomprehensible again
  nicholas maduro the president of venezuela worships him as god
  widely considered by who
  the difference being the bible was compiled from like 6000 manuscripts pulled from far flung regions all crossed references with each other in what was an early method of error correction in data rather than just a handful of sources
  sources  what do you even mean  theyre writing about witnessed events teachings of jesus pbuh))) just like the quran is difference being is that actual contemporaries compiled the entire works themselves
  thats still not a primary source and the stark brutal nature of mark relative to the other gospels is reflective of the fact that it was written in the dark days imediately after the first jewish roman war
  not him butscholars
  what do you even mean  do you not know what a source is     difference being is that actual contemporaries compiled the entire works themselves  the difficulty is we have less attestation and evidence given the centralization and opaque nature of its compilation we are more certain of what nt writers wrote given that we simply have more extant manuscripts from a precompilation era the church would not have been able to physically destroy all manuscripts from a book or gospel it thought erroneous as they were too widely distributed and it has not hence the existence of gnostic gospels and other things the church considers heresies all it could do was decide whether a gospel was in fact divinely inspired or not while with the quran we have no such thing the saying of mohamed could very easily have been rewritten by a small coterie of followers into the final authoritative quran
  does a book rewritten by people really have any less validity than a book written by people    also there are examples of exactly what you are describing could have happened to the quran actually happening to the bible there are numerous examples of apparent interpolation being credited as canon
  that is apparent interpolation being credited as biblical canon
  you misunderstand we cannot audit the quran like we can the bible since we are given no authorship further the bible has both attested authorship and reason to believe that the writer actually wrote what the church asserts he wrote given the diffusion of early manuscripts beyond their control we do not have this with the quran i do not have much reason to believe mohammad actually said the things it is claimed as i do not even have the name of the witness and if i did given the few and centralized scraps of the quran existent at the time it would have been easy to tamper with them silence dissenting voices and rewrite history during the compilation itself
  reason to believe that the writer actually wrote what the church asserts he wrote  change this to plural case of course   reason to believe that the writers actually wrote what the church asserts they wrote
  a lot of the new testament can be cross referenced with other sources to give credibility not the gospels but acts and corinthians and i think a few others
  you misunderstand  no i understand perfectly what you are saying im merely questioning why the bibles relative fidelity to its original copies makes it any more viable as a theology after all either way we are dealing with texts written by people which make claims we could never possibly verify    and again as examples like the johannine comma show we can see later writers altering the bible and being taken as canon just as you are supposing might have happened to the quran  i do not have much reason to believe mohammad actually said the things it is claimed as i do not even have the name of the witness and if i did given the few and centralized scraps of the quran existent at the time it would have been easy to tamper with them silence dissenting voices and rewrite history during the compilation itself  i could very easily see this happening mostly because it literally did happen with early christianity if this conversation is about the veridity of the bible as opposed to other holy texts i fail to see how this makes the quran any more doubtful than the bible
the quran is literally a primary source straight from the mouth
  so did this guy get btfo      
  straight from the ass  ftfy
  hahahaahahaha      pauline epistles are probably some of the few authoritative ones the rest not so much
  do you not know if the bible gets debunked then the quran would too both islam and christianity had the story of moses in them and turns out the figure has no historical or archaeological basis at all
  not knowing that jesus went back to india  not knowing that resurrect and resuscitate are the same words in the old translation
  the modern bible has been corrupted by human error it is not the complete word of god but it is holy nonetheless  however the apostles pbut have altered christs pbuh original gospel

many other sources we believe almost without question were written hundreds of years after something why is the bible the only one you refuse to consider might be true if not the miracles at least the events as described
  t absolute faggot
  ok brainlet
  a big part of christian practice is pondering mysteries
  im merely questioning why the bibles relative fidelity to its original copies makes it any more viable as a theology    from the fact we have multiple sourced testimonies rather than one from an unnamed source

where does the princess good queen bad meme originate from obviously it shows up in classic fairy tales but why did society feel that way
  meme  see when you take children stories that seriously that youll call this trope a meme in the /his/ sense you must either be an ultra newfag or a braindead retard nobody above 12 actually believes this is a real thing so it isnt eligible to be called a meme in that sense    in any case the trope probably came from angry peasants that saw the qt princesses and the roastie queens and found an easy target to blame for their problems also by writers who sought to dramatize royalty post french revolution you should ask this question on /lit/ actually
  electra complex
    a queen might have real political power a princess generally does not and is therefore innocent like a child

why did it take so long for the world to recognize radiation sickness shouldnt it have been obvious after hiroshima that being anywhere near a radioactive mushroom cloud is a bad idea
  the military wants to see how effective radiation is as a weapon but it needs test subjects
  radiation sickness certainly exists but its also a huge overrated meme in many cases most cancers from radiation are thyroid cancers one of the most easily treatable cancers there are people are scared of it because its invisible associated with government secrecy/experimentation/sinister activities and so in burger ideology is against individual liberty
  also to elaborate on its invisibility people cannot see it and so radiation can seem to come from any direction and given the poor state of science education and misinformation on radiation its akin to dark magic that evaporates you into a skeleton and rots your flesh of course mix in the question of disposability environmentalist hysteria progasoline/oil lobbies and poor government cover ups and you have the antinuclear hysteria there is today
  shit is untreatable and youe skin literally falls off if the dosage is high enough at that point your marrows are all fucked too and you can no longer heal and wounds will start rotting and shit  just a meme  your skin literally blackens and all your chromosomes get deleted what the fuck are you on about this aint some shitty banana radiation mate this is fucking nukes seconds after detonation you can bet the ionizing radiation will knock you out in seconds fucking bozo
    what an absolute moron
  holy shit your dumb fucking hell your so stupid go hug a spent fuel rod lmao see what happens
    ad homs  try having a triple digit iq
  radiation is completely harmless goys
so assuming a nuke went off outside my house and i was sheltered deep underground how long would i be before i could go out and scavenge an not die immediately
    200 years
  lel
they new about the radiation before there ever even started building bombs they had to design them you know   those guys are just test subjects
  what number is the bunker
any american who love his government is a cuck
  think of it in terms of a thin layer of radioactive dust coating everything  it depends on where you live but after the next rain storm most of it will have washed out into ditches and down drains  be careful of anywhere water can pool up and be mindful of how deposits could accumulate
medical aspects of nuclear radiation 1950 armed forces special weapons project atomic bomb effects  
  they already somewhat understood it they just didnt realize that shortterm exposure to even moderate relative to what caused acute poisoning levels would cause problems up till then the only major sources for study were the result of massive doses from lab accidents and longerterm exposure from the japs
  most cancers from radiation are thyroid cancers one of the most easily treatable cancers there are  yeah now not 70 years ago
  assuming a modern nuclear weapon which is designed to maximize blast and minimize fall out two weeks to venture out for very short periods three to five weeks for longer periods youll never see the region completely safe in your lifetime unless some sort of decontamination happens
  anon were talking about radiation poisoning not the ethics of nuclear power
  your best bet would be to gtfo from the zone which can be done safely within a day or less depending on distance from the blast and your equipment what kind of freak would you want to wait there and scavenge
  this was known decades before
  marie curie died of radiation sickness
  we knew
hello my girlfriend is studying french and has her first consultation tomorrow for about her bachelor thesis im trying to help her find an interesting topic but so far i didnt come up with much so im hoping for your help    so from what i understood it should be something obviously related with france french culture language art history politics etc but it also has to be narrowed down sufficiently to really be about one subject    my suggestion was about areas that were french colonies in the past and how the culture there today is still influenced by that apparently thats not good enough because its not specific about which colony and which aspect of culture to analyse but i also dont know enough about history to judge whether there is one specific area that offers something interesting enough to fill a bachelor thesis her friend for example has already picked a topic which is the comparison of the infrastructure of paris compared to another major city in asia    just so you have some idea of the range of possible topics you now know as much about the criteria as i do does anything come to mind
the colony france held most dearly to would be algeria i would imagine that would make a good thesis
    i will look into the history of algeria a bit more thanks would you have any idea which aspect would be most interesting to look at arts culture infrastructure

was the attack on merselkébir a war crime the british attacked a country they were not at war with they officially were allied   pearl harbour was considered a war crime for the same reason
    pearl harbour was considered a war crime     was it
  they officially were allied  no the werent
  crime against peace during the tokyo trials    france didnt surrender against germany they made an armistice in any case vichy france was at worse a neutral country
convention iii relative to the opening of hostilities the hague 18 october 1907  article 1  the contracting powers recognize that hostilities between themselves must not commence without previous and explicit warning in the form either of a declaration of war giving reasons or of an ultimatum with conditional declaration of war    admiraljames somervilleofforce h based ingibraltar was ordered to deliver an ultimatum to the french
  they made an armistice  a rogue state made an armistice    vichy france was at worse a neutral country  no they werent
  merselkébir  op btfo
  and what right did britain have to order the french to surrender their navy besides the british still sunk the french fleetwithout declaring war hence a war crime    the french collaborated with the germans but they always were neutral they were occupied thats hardly being german ally even after mers el kebir the french didnt declare war on britain
  and what right did britain have to order the french to surrender their navy  as you stated in this very post they were collaborating with the germans an enemy of the uk     besides the british still sunk the french fleetwithout declaring war hence a war crime   if you would read the actual article it explicitely states that if an ultimatum is delivered and ignored it is completely appropriate for a nation to attack with a declaration of war declarations of war are just formalities that are not commonly given
  they were collaborating with the germans an enemy of the uk  under the terms of an armistice after having been defeated vichy french was still officially a sovereign country and britain had no right to attack them unless you agree with de gaulle saying the real france was still fighting in london but by doing so you agree that britain attacked its ally  ignored  which it wasnt the negotiations were still ongoing  declarations of war are just formalities that are not commonly given  then why pearl harbor was considered a war crime
mers el kebir    i dont care if they attacked some frenchies as long as some degenerated stupid sandniggers died they should get medals not war crime trials
  british are humanitys villains yet they get away with everything  i wonder what would have happened if germany didnt rise to relevancy since the uk basically shared all of nazi germanys policies  today wed probably be talking about churchill the same way we do hitler and referring to whatever other ethnic group the brits would have committed inhuman acts against the union jack would be seen as a swastika
  pearl harbour had no ultimatum
  it could but i dont think so england took out a clear threat to its safety after warning the french multiple times and no they werent allies with vichy france wasnt an english ally their french allies were in england    yes they were vichy france was a puppet of germany french soldiers fought for germany they handed over jews and other undesirables and they gave germany war materials
  never thought of this that way i agree
  bongs are the best villains because they actually have better motives than the heroes
  french soldiers fought for germany  they never did though some volunteers fought for germany but not the french army
  british still sunk the french fleetwithout declaring war hence a war crime  the french actually fired first but thats by the by really      was the attack on merselkébir a war crime  no it was a legitimate attack launched for valid reasons against a hostile power after delivery of a reasonable ultimatum and the expiration of the time limit in said ultimatum the french had promised the british not to seek a separate peace with germany and to move their fleet outside of german reach both of which they reneged on   the british attacked a country they were not at war with they officially were allied   no they were not the french had essentially split into two sides the free french/governent in exile under de gaulle and the vichy french under petain who were actively collaborating with the germans the french fleet at mers el kebir was vichy    pearl harbour was considered a war crime for the same reason  no pearl harbor was considered a war crime because it was a attack launched without warning or declaration on a power that was at peace mers el kebir was launched against a hostile power after a warning and ultimatum and after the french had broken their word the ultimatum itself was reasonable and the honorable course for the french admiral would have been to follow one of its many options interment in the us or free french territory for example
  and what right did britain have to order the french to surrender their navy  well firstly the right of having a fucking battle fleet in position but in a larger view they have the fact that they were promised by the french that the fleet would be removed from german reach in the event of french surrender a promise that was broken and thirdly only one of the options listed was the surrender of the french fleet and even that included post war restoration of the fleet to france the other options were to join the british and redeem some of frances lost honor sail to a neutral third party to be disarmed and sit out the war or scuttle in port    the british didnt desire possession of the fleet so much as its removal from the risk of german seizure as it would have radically altered the balance of naval power
  the french had promised the british not to seek a separate peace with germany  the british had promised to help the french during the war they sent 10 divisions had 3000 dead and left the british also betrayed the french by not respecting the treaty of versailles signing a naval treaty with the germans besides the french didnt make a separate peace they officially still were at war with the germans as they only signed an armistice so technically yes france still was an ally of the uk  the honorable course for the french admiral would have been to follow one of its many options interment in the us or free french territory for example  the french never received the last point of the ultimatum all they got was give us your fleet or destroy yourself such wasnt at all a reasonable ultimatum the french promised the british they would not allow the germans to take their fleet as the armistice mentioned no such thing the french proved it when they scuttled their fleet at toulon years later    so this attack was both stupid since it only fuelled the german propaganda and greatly damaged the reputation of the uk but also criminal as a direct attack against an ally officially/neutral power at worse
  then why pearl harbor was considered a war crime  crimes against peace and war crimes are entirely different legislation to start with
  if the french navy had any pride it would have turned itself over before the armistice was even signed which several ships did unlike the cuck fleet at mers
  the british attacked a country they were not at war with    like that is the first time they did  remember copenhagen in 1801
  if the french navy had any pride it would have turned itself over before the armistice was even signed    why would a navy defect for a foreign nation upon losing a war  did the german navy randomly join another countrys navy in 1918
  the armed league of neutrality was like in the american war of independence an aggressive and warlike act towards the united kingdom denmark sowed the wind a second time and subsequently reaped the whirlwind
  why would a navy defect for a foreign nation upon losing a war  because they dont want to abide by a shit treaty were ships like the surcouf traitors to the nation because they wanted to keep fighting the cunts who invaded them in your mind  did the german navy randomly join another countrys navy in 1918  kind of its not like they turned up at scapa flow for no reason
  the embargo of japan was an agressive move the japanese had all the rights to attck the us at pearl harbour
  a bunch of countries being neutral is an act of aggression against britain
    who cares if it is a war crime which it isnt what are you going to do arrest britain
  yes in the american war of independence the league was an important economic factor in the eventual french/american victory this obviously could not be allowed to occur again thus the league was smashed before it became a hindrance to british military efforts
  what are you going to do arrest britain    bomb the shit out of british cities as a punishement  and this is what a francophile named adolf h who was eager to avenge the french did
  france is an algerian colony
  this is what anglos actually believe
    it says an ultimatum with conditional declaration of war not just an ultimatum
durant gibbon and many others cite higher german birth rates as a major reason for imperial collapse the romans were simply outbred    as important the rich increasingly put much of their effort into avoiding taxation instead of trying to support the empire they also refused to let their slaves and serfs join the military since they coveted thier labor    contemporaries most notably augustine also comment on the degeneracy and debauchery of the late empire the people came to make fun of prudishness and laugh at drunkenness adultery and licentiousness    finally the romans became dependant on a small cadre to fight their wars and when they lost they had to turn to foreigners having no martial skill themselves    compare this to the modern west birth rates in latin america and africa dwarf western ones and the uncivilized likewise seek the fruits of civilization demanding they gain access to the richer nations land and subsidies     4 of americans no serve in the military a historic low wars are now fought by a professional caste with drafts seen as unteneable the only difference is that the new forigners in america are significantly less likely to serve than natives and much more likely to say they would not serve america or would only serve their home nation    finally and most significanly the rich refusing to pay tax is an endemic problem the top 1 for instance control 38 of all private wealth but pay just 24 of all taxes once state and local is included    i dont even need to get into the celebration of degeneracy and debauchery    how comparable are we to late rome the rich then thought theyd last another 800 years right up until the last decades
i support mass illegal immigration of mexicans and central americans because wasps are mostly trash and the end of waspjewish hegemony over the us would be a great thing for the country and the world
  how comparable are we to late rome  were not fuck off
is augustus the greatest politican in history
glorified cheerleader
  bumpenstein
    based and thorough administrator he had the type of patience and discipline that caesar lacked  he had unlimited capacity to work a meticulous attention to detail and careful preparation he conducted his government with hardheaded realism and practical common sense  free from romantic illusions or mysticism
napoleon hitler caesar
was wwi really inevitable what if the entente agreed to give germany the congo and portugese africa in exchange for a nonaggression pact
   germany wanted war for its place in the sun willhelm spent the years prior to 1914 looking for a nation he can bully in a war to show german might   wilhelm wanted germanys fingers to be in everyones pies for everyone to fear the german kaiser
yes  everyone involved had been stockpiling and preparing to some degree colonial powers where already sorta ready for border disputes in far asia to trigger a large scale war in asia the same was true of south america to some degree and africa and arabia    russia might want a real coastline germany might want unification italy might want more of the coast of ottoman empire as would the greek  britain wanted everyone else to suck and was willing to enter any side that would escalate its position in europa the same is true of france  ottomans wanted a lot of things including more clay and technology the tribes in their area didnt want the ottomans  and it goes on and on as you list the participants a non aggression pact would just delay ww1 because its the first war in history where the difference between supply and manpower is so large that actually fighting the war turns into a huge economy destroying endeavor
germany was too big for europe too small for the world
as inevitable as the cold war
  i remember france and the uk were gonna fight over some shitty malaria swamp in central africa
  hitler explicitly stated he had no interest in an overseas colonial empire  as he attributed such to racial miscegenation lebensraum was centered around the acquisition of more territory for germans in europe for food room to colonize and a foundation for the supposed greatest empire in history part of what motivated this is how devastating british blockades had been in the first ww recalling how hitler had been insistent that germany was defeated by a collapse in morale at the homefront    but to answer your question eh maybe hitler certainly did not plan or anticipate for shit to snowball as quickly as it did following the invasion of poland
  god damn it im retarded i thought op said wwii
  the entente wouldnt have agreed or wanted to those conditions
  the same is true of france  france would never be on the same side as germany
  it wasnt about africa or colonies russia wanted to expand especially to take constantinople and assert itself in the balkans and carve out the remains of the ottoman empire
why did people in the past have such a better understanding of fashion and what actually looks good compared to the modern day  being a big early 20th century fashion fan mostly roaring 20s i recently bought a period accurate suit and hat and ive noticed all the women smile and basically eyefuck me whenever i wear it out   what period of historical fashion do you guys like and wish would come back into vogue
  
i believe most of it is the fact that people were thinner and clothes were properly fitted
back then the only people who could afford a finely tailored suit were people with a decent amount of cash this meant that just by walking down the street while wearing one you were announcing to the world that you were someone who is wealthy and important therefore most wealthy men would adorn an expensive suit to gain instantaneous respect it is for this exact reason that made men would spend ludicrous amounts of money on their outfits     regarding your question about it not being commonplace in modern day id guess that it is due to the historical death of traditional gangsters men of honor once they were no longer around expensive suits became something that were almost exclusively worn by people the public didnt usually respect this would include government agents politicians corporate fat cats and other undesirable individuals i mean im probably wrong about this part but like i said its just my guess as to why
  because youre comparing the best dressed and relatively wealthy urbanites of yesteryear with everybody today heres what your average poor fucker dressed like back then and they probably only owned a few outfits and had to wash them in a metal tub
    because mass production of clothes hadnt really started yet so people were wearing clothing that actually fit them instead of wearing shapeless bags
    the history of clothes isnt history
  they didnt you are thinking of movies no man should ever care about fashion
  whats with the gay ass scarf
    men should look like classless slobs    literal pleb tier opinion
  men should dress comfortably with utilitarianism in mind they shouldnt wear some costume to look like a gangster from 100 years ago note thats its primarily only people trying to make themselves look important that wear that shit now people who dont deserve respect like politicians or limo drivers men should just wear jeans and a comfortable shirt not some tryhard costume
    sees a well dressed man in a suit  immediately thinks of criminals    amerishart detected
  you say that like its a bad thing to associate old timey costumes with criminals
  basically eyefuck me whenever i wear it out  assuming women actually are eyefucking you wearing a zoot suit and fedora or whatever the fuck its because suits arent every day or common attire like they used to be but they still hold association with class and professionalism wear a modern suit and youll find the same reaction just wear a tucked button shirt and youll find the same reaction women are also dumb as fuck and settle 9 times out of ten for slobs who wear gym shorts and tank tops 100 of the time so anything with that association is an instant point of interest
    it is because it means youre a peabrained moron
  if anything i would say poorly educated people are much more likely to think suits are cool our authoritative
  heres how richfags dress now
  so you wear a fedora and a suit everywhere yeah keep telling yourself theyre staring at you out of lust plenty of men wear suits
    you can find just as many pictures of him in a suit anon
  this pretty much people who actually need to wear finer clothes dont think too much of it or put too much emphasis on it its men who professionally wear tshirts and polos working at gamestop that idealise wearing suits like a sir
  still looks like a sack of shit
    heres your you
  yeah but thts not what he wear normally thats what he wears to special events no one dresses like that on a normal day
  dude runs like the biggest fucking company in the world i can guarantee you hes wearing a suit at least 5 days a week minimum
  pretty unlikely except maybe for a couple hours to an event
  do you know who that even is mate
  i love how butthurt bezos makes people tell alexa to order you some preparation h leftypol
  most ceos only dress like that to important board meetings and shit or to formal events to which they are guests especially not in the tech industry or really anything besides banking and politics or customer service positions
  yeah not a guy known for larping as a 1920s gangster
  women are also dumb as fuck and settle 9 times out of ten for slobs who wear gym shorts and tank tops 100 of the time so anything with that association is an instant point of interest
    ceos dont dress in standard business suits    ok sure
  is this supposed to be an epic pwnage men do dress like shit women dont really care very much about how men dress but they generally do take notice of men who dress better suits professional attire   dont be insecure you dress like a faggot anon chances are youll find a gf some day
    come on he looks like he just graduated school and got fitted for his first suit
    guy complaining that he dresses nice but girls still ignore him  while being a landwhale    yeah it kinda is epic pwnage
    in what way list 5
  no waistcoat   shitty overly designed tie  shitty overlythin jacket   too open on the inside  lapelet
  except im not bitter about women dating slobs because im not obese and i already have a gf   do you actually disagree that men dress like shit i really didnt even think this was up from debate
    all suits must be the same weight have the same number of pieces  too open  litterally fitted to him    fashionlet pleb
  god damn it hes a businessman why the fuck would he be wearing a waistcoat im convinced that youre actually a fucking retard
why do people wear these meme shoes that look like retarded back to the future shit
  all styles are beautiful   fuck off libshit   fitted to him  i didnt say otherwise dummy    why wouldnt he moron what does being a businessman have to do with it
  some of those are alright desu
  what do you propose people wear out anon because i already know that youre a faggot and that your answer will be leather shoes im going to skip to the end and begin laughing at you
  so you can get facefucked without pulling hair of course
  there is only one good style  fuck off conservashit
  so you would wear a waistcoat to the office to a meeting
  why do fashion people hate shorts so much
  no there are number of acceptable styles just not all of them are good     no dumbass with are making comparisons here remember the context i wouldnt wear lorica segmentata in modern battle either doesnt mean that it looks bad   also im a neet and dont go to meetings with fat jewish cunts
  im honestly lost anon waistcoats are not business attire they havent been for a good while now jeff is a massive ultra rich businessman and he would look like a hyper fag wearing a waistcoat  im a neet  see 
  how else should i explain it im dealing with a complete brainlet i am saying modern clothes are inferior as a whole not suggesting that bezos should wear oldschool stuff while other go on living with normal modern standards  see   what am i supposed to see here i dont work i dont wear shits rarely polos and i actually hate suits too have never worn one or idolized them
  tips fedora    wats ur username on fedoralounge bruh
    if its fitted to him how can it be too open
  what is utilitarian about deliberately looking like shit    what part of looking in the mirror acknowledging an unimpressive man and going out the door is somehow a good thing for you    dont even bother answering everyone knows youre an ugly faggot without the self esteem to even try and look good fucked up to try and put your weakness on others though
  the style is too open in his chest area
  no one is saying you should look like shit just that dressing in a 1920s suit in a normal situation is fucking weird just wear a casual button up shirt and jeans like a fucking adult
  wearing old timey clothes doesnt make you an impressive man whether you are impressive or not is not defined by how you dress
  they didnt this  and the relative homogeneity of fashion lead you to romanticize their style one of the very few things that has improved or gotten back to the levels of excellence of antiquity is fashion among both men and women thots and basic bitches aside people especially fashionable people are extremely creative versatile aesthetes now and ive seen remarkably striking outfits when out in the downtown area and visiting other big cities on tumblr and other assorted vacuous hovels for consumer insects
  men should dress comfortably with utilitarianism in mind  men should just wear jeans and a comfortable shirt    wtf do you know about what men should wear has anyone in your life ever complimented you on looking good or what about for how functional your clothes look    i just dont get what it is with nerds on the internet acting as if their opinion is worth anything when it comes to style if you dont think it is within your reach to look good okay but if you arent why would you try and give advice to a stranger that can look good    its like me having no legs and trying to teach someone to sprint just stay out of the conversation you arent unique or interesting for walking around like a lumberjack npc
  t someone who has never dressed themselves well enough to be complimented on it    here is a tip retard most humans have functioning eyeballs and they use them
  people that care about style are insufferable its unbecoming of a many to care about such frivolous womenly pursuits
  yeah and most people who see you wearing a suit outside of a wedding or similar event think you look fucking silly its a costume not fashion
  i never wear a suit you useless faggot there are more ways to dress than suits and jeans and the fact that you seem insistent on this dichotomy shows your opinion is completely worthless      what kind of man are you who is impressed by forcing a pretension of tastelessness     npcs arent just a meme after all i guess
  npcs arent just a meme after all i guess  whats with you pushing this reddit meme
    its a costume not fashion    litterally the entire planet disagrees
  tell that to all the men throughout history while you sit on your computer and lactating out of your tits from hormone imbalances that all the modern men have
  what do you wear that is not costumelike and formal but also way fancier and makes you look more successful or whatever bullshit than jeans maybe it helps you stand out in your high school hallway but in the normal world men wear jeans most of the time or sometimes shorts during the summer
  men throughout history didnt care about fashion they cared about buying expensive things and displaying them on their body
  many men imitated powerful leaders and dressed like them so they did care about fashion
  tracksuit pants slacks corduroys shorts linen trousers i dont try to look fancy or more successful     dont try and talk to anyone about the normal world when you clearly have an autists concept of it      what the fuck do you think fashion is you stupid cunt
  it was about imitating rich people to make yourself look rich very cringey behavior as is fashion now its basically just trying to trick people a fully dishonest endeavor
so /fa/his/ i wear a buttonup shirt often plain or plain as well as trousers you know usually brown or black pants that arent jeans and brown leather shoes everyday im not saying everyone should i just want your opinion   is this good i also wear thinframed glasses and am not fat help an unconfident young virgin
  tracksuit pants  like for exercising or are you telling me wearing tracksuit pants makes you more fashionable than jeans
  it was colder back then and cold weather fashion is inherently superior to warm weather fashion because you can better exploit the aesthetic advantages of textural layering    its hard to be fashionable using materials whose whole purpose is to insulate when you are specifically trying to avoid insulating yourself because it is hot
  stop wearing glasses get better eyes
  that was not always the case you marxist sack of shit stop injecting your gay materialism into everything
/fa/ cope the thread
  well this is definitely the first time i have ever been called a marxist
  stop injecting your gay materialism into everything  says the guy who thinks ops hat and scarf are totally something a straight man should wear and not gay at all
  im telling you its okay to have more shit in your wardrobe than a hank hill costume    and for the record even though you will absolutely try and talk shit about it yes i and many men look great in tracksuits
  many are unaware that they are brainwashed by marxism     wrong i think it looks gay
  there is literally nothing wrong with wearing a scarf
  post outfit pussy
  pick one of these looks if you want the nerds here to respect you
  you dont have to be a marxist to recognize that normal people trying to imitate rich people clothing is cringey in fact i think most marxists would not be sitting here making fun of poor people and their wasting time obsessing over fashion in the first place
  i have literally never seen a straight man wear a scarf and i live in one of the coldest states
  just wear a fucking plaid button up and jeans like an adult
  not suggesting that bezos should wear oldschool stuff  the post i originally replied to was literally you suggesting that he wear a fucking waistcoat if you made a point against modern fashion it was by advocating old standards you are the brainlet you fucking yobbo goober doofus
  plaid  lmao
  sounds like hes already dressed like dale gribble
    men throughout history didnt care about fashion    this is possibly the most moronic piece of horseshit ive witnessed on this sorry ulcerated sphincter of a website and thats saying something    they cared about buying expensive things and displaying them on their body    and what decided what was expensive and worthy of displaying on their body fucking fashion
  and what decided what was expensive and worthy of displaying on their body  how hard something was to obtain it wasnt about patterns and colors or shit it was how much effort had to go into procuring it
    states    theres your problem
  because most of the shorts that people wear are cheap dont fit well have terrible looking fabric etc    there are good looking shorts but nylon basketball shorts do not look good on anyone
  wow do you have a black hole inside your head  the post was pointed out why the modern suit looked like shit and what were the specific problems why he looked like a sack of shit in it i didnt say he should wear a waistcoat
  no offense but is it also one of the dumbest states  scarves are very effective at keeping your neck warm
  generally when people say shorts they mean like khaki shorts not athletic shorts unless specifically talking about working out
  most jackets sufficiently cover the neck region any real winter jacket will zip up to the chin
    youre both talking about the same thing
  you have to be brainwashed by marxism to believe people imitated rich people if that was the case everyone would have imitated merchants not caesar or a king
  patterns and colors required effort to procure anon thats why people had such gaudy tastes in ancient times
  warm weather fashion is limiting but i have always felt that is what pushes someone to experiment with the aesthetic moreso than just sheer layering
  that has nothing to do with marxism thats basically the entire history of fashion rich people buying things that are rare or labor intensive to make and poor people copying it
    wasnt about patterns or colors    yes this is why a rich italian from 100ad looks exactly like a rich italian from 1500ad    the absolute state of this shithole
  well yeah some dye was quite expensive i just mean in the sense that modern fashion nerds care about it
  your first fucking complaint was no waistcoat meaning obviously that his outfit would look better if he were wearing one what other meaning am i supposed to extrapolate from your post
  khaki shorts also dont look great my dude all the pockets dont let the clothes give you the right fit     then again we may just have different fashion sense but for me clothes should be more or less form fitting and display your body in a positive light    men who look good in shorts are men with developed thigh muscles
  no coat that zips up will keep your neck as warm as a good scarf
  all the pockets dont let the clothes give you the right fit  im not gonna wear womens clothes with no pockets what man could wear shorts with no pockets i dont carry a purse around
  i refuse to believe you are this stupid you are just messing with me or just lying 
  i have literally never experienced a situation where the neck was what got cold and again i live in a pretty cold place  the problem with scarves are they are just unnecessary accessories it doesnt really add anything and what am i supposed to do with it once i get inside just carry it around
  men who look good in shorts are men with developed thigh muscles  vry true also khakis also never look good because theyre typically worn below the knee which hides a lot of the thigh i have strong legs but if i wear shorts below my knees it just makes them look fat
  tell me where you live you fucking homo and ill kick your ass
  men who look good in shorts are men with developed thigh muscles  any man should wear shorts in the summer who gives a fuck what your thighs are like they are the most comfortable thing for the summer thats all that matters
  seriously anon try a scarf theyre very good at comfortably sealing the air gap between your coat and your neck you dont have to wear it like a fag in fact theyre most effective when theyre mostly under the coat and you can barely see them at all
  idk my neck doesnt really get so cold that i need a scarf but i usuallu feel better when i have one on  and i guess just stuff it in your coat pocket or wear it over your shoulders what do you do with your beanie or hat
  khakis also never look good because theyre typically worn below the knee  most of mine are a little above the knee and i just buy random ass shorts without regard for that so i am gonna assume they are the normal length
  i put my winter hat and gloves in my coat pockets but a scarf seems considerably larger than those
  nobodys saying you need to wear pants just dont expect to look sexy in shorts if youre a leglet
  725 5th ave new york ny 10022  lets do this bitch
  ha i dont wear shorts to look sexy i wear them if its hot outside because they are more comfortable than long pants as anyone should in that situation no one should consider themselves not sexy enough to wear shorts thats absurd
no matter what (((they))) say hitler created some kino aesthetics
  good for you dude i already stated that i think fashion is subjective though i think you can gauge how the average person would react to a certain style
  hitler created some kino aesthetics  you mean karl diebitsch
  are you trying to be funny or is adulthood to you seriously signified by owning plaid and jeans    is everyone in this thread that developmentally stunted
  i am being a little hyperbolic with some of these statements but in all honestly if your pursuit of fashion is leading you to ditch pockets you have a problem like are you just supposed to carry your wallet and keys and phone all day
  yeah this emaciated jawlet with a huge nose is really setting trends    those clothes were not wildly different from any other countries at the time theyre just thick grey coats
  i am just saying dress like a normal dude because normal dudes dress that way for a reason its convenient and useful dont try and look like a homosexual or whatever you will just confuse people
  khakis have like 10 pockets you need about 3 total  4 if youre the kind of freak who uses both ass pockets
  im not saying ditch pockets just that your shorts will not look good if you have 4 extra baglike pockets on them    all my pants have pockets and 4 regular pockets 2 in the front and 2 in the back is enough for me
  are you talking about cargo shorts thats not what people mean hen they say khakis most khakis have front and back left and right pockets so 4    i am definitely not advocating for the necessity of cargo pockets
  they dress that way because they are conformist untermenschen
  oh fuck sorry mate we dont say khakis here but i always just assumed that was what burgers called cargo shorts
  normal dudes dress like that because they are bang average and cannot hope to look better either through physical or creative deficiency    i dont even know why i bother desu you and i both know if people in this thread could look good and be treated better they would    all this t shirt and jeans garbage is just nuh uh well i never liked you anyway bullshit and it is fucking autism at its height
  all this t shirt and jeans garbage is just nuh uh well i never liked you anyway bullshit  what do you mean by that anon genuine question
  i would say cargo shorts are a type of khaki shorts but not the default type maybe 10 years ago they would have been they got super popular for a while
  you remember how in school when your idiot friend would ask a girl out and get rejected then try and say they never liked them in the first place    the people in this thread preaching the hank hill gospel are people who just cant look good either they arent creative enough or they are genuine uglets     everyone on the planet likes to be treated better and knows that better looking people are treated better i am saying that most of this thread is just cope for people who dont believe they have the capacity to play that game and need for their egos sake everyone around them to be at their level
  dude you have a problem
  yeah its nerds trying to shill jeans and plaid every time someone talks about clothes
  like anything the people who care way to much about a subject are referred to as nerds as opposed to normies there is literally nothing wrong with wearing jeans in the vast majority of situations
the women smile and basically eyefuck me    theyre not eyefucking you
  yeah theyre really stuck in the middle school mentality on fashion    when i was in middle school i tried so hard to make everyone think i didnt care about anything thought it would make me seem cool and mysterious fucking cringe    but i was a dipshit kid care about the way you look you can look good and still be formfunctional you will get more attention from girls if you put some effort into your appearance
  yeah i dont think this guy is too selfaware i dont have a problem with some internet autismo loving a different kind of fashion but i dont like op because hes under the impression that hes achieved a fucking higher state of being because he wears outdated suits
  nah as an adult looking like you tried really hard to look the way you do is cringey whether its with clothes or even worse hair nothing more cringey than a dude who looks like he wasted 30 minutes on his hair
  no people who are fucking dweebs are referred to as nerds like people who have nothing in their wardrobe but plaid and jeans      pic related
  you can keep telling yourself that but there is nothing nerdier than a guy dressing like op and thinking that makes him cool
  dude if you know anything about fashion then it is not hard its just basic knowledge about what colors and patterns go with what    its cringey when someone thinks they look better than they actually do typically in cheap clothes they bought from asian retailers
  it only looks like people tried too hard to you because you have never tried at all
  will you please explain to me why you and so many in this thread think the only two things you could wear are a formal suit or jeans and a button up
  i dont get the asian retailer reference i dont thin thats a thing around me people who spend a lot of money on clothes are dumb like dont go and buy walmart brand stuff but one step above that is basically always sufficient like anyone who has ever spent more than 50 on jeans the fuck is up with that
  this thread has spent the gdp of an island nation on jeans apparently
  because they dont have a functional understanding of fashion    most guys can look good in some slim straightfit jeans gray or black a blank white tee shirt that properly fits them and some plainlooking darkcolored shoes its a classic outfit ages well     another thing that they fuck up a lot is outerwear lets go ahead and establish this now very few people look good in a trench coat especially the cheap ass one you bought from goodwill for 4 if you want a good trench coat that fits you well be ready to drop upwards of 250300 400 plus if its wool    shoes are another big thing different fashion senses require different shoes urban/punk relies on sneakers doc martins converses etc choose shoes that complement your outfit and do not wear sketchers or any other brand that has a huge ass logo on it unless you are a collector and thats a part of your look
  i recently bought a period accurate suit and hat and ive noticed all the women smile and basically eyefuck me whenever i wear it out   he thinks women arent staring at him because he looks like a dumbass going around wearing a 1920s style suit designed to be worn by businessmen at work or men at formal parties
  if you go on amazon looking for clothes youll most likely come across some really cheap shit from asian retailers that looks really nice in the pic formfitting welltailored nice fabric etc    but those clothes are complete bs never buy them    and dude people have different interests some people spend all their free spending cash on legos some people build model ships and some people buy expensive clothes that they enjoy if they can afford it then you dont need to understand it it wont affect you anyway    but for your question on the jeans its for high quality fabrics brand recognition a certain fit etc
  fact only americans and 3rd worlders dress like shit
  with proper care a good pair of high quality jeans can last you years
  levis can last a good few years too
  what do you spend your money on toys anime games everybody pisses money away on something clothes at least have some benefit to the person wearing them that they may give more confidence

posts entire american undergraduate economics curriculum
  its him the american
  every single soviet hero their deeds and backgrounds have been embellished beyond recognition
  he was basically the real life john wick though
  lying about your kills is what john wick did
english newsreel on germans post ww2   
  gommies still salty about the winter war lmao
  why would they they won
  get the shit beat out of you for days  completely underestimate your opponent  two black eyes orbital bone broken  your opponent is too tired to carry on  ttruce  youre using won too liberally lmao
this so sick on internet pophis fags wanking so much over le white death like yeah he was cool but calm down firstly he didnt kill 705 he admitted to his biographer later in life that his actual number was closer to 200 still a lot but still machine gunners were going crazy from killing hundreds a day and eventually were only allowed to spend a few days at the front including smg kills and that the 5/700 number was pure propaganda as it was being published in newspapers around the world the pictured i posted was simo at his spot after the war what he did was to crawl up into the spot before dawn and shot at the human waves of russian troops with his rifle and when they got close switch to his smg he wasnt a sniper in the traditional sense just one of the best marksmen in the army at the time he famously could make 16 shots on target in one minute that was 150m away    i hate that people think he was like crawling around behind enemy lines like a ghost that the russians whispered about in fear or something like they would have any idea who he was
  ttruce  finland was the one who sued for peace though
  youre missing the point which is that the soviets were completely humiliated and theres no getting around it
  ttruce  finland was the one who sued for peace
  and that somehow alleviates being humiliated by literal whos the we won in the end though cope is pathetic
  theres nothing pathetic in winning the war
  youre missing the point  no you just took a meme literally and think the soviets were the ones who were begging for peace like a dumbass
  you got humiliated badly it was absolutely the most pathetic display of a modern army getting btfod outside of maybe vietnam
  this the soviets literally commissioned a march to be played in helsinki after its conquering didnt really work out did it    in 1939 before the soviet forces were to invade finland the party secretary of leningrad andrei zhdanov commissioned a celebratory piece from shostakovich a theme to be performed as the marching bands of the red army would be parading through the finnish capital helsinki2 shostakovich finished composing on 3 december 1939 as the red army was advancing in the finnish front and the puppet regime finnish democratic republic was founded three days earlier
  youre literally missing the point to avoid confronting that it was fucking humiliating lmao it doesnt matter who asked for a truce because the point is the humiliation and the soviets most definitely got humiliated in a war that should have been a wash
  i couldnt care less that a hundred thousand ivans got raped by the finns because theyre dogshit at war you literally didnt even know who sued for peace there and you probably didnt know that the russians were breaking through finnish defences regardless of the embarrasing number of slavs that died
  trying to argue on a technicality  missing my point and the spirit of the argument  youre one of those autists who got absolutely dogshit grades and argued with the teacher afterwards arent you
  im not trying to argue about some technicality i agree with you that it was an embarassing experience for the red army your shitty analogy of a guy beating the shit out of someone and then getting tired and then the beaten up guy russia asking for truce is so factually incorrect its laughable
  you got humiliated  i wasnt
  im not trying to argue about some technicality  yes you are especially when ive told you the point of what i said no inference needed so you literally are one of those guys    every single shit grade you ever got was wellearned learn to answer the question asked of you and get to the point
  yes you are   my criticism was that your analogy was factually incorrect in every meaning if you give so much the peace treaty bullshit was merely one aspect of it finland was the one who sued for peace finland didnt get tired of beating the shit out of russia russias overwhelming manpower forced a breakthrough in finnish defences forcing them to retreat which wouldve spelled disaster in the end albeit at a large cost for the red army funny how you also dont address the rest of my argument  to me it sounds like youre projecting like a child
  tldr  arguing about the details of the analogy rather than the point its making  sterilize yourself my dude
5748872  literally zero arguments   a literal child lmfao next time dont make up retarded analogies if you have 0 clue about the winter war not even worth a you you poor soul
  so true not just for propaganda purposes though they were expected to do well by leaders so the leaders could look good so on up the chain look at the societ aces in korea so many lies about the numbers and they cant be corroborated with sources
honestly the early soviet losses in the winter war are somewhat understandable considering pretty much everyone expected the finns to not put up a fight at all and so the red army just threw together an attacking force and assumed theyd be fine kind of like how if czechoslovakia fought back fully the germans would have had initially heavy casualties
  you didnt make an argument to refute you sperged out about something that didnt matter

  battle of moores creek bridge    pretty sure the battle of orthez was more relevant than this one
i want to read more about history but i have no idea where to start please help me out here bros
rome is a good start or mesopotamia     idk man pick a time and place you find interesting and start reading
  start with what interests you when you start to read check out a bunch of books on the same topic to find out what author you prefer to read
  this as you read youll learn a bit about countries related to the one youre reading about and then you can read about the most interesting one of those in an interesting time period etc
  start from interesting subjects word wars are easy to comprehend are interestin and there is plenty of material  if you really want it all you should start from ancient egypt  greece rome     general tip try to start studying subject from oldest point possible history is chronological and events are always somehow related to past events crude example ww2 was mainly caused by ww1
  unironically start with an ap or 101 history coursebook it will give you a good overview and show you areas of history you might want to study in greater depth
  i would go backwards with that order rome is broadly more interesting and probably the civilization more like and most influential to our own ancient egypt isnt that interesting if youre not already interested in the first civilizations
  the plain and simple of it is only european history matters and other things that connect to europe persians pheonicians the mongols and the various interactions between europeans and other groups during the last 500 years
  general tip try to start studying subject from oldest point possible history is chronological and events are always somehow related to past events crude example ww2 was mainly caused by ww1  thats the problem i have for every interesting time period i choose it seems like i need information from a previous period so i could just start with the beginning of time itself i guess       unironically start with an ap or 101 history coursebook  i might actually do that
  thats the problem i have for every interesting time period i choose it seems like i need information from a previous period so i could just start with the beginning of time itself i guess  thats a strategy but you could just read one period and get a fairly good but not perfect understanding and then moving on to other stuff that seems interesting perhaps related to what you previously studied
  first things first what are you into  if youre into great men then alexander and caesar are good places to start you can then read further on the societies they came from you can learn how events allowed them to exist then the aftermath you should then find new things you like and you can keep reading till you have a modest understanding of what you like and which books you like
  the order was chronological to understand rome better you should know greek history first      in that case you should just jump in somewhere if it is western history you want to learn id recommend to start with ancient greeks thats pretty much where western history starts and it is interestin subject imo  if you dont find that interesting just pick any subject you do find interesting    by studying different things you get more pieces to the puzzle and eventually start to see the bigger picture if there are something that you feel that is essential to know you can ask here thats what /his/ is for    in /his/ there are no stupid questions only stupid tankie/wehraboo wwii threads
  start with the gayreeks  resume with the romanians
were the inquisitions really as horrible as theyre portrayed in media
yes    speaking of berserk you know the part when the kushans occupy a midland town and brutally kill everyone thats what a coalition of catholics did to the cathars except they killed a million
  oh it was awful first they sent you a letter 2 weeks in advance before they came for you and then if you passed their tests you were utterly free  it was so bad that the vast ammount of people tried were found not guilty      there was a shitton of rape though
  no it was generally an improvement over the court systems it superceded these would have lower standards of evidence and welfare torture was worse before the inquisition the inquisition limited what could be done for how long it could be done made medical supervision a requirement and it only used torture to extract admissions of guilt from people who had already been found guilty  the point was to have the convict confess to begin the pennance procedure after which the vast majority of convicts were free to go
  no in fact it wasnt even that bad its mostly protestant and anglo propanga
  first post worst post
    in regards to witchhunts heretic christians ie the cathars and gnostics yes in regards to jews and muslim converts such as in the case of spain not so much    and while the inquisitorial procedures were pretty bad most of the attrocities were committed through acts of war such as in the massacre of the waldensians the cathars the hussite crusades and the killing of entire populations and towns and attrocities against civilians on the other side during the thirty years war     and the earlymodern ones were still an advancement in regards to the practices of the church in the early medieval and dark ages which precluded sweeping cultural replacement and destruction the edicts of theodosius condemned people to death for even looking at the ruins of nonchristian temples and there were similar provisions elsewhere for things like not attending mass eating the host wrongly the earlymodern period though and the religious wars that followed was a time of recrudescing of fanatism and religious strictness things like witchcraft and other sins which could be indulged just a century before became grave offenses    to sum it up liberal media portrayals arent entirely accurate but there was something there though but christian revisionism about that is even more fallacious and misguided
  also jewish propaganda
    it was not just that in fact the actions of the protestants were even worse at times        if you passed their tests you were utterly free    yeah the tests were exactly what the portrayals are about if the inquisition was indeed mild with jews and muslim converts many thousands of woman were killed during such proceedures and they were even worse in early medieval times        there was a case in the princebishopric of trier were some villages were reported to be left with no or only a few adult woman for decades afterward the salzburg witch trials killed 100 german children
    jews mostly laugh at it not everything is black and white
  seething christcuck
it wasnt as huge but shit still sucked to an extent
  theyre christian so yeah worst people youll ever find
  based and frogpilled volcels should rape all the women to preemptively punish them for selecting the wrong mate
  yeah sure and communism only killed like 12 people
  no
  volcels rape  literally what
were they viewed equally to a white russian
  its everybodys wish deep down inside
  yes many american civil rights leaders who visited the soviet union attested to this there was more or less complete equality between genders races and nationalities in the soviet union which is a fact they used to great effect in their propaganda
    unless you were polish hungarian or jewish
  murdering children is good  christchanjpg  christlarper detected
  yep and watch the national iq average of this country go down dramatically with no whites
  examples
  wall of text with appropriated visual aesthetic  why are leftists so predictable
  there were no soviet blacks in the soviet union
  incorrect there were tens of thousands of blacks living in the soviet union their descendants remain in the russian federation today
  antisemitism in the soviet union reached new heights after 1948 during the campaign against the rootless cosmopolitan in which numerous yiddishwriting poets writers painters and sculptors were killed or arrested23 this culminated in the socalled doctors plot in which a group of doctors almost all of whom were jewish were subject to a show trial for supposedly having plotted to assassinate stalin4    inb4 wikipedia    stalin even exiled his own doctor because he was a jew
  vaporwave is inherently anticapitalist
  they were handed out by the state a pure ethnic russian virgin to impregnate
  did you forget the rest of your essay gonna need some more words words words words words words
  the killing of individual jews who plotted against the soviet union is not evidence of structural discrimination against jews who were highly over represented in the soviet government and even had their own autonomous oblast
  holy fucking based
  wtf i love the soviet union now
  no russians are pretty racist in a casual yea so what way    since blacks were historically rare in russia most russians didnt really think anything about them in soviet times they were almost always from commie countries in africa so considered allies    but in truth most russians wouldve thought they were jungle bunnies lustful primitives and dumb apes not trusted around their women    ive been to russia as a tourist and i had a couple russian friends online that i met up with one put me in touch with a girl studying english and she was kinda my guide for a while no sex she had a boyfriend one day in the metro a russian woman was walking arminarm with a guy who was clearly her boyfriend and most liley caucasian georgian armenian something like that a bit swarthy black hair but couldve been italian and this girl nods her head at them giggles and says aah lyook like coffeee and cream he hehe that was worthy of mention     russians are full of clichés and stereotypes about foreigners and that includes blacks in short if they think about them all they dont like them    inb4 bbut pushkin was black
    so just like latin americans up until the last decade
  op specifically asked about the soviet union though its reasonable to suspect that the attitudes of people in the 21st century russian federation may not be identical to those of soviet citizens especially after all the terrorism by caucasus niggers
  if russians are casually racist now its inconceivable that there werent racist a couple generations ago
  the totalitarian ideology during ussr was that blacks from commie african lands were comrades while blacks in america were an oppressed underclass that could potentially be used to foment revolution    but what people really thought was that blacks were mostly impulsive dumb lusty apes good at sports and drumming    is that clear    pic not rotated whatever
  and yes the pic is from 11 years ago on a shitty pointandshoot that was on its last legs
  its is when youre a judeofascist alt right type
  the only source that confirms this extreme righty point of view is larp
  well unlike niggers the jews probably deserve it and if they didnt like it they should have sided with the fascists
  today on state documentary 5475 we will be examining the black man  we begin by looking at his strong and dark build his assertive attributes   long oppressed by various imperial powers the pearly womb of the native russic woman could only be benefitted by his imposing seed
  russians had no experience with blacks and also had political motives for cashing in on the race controversy in the us
did you ever hear the tragedy of king cotton the great its not a story the union would tell you its a dixie legend king cotton was a great industry of the south so productive and so valuable he could use the cotton to influence the europeans to wage war he had such a knowledge of economics he could even keep the negro slaves from being freed he became so powerful the only thing he was afraid of was losing his negroes which eventually of course he did unfortunately he taught the north everything he knew then the north killed him in his sleep ironic he could influence others to wage war but not himself
  is it possible to learn this power
  heres a you for the effort op  5/10
   not from a yankee
  kek
  holy kek
  cotton never accounted for more than tea i think it was something like 2 of us gdp
  no look it up cotton was often more than half of total us exports
    based
  i love how southern apologists believe in king cotton but refer to slave power as a myth
  top of the barrel shitpost
  usa has always been a big inner market exports arent everything
  agreed but thats the point of the pasta the south had far too much faith in the power of cotton
  thanks for the chuckle
  wouldnt it be egypt that killed it or wherever they started cultivating alternative sources of cotton i forget
why didnt they just use lazy whites and pay them wouldve been cheaper than being responsible for maintaining niggers
    then you suddenly have this massive labor force who used to be your slaves roaming around the countryside with no way to support themselves even among northerners what to do with the freed slaves was a question that made a lot of people uneasy     also slavery was a big cultural part of the south
that constitutional ban on slave imports after 1808 was only half clever    shouldve been followed up with granting full citizenship to all newborn slaves after 1838
  dump them out west
  the great migration
where do i start with the yugoslav wars what books are best on the topic
  quran
bible
  to kill a nation the attack on yugoslavia by michael parenti    
  there was no nation to be killed yugoslavia only existed by supressing different ethnicities and having concentration camps
  t cia
  read about a 10 day war in which the noble white slovenian took on the combined assault of brown savages from the south and emerged victorious
  actually i am from the only white country that was a part of yugoslavia    we did so well after the turkroaches larping as slavs stopped leeching from us that they started mass migrating here    basically slovenia is north america and balkan is south america
  everything is quite simple really there is no need to reed many books on the topic just watch the death of yugoslavia
  start with the greeks
  be slovenian   literally beg for serbs to send the army to stop italians and austrians from raping you   serbs do so     we wuz occupied by turks it was awful unghhh  eternal stableboy
  calls slovenians stable boys for being under austrians  wants slovenes to be under serbs    you subhumans only looted my country especially during ww2 all serb generals did was mass murder slovenian civilians who were not communists
  lol so /lit/ only likes books 14
  you start and then give up shortly after because none of it makes any sense and you probably need balkan autism
  i found this good for getting a general idea has interviews with a lot of the big people directly involved  
once and for all the only book that can be classified as objective as far as it can be is balkan battlegrounds written by the fucking cia it can be found freely on the internet it mostly deals with military history but has a very solid look at the causes and roots of all the wars of the 90s that happened in that area
  shouldve left you to the italians
  supressing different ethnicities   they were all pretty fucking jolly until the loans stopped coming in  fucking balkan niggers
  you had your own communists you fucking liar
  the cruelest acts in slovenia were commited by slovenian nazi collaborators since their task was to terrorize the populace in order to discourage them from joining the resistance movements
  false most civilians were killed by communists during and after war because they were filthy serbs who wanted slovenian goods
  coping hard you commie faggot  commies killed more people after the war then during it  commies killed more civilians/unarmed then enemy combatants
    nigger nobody fucking knows because even the people that fought in those wars cant agree on why they fuck they even started it
i mean i would have assumed russian fed like most people but apparently polls suggest russian citizens suggest otherwise look at russia
  life spans were much longer during the ussr the average russian male has a horrific life span nowadays
  many russians feel that way perhaps justifiably so most of their extended empire does not
doesnt include the baltic states  of course shitholes miss a big daddy state that coddled them and pumped their economy   restaurants served cutlets without meat all the restaurant employees went home with full bags    they were not ashamed to talk about stealing it was good and they were proud of it and you a stupid engineer refers to himself cannot do it you get your hundred rubles and thats it    everywhere it was the sameit could not have been different   
all of you should read one life in russia by nikita sadkov  of course orcs will tell you that they were better off under the dark lord it is in their nature
  baltics states would be tiny illiterate shitholes with germans rulling over them if there wasnt for us georgians
isnt sputnik a propaganda site funded by russians
  unsurprising all 1824s with access to the internet can see how laughable the comparision is
  maybe
  life expectancy of soviet males in 1986  64 years or 69 for both genders  life expectancy of russian males in 2018  66 years or 70 for both genders  are you retarded russia experiences stagnation in life expectancy and the country is far behind the rest of the countries with similar gdp per capita but 90 of people who talk about eastern europe on /his/ dont even fucking check statistics im so tired of retards like you i bet you just take your facts from /pol/  t ukrainian
  the soviets were imperialist scum and communism was bullshit all armenia needs to do now to finally become great again is reconquer all of urartu
did the scythians actually use a significant number of women warriors or is it just a modern meme
  meme slavic women are too soft and feminine to be warriors
  scythians  slavic  
  my бaбyшкa would like a word with you anon
  they have found kurgans scythian burial mound with female skeletons adorned with armour and other items implying she was a warrior
    they were found in russia scythians were slavic
  what else would they be
  iron age scythians were hapa mongoloids so no indo iranians and slavs separated in the early bronze age
  meme archery requires a massive amount of strenght in the upper body most women cant even clean the house without their husbands helping
  theres no genetic or historical anectodal evidence that suggests they were asiatics go back to r/asian masculinity or whereever the fuck
  that seems like rather weak evidence though people tended to be buried with all sorts of stuff the anglosaxons used to bury their babies with spears if i remember correctly
  cuck scythians were white russians
    according to unterländer et al 2017 iron age scythians from the southern ural region east kazakhstan and tuva can best be described as a mixture of yamnayarelated ancestry and an east asian component the latter occurring only at trace levels  if at all  among earlier steppe inhabitants38
  cant have a single /his/ thread without niggers claiming that indoeuropeans and egyptians were iranian niggers
  theyre just mad that whites continue to steal their women    t a black man
  evidence of baby warriors then
  less warrior and more war retinue that wasnt afraid to participate on raiding
  russians are finnougrics conquered by slavs
  blacks in the west are seed of white men
  its like the shieldmaiden all over again in every case of these female warriors the skeletons show no sign of ever being in combat and if you were an ancient warrior you would have signs more likely these culture practised killing a mans wife in the event of their death or perhaps done so in this case because there was no body of the man available to bury so the wife was used as a surrogate
  scythians werent slaves get over it subhuman without history or people to be proud of
      back to cuckshed hapa scyths were peasants of slavic scythians
  tfw people use my ancestors to virtue signal
  they were pakis
  pakis have nothing to do with aryans theyre australoid subhumans just like pajeets
  kek
chad scythians  keeps pastoralist ways of his ancestors  lives in the open steppe spends time fighting and herding  controls land from crimea to altai  immensely wealthy because controls trade routes  routinely goes on raids for germanic and slavic women  master horse archer  uncivilized but ferocious and advanced nonetheless  outwitted the greeks    virgin slavs  gets enslaved so many times becomes the source of the word slave in over 100 languages  lives underneath a swamp breathing through straws to avoid getting killed  control nothing because lives in swamps in belarus spends time playing with rocks and sticks  looks vaguely human  millions of their women get bred by germanics byzantines mongols turkics scythians etc  tries to avoid conflict after getting defeated and enslaved by scythians and germanics  uncivilized but stupid and harmless  enslaved by greeks

  where exactly was it i claimed scythian bvlls were subhuman slavs/mongoloids what dumb fuck  is my first post here showing that low slav iq off perfectly
  scythians migrate towards what is now pakistan  slavshits claim descent even they have nothing to link themselves to scythians   cry more
  whitest people in the world  scandinavians celtics germans finnish
  germanics have too much lbk shitskin component with orange skin when tanned they tan like meds     finns  hapa    celts  meme group and if french represent celts then i have bad news for you     australoid hand wrote this post its clear as day
  they hailed from eastern europe to rape swarthy natives od inbredistan
  germanics have too much lbk  funny because slaves have more eef than scandinavians  hapa  the only hapa group that has been cucked by huns turkics and mongols are slavshits not pure finns    subhuman hands wrote your post
  extremely based post except  routinely goes on raids for germanic women  is incorrect since the goths majorly btfod the scythshits
  slavs have more enf than scandis  nonsense
  the scythians were never beat by goths goths migrated into scythian lands circa 4th century ad by which point it wasnt scythian but a sarmatian offshoot that had been genocided by the huns/xiongnu
  finns have more mongoloid in them than slavs though and before you claim finns are more aryan or whatever than slavs wash your face in a cold water and rethink your life hatred steeming from your posts is that of an aussie or that swedish albanian from /pol/
  hatred steeming from your posts is that of an aussie  im not even a hateful person what are you talking about
  their capital city scythian neapolis stood on the outskirts of modern simferopol the goths destroyed it later in the mid3rd century ad  the state of scythians lmao
  the goths were driven out like cattle by huns i love how you pretend germanic are some superhumans when in reality they were roman and hun cumsockets literal slaves
  slavs have more mongoloid in them than finns   fixd  rethink your life slave i couldnt care less for slavshits i dont even know any you on the other hand have proven to be emotionally fragile and angry towards anyone nonslavic
  thats wrong though finns are more mong than slavs and no amount of shitflinging will change that
  neapolis was a bosphoran greek city under the rule of rome it was absolutely not a scythian city nevermind sarmatians are the ones living in that area and have been driven off by the massive hunnic confederation
  its unsurprising that germanics were driven out of ukraine given that there were other hordes of steppeshits involved too not just the huns only a few germanic tribes were subjugated by the huns anyway while most remained free and even then the goths became the ruling elite of the hunshit empire also after its collapse hunnic women were unfortunately taken by germanic men
  i wonder what goes through your little head when you lie so much
  
    more like the huns exterminated or raped the east germanic aristocracy and installed their bastard children as heads of the germanic tribes  pure fetishism and only a few germanic tribes were directly subjugated by the huns so even if it were true who cares lmao    probably quite a few slavs  unlikely actually    famed gothic cavalry at adrianople were mostly huns and alans  the alans were involved but the huns had literally nothing to do with it and the contribution of the cavalry is overstated anyway  some older works attribute the gothic victory to overwhelming gothic numbers to gothic cavalry and sometimes to gothic use of stirrups36 more recent scholarly works mostly agree that the armies were similarly sized that the gothic infantry was more decisive than their cavalry and that neither the romans nor the goths used stirrups until the 6th century37    odoacer first germanic king of italy from the torcilingi tribe literally turklings  theres no proof that he was from the torcilingi he also could have been from the rugii or the herules he also had a germanic name which i know is mostly irrelevant but the turkish etymologies people have tried to put forward are still absolute bullshit
  slava  fame   slavs are people with richest history just you dont know it because you dont deserve to know
  conquers rome and greece  they live underneath a swamp breathing through straws to avoid getting killed i swear
  the sunni turkic qara khanid khanate conquered the scythian saka buddhist khotan kingdom forced them to convert to sunni islam forced them to turkify and become turks defecated on their buddhist statues and destroyed them and destroyed their scythian saka culture and identity now they are uyghur sunnis in khotan
    embarrassing
  slav  slaves of the world  slavs are slaves with the longest history of being slaves for others
  millions of their women get bred by germanics  who  wandili lugi rugi quadi suavi  you know slavs known under latin term germanae brothers
  yes you are
oh its this retard lmao
  slav low iq and fantasies on display for everyone to see
  they were never slaves kvens were q haplogroup
  embarrassing
  slavs were slaves of germanics who conquered eastern germany from them slavs were slaves of germanic rus who ruled all of them slavs were slaves of scythians who conquered so many of their tribes slavs were slaves of turkics and mongols who captured millions of them slavs were slaves of arabs who bought millions of slav women as sex slaves
  germanic rus  they were slavic rugians also known as ruthenians
    looks like massive cope to me
  i only made one of those posts but alright 
  slavs were slaves of scythians  alans were allies of wandals  because they both spoke slavic
  eos gentis esse sueonum  oh nonono
  rus were nordic varangians conquering and killing millions of slav subhumans and breeding their women
  where is the genetic evidence for it
  alan descendants are iranian ossetians vandals were germanics slaves were thralls and conquered by both groups
slav trying to derail the thread with his coordinate/etymology autism to hide the fact that they were btfod previously  embarrassing
  who were slavic wagrians and not swedes similarily swona from beowulf are slavic  they are sibini siwini in strabo among other slavic tribes zumi  ziemczyce boutones  bytyńcy etc  this name means people of ocean and was applied to nameless inhabitants of scandinavia
  alan descendants are iranian ossetians  nope real alans lived in ukraine fake caucasian late version doesnt matter
  were btfod previously    jordanes writes ermanaric btfos slavic spali  ermanaric after his victory have to evacuate to the farthest part of scythia
  youre overusing this word makes you look stupid
  who were slavic wagrians and not swedes  too bad during the middle ages when the annales bertiniani was written sueonum was used to refer to the swedes eg rex sueonum hericus eric the victorious
  its easier to just spam one word that quite nicely sums up my reaction to your posts
  scythian alan genetics and language survives in ossetians direct descendants no slavshits ever claimed to be descended from alans until larpers on the internet
  as i said caucasus has nothing to do with real alans
  as i said this slavic name was applied to swedes
  as i said slavshit larpers have nothing to do with scythians and their descendants in the caucasus
  just give up faggot
bump
  oh you mean ossetians that have nothing to do with scythians genetically
  sad
  turkic
  lol
  just like your life
  ancient greek sources continuously describe warrior women  it may be a meme but its certainly isnt a modern one
    how aboutscythians
privilege plays a huge role in our lives people have 9000 and 1 biases and every single one of those can make or break your relationships with others  so what if feminists did the theory first the got one thing right   and then it is more ironic that you people who deny privilege are the most bigoted of all which is exactly what privilege is all about
  its mostly murrican teenagers who live with their parents that think life is fair and all nonrich people are just lazy or dumb
also internationality theory is common sense it is just the idea that it is the intersection of all your privileges or lack of them that matters not any of them on their own this is meant to address the most common cirque of privilege  and yet some people seem to think it is some kind of conspiracy theory
ive found that the best way to explain ir is to compare it to nobility white europeans are the worlds noble class some have lost their fortunes and live like the plebs but still have their blue blood and dignity some minorities have built immense fortunes that no white person could dream of but despite their achievements are still not treated as one of us
    it takes living in a rich white suburb to have this retarded opinion    after the saudi royals or ccp elites really not accepted    no race matters a lot less globally even in big cities like new york what you say is not culturally true    its true for americas stolid rich suburb culture and thats about it
the only people who accuse others of being privileged are those of privilege themselves wellrounded critical thinkers understand that everyone suffers everyone has hurdles they need to overcome and these are undetectable to external observation
  this post  op is a faggot
  its true for americas stolid rich suburb culture and thats about it  even this isnt true some negroid sportsstar or obama type would be accepted into americas judeoanglo elite long before some white working to middleclass commoner who comes into surprise fortune would
  i accept my privilege as white because i know im superior and no matter how much nonwhites try they can never achieve what we have achieved
   race matters a lot less globally  wrong even in places like brazil different upper classes from different races are form and they live separate from one another
  i accept my privilege as white   tissac goldberg
  after the saudi royals or ccp elites really not accepted  of course not do you consider them one of us or do you threat them with suspicion for me its definitely the latter they impose themselves on western society because of their immense wealth but that is a different kind of relationship
  white privilege seems to be mainly an absence of racism which is fair enough but you stretch this out into convoluted allencompassing conspiracy theory to the point if some autistic guy doesnt make eye contact you assume it is because he is secretly racist or whatever    of course /pol/ disagrees for other reasons they just have a kneejerk reaction however not all your critics are /pol/ youre not right about everything and youre wrong about this the more you beat this dead horse the less reasonable people will take you seriously
i dont deny that priviledge exists and that i probably have lots of it but thats about it i wont give it up just because some other people are worse off than me ill keep it and make the best of it so i can give even more priviledge to my children making their lives a lot better than mine was at the start
  no race matters a lot less globally  lol be nonwhite and go to any country in europe and tell me race does not matter you speak like a clueless american and no wealth does not automatically eliminate racism
  shut up jew you are the most privileged bastards on this planet
  for me its definitely the latter   who the fuck are you
  its not even the concept of privilege that irritates me its obvious that power differentials are hardcoded into even the most egalitarian of societies what galls me about privilege theory as snarled about online is how even the smallest of disparities is cause for psychotic intrasite shitfits and the denial on a large part of slacktivists that what they really want is to seize the throne and to destroy those who ever kept it from them
  the problem is that on the one hand there is the academic theory that is 100 valid imho on the other hand there is the interpretation of the theory and the policy based on the theory that are less valid and in many cases unjust in their own right  but this thread is about the academic theory
    be white and go to africa or central asia and walk out alone without security and tell me white privilege advantages whites everywhere    privilege structures are contextual
privilege denialism is not much of a problem when you recognize its an opinion a belief and nothing more whats truly ugly and disturbing is the resentful will to diminish privilege and advantage in life   why make equal two things that were not even equal at conception wouldnt more extraordinary results occur if extraordinary circumstances were allowed to blossom rather than be hampered
  white people you do have privilege but thats a good thing accept my narrative goyim  t shlomo silverstein
people have ingroup bias this is true for every ethnicity and isnt limited to white people the reason so many nonwhites are negatively affected by white ingroup bias is because they voluntarily move to white countries
studies have shown that heightism and lookism are real in the sense that people who are ugly and short make less money even when controlling for education and intelligence and achievements other studies have shown that people are much more kind to you if you are handsome or rich worst of all ugly people are thought of as being evil whereas beautiful people are thought of as being benevolent  human brains are fucked
because the theory as applied is retarded    how do we know whites are privileged    because they earn more get shot by police less go to jail less and live longer than hispanics or blacks    ah so asians in the us earn almost as much more than whites than whites earn over hispanics get shot by police less and live longer so they have priv    no you dont understand intersectionality asians are poc which makes them moral and virtuous your lack of acceptance of this theory proves you have white fragility you are an evil pussy and must be forced to give your property to virtuous poc
  never said it wasnt contextual
  forget about race privilege theory is not just about race what about lookism and height should beautiful tall people be threated like royalty just because
  it doesnt matter what you think dumbass it matters what their class thinks the 1 accepts saudi and chinese nobility as their own because all those rats are the same
  did you forget that american colleges are artificially lowering the number of asians because they are overrepresented nobody says asians are unprivileged quite the opposite
  youve phrased the resentful will to diminish privilege and advantage deliberately to sound like a scary commie conspiracy to make everyone poor when its really the desire to elevate others to that same level of privilege you of course know this and are just arguing in bad faith
  the 1  are many people and many classes in itself im part of the 1 and i have met some rich saudis not princes and you dont know what youre talking about if you think wealth trumps everything if anything the kind of people i run with are more tribal than the middle class and working class
  privilege theory is not just about race what about lookism and height   privilege theory is never applied to lookism and height though
  when its really the desire to elevate others to that same level of privilege  raising everyone to the same level of privilege is the same thing as diminishing privilege dumbass  its a zerosum gain
  i still really dont know what people are talking about when they talk about privilege
  im part of the 1   sure you are
  they mean fuck whitey thats literally it
  that is where you are wrong you are confusing the academics with the buzzfeed maymeme there are many articles exploring all kinds of stupid human biases both heightism and lookism turn out to have a nonnegligible effect on our lives
  its has to do with prejudice and discrimination how people threat you based not on who you really are but on superficial aspects of your appearance or origins    for example tall people are seen as natural leaders so if you are tall everyone immediately assumes that you will be the leader of the group the most wise the most intelligent the most capable and the richest
dunno about you guys but this all sounds like a load of bullshit to me
  im part of the 1
  dont get me wrong i understand that some people are born with advantages over other people but i dont get why thats a problem most of the things people cite when they talk about privilege are things that most people arnt currently prevented from doing for instance whats wrong with parents trying to make a better life for thier children i think thats part of being a good parent you want your children to have all the advantages you can i feel this is the source of most privilege the problem in the us is that because of historical discrimination minority families have not yet built this wealth however nothing is currently preventing this so whats the problem
    so saying whites are the privileged group and no one else can enter in is retarded it isnt true in most of the world    indeed its only white nations that allow the mass migration of unskilled foreigners who are dependant on welfarw just to better their lives
  you are confusing the academics with the buzzfeed maymeme   there is no difference  some fringe academic that writes important papers about the shocking fact that deformed people are not treated in the same way as beautiful people is politically irrelevant    politics is what matters and it is the buzzfeed maymeme which drives politics
  so whats the problem  the problem is whitey has shit and they want it
  this is a resourcefinite world elevating those less fortunate will in turn require a sacrifice of resources from those who have as another anon pointed out its a zerosum game even the very concept of wealth and inequality is just a human interperation of material scarcity a fact of life
it exists and theres nothing wrong with it  its not my fault my parents gave me nice things and good opportunities and pushed me to succeed and it certainly isnt their parents fault for doing the same
  life isnt fair
  shut the fuck up minority
leave the internet and talk to other peo0le it has screwed your mind
itt the straw that broke the camels back
  didnt really break their back romans continued to exist and kicked germans ass multiple times after this the only thing this event does is further prove just how obnoxious germans are
  t varus
  after teutoburg germanicus went over there to wreck shit this is what op could have also meant germania would have been subjugated if tiberius hadnt recalled him because he was worried that germanicus was getting too popular
are you the anon who keeps posting that carrhae and teutoberg marked the end of the roman empire
  no but i strive to become just like him one day  spoilerand i honestly find this meme of his hilarious for some reason its like some autist who just learned about this two battles and have to shove it into all of his discussions somehow/spoiler
the french resistance did more harm than good   they gave the germans reasons to treat them worse and thus cementing the stereotype that right wing dictatorships cannot work  in return they achieved nothing not a thing what a waste
 pay the church of scientology 300000   become an operating thetan viii      profit    seriously though what kind of religion requires money if its about mindfulness then join a meditation group even former members have claimed that they were brainwashed by the church
scientology has like 15k members or some really low number everyone knows theyre a joke and a scam
    xenu disapproves
  ever heard of chicken soup for the soul there was this one story where one gave his account of what hell was i was told that a group of rusoamericans or norwegian americans began buying boats and etc by pool just so they could fish but in reality they built underwater bunkers where they held prisoners some submarines saw them and began shooting at them in alaska they saw people asleep with sound systems when they further investigated it the people were americans and the sound system was a recording telling them how ugly they are how stupid they are how they are sins because they are mixed they realized the holding cells were owned by russo american groups not asian americans but russo american expanisionists scientology sprang from there i met a relative of hubbard whom worked for the fbi supposedly he couldnt stop laughing at the fact since they fooled everyone vía bought news sites commercial slots and religion they couldnt believe they could buy anything not even a time slot on tv
  its a tax evasion scam you dumbfuck  be hollywood celeb  make 20m in one year  subject to 53 tax in highest bracket  donate 10m to church of scientology tax free  church of scientology offshores the money  gives you back 9m  church keeps 1m  you saved 4m that would have gone to taxes
  so was that disclaimer true do they actually believe this nonsense
  apparently
  the situation goes is that they killed the real ron hubbard for marketing to minorities so theyve been trying to replicate nerve signals with the bit of collected information they have they did they same thing to donald trump there are two donald trumps one was not a real estate mogul but supposedly worked with the disney group trying to buy and sell land the other was a russian new yorker that realized they could be made fun of and sooner than later theyd be thought of as the legit ones they killed william cooper because he supposedly had a people smuggling route in the desert he didnt trust the white folk one bit he saw that they were killing themselves for rogue norwegian propagandists whom come from lands with the no laws or civility
  you think they are operating the old cubanseychilles network supposedly the situation in cuban and now dominican republic was for wealthy to move to islands in africa in exchange the africans get some land africa offered wealth protection and security not to everyone of course because mirth africans got kicked out but they spent the latter half of last century until now marketing islands off southeast africa
  its a big social problem most countries have guerilla groups we have gangs what was discovered was the crip was the guerilla squad of the blood family so one plays down the other especially when several rappers come from blood families and sponsored by crip they have been eating off of the entire congo war scenario which caused latin kings to split as one side was playing double alongside the congolese and in turn the congolese warlords were settling in the us acting like they did nothing to north africa meanwhile all the latin king affected by the warlords boycotted nothing different than the norteño smuggling semitic peoples people who have a set up network of likenesses after the insurgency of el salvador where the priest were bringing in asians the norteño groups realize they could also use siberians play them off as hispanics
  dying ethics using instruments on the living
  yes
  youre only told it by the church when youre already like 300k in so if youve made it that far you probably arent going to question it
  heres the thing one of the greatest sins in the eyes of the church is to question or doubt anything l ron has said/claimed heres some of his most outlandish ones      if you try to leave the church you get labelled something i forget the name but it basically means like a subversive person and in the process of all those sessions with them they got you to tell them your darkest secrets so they have a whole portfolio of your dirty laundry and they will use it to ruin you if you turn on them
    wut
  yes even the alien spacecraft looking like airplanes is on tape being said by lr himself
why didnt you listen

were nearing the 2020 mark and im left wondering what happened what defining moments will set us apart from the 20002010 period im halfway my 20s and i feel like this decade hasnt quite set itself apart from its predecessor we had big data the internet rock disco and hippies the decades before us i have no idea how to define these 10 years in one word the march of globalism mass immigration to the west gender progression the up and coming far east space exploration and the progression of big data are current themes yet hardly unique to this decade correct me if im wrong but these 8 years have brought us naught but the same or give me one term they will refer us to in 20 years
  isis syria and ukraine are the main incidents i can think regarding the western military surely the saudis have been giving it to yemen but thats just more of the same then theres turkey and its internal struggle and their continued genocide of the kurds again nothing new venezuela has its crisis brazil had their riots france and belgium suffer minor riots too greece has silently been recovering from the 2008 consequences all in all more of the same
    this question breaks the rules but its surely better than the thread asking is it moral to let another man fuck your wife by any means    i believe that from 2008 onward all of western civilization began to transition from modernity to a postmodern society as a whole    the march of globalism mass immigration to the west gender progression the up and coming far east space exploration and the progression of big data are current themes    essentially the waning influence of the us as a global super power and loss of hegemony     failed us intervention in the middle east and n africa  the decline of american manufacturing and rise of tertiary services the us doesnt make anything anymore  stagnant wages and rise of surrogate consumption netflix amazon etc and no incentive to save  increasing deficits for some reason us treasury notes/bonds are still worth something  the rise of actors like russia iran and china in other places around the world  the postcold war europe and sudden rise in national sovereignty europe doesnt feel unified anymore  the refugee crisis  disintegration of financial institutions in the european union  imf and world banks influence is indirect as opposed to direct chinese influence in places like africa and south america chinese building infrastructure in those places but also taking control of resources in those places  the decline in the western humanities  the rise in russian propaganda which infiltrates western leftist ideology all over the globe a consequence of the decline in the western humanities  the false hope of big data being the solution to all our problems when its really the next bubble similar to that of the tech bubble burst in the early 2000s as the last hope for capitalism  young people care more about capitalist institutions as a whole as opposed to democratic institutions  young people now recognize status and class as a mark of their identity  end of pax americana
  the 90s and 00s started stacking more and more shit on top of each other and this decade is the year the first cracks appeared arab spring ukraine syria global nationalist revival the outright death of subcultures in the west for the first time since the 40s thanks to the internet and zoomers and the refugee invasion
  the 20s are gonna be a wilde ride trust me we are living in a long preparation era from a catastrophic event in waiting for another just like the 99 years between 1815 and 1914 the only difference from victorian era is just than their golden phase was just before the end our was right at the beginning
  every year will be worse from the last
  american soft power decline if trump wins a second election
  fortnite isis end of us hegemony and rise of populism against the dying neoliberal order
  europe doesnt feel unified anymore  quite the opposite europeans are united against the usa and russia now what changed is that the us is regarded as an enemy by many europeans and they despise it more than any other country in the world    if the usa disappeared tomorrow the eu would dissolve within the decade but thats not gonna happen
  what happened in the 1940s to kill subcultures
eu is much more integrated than it was in the early 00s and eu and us are diverging i think this is pivotal because we might see again a situation where the west is not united
nobody has yet mentioned that liberalism is losing ground libertarianism disappeared entirely from the public debate nobody takes market fundamentalism seriously anymore regarding social issues both the right and the left have quarrels with liberal ideology people question whether there should be freedom of speech etc
i wouldnt say we have progressed but definitely moved sideways i would say regressed but i know better in some ways the worldview has positively advanced such as humanities awareness of their impact and inputs into change you could look at things like occupy wallst etc people are more consciously aware of issues and matters in other ways though its declined the same people as they come aware also realise there is nothing to be done about it but continue on
  really sad desu i think both sides of the atlantic have their ups and downs the us could learn some stuff from the eu environmentalism reform voting system and healthcare and the eu could learn from the us actual free speech not making ridiculous regulations that just create headaches for the rest of the world integrating immigrants better
  jews
  i can only hope we kick off the 100th anniversary of wwii starting with more nazis
  actual free speech  speaking for west europe i think free speech is fine media is predominantly leftist but the rightwinged messages arent surpressed just regard the rise of the rightpopulism in france the netherlands and austria to name a few i do agree that mainstream media always have a pull but that is regional and goes just as well for the us     for example last week ive been watching the news regarding the un migration pact or marrakech pact and things were reported fairly twosided
  a new radical and authoritarian strain of progressivism has left the universities and is now hitting the mainstream infecting every aspect of our culture    westerners are becoming aware of both this and the effects of mass immigration populist nationalism is slowly on the rise trust in institutions like the academia and the media is getting lower    bipartisanship is breaking down in the us democrats and republicans are getting increasingly hostile to each other political clashes on the streets    disillusionment about the future is growing people are increasingly alienated and depressed things like student debt and housing prices make life hard for millenials    there is a stagnation in western culture look at movies or video games more and more lazy cashgrabs less and less original ideas    social media now rules human interactions people isolate themselves in echochambers or form online mobs for harassment    or give me one term they will refer us to in 20 years    the present always judges the past through its own lenses we dont know how the world will look like in 20 years therefore we dont know how they will see our decade
  i honestly tried to fit it in /his/ if you wish help me keep this non/pol/ and report the cunts who shitpost jews    failed us intervention in the middle east and n africa  russia definitely had the drop on middle eastern events lately the us still had some carriers in the meditereanan though and several eu members have been giving support in syria/algeria    the postcold war europe and sudden rise in national sovereignty  i think the national sovereignty is still a good thing i think it would be very sad if all involved countries would be mindless pieces of a whole without its own identity
  the decline of american manufacturing and rise of tertiary services the us doesnt make anything anymore  the manufacturing sector in the us is as strong as ever what changed is the amount of employees required to produce that output because of automation many jobs were lost in the manufacturing sector but economically speaking it keeps growing
   there is a stagnation in western culture look at movies or video games more and more lazy cashgrabs less and less original ideas  this has always been the case youre just too young and quite possibly too retarded to realize it
  how many good movies can you list from the past two years
  not that guy but dude are you for real
  the arab spring was a long time coming power vacuums after western influences combined with oppertunistic local aristocracy just be glad westeners didnt get more involved korea/vietnam style      against the usa  could you elaborate on that the netherlands shivers at the thought of losing the us as a trade partner       lets keep it ontopic anon wasnt saying there werent cheap remakes he was saying this trend has been going on for a longer time    get out     
  i think he means youth subcultures they really evolved in the west due to the post war prosperity trickling down and giving the youth more free time and money now with the internet changing the social dynamics theyve gone away again
  could you elaborate on that the netherlands shivers at the thought of losing the us as a trade partner  culturally european millenials have been raised in a very anti us view and hold very anti usa views these are iraq war 2003 kids who now see the usa as being the embodiment of le ebil white racist capitalism add the fact that decades of us is best has led to them going to the other extreme and insisting that aktschually usa is worst than niger in development and hitler in morality to show off how w0ke they are and totally not subject to propaganda from the man    albeit the us has earned this dislike in certain departments lack of universal healthcare shitty prison system stagnant education high gini index etc these are legitimate complaints to be made but millenial europeans see this as proof of american right wing ideology being inherently inferior and against superior european enlightenment western europeans view americans as barely civilized barbarians these days and insist that a federal eu superpower would he a more benevolent and enlightened countryb
  there had already been turbulence in the 90s with the power vacuum left by the collapse of the soviet union  other places in the world were also experiencing conflict and turmoil    the what happened in the me was the long expected outcome of the bush era intervention
  i think sub cultures still appear to be around though with all the different musical genres and fashion trends along with the political polarization
    traditional media had appeared to be dying although now appear to be trying to restructure theirselves to the current ageno telling if it will ultimately be a success though meanwhile user created content has grown
  bipartisanship is breaking down in the us democrats and republicans are getting increasingly hostile to each other   why do you tell lies on the internets democrats and republicans literally agree on the same shit when it comes to protecting us national interests meme shit like gays abortions and etc are for dumb folks
  lets not forget that the rise of isis and lone wolf terrorist attacks which europe is the primary victim of can be strongly linked to the frankly retarded decision to invade iraq in 2003 which i think gives europeans a very legitimate grievance against the us authorities when a generation of millennials have grown up in a climate when the next truck attack is just a few months away and the resulting antiislamic sentiment is threatening to undo enlightenment values its easy to see why europeans would be peeved
  nothing the fall of the soviet union was the scouring of the shire of the 19th century history should have ended after year 2000
  i think free speech is fine  you can get fined in france for criticizing islamic ritual slaughter since according to the government its considered as ethnic hatred towards muslims theres this insane proanimal woman forgot the name who got fined like five times doing just that
  the fall of the soviet union   19th century
  considering my personal experience youre way off the mark concerning the antius sentiments i know in poland people cling to the us for their nato support against putin bonds have only tightened remember that large trade agreement start of this year iraq and afghanistan were mishaps but eu is still more americaminded than prorussia or anything else
are you fucking kidding me the 2010s were more eventful than the 2000s how is trump and the internets increasing domination of politics not a turning point    maybe the early 2010s obama years were kind of a lull
this decade was defined by populism id say the struggle of populism vs elitism
  those years will be remembered as unjust wars of american aggression that fucked the middle east and the world also the rise of sjws also thanks to americans i guess america fucking up the world is a good description for 20002020 period
  what happened  too early to tell
  the election of trump will go down in history as one of the major geopolitical shifts in the west on par with the election of hitler or the fall of the soviet union
the world became more digitalized the internet was primitive dial up in the 90s and first few years of the 2000s the mid and late 2000s were the infancy of web 20 so many people werent fully integrated into it yet the iphone came out in like mid late 2007 and still had some kinks to work out early     by the 2010s everyone and their dog had an iphone user driven platforms like youtube twitter facebook instagram snapchat reddit tumblr spoiler4chan/spoiler etc became the dominant forces of communication and began overtaking traditional media sources high speed internet and mobile networks everywhere allow for people to access more information at greater speeds and in more places information isnt as monopolized by a few corporate big media conglomerates driven by a profit agenda however this lack of restraint and regulation on crowdsourced information a good thing ultimately does lead to some misleading or fringe ideas to gain traction and insular echo chambers to form     ultimately though free flow of information and freedom of discussion is necessary to best educate the population and the internet is a tool that depends on the person using it we should not hold peoples hands and let the state or some corporation decide what we can and cannot see people should instead develop critical thinking skills and discern truth/knowledge on their own its a very powerful liberating tool for humanity that has led to a dramatic change in our world for good and for bad the good outweighs the bad though and we must fight for this wonderful technology and protect it from vultures who want to destroy or censor it
  is just another puppet like obama and bush  major shift  lmao
  but he triggers le cucks
  trump is an unqualified antiglobalist demagogue who only got into power by promising shit no other candidate ever would a massive wall banning muslims entering the country jailing political opponents softening ties with russia which has helped a resurgence in rightwing movements in other countries look at poland hungary and brazil for instance he might still be a puppet but hes a puppet with a more explicitly nativist and militarist agenda
the smartphone desu
  i think that this is the best way of looking at it   concisely we went from a depressed nihilism of nothing matters bro to a hedonistic nihilism of nothing matters bro
  id say stagnation but that was happening in the 00s and even before that to some extent the continued growth of china as a world power those are the immediate i think    i think in the future looking back on this era i think the worrisome growth of big data will be a point of interest the dangers of global warming continuing to be neglected i think capitalism is slowly coming to a head either we slip back into a system of feudalism or embrace socialism capitalism is dying not really because of class consciousness but because were running out of fuel to drive consumerism name 1 sweeping consumer technology to actually make waves since the invention of the smartphone thats not to say new inventions wont be created but well probably be stagnant for a while until we get better neurotechnology and better ai you can just kind of tell how weve run out of ideas by forcing smart technology down consumer throats need to sell more tvs fridges lightswitches ac units shove a smart device/computer in it
    whose puppet
  trap music opioid addiction hipster and streetwear fashion mass surveillance the syrian civil war and migration crises
  capitalism is dying  its not consumerism isnt a synonym for capitalism
  you know the (((answer)))
  they fucked it up because they created it its only destruction can come from within
  american soft power decline has been going on since at least 2007 if not earlier
  capitalism is dying  lol its more powerful than its ever been
  its not consumerism isnt a synonym for capitalism  i never said it was but im not sure how capitalism with heavily reduced consumption brought on by the fact that devices like smartphones have consolidated a whole slew of previous devices and digital entertainment is cheap as fuck    im an oldfag and i remember when bigbox stores like best buy would be packed with people buying the latest dumbshit or whatever now i have no idea why these stores exists other than to sell tvs and phones
   democrats and republicans literally agree on the same shit when it comes to protecting us national interests  like protecting the border
  lol its more powerful than its ever been  sure jeff bezos makes 9 million an hour but thats not a healthy capitalist system thats just slipping back into oligarchy if not feudalism    at some point we just accept the bezos and zuccs as our new lords or we guillotine them its either one or the other as far as i see it maybe take a while to get there but itll happen
  capitalism isnt everybody is succussful and equal its its own entity with its own measure of succuss not attached to the well being of its tools if you seriously think a small group of people holding wealth is synonymous with feudalism than you really need to expand your perspectivesand actually study feudalism capitalism is working exactly as intended the small blip of workers rights and middle class growth of the 20th century is the exception not the rule merely a hold over from a previous era as humans slowly adapt into a new course
the 2020s will be full of war
   capitalism is working exactly as intended  then we should fucking end it
  usa is worst than niger in development and hitler in morality  nothing wrong with that statement even cuba is better place to live despite half century of us sanctions
  arab spring resurgent russa death of the west as the sole superpower
  i think the death of the west as the sole superpower happened awhile ago with the rise of the ussr and later the rise of china i think what were seeing is the fracturing of the wests power its no longer the us and europe acting together as they are becoming more and more separate entities
    reading comprehension
    take your pissweak teenage cheguevaraprinttshirt /pol/shit elsewhere
  death of the west as the sole superpower  decline usa is still the only superpower there is no one else can realistically think of occupying random countries across the globe
  25 years or older nigger can you not do math
  chinas not as powerful as ussr was its mostly due to its heavy dependence on america
  im not trying to say its as powerful as the ussr just that china has become a superpower i also wouldnt say that china has just made itself the uss bitch either while certainly depending on the us china had some tricks up its sleeve to make the us depend on it as well giving it more freedom to exert power in ways the us might not agree with
slow return to multipolar world evolution of internet rise of authoritharianism and mass surveillance populism wars in syria and yemen isis and islamic radicalism exhausting itself decline of american power rise of china resurgence of russia crisis of international institutions and euplenty of shit my dude less happened in 00s though i was still a child then so perhaps my perspective is flawed

  blade runner 2049  dunkirk
  2049  good    pick one      in all honesty i see the 2010s as the continuation of long term negative trends established during the 2000s like the great recession hollowing out of the middle class expansion and reliance on us military power and mass surveilance of citizens shit might reach a boiling point in the 20s but i dont see the 10s as standing out on their own
  im just excited to live in a 20s sound more historical hopefully its as chaotic and fun as the last one we all know that crash coming in the future this time around though and this crash is going to be even worse
  the early 2010s had the arab spring greek crisis antiausterity protests in europe and the beginning of the catalonian crisis
  t /tv/poster
im seeing a lot of the waning dominance of the us or the west in general i think were generally agreed on that     what do people think of the new trend of legislation of the internet a western example would be the recent article 13 in the east there are examples of heavy cencus like in china and iran
  what do people think of the new trend of legislation of the internet  it was obvious that it will come theres a lot of profit escaping through the internet
  word gucci gang
  2000s the rise of progressivism  2010s the rise of conservativism
  thesis  antithesis  so in 2020 we are going to see synthesis or rise of people who dont care about these western issues
  iraq was a multilateral war not a us war over a dozen european nations chose to invade iraq along with the us
  wait do you mean the gulf war the uskurdish insurgency war the 98 invasion or the 2003 invasion
ive always had an interest in the role european alchemy played in the history of science but have always had trouble digging through the stupid new age stuff and the actual historical alchemy     anyone have any good sources on this subject specifically academic monographs or journal articles from a historical perspective
  firsthand sources are a pain in the ass because theyre written in latin and in books locked away in private archives     but i can tell you that what separates gold from lead is one single electron so it is theoretically possible to turn gold into lead
  secondary sources are what im more interested in anyway though as i said its difficult to find any reliable academic material on the subject
  theoretically possible    using nuclear fusion technology not alchemy/chemistry if you actually turned a significant portion of lead into gold you would instantly nuke yourself
tell me about what you were doing during the 9/11 attacks anon  you are old enough to remember 9/11 right

i was at school when it happened and we all got to go home for the day based terrorists    also i thought it was an accident
i was at home i was feeling sick so mom let me stay and i took the opportunity to wake up as early as i normally did to watch some cartoons i remember feeling angry and disappointed that all of the channels were covering a building on fire and none had cartoons showing i didnt have cable at the time    then the second plane hit and i knew that some weird shit was going down and went to wake up my mom and tell her i dont remember this part but she told me that when i did go to wake her up i told her that a plane had crashed into the empire state building     i was 8 at the time
  you just wanted to post that picture didnt you
  also i was 4
  i was 7 years old and was sitting in front of the tv watching saint seiya when suddenly they stopped the show and the news started playing talking about a terrorist attack my mom was making me letter soup so i watched the planes hit the tower while trying to eat all the letters from my name  10/10
  the guy who keeps posting this negroid mouthed blonde is a brazillian chimp    fuck off nigger
  that explains why (((they))) post trap and cuck threads on all boards 24/7
americans believed that planes hitting a building causes this  lol
  weight your exposures associate meaning to your own valuements program yourself directional being free of undue influence and choose decisions that give you a good life in health and truth do stuff thats good for you
  i was 8 and remember my dad saying holy shit from the kitchen and holding open the two page spread on the attacks with a giant fireball on the front page  ps mossad and part of the cia did 9/11 using a group of al qaeda people probably without bin ladens knowledge  they also may have used us ramp crews to smuggle weapons on board
i was waiting to go on a field trip to the bronx zoo ama
  im 23 and i remember it you fucking pleb
a pizza place opened nearby so i ate a free pizza   saw it on tv didnt give a fuck so i went to play soldier of fortune   later i fapped      whats the sauce for this pic i keep seeing it posted all the time
i was sitting in my 2nd grade classroom  i lived in mexico but went to school across the border in texas  i heard the administrators call all of the mexican kids to the office    it was all of our parents picking us up for fear of the border closing down completely    i just watched the news at home while my dad was explaining it to me
  i was in school in 5th grade another teacher came in and turned on our tv we didnt do much of anything the rest of the day just watched the news    i remember walking home from school that day was really spooky i live right under a main route to a nearby airport so every day id see 35 planes while walking home on 9/11 they grounded every flight so the walk home was totally silent and the sky was empty
  the towers didnt collapse  they turned to dust mid air
i guess im an old fuck too i heard it on the radio on the way to work it was a weird drive home the traffic was better than ever and everyone on the road was polite and understanding to each other it stayed that way for a few days i think it permanentlyish improved relations between common people still to this day among those who were old enough at the time
it feels weird how you spoke to some people for the last time on that day
  you have to go back
  it was an old guy running over his kids video games its an old internet meme
  how can you run over video games theyre all just on the console
  thats crazy i can barely watch documentaries about it without tearing up but im old enough to remember it    i guess you feel like i do about pearl harbor or jfks assassination
  uhhhh no youre just gay
  too lazy to greentext but i was in middle school in reading class it was around 915am when news started getting around we could see through the doors glass window teachers/admins were frantically walking by word got around fast so we asked to turn on the tv the temporary reading teacher we had assigned wore a head scarf and was an immigrant she tried to keep us from watching it but eventually relented i didnt put two and two together until years later but she was definitely uncomfortable in letting kids watch it im not sure if she was worried about the islam connection to her or not i distinctly remember hearing the name bin laden and thinking it was a british guy for some reason with first name ben     the administrators at this point had made an announcement over the intercom stating that there had been an attack in nyc class schedules would be maintained but there would be no outside activities for most of the day tvs were on in all class rooms and little was taught when i changed classes i remember seeing my science teacher in the hall on her phone bawling she was a transplant either from ny or jersey i cant remember but i do remember she couldnt reach any of her friends in the city my english teacher was with her comforting her and asked us to go inside the class and sit down  it was in english class where we saw the south tower fall my teacher was too shocked to reassure us she tried to turn off the tv and get us to do work but gave up    i saw science teacher later that day as my mom picked me up and she was on her phone then too outside her class room     at lunch i saw a friend of mine crying and talking to two administrators his father was on a business trip and was in one of the towers during the attack i dont remember if he was hurt or not around 11am parents started coming to pick up their kids
  my mom came and picked me up at 1pm and besides the radio on in the car there was nothing but silence in the car my mom told me not to worry     even as a kid i picked up on the confused state of that day that sad morose feeling the disgusted bitterness the excitement and hectic energy all around    when i got home my father was there he seemed resigned but i could tell he was also angry he was helpless and scared he said this something along the lines of this will mean war i do remember that after that i dont remember but i probably spent the rest of the day playing cs 16
im 23 and i have some memories of the news talking about it and my mom being all worried  i dont remember exactly what i was doing when it happened though
  huh i dont remember that one
  i ran into my parents bedroom to see both of then screaming and then watched the second plane hit live
  eating pussy
  i was at disney land magic kingdom on holiday and we got evacuated
  god i fucking love zoomers girls im so glad 2000 was 18 years ago
  i find young girls attractive  congratulations youre a male
  no young girls from any year before 2008 look like fucking goblins legal zoomers are the sexiest barelylegals in history
  whats the matter not into scene girls
i was in school didnt find out what happened until i got home    my m8s teacher turned the news on after the first plane struck and the entire class of 12 year olds watched the second plane strike live
  i remember the teachers decided to turn on the tvs to watch it even though we lived in northern jersey and lots of kids had parents who worked in new york so predictably a lot of kids started crying and going nuts thinking their parents died
  shit i forgot about those little sluts
  when dyed hair didnt come with a rape accusation
  why is nyc so damn ugly holy shit its like a growing cancer on good land
  modern architecture more than anything
  flying a plane into a building
  im a us citizen was born in the us just raised on mexico since parents worked there
  ok pablo
  damn a blast from the past
  a fake youtube series about a family in which the father is constantly mad at his under preforming quickly to be enraged and lecherous son jessie who streams video games as a job which upsets and confuses his normal father who considers this to not be a real job  watch as hijinks ensue all recorded by jessies brother conveniently
i was 10 but also outside of the us so nobody cared and i have nothing to remember
  was 7 and i was pissed because they interupted zoboomafoo for special coverage of the towers
i was in 8th grade    they didnt tell us a teacher burst out crying in one class but i went to a ghetto school so that happened    late in the day they had a moment of silence for the terrible tragedies in new york and washington and that teacher started crying and said we were attacked    for like 3 minutes before she got out the story i thought chang or ivan nuked us kind of fucked up because my extended family was all in nyc and washington    did have an aunt in a tower but she was on a low floor and got out    the days after were crazy we had a giant rally and people flooded the big intersection near us during the candle light vigil and chanted usa usa usa    my sjw social studies teacher got all upset when kabul got shelled the next day and talked about it not realizing this was just part of the ongoing civil war taliban never came close to controlling all of afghanistan we put a kill them all and let allah sort them out bumper sticker on her door    kosovo was crazier because my fifth grade teacher sat us down like wed be upset because a war was on its the ghetto though so no one even knew so then big ben this fat black kid who had a pimp walk from age 8 asked if kosovo was in africa like there would be problems if it was everyone leaves in to get upset class is like 60 black 20 hispanic its me white and one vitenamese kid    no its europe    aw snap we gonna mess them up why kosovo talkin smack    everyone cheers the war
    if im 29 and remember it then theres no way in hell that you two lying sack of shits remember it
  the girl is super hot
  about 8pm when i checked the news while i ate i saw it and went huh  then i went back to playing cs again
  i was in kindergarten
  you must be 18 to post here
it was an odd feeling when i realized im probably going to marry a girl that doesnt remember 9/11 having been born in 95

  i was playing asherons call and the world supervisor came on and said we dont like to interrupt your ac experience but you might want to turn on your tv
  i was an inner city ingrate kid that got sent home early where i spent my time playing game boy while the news blared 9/11 news nonstop i really didnt give a shit because i was only in the third grade and had no family or loved ones in nyc to worry about
  i had family in the army and i lived 30 mins away you could legit see the skyline from certain places walking distance from my home in the nj suburbs
i remember it well  be me  at church of england school aged 7  day of 9/11 attacks  teachers come in and say there has been an attack and we should hold a minutes silence  everyone complies myself included  everyone puts their heads down on the table for some reason when we do this  i for whatever reason put my hands together as if im praying  teacher spots me  goes ballistic at me for being disrespectful and makes the whole class start over  to this day im not sure what i did wrong
  t born november 14th 2000  jesus christ there are people here who are younger than me
  ahahahaha someone bombed america holy shit eat shit seppos  fucking australians save your ass from the nips in ww2 and you bastards give us this shit baka still love aussies
one of my first memories is watching dubaya give his speech with the firemen at ground zero  
  thats a really gay first memory mine is crashing my tricycle down the stairs
  i was a 6 yo french kid  i was at my grandparents watching the kids channel when my grandma who had been listening to the radio barged in switched channels and i saw the plane crash my grandfather who always liked america as he had worked at a local us base after ww2 was furious later in the afternoon the tv showed people in afghanistan and iran celebrating on the streets i remember being outraged that people could celebrate the death of thousands and made a vengeful drawing of turbanclad brown people getting bombed    i was also pretty shocked that the us which cartoons and movies always showed as invincible could be so badly hurt lastly this destroyed the common worldview which was teached in school at the time that history was over and there would be no more conflicts next day in class the teacher had us actually talk about it and told us that this event changed everything
  people in afghanistan and iran celebrating on the streets  do you have a single fact to back that up otherwise yore a lying brainlet
  i was 14 i got home from school and it was all over the news then i turned on my ps2 and played fifa with my friend
  ah yes i remember it like it was yesterday came back home from school turned on tv and saw americans jumping off wtc and killing themselves i immediately ran to kitchen and with a huge smile on my face told my mom that at last americans got what they deserved
  look up tf1s journal de 20 heures of september 11th 2001 i remember it quite vividly so does my mom my grandparents and a few friends of mine
  22 in in weeks    didnt remember 9/11 because one it was my sister bday    and the biggest revelation to us on that day was that our uncle got married to a muslim women in miami without us knowing for a year     which was bad because my family was hindu
  22 in 3 weeks
  it does not show that anywhere ive only seen some tajik warning of attacks months before it happened and asking for help against terrorists you are clearly lying
i was in middle school we were in history class when the teacher told us remember after school walking home with a couple friends and telling them that i dont know if it was him or not but remember the name osama bin laden because he was gonna take the blame i had seen a documentary about him some time before and instantly thought of him i still remind my friends on how on point my prediction was
  did some digging looks like international tv relayed this fox news report that supposedly showed people in gaza celebrating 9/11    
  im 22 and remember waking up and watching the cnn coverage from after plane 1 hit but before plane 2 hit i also remember going to the top of the wtc the summer before
  thats the infamous 30second lying clip though at no point is anything about 9/11 mentioned it was shot before 9/11 happened
  not sure whos more idiotic the zoomer trying to stop the 30 y/o boomer or the 30 y/o boomer wasting his own money
 t italian   be 12 yo me   in my house with my parents and other relatives watching tv   news flash its 9/11   relatives kinda panic and run downstairs to my uncles apartment    12 yo see a chance   not follow the rest of the family downstairs    immediately change channel on some old pay tv porn channel running ads   procede to masturbate   one of my first jerk off was after hearing about 9/11   mfw i will forever associate 9/11 with that
    i was at the primary school this day i was 9 i remember perfectly this day it was a very bright day the sky was blue with some lowdensity cloud     i remember being completely conscious and thinking about the future then i returned to home put on the tv and see the exact same building in fire everywhere
  same
i was born in march of 2000 so i was only 1  earliest political events i remember were obamas presidency and the recession
  im one or two years behind you but i dont recall kosovo being mentioned at school once kind of weird now that i think about it    i do remember my 3rd grade teacher let us watch operation desert fox footage on the news in 98 she was a tough love kinda gal but felt it was important for us to see history in the making well it took about 2 minutes for some girl in my class to start crying about how we were at war teacher had to turn off the footage explain that it wasnt a war that would reach home
  i was most likely asleep at that time then woke up in the morning to watch it being televized
i was 5 and had just built a towering marble run near the tv i remember simulating the attack with a toy plane and my dad telling me off
we didnt have a tv back then so i only found out a day later through an article in the newspaper didnt think much of it
  i remember being outraged that people could celebrate the death of thousands and made a vengeful drawing of turbanclad brown people getting bombed  based 6 yo french kid
  tfw being old enough to remember the 2000 election
  i was most likely asleep at that time then woke up in the morning to watch it being televized    not being at school    underage
  he doesnt remember these videos
  why do old people have no sense of how many years ago something happened if you were born in 1998 1999 or 2000 you would not be underage
freshman in highschool in new jersey  happened during gym class  come inside after class is over and find out about it  next class is just spent watching the tv  luckily nobody close to me worked in the city at that time but there were plenty of people at my school who did have family and friends who did    cant really remember how fast we learned what had actually happened but i very distinctly remember all the seniors at school talking about enlisting to go get revenge
  taylor ham or pork roll
  ron paul /b/
i was in a kindergarden in my shithole we were super excited about it like the building was thiiiiiiiiiiiiiis tall
  than after i though that it was a horrible horrible tragedy for a long time up until 10s
  but then i understood that mutts deserved way more than just two shitty towers collapsing and some miserable 3k dead

  you will never get to see americans getting microwaved before your very eyes again
  jokes on you we completely destroyed two of your countries in response
  do you count one of those countries as your own
  nah the jews destroyed this place decades before 9/11
  you mean you destroyed a country which was against al qaeda allowing terrorists to thrive in the region  yeah im sure those meanie terrorists are so angry with you for that
  still fucked up the arab world
  what happened to the must be at least 25 years ago to count as history rule
  and al qaeda thanks you for that   
  yesterday is history
daily reminder osama bin laden was a trained cia nigger
  15 years  just over 20 people dead  amateurs
  yes which is why i asked about the must be at least 25 years ago to count as history rule and not about history in general    for the purpose of determining what is history please do not start threads about events taking place less than 25 years ago
  nobody cares nerd
  gonna need some pics lad

  how do you delete posts
  heard about it from one of my mates in school whole teaching staff was running around trying to hide how confused and scared they were we noticed we were 12 not complete morons a lot of us didnt know what a world trade center was a mall    then i got home and saw it on the news and i dont think i could process it at first id seen loads of pictures of the place my uncle had been there when he was younger and he was always a weirdly big fan of the towers so id been told about how ridiculously huge they were    its really something to see those towers come tumbling down like that when your mind cant even handle the scale of what just fucking happened
  imagine being old enough to remember 9/11

  be iranian family living in australia  mum wakes me up on the morning twin towers have collapsed someone flew planes into them  go to the living room mum and dad are watching tv  watching some american news tv show  tv heads discuss who could be responsible one of them says maybe it was saddam hussein  dad loudly says no this looks like the work of osama bin laden  dad drives me to school hes very solemn and serious  days later its confirmed its bin laden  im the token middle easterner at a white school kids all asking me whats my deal and whyd my people do this  shrug my shoulders wondering the same thing   dad explains we are iranians and enemies with everyone involved the americans bin laden the arabs the guy saddam they had been talking about on tv  shrug my shoulders again
  almost 5 years old   walk down stairs to talk to dad while he works out and to ask whats for breakfast   hes sitting on the couch crying   the only time ive seen him cry at this point was when my mom got cancer for the third time   look at tv and see the second tower get hit   ask what movie hes watching   its not a movie people hijacked planes and flew them into the twin towers   we sat in silence and just watched things unfold for about an hour before going to get some breakfast   dad bought that week first time he had ever owned one
  playing with my lego in the living room when my mom turned on the tv and was really shocked i knew it was bad due to that but not that i really knew why  the most interesting was that at the time i knew that the news would report on the stuff that happened that day/week in the world but i was a bit annoyed about seeing 9/11 weeks on end because i thought everyone should know that by then and thus it wasnt really news anymore
  my 1yo memories are quite vivid
    they all look the fucking same
  being a zoomer  what is it like knowing youll grow up a slave
its kinda funny because i dont remember anything about 9/11 im 21 but i remember all the news reports when the russian sub kursk sank   to this day i still fucking hate submarines and dont even like going out on open water in a   cruise ship
    i slept through it because i was living in another country at the time
i was in 2nd grade we got let hone early the next day the teachers freaked out as they didnt see my mom pick me up but someone else family friend    anyway me and my cousin 2 years younger player various old mortal kombat games where they used real people and tekken 2 i think maybe mk trilogy was out but it was a good day didnt even know about it until 2007 because drama teacher lost her hubby that day and made a big deal
  it unironically does yes human brains are malleable
  dad explains we are iranians and enemies with everyone involved the americans bin laden the arabs the guy saddam they had been talking about on tv  based
  it was beautiful
  germany  was in 3rd grade and pretty hyped when i came home and my mom watched it in tv i remember we talked about in school next day
  i also remember watching the bombardment of bagdad live on cnn
  i read big ben with fat alfreds voice
  ur gay lol
  i had gotten fired from my job the friday before several days later on 9/11 i was leaving home to go a job fair at a hotel i decided to go back into the house to print up several additional resumes and turned on the tv while doing so it was then i first saw that the towers had been knocked down i went to the job fair and it was weird driving past the mall of america and seeing its huge parking lot empty they had closed the mall just in case   i didnt have cable tv or internet at the time so for me the worst part of 911 was the aftermath of having to watch nonstop 911 crap on the tv networks for weeks on end it really got boring and annoying after a few days and i was very glad when they finally dropped the subject and got back to normal programing
  i broke my right arm like an hour after 9/11
was franco and the nationalists during the spanish civil war an exact copy of the reconquista and the inquisition
  there would be no outside activities    i never understood this shit i remember stuff like this going around my school at the time and parents were picking their children up from school as if al qaedu gave a rats ass about some podunk elementary school in the middle of bumfuck nowhere even as a little kid i thought how everyone was acting was unfathomably retarded    is this kind of irrational cognitive dysfunction just an american thing
  i was like 4 i got checked out of school and went home dont remember much after that
  it was more like the uncertainty because it looked like someone declared war and shit so you automatically assume the worst
having an early morning fuck with my dad  mom rushes in  turn on the tv  we were like mom were in the middle of something  shes like turn on the tv  fine reach over and grab remote  wtc in flames  what the fuck while still pounding away  get the urge to cum  second plane flys into the tower  cum at the exact same time it hits     how in fuck could i forget that i feel guilty about cumming the exact moment hundreds of people died till this very day
    would definitely do it for me if it had a dick     imagine pounding that soft ass with a middle sized flaccid cock
    americans think its only arabs who hate them
  underrated
be at school either 1st or 2nd grade cant remember  live across the river from the pentagon in crystal city  kids start getting taken out of class by their parents   oh man i want to get taken out   oh man i am getting taken out fuck yeah   mom tells me some very bad people are doing bad things walks me out as some humvees pull up to school later learned that they were there to secure some generals kid  me thinking scary stuff meant squirting ketchup and mustard everywhere   get home glued to the tv and my tiny kid brain couldnt really grasp it   watch both towers collapse see the smoke rising from the pentagon across the river  me and my mom run outside and look up whenever we hear jets even though theyre all air force  remember being terrified seeing the tanks parked on memorial bridge the weeks after    if anyone has seen arrival the scene where theyre evacuating the school and its just this weird hushed silence and kind of general shell shock punctuated by the roar of jet engines fucking triggered the shit out of me

    one senator dies  chain of events unfold which brings down the entire australian government  this event is actually quite interesting and more people should know about it its basically unheard of in a civilised country post wwii
  australian politics seem totally crazy no one votes on the prime minister and it can change multiple times a year how the fuck does that make sense
  making me do work and not giving me a quick green text run down of the chain of events    youre lucky i like australia
  not true the fourth republic literally fucking collapsed because of the algerian revolution france was on the edge of becoming a fascist state when degaulle managed to convince the pied noire coup plotters and paratroopers to support him only to cuck them in the end
  blatantly incorrect the average confederate soldier couldnt even afford to own a slave the primary reasons for the war were taxes tariffs and railroad policies
  wait who died i skimmed through the article and couldnt find anything saying that
  opposition control the senate  block money bills basically the equivalent to gov shutdown  demand election  pm says no fuck you  pm goes to visit figurehead representative of the queen  figurehead representative stabs him in the back  whole government sacked opposition leader becomes caretaker pm until next election which he promptly wins because the old government got fucked
      got ciaed
  
  you elect a party to government not a leader president/pm the party reserves the right to chose their own leader so as is often the case they will change the pm in the middle of a term
  british dominion constitutions are fine they have good checks and balances and generally respect the liberty of citizens but theyve caused some strange political messes canada had a similar event in 1925/26 called the kingbyng affair the liberals didnt win as many seats as the conservatives in the 1925 election but continued to govern because prime minister king convinced governor general byng his government could function with support from the progressive party whose seats combined with the liberals outnumbered the conservatives in 1926 a member of kings government was found to be taking bribes causing the progressives to back the conservatives instead king tried to get byng to call another election he refused and told the conservative leader arthur meighen he could form government if he could win a byelection in his home riding while meighen was at home winning a byelection king made a nationalistic speech that appealed to the progressives and they put their support back behind the liberals meighen felt his minority government wouldnt be able to function so he asked byng to call a general election byng agreed and the liberals won a majority government
could walt disneys original plan for epcot as a preplanned city of the future have worked or was it an idea that wouldnt have taken into account the problems introduced by todays world
    during the 60s and 70s there were many attempts at creating cities of the future at first they were places were the middle class could live and thrive but as time progressed most middle class people moved into the cities  or to other parts of the country     look at brasilia in brazil and    vällingby in stockholm sweden    are two cities or communities that do not differ that much in appearance and had similar aims as epcot to be modern selfsustained communities for the future    while the aim is admirable you will find that nobody ever goes to visit vällingby or brasilia except diplomats in the latter case the cities are drab boring and uncultured there is no room for freedom of expression or deviation from the norm furthermore if we look at epcot it explicitly has as its goal to only house people who work at disney world so that means it will only attract what today can be at best called lower middle class cleaners store clerks waiters and hotel porters in the us i would even call these the new working class they are poorly paid and dependent on tips     another aspect of epcot was as a continuing experimental and testing ground for new products by the leading brands in the us but even if general electrics establishes a rnd and factory center at epcot what happens when products start to be developed at an ever increased pace the entire premise of epcot falls apart when appliances cannot be installed quickly enough before theres a new and better one on the market samsung released new products every year and it doesnt need epcot to test them out is samsung going to produce roughly 10000 new tvs every year just to show off in epcot not likely    when this fact overtakes any commercial incentive to display new products at epcot then the experimental aspect of the city would disappear it would be left only a slum of people working at disney world
i forgot shouldve added walts video about it        another aspect of epcot was as a continuing experimental and testing ground for new products by the leading brands in the us but even if general electrics establishes a rnd and factory center at epcot what happens when products start to be developed at an ever increased pace the entire premise of epcot falls apart when appliances cannot be installed quickly enough before theres a new and better one on the market samsung released new products every year and it doesnt need epcot to test them out is samsung going to produce roughly 10000 new tvs every year just to show off in epcot not likely    that exact point actually gets brought up in this short analysis video

what went wrong with christianity
  weakest b8 ive seen in a while
  not updating the moron book or bible with new information i mean you have to be seriously fucking stupid to take advice from nonwhites in the iron age
  that is a shitty graph   that being said questioning the status quo dictated by the popeman would probably see you hanged as a heretic
  eh plenty of people extended science and philosophy during the middle ages beyond where the ancient romans got even with the boogeyman
world war i and world war ii particularly wwi and the spanish flu following it the sheer devastation left people wondering why god would allow such devastation to occur    source sartre and camus
  there was serious scientific advancement during the dark ages
  this essentially implies that no scientific development was happening anywhere outside of europe how can you say that the adoption of christianity in europe lowered the level of scientific development of the entire world
the romans took it over    t southern baptist
  the dark ages are a renaissance meme
  yes
  scientific development  outside of europe
    some popes were patrons of the sciences though and pope sylvester ii was even a renowned mathematician and astronomer himself bringing indoarabic numerals to europe creating a hydrolicpowered organ and an armillary sphere which in and of itself debunks the people thought the earth was flat meme  with an accurate representation of the ecuador he also represented the poles as slanted though he messed up the exact degrees  of course he became more famous for the legends that he learned sorcery in cordoba and consorted with a demon
  it wasnt christians it was barbarians mostly german and steppepeople ones that did this christians actually protected works of classical literature sciences and philosophy by keeping them in monasteries and having monks make copies christian monks are the reason platos works survive to this day the god damn barbarians went and invaded rome and burned all their shit then when the middle east thought they were safe and had their works of literature science and philosophy protected assholes like tamerlane came along and burned all that down too most of these barbarians werent christian they were either some form of pagan or in tamerlanes case muslim    dont hate on christians hate on barbarians modern day germans are not barbarians anymore and havent been for centuries they are blameless its the old dead people you should hate

every 7 seconds a german soldier dies  stalingrad  a mass grave
so whats it like for the other side every 3 seconds a soviet soldier dies
  every 07 seconds  german achieved 101 kd ratio at stalingrad before succumbing to starvation
  why
  because soviets were throwing hordes of barely trained soldiers often without rifles at the entrenched germans while stukas strafed soviet boats killing thousands before they even crossed the volga river
  because germans just let their soviet pows starve to death in the pocket
  dont mind us just leaving your flanks exposed
  do not matter as the red army latter bred an antire new army from these german qts
  leave underequipped and stretched out forces to defend your flank  im sure the germans werent at fault here for deploying their allies like that
  blaming romanians for german mistakes
  based and enemy at the gates pilled
  
  we didnt lose we were stabbed in the back by jews  i was just following orders  i failed because hitler interfered  we lost because we relied on those totally not underequiped romanians    making germans responsible for something is like catching eels with bare hands
  german  qts
  they behave like kikes from their own propaganda
  yes theres a reason for that
  and it all could have been prevented if we just allied with germany and save the white race from extinction we should have listened

what did european socialists in general and the german communist party in particular think of the versailles treaty
bump
at the very least lenin thought it was just meant to prop up the liberal capitalist imperialist countries that won the war  i think its safe to say most thought it was nothing new
  kpd and all communist parties wanted to annul it according to this guy    its a commie source so take a critical stance it seems reasonable that an edgy contrarian block would want to go against the mainstream political parties views just because they could    according to this translated wiki article they wanted to revision it by overthrowing the govt and driving off the french    the communists also advocated a radical revision of the versailles treaty and its alleged vicarious agents of the spd and the moderatebourgeois parties in 1923 for example karl radek interpreted the peace treaty as an instrument of  entente capital  that is of french and angloamerican finance capital for the exploitation of german workers clara zetkin argued the same year that the overthrow of the government was for the liberation of the fatherland from the french occupation forces in 1930 the red flag proclaimed a program clarification on the national and social liberation of the german people whereupon the social democratic forwardastonished stated the kpd becomes more nationalist than hitler 2    christian striefler kampf um die macht kommunisten und nationalsozialisten am ende der weimarer republik propyläen berlin u a 1993 isbn 3549052081 s 96 und 398    couldnt be assed to find another source its just typical edgy commieshit maybe hitler was the saner choice at that time
  molotov hated it as much as adolf but then again they were excluded from participating  although they also refused to participate to so whatever  and the allies actively fucked them whenever possible     so its kind of fair
  kinda cool to think that antifaschistische aktion flag logo is actually so old yet still in use its rare to see political movements that keep using basically the same logo unchanged for so long
why did the dutch suck ass at colonising if the voc was so rich
  no interest in developing shitholes outside of squeezing money from said shitholes     the only dutch settlers were in it for themselves even south africa was a mix of french protestants germans and the dutch
  what about suriname
  the voc and early colonialism in general benefited way more from just intercepting and monopolizing on trade in previously developed regions of the world like india east africa china/japan sea etc   settler colonialism really only came far later as it was really wasnt worth it at the time
  sugar it is majority black for a reason no other crops was as profitable
  also suriname was part of the wic  west indies company
  doh i should have known
  uhh what are those orange squares on australia and new zealand
  angola  new holland and new zee land as colonies  wat
  thats namibia not angola still shitty map
  you dont understand finance very well do you    voc was an investment firm in which people bought bonds/stock in venture units ships and the ships return paid returns in form of dividends and price increase exporting people from dutch would just weaken the whole fucking thing they had trading posts not colonies the ones they did were to export trash genes furthering the eugenics line of their development ergo ratiocination being further succint to the venture
dutch population was less than 2 million people   having colonies is only a costly burden money is mostly made with trading which is what the voc did
  denmark always had a tiny population compared to the united caliphate and frankistan
  denmark  american education folks
  the dutch basically traded new york nieuw amsterdam for suriname
    look up abel tasman
  its implying there was some kind of colony or post in those places which is wrong  even if its about tasmans discovery of a place its still wrong  its just plain wrong
  they were interested in making coin not transplanting its already small population for long term settlement

  they were jews as they had nobody to leech off of they lived in their own filth and did nothing productive
  this video is currently on a thread posted on 8 /pol/ and some of the anons are reeeing at the fact that anyone would demand a source for the some of the claims   sources are jewish lol  
    based conquered rome bogged homossexuals    read germania    
  european dipole to rome stands to this day
  so bad that for the colonizers came here just to become romans since being a grmans was so pathetic    i bet they got turned on by being called flavius by their costantinople daddies
  that actually is pretty hot
   are jewish lol  that is literally a stance actual stormshits take there were a couple of threads about that on /his/ a while back
  they were stoic 65 bodybuilders who never had a degenerate thought and refused the trap of (((civilization))) and (((technology)))    they were almost pure neanderthals and could survive naked in the cold northern winter until they got raped by the negroid rmans
  cucked ware was protogermanic  cant these fags do a few minutes of research before putting out this shit    he did a good job on discussing the nordic bronze age germanic warriortrader elite though
  
why not just put all the jews in the front line with armor and guns and force them to fight for germany with machine gun nests behind them if they turn around
  what do you do when they defect to the other side
  use it as proof that jews cant be trusted     why didnt spartans use halots for war  same answer they are better for cheap slave labor

  the shitty farming part is pretty hilarious  settlers come here and try to farm shitty new england soil  every 2 feet they plow they keep dredging up rocks and nothing wants to grow sufficiently  cut down near every tree and sell for lumber to afford food and have fuck ton of rocks to do nothing with so you stack them in long walls to mark off your land  independencejpeg  louisianapurchaswav  all farmers move out west where you can actually grow shit everyone else is too busy in factories to give a shit about rest of land  trees all grow back albeit as new growth leaving seemingly random stonewalls throughout the woods  i have a few in my yard me and my father have always maintained they look nice and help preserve a bit of the history we add stones occasionally and keep them nice and square looking squirrels and shit always hide out in there too always throws off people who arent around here that there are just random walls throughout the woods lol

    and thats a good thing
  if you people were actually smart you would all be radicals either fascists or hardcore leftists
  they had struggles which were stronger than those in the south so they had to be creative innovative and intelligent to live there in the early days on the other hand the difficulty in living there is not so great that it prevents their development past basic subsistence so unlike appalachia they were able to successfully develop a decent culture  t toynbee
    whereas the south is now all republican and degenerate as shit with higher crime more premaritial sex lower age of losing virginity more single motherhood and a 3rd world education system    just lol  having a 40000 per capita gdp instead of an 80000 one

in a sadistic way the old die so that the young may live i realised this today as i witnessed my grandpa cling to life in intensive care after receiving a heart attack    we will unplug the machines tomorrow so he can return to the earth beautiful in its way i think he had no regrets in life however to my surprise my father is not taking it well this surprises me as he disliked him most of his life    i saw him today in icu struggling to live they say he is in no pain but as a humanist just let him go im pretty sure he is brain dead anyway theres no honour in surviving like that    his old wrinkled face has seen many a sight its time it returned to nature no yesterday and no tomorrow just infinite peace
  take a shit on him when no ones looking and then wait for everyone to wonder where the poop came from itll be funny
  he disliked him most of his life  the worst thing about death is that the surviving are stuck with regrets that cant be resolved
  wasted
  im disappointed too
however to my surprise my father is not taking it well this surprises me as he disliked him most of his life    people can give up on each other when they fundamentally disagree yet they still love each other instinctively

how were the partitions of poland received internationally
everyone pretended they care
who fucking cares
  celebration
  how were prussians expecting to keep that much of poland in check its like 50 of their country
people died of laughter in every country
  france and britain were busy with each other the last partition happened in the midst of the french revolutionary wars  everybody else was irrelevant at the time so they either didnt give a shit or if they did nobody cared what they had to say
  nowadays is abitated only by poles but back in the days the coast and some big cities were prevalently german poles were scattered from danzing to ukraine but in many nonrural zone were a mere large minority
  turks and frenchies hated it
  with the deepest concern the international community ever heard
  all of greater poland and masovia  the very cores of polish statehood  with major cities like warsaw and poznan  minority polish  what
britain pretended to be mad the ottomans were actually mad but were so feeble and dependent on western aid they couldnt do shit france was busy recovering economically and then fighting an internal revolution to care spain didnt give a fuck about what was going on on the otherside of the continent the scandinavians were too weak to make a move without being annihilated and the german principalities didnt give a fuck about anything outside the hre safe zone
  looks like nothing has changed in current year
  because the german territories had a larger population
  ottomans ever got western aid
  why do you think brits and french ended up fighting in crimea
france generally supported the poles    even after the revolution french opinion remained strong    in 1848 polish liberation was the cause celebrate of french radicals until they got their own revolution off the ground    the turks used units of trained polish soldiers as special forces in the crimwan war and tried to support faltering attempts for groups in the caucuses to make common cause with the poles    polish conscripts on the frontiers often defected to upland caucus rebels making some ties
  why did the ottomans support the poles
    because they were in conflict with the russians they also gave material support to the persians in their caucus clashes with russia the enemy of my enemy is my friend kinda thing    sort of like how the turks sided with england france and the pope in the 30 years war because if spain/austria won theyd become too powerful for any great power to stand against in the future
    also polish veteran defectors were highly sought after when the highlander rebels in dagestan or chechnya captured field guns the poles could help them opperate them as well as the russians
  nobody noticed
  the ottomans were mas and a lot they would had started a war over the independence of poland if it wasnt a time were every other great power was busy with something else as  stated
speaking of hw bush why did he permit the us murder rate to surge under his watch rising crime was a big reason behind his loss in 1992  clinton hammered him on that issue one of clintons big campaign pledges was to hire 1000000 more cops which was seen as necessary due to bushs failure to control crime and then the la riots happened in april/may of the election year why didnt bush take better care of the crime problem during his time in power
  crime peaked under bush because the cold war ended the defense contacts dried up and unemployment increased la was just one of many cities in the sun belt that depended on defense jobs especially to maintain blue collar jobs for undereducated black men the loss of these jobs and a stabilizing middle class was just one of many factors related to the la riots clintons crime policies were just a doubling down of what reagan and bush were doing harsh sentences especially for drugs the reason crime decreased under clinton is due to the economic recovery and because of roe v wade its no coincidence crime rates started dropping 20 years after the legalization of abortion many unfit parents after 1973 would choose to abort their pregnancies rather than attempt and most likely fail to raise children as a result fewer children are being raised in abusive and neglectful families and thus fewer children growing up to become criminals
  theres no evidence at all that abortion actually lowered crime rates anon especially considering how soon crime began to drop compared to its extreme peak in the early 90s in major metro areas i like the idea but its not substantiated
  presidents dont police states unless they call out the national guard the states and cities were largely more liberal than the executive in those days nyc had a lax attitude on crime until giuliani got in and began cleaning house nycs size alone had a huge effect on the nations overall homicide rate
  i would like to add that in the 90s we saw the first generation of people born after lead paint was largely banned from urban areas enter early adulthood higher lead levels has a direct correlation to increased aggression and lower iq a lot of different factors started to come together in the 90s that started a massive downward trend in violent crime not just in america but all over the western world blaming bush sr isnt really fair there were a lot of complex factors at play 
bro    why didnt george bush just like   stop murder
  it comes from freakonomics and is ironic because that book specifically tells people not to treat correlation as causation
  lots of complex factors  durr hurr abortion durr hurr lead paint durr hurr dem programs for da kids yo
  hurr durr shitposting  epin
  out sourcing    relocation of the poor to lower income housing in the cities    urban decay    drug laws    lead paint
  okay what do you think it was then clintons extra bit of tough on crime policies even though america had been tough on crime since nixon   nafta  the fresh prince of bel air
was it really a rise
is there any truth to the claim that the murder rate has become less and less useful to measure crime and violence since the 60s due to improved emergency medical care allowing increasingly more people to walk away alive from wounds previously fatal
  were not disputing the lots of complex factors  claim were mocking the muh abortion muh lead paint meme
  the murder rate has dropped as a result of improved medicine since basically the nations founding that being said its still a valuable statistic and the only crime statistic required to be reported by all 50 states
  i rather mean that it has been claimed that it dropped so much after the introduction of widespread ers 911 and ambulances in the 60s and 70s that it has become borderline useless to draw reliable conclusion about violent crime development especially over longer periods of time
  its part of the story but the overall murder rate is still a decent proxy for general lawlessness in a given area if you see a large discrepancy between murders and other crimes you can usually guess that the other crimes are being cooked statistically
why do irish and northern irish hate each other
well they dont really relations between them at this point are quite cordial youd be hard pressed to find anyone from northern ireland who doesnt pop down to the republic every now and again    the cliff notes version is that in the early 17th century thousands of english and lowland scots emigrated to plantations established in the northern part of ireland sponsored by both the government directly and private sponsors acting on the governments behalf in an attempt to outbreed the native irish inhabitants and bring ulster under control as it had traditionally been the most rebellious and resistant part of ireland this worked quite well in the eastern part of ulster but in the west and the south not so much     the affinity that the descendents of these planters feel for britain is why northern ireland exists in the first place
they dont
northern irish  not a real thing
    
  what the fuck is that thing
  half of northern ireland are irish catholics while the other half are the descendants of scottish protestants sent by james i to colonise ireland
  that the catholics were there before the protestants is popish propaganda
  one groups actually irish    the other is the descendants of english colonists placed there to put ireland under control displace irish culture and promote english ways
  imagine britain but now its the north thats civilized and the south thats populated by savages the people of northern ireland are just protecting all that is good and holy
  hugh oneill and hugh roe odonnell never existed apparently
  and the cruthin were there before the concept of irish was a twinkle in iberian eyes
  havent seen you in a while
  it really isnt northern protestants consider themselves british northern catholics consider themselves irish almost without exception the irish in the north are the same irish ethnic group as in the republic the british in the north are a settler ethnicity of various sources but tied loyally to a vague patriotic britishness
  an irishman
  northern irish  no such thing there is irish and scotch irish scotch irish are usually 5 foot nothing with a jewish nose and beadyeyes
  northern ireland exists as a royal prerogative  only the monarch can remove it

  people who are unable to cope with modern society gravitate toward ideologies which created societies they could cope with whenever society undergoes a radical shift there are going to be those who are more fit than they were before and those who are unable to adapt and are unfit    you are right the most fit right now are those who go on snapchat and tinder and happily wageslave and find absolutely no problem adapting to the internet and modern society in general a lot of these people would have been victims of natural selection 500 years ago but now they have it good in the same way many who would have been content with life in the past find modern society utterly unbearable the problem is there is little selective pressure and weve only had a few generations to adapt so there are a lot of people who feel left out and unfit    genetically sound and unsound is relative
what could have been
shitty historical maps
  ethiopians in the middle of a desert
    what is the first known map of the world created by humans

did christianity contribute to the decline and fall of rome in any significant way
  no    also checked
  wew
nine nine six six  314  diabolus ex machina  past the 7th heaven  the last judgment the library of babel  censored passages  treader of the path    all pertinent
  reminds me of the mlg conspiracy theories
  yes rome was a yolo state then became a leave for some magical afterlife state not that yolo conquest economy was sustainable but the culture shift in the midst of that only hurts
  go to bed neetzchud
  theologist    what the fuck is that does it just mean degenerate theologian
    yes the rise of christianity killed the religious pluralism which was a source of strength to the empire
constantine and his christian bullshit rekt the empire with no suvivors its more of a stuggle of greek versus latin but christian dogma was a major factor
  diversity is strength
  for an empire as opposed to a nation yes
yes christianity led to islam and the fourth crusade which all led to the fall of the roman empire
  contribute  to some degree yeah since the early ones didnt want to kill people for some reason unless its for their religion but its overstated by gibbon et al
could someone help me know what year this sword was used for
  that is the 1873 french courier cutlass used during the revolution used for night slashing of dumpy people
assuming its not an artificiallyaged replica its definitely late 1700s through the mid 1800s     cant tell nation of origin specifically but its more than likely american french or english    the simple handguard with poorlydone leather handle wrap suggests it belonged to someone of a lower rank but well above the rank of a common foot soldier     does it have any marks or ornamentaion on the blade or pommel
why does it look like the blade is on backwards
its 100 a calvary/officer sword from the a civil war era or maybe a few decades prior or after     my first thought was csa as it looks similar to one ive seen in a museum but i cant find any on google that look like it this is the closest i found
  my bad    and itd help if you said where you found it op
  context would help anon
why did architecture postww2 become just so boring its all just steel pvc and glass concrete was used terribly for a bit between the 60s and 80s famously in brutalism but what happened to masonry and building cities in unique national/cultural styles     go to any major city in the world today and they basically all look the same in terms of post ww2 architecture
  population boom human rights fall of imperialism creation of middle class  purge of nobility globalisation  consumerism  it wasnt cost effective to build with stone and ornate masonry anymore  middle class wanted their own house without too much regard or passion for art and tradition as they were of poor families raised in basic conditions  modern technological standards regulations and functioning cant work with the lack of space and poor insulation in favour of traditional aesthetics  economic integration of underdeveloped countries that never had any historically impressive architectural past meant that people were more interested in quality of life than neoclassical facades  also  concrete  steel  industrialisation  mass production  free education  most people arent into architecture a lot of their ancestors were treated like shit for milennia in some empires only the crem de la crem had respectable dwellings while in others people either lived in rural villages or aesthetic appartment buildings with mediocre living conditions and not much sense of beauty for the individual sharing the building with 50 other people many times these urban areas were just colonial push overs like ireland where they were highly developed but shit quality grey flats
because is expensive to host so many people with expensive materials you can blame people unable to hold their dicks and study when humies find a way to build ornate buildings with cheap materials this cubic mess will be over
i date an architect   cost is the single major thing but lets be real even when architects have insane budgets these days they still just build absolute fucking shit  one thing is that theyre just stubborn as fuck they think god awful contemporary architecture is extremely artistic and beautiful and that everyone else are just fucking plebs for not understanding it go on /r/architecture and look at the discussions they have when talking about how they just dont listen to the public we do listen to the public but the public dont understand the insert architecture wankery to justify hadid eisenman or gehrys awful buildings  also architects have largely been trained to hate traditional and classical architecture ask any trained architect essentially what they think about it and they think kitschy or garish   yeah something like musee dorsay is garish but pic related is a beautiful piece of architecture that perfectly blends with its surroundings
  yfw our entire world is made hostile and alienating to us by pretentious artist jews  not even a nazi but it really feels like jews have been behind every art movement that makes the world a more painful place
  not even a nazi but  if what you took out of that article is that the (((jews))) are behind ugly architecture then youre a nazi accept it and kill yourself
  leftypol pls go
  pol pls go
  but what happened to masonry  its expensive and not robust
  im a commie fren    masonry isnt the only kind of beautiful architecture eastern europe and northeast asia are great examples of places where most things were made of wood but they were beautiful
  thats the other extreme man that is an ugly building ugh
  i find them really cozy especially when you compare them tobeautiful modern buildings
  
    these are fine    this is horrendous
  great article       as someone who has just recently revived my interest in architecture as a career it kills me what is considered good in the modern day    its clear that our current standards for architecture is based not just on only cost no its far worse its based on many layers of beuacracy from the national and state level and standardized architects who spend more time with the academic arts or purely functional engineering fields then trying to build good architecture there is no soul anymore and architecture is no longer about creating an environment but much more about about either building something cheap or building somthing revolutionary to the acedmic field    its avantgarde college grads with no actual taste because they developed their taste in the schools rather than experience as someone who has spent way too long in acedmia and knows actual creative artist let me tell you art does not come from the modern university and it never will you go there to get certified and maybe learn a concept or two if you expect to become more artistic or creative youre deluted all you get is acedmic circle jerking creating bold art which has no substance because its created by people without any character or understanding of the world just last week one of my musician freinds introduced me to this chick shes 37 has kids dumb as a brick but in 6 years she managed to completely teach herself how to paint and i shit you not it was some of the most beautiful paintings i had ever seen it touched my soul and made me sad sad that this woman who probably has to deal with so much shit and gets taken advantage of because shes dumb is not praised in any way despite how naturally talanted she is nobody in the universities could do that they couldnt even get near her level they are too busy trying to paint with their menstrual blood instead of understanding their feelings and how to paint it     cont
  its only bad because of the color a nice paintjob and you wouldnt be bitching green and white is always cozy
  the colors are terrible other than that its a beautiful building
having your tastes screwed by spooks such as economic classes  lmao
  then you add the bureaucracy of the building codes and laws which i understand they are needed you dont want some dumbass to design a bridge that kills thousands but it also restricts any potentially great works with it if youre building is too high if it uses weird shapes or anything remotely not to standards then its a no go although great architects can sometimes get around it its just another layer the architect has to deal with ontop of all the other bullshit they need to keep track of     architecture is as much construction as it is art truly good architecture melds both fields and focuses on creating an experience with the building its just now a days the demand for cheap and the lack of truly talented characters who understand history nature engineering and art is what is causing the problem most modern architecture is from acedmics and as ive said thats not a place one develops character the modern university is just an adult daycare and nothing more     its a shame really that in an age with the most wealth access to technology access to every great work of humanity with so much knowledge and skilled people we create shit     im not saying im better or ill get anywhere but i promise you anons if i make it through all the hoops it requires to be an architect i will not allow this shit to continue i will do what i can to crest great things with soul and things that will uplift culture instead of shit on it even if it leaves me broke kills me
  they just dont listen to the public we do listen to the public but the public dont understand the insert architecture wankery to justify hadid eisenman or gehrys awful buildings  also architects have largely been trained to hate traditional and classical architecture ask any trained architect essentially what they think about it and they think kitschy or garish  i hate these people so much
  im not an architect but those are some disgusting windows and theres an obvious over usage of framing til the point that it becomes bland instead of accentuating the building
  thats postmodernist architecture deconstructivism       modernist architecture is an incredibly wide group of styles but includes many shit /his/ and even /pol/ love like art deco art nouveau streamline    use the word contemporary for current architecture
  i still dont get why people jerk off to gehry so much when his buildings are known to be absolutely fucking awful places to work and live in and in terms of maintenance
  i actually saw this process happen to a former flatmate of mine who studied architecture he started off with just the indoctrination he got in secondary school art class that contemporary is good and youre a moron if you dont understand it he still had a general love of architecture though then when he had studied for a year it was replaced with precisely this attitude we lived in a city with some pretty fascinating architecture and space creation too but everything he produced in class was ugly and boring as fuck
  i love graz
  experts general hate when laymen lecture them on their craft if i spent all that time studying architecture i would not want some fucking mcdonalds worker telling me how the building shoulda been made you stupid fucks cant even get my soft drink right
  anti semite
  there are scads of houses like this in upscale new england neighborhoods but we really arent talking about houses here i hate modern architecture but to discuss this you at least need to understand that building a house and building a library or office are extremely different
  materialism abjects the ideal of beauty which is perfection not achievable on this realm what remains is just utility and no aesthetics
  you can build a large important building which is beautiful for all people shit on the ussr for muh grey commieblock utopia important buildings were often quite nice looking
  even hospitals in poor parts of the country could bother to not be misery inducing even if they werent particularly beautiful
    omsk library is a good example of how even when employing more contemporary styles you can make it look nice if you dont have some grudge against humanity theres symmetry to it theres some neat sculptures the color is pretty alright shame about the landscaping though idk why russians always suck at landscaping
  oops pic
    most is garbage but some of it is nice
  damn i really like this i think what you said is the reason why its shit pretentious architects who hate the plebs and shit on everything
    architects often get mad when nonarchitects conflate the terms modernism postmodernism brutalism etc they love telling people that say frank gehry is actually reacting to postmodernism these terminological disputes can obscure the fact that everything under discussion is actually just a minor variation on the same garbage
  i agree of course but you shouldnt so readily compare domestic building with public building there are good reasons why traditional materials and designs arent used for large buildings even if there arent good reasons to make them deliberately ugly
  but even modern domestic buildings look bad i plopped down at a randomish place in one of the worlds wealthiest countries with a rich tradition of building in wood and this is what i see
  and its not like even 5 of american homes are like  its mostly just this sort of abomination against nature
    even the poor ass end of russia can manage less aggressively ugly and dehumanizing housing just click around a lot of rural russia on google maps its dilapidated as can be but at least some human heart can be found
  that is an example of garbage right
    but even modern domestic buildings look bad  i agree with you there too but thats the market housing is just too fucking expensive for people to be concerned with how it looks people who can afford a beautiful quality home widely prefer a cheap ugly big one instead that usually means massproduced homes in places like doral st which is how america looks everywhere today when youre two blocks from a main route and within 4 miles of a target its called economy of scale i hate how it is but if it werent this way more people would simply have to live in more apartment blocks which is worse for them worse for the market and worse on the eye
  because the great depression killed art deco the height of architectural aesthetic rivaled only by gothic and architecture never recovered  except that time in the 60s when they briefly brought art deco back before hippies realized taste wasnt for them
  japan has lots of miserable architecture
  but if it werent this way more people would simply have to live in more apartment blocks  we clearly have the resources available to do better than this if everyone from the dawn of history to the 1900s managed it and even poor siberians manage it now  saying its just the market misses the whole point modern buildings and architecture are a reflection of the failings of market liberalism in general most of the people who really have a bone to pick with modern architecture are fascists traditionalists communists etc just generally people with some gripe with the current way of doing things it is clearly demented that humanity has more resources at its disposal than ever before yet more people live in soul crushing conditions than ever before this sort of contradiction pops up everywhere the dehumanization present in modern architecture is symbolic of the dehumanization inherent to the market system    a shame because their traditional way of doing things was really nice
  dude of course suburban and rural areas are going to look completely different this has got nothing to do with russia except that russia is more rural and more poor      you say dehumanization i say urbanization we may actually mean the same thing in different terms but while you seem to see this as a more deliberate process i see it as the inevitable and its not actually new either like eating leads to shitting architecture has to accommodate the inevitable by installing plumbing i have never seen a beautiful toilet but i need one anyway
  leftypol please go
    no its aesthetic as fuck
  american rural areas are all rusted out trailers and shit its uglier than the suburban somehow
  thats such a ridiculous generalization rural doesnt mean impoverished
  omsk  building not a commieblock drug den with possibly noneuclidean elements  wait a fucking minute
  i maintain that a lot of the communist era buildings could be made wastly more beautiful if they just slapped some colors on them
i love rammed earth  i wish i had the money to build stuff
  i see it as the inevitable  he doesnt know that an age makes not it is man made
  this is actually because of an old belief that one of the things that could make a person better was the beauty of the space they lived in and the calming effect beauty had on the soul and body this is why old hospitals were generally extremely beautiful buildings with very well maintained gardens ever see in an old movie sick people being wheeled around these perfect gardens that is that very idea
just so boring its all just steel pvc and glass    welcome to global capitalism and countries thinking they need to adopt anglo styles to be taken seriously  its the same question why dont the korean or japanese or chinese or african leaderships wear traditional clothes of their countries and instead all wear western suits why if i go to china is everyone wearing designer western brands  the bourgeoisie take the world and turn it into a mirror of themselves
because modern cultural starchitecture is developed by people who failed first year sculpting and found that in the field of architecture people jerked off over their failed sculpts when presented as a building thus they could get their artwork presented on the scale it never could have been before   just look at frank gehry just look at his fucking buildings theyre literally first year art student shit yet he is considered the greatest living architect the music experience project is such a poorly designed space inside people literally vomit from the vertigo it gives them his buildings all leak they have crazy amounts of dead space and unusable space inside due to the way the walls are    this is the problem with this sort of architecture in general and architects who jerk off to it the building is seen as a piece of challenging postmodern art first rather than a space for people
australia builds wanky deconstructivist nonsense as its national museum  because of its shitty design doesnt actually have space inside to properly host exhibits     literally most of this building is foyer im not kidding you only ever get about 1/4th of an actual exhibit when it reaches this building you have to travel to sydney or melbourne to see the full thing because there is no space in this thing for actual exhibits
  lol they build one opera house and suddenly they think they have that shit figured out
  its an old belief but its not a dumb belief feeling miserable makes for worse recoveries
  people are what they perceive the most so its true
  the opera house wasnt even designed by an australian    
why are houses so soulless nowadays
  you can have all mod cons and lots of floor space or you can have soul the people made their decision
think theres some cool new stuff as well 3
  that town needs antibiotics
i think lot of people just dont realize that how world population exploded and literally exploded after ww2 at the end of ww2 there were about 25 billion people it hit 5 billion 40 years later at the same time massive urbanization occured  about 30 of the worlds population lived in cities around ww2 which reached 40 in 4 decades so from 800 million city dwellers we went to 2 billion and this change was much greater in the developped parts     all these people needed housing and a decent  of old dwellings got destroyed in ww2 there was a need for cheap buildings that rae fast to construct but wont collapse like cardboard the material enabled this  steel concrete glass    that said you can build beautiful buildings with these materials still from my readings of history of architecture what i see unfold is that there was this huge rush of romantic very ornamental and detailed architecture notably art nouveau and art deco and architects got sick of it and went full contrarian ive read architecture journals from the 30s that call for simplification of the overabundant aesthetics of budapest and vienna for example and the proposals all predict postwar grey box style constructions this was of course the spirit of modernism to throw away the old look to the future build simple geometric shapes that on paper would awe with their proportions size large minimalist facades and so on of course today psyhcology well tell you humans fucking despise this and we prefer to look at images you can lose yourselves into but it fit well with both the intent of architectural schools and the costsensitive developers plus you could appeal to the public too by saying hey we can build these up fast and en masse
  other thing is that with these buildings you dont need many skilled craftsmen just dumb labourers and a few who manage them no fancy ornament  no need for highly skilled  wellpayed people do this for a few generations and it becomes probihitive to even want to build such a thing due to scarcity of relevant workforce    architects and the public did got fed up with the monotone shapes of modernist and the the onslaught of postmodernism happened although postmodernist at least the deconstructive part which most people think of the lets throw random shit down really isnt that relevant and only represented by some major public buildings its just too radical to have much acceptance so while some examples to horrify will be built i dont think it will ever gain widespread use    also there are architects who build using the old or reinvented styles new classical is relatively well known school which has some great examples but theres also some good examples in reconstruction like the lübeck altstadt project
  historical styles were also quite globalist or at least continentwidelike romance or gothic all over europe sure over time each country developped their own national style but to a laymen these are not identifiable same goes with later styles i mean could anyone tell a random neoclassicist building where is it from without context or an art deco one    a a style enjoying worldwide is not inherently bad other things make ir or not make it
  this is scandinavian style i also think its nice it aims to make modernist styles more humancentric more peopleoriented theres lots of new city projects in europe like it
one last thought from my rambling lots of these postwar projects were designed as largescale models as urban planning i think where went totally amiss is not considering your average citizens view of things because really from the air or like here on google maps you can make out the intent  in this example the freeway is greeted by a 20 storey tower block then on both sides commieblocks serve as walls finally opening up to a large green space what looks like a rambled nonsense of towers and endless grey walls are part of an urban puzzle too bad youll never realize it unless you really look into it
  forgot pic
    cannot emphasise the importance of this element
  it also has worse acoustics than a school hall  
  because we build to consume to be demolished next year  as an architect i know where i put my head on and this pile of shit at least gives me money
i was already sad by finishing a project today and decided to go to /his/ to see if the regional ban was lifted  it was and now i just got reminded that my profession is doomed to always follow popular ideas of modern beauty and squared dead and with no reason to be designs  some fall onto the trap of simple is better but dont think outside of it they think that just a square and a rectangle linked by a staircase or a simple open arc between the two solids is already a piece of art
and then you have the tradfags calling for a reform to the old and forgetting that the old was just like the modern squared and triangles with rules that tell you what decoration you should put here there what type of wood cement color and so on  the more i dwell on the ideas that the few moments we had of freedom to build when people had a spirit to actually make exotic different and new things was during the end of the belle epoque with the new art movement  sadly its not coming back and it will not until people understand that beauty is about feeling good and comfortable with the aesthetic and not getting a french book to see if the angle of whatever triangle is ok or hate any type of decoration because of their clean/minimalism is better
  possibly the only based socialist ive ever read
  when people had a spirit to actually make exotic different and new things was during the end of the belle epoque with the new art movement  tell me more about this anon
  hokkaido is very poor show some pictures in ginza or plop yourself down at enryakuji
  im as /pol/ as the next guy but i still kind of like modern architecture even shit like in this picture it just needs to age a bit and become representative of our era i like it when architects experiment honestly even if a lot of the stuff comes out looking ugly
  it just needs to age a bit     thats a big part of the problem it doesnt age well because it has been built with shit materials and in the optic to be replaced after 30 years
  lots of truth here
   they think god awful contemporary architecture is extremely artistic and beautiful and that everyone else are just fucking plebs for not understanding it   not really true generally i study architecture and teachers constantly shit on ugly buildings
  and also we get taught about history of architecture and analyse churches and such
  hokkaido is absolutely average in terms of wealth and income relative to other regions
  this is very nice
  most people admit that they would rather live in an aestheticallypleasing city which is mucky has poor transport etc than one which is little more than a glassandconcrete jungle with japantier sanitation and regular buses/trains    its scientificallyproven that oversized bland facades that are little more than a vast featureless face literally have adverse psychological effects on people especially compared to something like a timber tudor facade in a quaint english village or the honeycoloured shops and houses of provence    another consideration is that mostly for the construction of every one of these new monstrosities several mediaeval or at least preww2 buildings are destroyed  this happened in my hometown of exeter where in the 1960s the council decided to hack a 30ft chunk of 2000 year old roman wall down and replace it with a disgusting flyover and new road    in other words there is a strong marxist influence at play here    
bump
  this the main architecture style in london nowadays  a lot of buildings are being built in this blocky brick design  its honestly not as bad as the ugly post ww2 council estates but i am not sure how well they will age  once the bricks and windows get dirty theyll probably look like shit too
tfw i left my ugly old modern uni and my new one has some of the most gorgeous gothic architecture in the country
  literally just smaller commieblocks with scaled up windows
  hometown of exeter  based  that bypass was pretty much necessary though
  i agree with what she says but its a bit misleading to say  theres nothing stopping us except the prison of our ideas and our horrible economic system we must break out of the prison and destroy the economic system  as if the only thing thats stopping us from building beautiful buildings is capitalism  soviet russia communist china and north korea are not known for their beautiful architecture in fact all they build are soulless soul destroying dystopian commieblocks whereas some of the most beautiful buildings and cityscapes in the world were build in capitalist citystates like florence and venice  rich people often have horrible taste  again the people who were building these beautiful buildings palaces and cathedrals in europe that people travel across the world to visit were rich people rich people can have good taste they were the patrons of the fine arts before ww2 but the problem is 1 our culture and 2 maybe the fact that capitalist nowadays are not grounded they are rootless cosmopolitans so to speak and so they dont care about fucking up a citys aesthetic to make a quick buck
    its largely to do with cultural preferences and spirit of the times the soviet union had beautiful neoclassical stalinist architecture but ceased producing grand architecture during destalinization nordic countries have historically produced plain and conservative architecture largely based on their protestant faith which looked down on garish displays of wealth as opposed to italy and southern europe which was the epicenter of the baroque movement
  soviet russia communist china and north korea are not known for their beautiful architecture  why do people keep on repeating this retarded meme even the commieblocks arent trying to be ugly like most modern capitalist shit
  bbut thats a palace its supposed to look nice  even unimportant areas of periphery soviet cities looked nicer than 90 of american cities
  hanseatic league towns in scandinavia are some of the nicest towns to visit though their buildings are beautiful    if this bleak drab grey monolith is the best example you could find of beautiful communist architecture then ill happily keep repeating this retarded meme that most people understand as a common sense theres a reason we call them commieblocks  the only reason that picture looks nice is the flowers in the foreground you take those out and that picture will look like crap
  leningrad is a beautiful canal filled city that shits on venice and copenhagen and any other germanic city combined and most of it was destroyed in wwii so its all post war
  also please note that most of the hanseatic cities you mentioned have cute small old towns where no one lives and your pic  came from most of leningrad is like this
  is that picture supposed to prove something the complex in the bottom right is the only thing that looks acceptable and even then thats debatable everything else looks like it could of been pulled out of the rust belt s picture is a much better example
  theres nothing remotely nicelooking about that city  looks like a depressing shithole    its called st petersburg you braindead faggot  and no most of st petersburg is a depressing shithole like the rest of russia  venice and hanseatic league towns are a hell of a lot nicer to visit than st petersburg
    those rowhouses are plain and their front facing facade is plain just put your hand over the the roofs of the facade and theyre plain cubes
  just change the building and it looks difference  how did you figure that one out retard
    cope with it fag your simple brain considers colorful cubes fine architecture
gayest fucking thread on his right now
  cough
  t frank gehry
  and most of it was destroyed    nope    peter was a huge germanophile btw but he undoubtly hated russians 200000 of them died making his dream of a european city a reality
  in other words there is a strong marxist influence at play here  lmao you fucking retards
  the italian city states were not capitalists  capitalists / merchants
  waste of dubs
commieblocks were not terrible looking in the ussr when they were first built the problem is like all rushed shitty construction after 15 years all the plaster falls off and they look like shit this is the same with all the new suburbs in my city with these massive rushed developments they looked okay when built but 10 years later the place looks like a ghetto
  then why do you people continue to produce this shit
  which uni
  why did architecture postww2 become just so boring  because the aesthetic team has lost
  post modernism and minimalism basically    architecture is deign and art at the end of the day it follows these trends
do a lot of research into urban renewal and new urbanism   holy shit this would improve our town so fucking much  local election coming up  decide to actually get involved in at least having discussions with randos and pushing ideas of new urbanism   literally the response every time muh cars muh quarter acre blocks muh roads    cars roads and low density suburbia this is literally all people give a single fucking shit about it was one of the most depressing experiences of my life going to those town halls and shit and just realising how fucking dull and selfcentred your average person was
  people are too stupid to know what is good for them and will destroy everything good and beautiful in the world when left unrestrained even a shared sense of morality is too authoritarian for the modern west so it seems we are stuck on this course until the people unwittingly destroy society individualistic cultures rarely create beautiful things
  care to share some info on new urbanism  or maybe some books to read about it
  capitalism is the reason these sort of building exist
  you posted a very interesting building  and then complain about it not being interesting   r u dumb
  why do tradcucks hate glass and steel so much steel and glass are fucking beautiful
  suburban nation the rise of sprawl and the decline of the american dream  cities for people  walkable city how downtown can save america one step at a time  new civic art    also famous ted talks        i would also recommend the power politics  planning series which uses city skylines to show how weve basically catastrophically fucked up urban design and planning over the 20th century    
  i literally have this argument with my gffiancees father every time i see him he is/was an architect through his 30 year career and still feels a need to defend the utilitarian design choices that made our cities so ugly
  and then you have the tradfags calling for a reform to the old and forgetting that the old was just like the modern squared and triangles with rules that tell you what decoration you should put here there what type of wood cement color and so on  but it was much more beautiful if you have two styles that are as formulaic and unoriginal but one is much more pleasing to the soul than the other why not choose the latter
who cares
  become a mormon if you care so much
  only an ant would follow an ant
  modesty is a spook
  as a christian i will say that quoting the bible to make an argument in a public setting is a bitchass way to go about it
is that guy a mulism they were just triggering him epic style
  amish
  white boy incels btfo
  what a fucking faggot holy shit
  when did the amish start proselytizing
      a bit off topic   but if lets say a black woman decides to marry a amish man and fully commit to the amish life style would she be allowed to   would she face discrimination
  cunt just needs 23 seasons under the iron and he could run that shit but he wouldnt fuck retards fuck recruiting via inductive public offerings too /cringe
  what a retard holy shit
  deductive
  the amish arent exactly the most racially tolerant people around there do exist black amish but they generally have their own community not uncommon for them to adopt black kids either though they generally leave the faith
  theres another religion with nearly identical views on the role of women and these girls would never never fucking mock it like this  i dont like either religion
disgusting whores
  u sure showed em pal
  becky looks way better tho
  t becky
  nice try rebecca now stop posting on 4channel this isnt a site for girls
  these women clearly has internalized mysoginy for displaying themselves like this for the male gaze    off to gulag
  why do these women show their face
  i dont need to show them anything autitic beta fag they will be completely miserable in their 40s this black chick is definitely a future single mother
  which is more likely for the two roasties  1 single motherhood  2 childless 40 year old    take your bets
      
  absolutely based
  explain to an autistic like me how is the mount me pose in any way shape or form a display of aggression or dominance the way these young ladies intend it to be
  this is a revelatory question these are atomistic times of supreme egotism and of supreme general incompetence   slogans and shibboleths are worn as if perfumes that is all
  it obviously isnt but there is a dedicated push for a destruction of nobility because decadence and hedonism is profitable and to be profitable is a complete necessarily in a system that demands an evergrowing rate of profit
  oh you want this booty but u cant have it
  one on the left looks like my last ex    damn she was annoying
  i say out loud to her imagine the smell
  based and brappilled
  one on the left looks like 80 of western women  ftfy  the rest of the 20 have the art hoe look
  incel  he probably goes home to his submissive wife and fucks her unprotected with zero regard for her pleasure every night
  yes have a completelycovered muslim woman walk by and watch those same hypocrites suddenly be respectful of the views of others
  what i learned after four years of college sometimes becky is a huge slut in disguise and is just conscious of her public image sometimes everyone assumes that stacy is a slut but she just likes the public attention and is not actually as much of a slut as youd assume
  the internet already turned them into huge sluts
  youre a whore stacy
  i agree with op thats just gross
  its a taunt like here is my ass but you cannot mount me haha
  left resembles rel while the right a stereotypical streetwalker as the artist probably intended        there are probably dozens of more normative sects around that demand modest attire without them having to be the most iconic of fringe groups
  you are free to be modest if you want to
  i base my world views on r/incel
  gyalkochan
  are muslim men holding signs telling others how to dress and behave    people having sex life the horror
  no youre rather not free to be immodest as evidenced through numerous public decency laws across the world and further restrictions on permitted apparel at different venues thank goodness and long live god
  t piercing spacer wearing bugchaser
  ops question was about attempting modesty and he certainly can he is even supported by the law
  observable universe being that big  nah
    any attempt at trying to control peoples sexuality and modesty is doomed to fail simply because of human nature     think about it you have an animal that can mate and breed 365 days out of the year and you expect that animal not to be a turboslut  and i mean both males and females
im conservative but i fully support slut culture makes it easier to stop similarly minded women
  are you implying that it is hard to be monogamous because it isnt most people manage it just fine sure there is a significant minority that are incapable of being loyal partners but thats a minority
  mate and breed 365 days  no such thing as ovulational cycles  t biology brainlet
  i am of the opinion that a lot of it actually hinges on the openness and acceptance of such behaviors not simply the act of premarital sex or whatever  if society begins to vocally accept it it condones devaluing commitment it condones single motherhood and it effectively weakens bonds    you can do the same thing but closeted or uncloseted actually makes a big difference
  this to be quite honest
  yeah youre complacence rather does nothing to discourage it its legislation that negatively ends up affecting promiscuous people that actually has an effect on it more than anything
  it clearly isnt doomed to fail because monogamy or at least something close to it has been the norm for the entire history of agricultural civilization excluding the past two generations    our nature is indeed debased and corrupt look at our closest evolutionary ancestors the bonobo they are perhaps the most sexually degenerate animals known to man but clearly we are able to be better than this
  despite this most young people are very uptight about actual nudity
women wearing clothes to emphasize their assets in a mostly sensual manner is but a manifestation of their societal and cultural subjugation
  despite this most young people are very uptight about actual nudity    explain how
  i have a theory about this its because nudity is the last remaining form of intimacy that we have how can you form meaningful relationships without intimacy
  womens fashion is a twofold social signal its meant to simultaneously convey fuck me chad and dont look at me you creep
  at least in the usa generation xers and below tend to be reluctant to be naked in front of others even if its in a casual situation where its to be expected in locker rooms most people under 40 change clothes underneath towels and dont shower naked
  i dont think it carries a specific implication as to who that would rather have to do more with their personal attitude and behavior  this is why strip clubs have bouncers to artificially inhibit people from acting on their natural impulses
  just because niger apes are too low iq to think about anything else besides sex does not mean that humans are incapable of human decency
  i base my world views on r/feminism
  the taste is even better
  what do you mean better   the bonbons manage to live a comfortable life where they solve their problems with sex and through social activities  i think we should be more like the degenerate bonbons than the warlike chimpanzees  what is so bad about sex and sexuality
  thats plausible a lot of relationships today just seem like hookups though whats more being naked together isnt necessarily sexual
  what is it with secondgen indian/arab/southern asian immigrants they tend to assimilate into the worst aspects of western slut/university leftist culture and you get pic related
  tfw ywn eat that asshole out
  i live in leafland and i always see indian mothers/grandmothers wearing modest traditional clothing and teenagers dressed like typical thots
  on the other hand people also give out nudes on the flimsiest of pretexts and every new generation keeps reviving topfreedom locker rooms seems like a pretty specific dated example to make an archetypal point out of
  trying to do what every civilized society before the mid 20th century did is doomed to fail  the fuck are you even doing on /his/ you absolute retard
  chinks shower naked  in school i would always to the bathroom stall to change for gym  this would annoy some people one time somebody tried to pull my boxers down but i managed to grab and hold onto it and no homoerotic fantasy ever took place
there are people who think they have the authority to dictate what the opposite sex does
  we  peace as an end and not a mean of the end  breeding is to in some way extend our lives humans are machines for living we should cultivate inmortality not peace
  theyre called feminists and theyre basically running most if not all of western governments
  i am always hoping most of the people here are sarcastic  whats funny is that half of them probably never have had a serious relationship with a woman  they view women as objects who must see things in the way they see them only because they never even try the other prospective
  most feminists would say people should be given a choice
  you realize that the word feminist relates to the equality of sexes
  feminism means equality  get out of here with your newspeak doublethink faggot
  using all my empathy i dont think theres any situation where id react by spreading my asscheeks and sticking out my tongue in public like the dumb sluts in op    seems like they view themselves as objects from their own perspective too
  feminism means equality  yes and north korea is a democratic republic
  why do men have such big victim complexes lol
  but dont be masculine
  yeah sending nudes is widespread this is or at least its meant to be a very private betweencouples thing nudes getting leaked is usually something scandalous   btw locker rooms still exist and people over 40ish still change openly and shower nude at the gym/pool theres some generational difference in regards to attitudes about it i think
    theres not victim complex here retard feminism has always been about female empowerment not equality
    back to the kitchen whores
  or maybe they just want to try to piss off the xtian by being slutty its not that hard to read the situation lol    if being masculine to you means dominating half of the human population then no your version of masculinity is going to die     yeah because women have kinda been fucked throughout history sweety
  this is 4chan in 2018
  thank you for addressing my points
  theres some generational difference in regards to attitudes about it i think    i dont have a car but if i did id just walk back out to it after lifting shower at home doing it your way seems almost ritual from my perspective
  addressing unironic screeching harpy feminist points  no thanks go back to tumblr if you want to discuss feminist lies
  yikes
  t jew
  mobile poster  yikes  actual feminist  jesus christ i hate 4chan
  chill
  or maybe they just want to try to piss off the xtian by being slutty its not that hard to read the situation lol  thus proving his point that empowered women are retarded whores  yeah because women have kinda been fucked throughout history sweety  gender roles consist of housework and child rearing while men toil in the fields and die in battle  oh noo muh oppreshun
  i remember both of these things east asians had little issue with stripping down totally to change even during puberty i also changed in the stalls or in an empty area in 6th7th grade eventually around age 14 i realized that everyones bodies have their own little flaws and there was nothing to be embarrassed about
  sweaty
  trip on mutt girl
  thus proving his point that empowered women are retarded whores  nothing wrong with being a whore   gender roles consist of housework and child rearing while men toil in the fields and die in battle  oh noo muh oppreshun  not having a say in their in own reproduction or having a say in political life is pretty bad just because theyre not doing as shitty as their husbands who technically own them does not mean theyre not oppressed
  its really hit or miss with those types too most absolutely are terrible people to be around but some are pretty based the former definitely outnumbers the latter by several orders of magnitude
  this is why muslims are based there is unironically nothing wrong with them coming to the west we need people to counter the degeneracy that has grown here
  i guess they never miss huh
  unironically this womens looks dont even come close to showing her true nature spergs will fall for memes like they always do tho pic definitely related
  becky would have made a fine wife with a healthy sexual relationship with her husband but in this timeline shes been turned into a slut she has no choice but to slut around because there are no longer any potential husbands around
  hahaha dude just do what ya want and be a whore lmao every single civilization in history ascribed importance to marriage and sexual relations just to oppress womyn   a societal system that recognizes inherent feminine and masculine traits and creates gender roles to suit them is oppressive but degrading myself to a warm fleshlight is empowering
  we need people to counter the degeneracy that has grown here    you dont need to show skin to slut it up which arab and persian women provide ample evidence for this solution is putting tile over linoleum
  you got a boyfriend i bet he doesnt kiss ya
  id still do it out courtesy and a sense of respect for others and myself but im not weird about if i cant but it would just be a preference
  thinking that becasse there are sluts hoes heathens decadent and immodest people means you have to be so as well shows that op is a true antibased bitch boi be a real man
  put a trip on so i can filter you
  the past sucked dick at almost every time compared to now and all im saying is that people should not be forced into any role just let them decide and chill out
  lol becky btfo
    obsessing over women you do not know irl is very unhealthy and will only bring about negative effects on your life stop immediately
  all abrahamics are compelled to grow their sphere of influence
  there are no longer any potential husbands around  this women arent becomeing sluts because of anything other than the fact there arent any good men left for them to be traditional with yea maybe women arent modest now a days but how many men out there regularly watch porn dont take care of themselves spend their days on the internet being retarded dont have a job have no desire to have children nor ability to support them arent loyal and give attention to the slutty types i find it ironic incels say im too ugly for a girl to like because really they just mean that the girls they find attractive dont like them how many people on here fawn over pictures of traditional women who are just makeup caked models showing off to the world for money im sounding like an annoying femcel rn but im just tired of the hypocrisy if you want a good woman dont waste time looking for one work on making yourself a better person and they will come to you be confident dependable responsible passionate and level headed and women will fawn over you regardless of looks and this is a simple fact
  look at the true chads perspective on this modern situation  
  whats your excuse goblino manners dont count
  unironically being against beasitlaity   cringe
  that said though becky is still the equivalent to a feudal lord with only a few serfs and a run down tower house compared to stacys louis xiv sun king with absolute power and a versailles palace
  i mean by that logic we are actually doing an excellent job of curbing degeneracy all statistics show that millenials and gen z are actually having historically low amounts of sex which is more than likely responsible for the incel phenomenon people in the 50s were much more modest for sure but they had sex signifigantly more than really any other generation and hence the baby boom that made baby boomers they just did it in secret so either people are more repressed publicly and have more sex privately or are more open publicly and have less sex privately you really only get to choose one or the other
reactionaries the thread  zzzzzzzzzz
  implying i dont just save pictures of attractive women so my threads/posts get more attention and yous  loling at your newfaggotry pleb

    gawd bless murrica
why is his so anti hedonism i dont owe you anything you little fucks
  the past sucked dick  maybe for lovers of mass surveillance and further hampering of freedom
  when i say the past do you think i mean the 90s
  belligerent leech
                      samefag
  90s not the past
i love decadency
  its in the modern era which is better than everything before it
  nah pretty sure the 20s were quite distinct from the 70s the 16th century is called the early modern era
  distinct but worse than now every point in history is worse compared to know in general

  are muslim men holding signs telling others how to dress and behave  not only are they holding up signs theyre   shooting people and literally cutting their heads off dumbass    did you forget that  did 24/7 orange man bad flush the last decade of islamic terrorism down your memory hole
  they are servile betas who yearn for an alpha to tell them how to live there life collectivists deserve to bullet
  true ive found that midlevel girls with egos are the worst of them all  they become extremely easy whores in order to get the attention that they think they deserve their willingness to put out puts more preassure on women just ahead of them to put out more in order to hold onto a guy but the toptier girls are better able to resist because they dont need to take dick every day to get men to do stuff for them    its somewhat important for a girl to have a realistic idea of where they are on the sexappeal hierarchy social media warps perceptions badly    thankfully people are having less sex now than ever before problem is that theyre much fatter hard thing to fix
why does 4chan attract faggots from all over the spectrum
dick cheese
and now some faggot is posting pornography in some vain attempt to delete the thread all youre going to do is get yourself banned you stupid cunt
  heres your no spooks individualism bro thatll be 000026 btc
  4channel has become famous because of /pol/ and reddit
  btc  youre a larger faggot than the faggot posting pornography
  ive found that midlevel girls with egos are the worst of them all  they become extremely easy whores in order to get the attention that they think they deserve  their willingness to put out puts more preassure on women just ahead of them to put out more in order to hold onto a guy but the toptier girls are better able to resist because they dont need to take dick every day to get men to do stuff for them    it really depresses me every time im reminded the extent to which sex is an instrument for women something to fulfill over objectives besides sex or attraction in their own rights  or that the attention they receive from it is more important to them than the act that it comes with you wouldnt be far off in assuming that women would hardly ever have sex if it wasnt such a powerful bargaining chip for getting other things from men
  all statistics show that millenials and gen z are actually having historically low amounts of sex which is more than likely responsible for the incel phenomenon    i have yet to see these statistics that claim millenials are having less sex broken down by gender so im more inclined to believe the reality is that male millenials are having less sex while female millenials are having the same amount of sex or more with a handful of men which of course artificially brings down the overall sex frequency statistic giving the illusion that millenials are magically becoming prudes while some how also being willing to hand out nudes willy nilly
  then destroy 4chan/4channel/whatever the fuck that stupid jap wants to call it nowadays all weve become is a skin suit being worn by a buffalo bill knockoff
  iirc going by the data is the same for both sexes    it has everything to do with more people being fat an unattractive and being at home on their phone/pc instead of going out cant have sex with people if you arent doing something in person with them people just arent social enough to meet potential partners    i think the general social survey had something about this but i cant be bothered to look it all up now since im at work
  yeah i usually turn my back or change one half at a time unless i know people wont be uncomfortable
  women love having sex for the sake of it with chad though
  ill believe it when i see the actual statistic broken down
  sleep tight commie
  hedonism is animal behavior thats why if you wish to be a stupid monkey go back into the forest of europe where you belong degenerate
  just threaten to shoot people who fuck and trust me sexual activity will go down alot
  consenting adults having sex with each other for the sake of it  how would reactionaries recover from that
  oribters
  by reacting  duh
  by being a bunch of npcs
  hedonism is animal behavior thats why  everything you do is animal behaviour in fact everything is hedonism because adhering to a particular doctrine or ideology is done solely for selfish pleasure of one kind or another
  and yet the virgin still gets neither
  saved       cuck islam is your last chance against (((feminism)))
  the irony is that most sandniggers in europe can get pussy compared to white men
  islam would be a fine religion if it werent the ramblings of a false prophet
  thus proving his point that empowered women are retarded whores  sacrilege is a virtue and ought to be encouraged by any and all means specially when it triggers weak willed shitstains like you
  going to hell lmao
  i suppose its best not to be mad about them theyll either repent or burn in hell eventually
  imagine being such a little nothing that you based your entire being around the threat of hellfire
  whatever you want to call it bro thats how they recover by putting their foot down and saying enough there is no inexorable progressive arrow of human history literally any progress can be reversed in an instant if enough men desire it
  alas when the chriscuck lacks any means of enforcing his retardation we can see him degrade to a pretty pathetic and by his own standars effeminate form of passive agressiveness
  we wuz sultans  somalians were indeed the kings and queens of great sultanates like the ajuuran sulatanate

  just dont forget it goes both ways pretty
  not finding divine will  weak
  the guy with the sign looks like a fucking wimp no wonder these sluts partake degeneracy
  this is nothing surprising this is the logic evolution of western and more specifically american society    americans have always been gross impolite and vulgar in their vocabulary and way to talk they say stuffs like get your shit together instead of just saying fixing do you realize that they need to make a reference to feces just to say to fix something and this is ingrained in their culture    i remember when i first was in the usafor work one of my colleagues said this expression to me and when i showed him that i was shocked he was surprised to him getting your shit together is a sound correct sentence that isnt gross    you people are always so gross and obscene this is disgusting    there are other examples expressions like butthurt shit happens are commonly used in the american middleclass and even upperclass     when your whole culture is about shit and butts why are surprised to see it becoming more and more degenerate each year     get your shit together
  do a favor to yourself and never go to australia spain or any spanish speaking countries for that matter
  ascribing divinity tou your own willful lack of self  ayy
  be careful you dont end this looking the same way
  weak
  poop tee hee    part of the reason people do this is to add stress to what they are saying when you stress someone their brain lights up and what you are saying grabs their attention if you meekly say fix your mistake they feel they can ignore it

  feminism is an inherently sexist term which promotes female primacy over males because it has fem in the name  this is ridiculously inane its on the level of saying that the word fireman is sexist and stops women from becoming fire fighters because it has man in it
  you sound like another butthurt baby who doesnt have his shit together not even for 8 hours a day at work
  looks at you suspiciously  what game are you playing
  what
  how is the iranian revolution a reaction if anything they just went back to their own traditional model of governance that existed for centuries way before socalled shah secularism
its been 20 years since the good friday agreement can you recommend me some comprehensive books that chart the history of the troubles and its factions without hinging towards either side

  im asking for an account of the troubles that took place since the 60s not the good friday agreement mate
taiwanese aboriginals were some of the most savage and cruel peoples on the planet responsible for butchery of englishmen americans and japanese civilians alike  their twisted culture revolved entirely around decapitation and self mutilation  the japanese taught them how to read and write gave them hospitals and medicine all at the cost of stopping the loathsome practice of ritual decapitation and mutilation  but the taiwanese aboriginals were far too savage and demanded blood so they rebelled against their japanese saviors  same goes for korea korean nationality is an oxymoron and the joseon dynasty was no better than a primitive tribe attempting to imitate chinese culture the japanese saved them from themselves as well
  taiwan mountain aboriginals on the east coast of taiwan butchered white sailors because white naval ships started hostilities by shelling their villages for fun german ships were shelling taiwan paiwan aboriginal villages from sea and this led to the paiwan aboriginals slaughtering any white man who was shipwrecked on their coast massacring the american crew of the rover and defeating the american marines in the formosa expedition in 1867 whites should not have shelled their villages
  taiwan plains aboriginals lived under dutch han and qing rule and had largely been sinicized so they were irrelevant unlike the taiwan mountain aboriginals
  most aboriginal people are fucking garbagetier op of course they rebel against their evolutionary betters
i blame corruption in the ming court
  
  imho fierce rebellion is generally the best strategy for dealing with europoids
  taiwan aboriginals did not have chinese style halberds or full blown swords like the painting they had short swords spears arrows and bows and muskets
  superiority is a sentiment
  japan was in the right for annexing an island that they won in a war in which they demonized the chinese even though the qing were at a similar level of military and proceeded to kick the hornets nest
  taiwan mountain aboriginals did not recognize any government authority and the annexation of taiwan by japan was null and void in their eyes
  aboriginals just want to do the shit they always do and be left alone ill admit that the government has a right to step in to stop conflict between tribes but otherwise they didnt have any right to subdue the tribes the way they did if they want to live in mudhuts let them live in mudhuts  the japanese brought it on themselves when the wushe incident occurred which was brutal but at the same time was essentially a pushback by the seediq the seediq purposely avoided killing the han chinese as best they could other than a couple accidental deaths i cant speak for the other tribes across the island but the japanese handled relations with them much worse than the qing
  peoples on the planet responsible for butchery of englishmen  based anglo killer    same goes for korea  koreans literally taught japs agriculture tho
  t sciencedenying leftist
  those arent even the aboriginals op is talking about retard
  japan was right to annex taiwan  no
  tjewpanese sub human
japan needs to realize they need continental clay if they want any shit done
kill plenty of shitskins  impose your culture  maintain your culture during the empire unlike the mongols whos culture was so niggertier that kublai khan was more of a chink than a mongol  today the modern world owes plenty to you  how can one island be so based
mongol culture so shieet that hardly anybody speaks mongolian
i was born on 9/11 so i dont remember it someone explain it to me it is the bane of my fucking existence because i share a date with it
it did not happen
literally just a meme
boom
  im 18 though
they didnt like how us foreign policy was almost exclusively antimuslim    
  projewish antimuslim i dont care
  your either a liar or very deceptive in your omission of the year
  well you see 9/11 was actually an elaborate conspiracy pulled off by secretly placing bombs which are strong and hot enough to melt through steel beams but quiet enough to not be heard at all into the buildings without anyone noticing in such a way that they would not be accidentally detonated by the flying of two planes into the buildings which was done anyway because you see buildings only collapse when the supports are vaporized completely in explosions fire has never once destroyed a building that would be ludicrous anyway the passengers on those planes were also either paid government actors or just randomly murdered in some unrelated way we dont really know the pentagon was also partially destroyed by a pler really shitty bomb that barely cracked through one of its walls which is weird when you consider a plane couldve been used and produced the same results the owner of the world trade center property wasnt there at the time of the attacks so its pretty clear he knew ahead of time i mean have you ever heard of someone not being in the place they own 24/7 me either but finally one last plane was destroyed just for the fuck of it i guess those people were probably actors to or something oh i forgot building seven well that one was destroyed by bombs too but with no accompanying plane for some reason though i wonder why the government wouldnt just fly a plane into it as well to complete the illusion but who fucking knows it was also on fire for several hours but that surely had nothing to do with its collapse again it was bombs that none heard and left no tracesoh wait of course people found thermite in the rubble i mean they found the nonexplosive chemical components of thermite that are identical to ones found in many generic office supplies but thats irrelevant but yeah rough day whos you vote for
regardless of how it happened 9/11 basically kickstarted a new era in us foreign policy they used it to justify everything
  it really is an unfortunate coincidence that all those muslims happened to be barbaric ponces
  watch ryan dawson

  it was proisrael and antirussia which generally meant prosunni except for palestine   he got part of his demands met no troops on the peninsula
  people born in 2001 are now old enough to post on 4chan
  this is an understandable strawman of an actually fucky event likely pulled off by the cia the mossad and alqaeda together which may have involved placing truck bombs in the basement with the intention of using them to collapse the lobby with the aim of blaming it on palestinians although that part did not work
  thankfully not until next month  but soon people who were born after 9/11 will be old enough to post on this website then youll feel ancient
  
  youve only got a few months left boomer
is abortion a philosophically resolved issue in society it seems that its only a radical minority of reactionaries that genuinely oppose it these days
  the idea of abortion in general i see as accepted in some capacity by most even if its only for special cases/medical necessity but for the foreseeable future there will be heated argument over the specifics many people will accept nuking a fetus thats only 6 weeks old but aborting a fetus thats past the first trimester is a lot more of a grey area i dont think its as accepted as homosexuality has become ill put it that way
  the bigger problem is that antiabortions are also antibirthcontrol there would be a lot fewer issues about wanting abortions if contraception was readily available its a mostly avoidable problem but some people want to shame women into getting pregnant and having babies because muh collapse of civilization and rampant betaism
  its murder you are literally killing a human person i am not against murder but leftists who usually are the most ardent supporters of abortion are strictly against murder at least against non right wingers are either own up to it or reconsider your position
  at least in the us there is a large minority that oppose it and in some states its a majority     even then people quibble about the exact ethics of it so i would not call it resolved
  youre killing a human embyo or even zygote that has not achieved personhood being human doesnt make you a person its just widely understood that way because its convenient since all known persons are human and the vast majority of humans are persons
  state what defines a human person
  being human and being a person a person of the human variety which without aliens and advanced ai and magical elves and fairies is the only kind    personhood is about having an ego and having agency and recognition of personhood generally involves individual rights in respect to it many humans were denied recognition of personhood throughout history a fetus it a protoperson a mass of cells with the person potential
  having an ego and having agency  could you get any more vague if you tried
  its not vague it just means being and recognizing oneself to be an individual and being able to act on it accordingly to what is generally understood to be a human level because as far as we know humans exhibit the greatest degree of personhood
  it just means being and recognizing oneself to be an individual and being able to act on it accordingly  so being a person means being conscious then does that mean i am free to murder people with brain damage or in commas as i please
  abortion done by women is for petty reasons abortion done by men is for rational reasons like population control in the ancient periods if you are gonna kill the baby just dump into acid once its out of your womb
  it only bothers people because they dont want to acknowledge that it is killing a human being when it is literally killing something that is human it merely lacks humanity at that point so it is much easier to do psychologically it only has moral significance if you think killing a fetus is the equivalent of killing a grown adult
  it wont be settled until a firm understanding of the point at which a fetus becomes a human is established unfortunately this seems to be arbitrary so i dont think it will be settled anytime soon
  no one cares about the fetus being subhuman its the fact its a future human that makes abortion morally in the wrong
  no because you live in a society that sees a person when they see a human because thats just how your brain is wired    personhood has never stopped one person from killing another in war personhood has very little to do with you being free to kill people there are plenty of times that people kill other people and there are plenty of times that people commit crimes that have nothing to do with killing that might be how you justify it in your head but it is generally accepted that the family of someone in a vegetative state can kill the family member because that human is no longer a person with any agency or meaningful potential for agency and is essentially treated like the property of the family the family is the entity that gets to decide whether or not to kill the human in vegetative state because society recognizes them as the people who would be harmed by it not the person in the vegetative state    as far as severe brain damage and comas no you are not free to kill them in the sense that you are not free to steal property or kill your neighbors dog however there do exist people who are recognized to have the right to kill them as one might euthanize a pet the rights of the person in the vegetative state are extremely limited and they are not recognized as having full personhood    the entire situation would be easily avoidable if antiabortionists werent so against the day after pill and other forms of contraception being readily available these are farm more convenient and almost no one would prefer an abortion over another method of contraception except that antiabortionists make it so hard to obtain that abortion starts looking like a real alternative because things like the day after pill are time sensitive or people dont take preventative measures because its made difficult and only realize their mistake after the fact and realize they should have done something to prevent it
morality is subjective to some extent in my country abortion in evil in your country it is everyday life
  i dont care either way i am fine with abortion when its merited one of my acquaintances had a kid in her mid 40s the kid is horrifically brain damaged and has dragged her whole family into hell over the extreme costs and constant effort to keep the little mongoloid alive the kid should be dead despite its humanity
  a large number of reactionaries support abortion within reason post 2nd trimester abortions should require approval from the state and a doctor otherwise do as you will
ghouls eat babies to maintain a false sense of youth debate me
  yes hes defective but most aborted humans are genetically fine and killed because their mothers are whores who cant control their pussies
  but contraception is still evil though because of the inevitable collapse of society due to sluts
  so why not just give women who cant control their pussies the pill just force feed it to them
  i appreciate your post
  women are subhuman they dont think about the pill when they want to fuck a dude they literally go oops when they get pregnant from no protection then blame the dude for not using a condom it would be best to find a way to reduce sexual intent in women entirely rather than just removing the penalty of unprotected sex
  it seems that its only a radical minority of reactionaries that genuinely oppose it these days    you are a redditor that lives in a bubble arent you  a pretty large percentage of people opposes abortion it is not a small minority
  just force feed it to them  better yet sterilize all men that have had premarital sex
abortion is murder
  sterilization wont solve anything its better to make women accountable for their actions before contraception they had to raise whatever shit popped out of them but we had arranged marriages to ensure there was stability now given freedom the dumb sluts go back to the paleolithic era letting guys fuck them then raising those mens young without their help until they drop dead
  just sterilize all men that cant afford to pay child support problem solved
  target the men  no women are the ones who can approve of abortion so focus on them only
  how do you expect single moms to raise children who dont grow up into criminals if they dont have any child support or husbands she might be responsible for raising the thing but youre the one that impregnated her and should be responsible for paying for it
  until men have a say in abortion no also child support that is pure money is stupid it should be actual child products so the disgusting cunt doesnt steal from her own child to finance her selfishness
  contraception isnt readily available  lmao
  until men have a say in abortion no  but if you want abortion to be illegal then what does it matter what they say i dont want to pay child support so i say you should get an abortion even thought abortion is illegal why did you even have sex with the slut were you raped    also child support that is pure money is stupid it should be actual child products so the disgusting cunt doesnt steal from her own child to finance her selfishness  you cant make up for actual hands on parenting with material goods you deadbeat
  are you a woman if so then fuck off
  im curious what do you think should be an appropriate penalty for feticide for purposes of this discussion lets define feticide as someone other than the mother terminating an embryo or zygote against the express wishes of the mother
  yes  the only reason you dont is because youre scared of spook laws set forth by a government youre told is real  youre afraid of hypothetical consequences and disguise it as ethic and moral standard   i want to cum in jennifer anistons belly
pro abortioniste are so fucking retarded    its an unstoppabke chain once the conceotion happens    a developing chuld is jsut as much a parasite on the mother as 6 y/o    women are evil greedy whores and they will reep what they sow
  it seems that its only a radical minority of reactionaries that genuinely oppose it these days  what the fuck are you talking about 37 of the us not only opposes it but opposes it in all or most cases thats pretty far from only a radical minority  
  the other 63 are literally nazis without even realizing it
  abortion that isnt related to genetic anomalies shouldnt be allowed
  i am married and think men having affairs single parent households and deadbeat dads are a major societal problem and degenerate i would like it if you kept this degeneracy to only one generation at least instead of procreating
  yes dude its always the guys fault never the women
  this is the same kind of absurd argumentation a carnist comes up with against veganism  just admit that youre partially bad  my god the oversocialisation of you people
  literal nazism
  means being and recognizing oneself to be an individual and being able to act on it accordingly  ok so like a teenager
  grievous assault and damages in proportion to emotional loss and actual costs due to pregnancy if you want feticide to be special theres no reason you couldnt make it a special kind of assault like rape which even thought sex has no punishment when consensual assault plus sex is rape assault plus feticide can be something too
  what are you smoking where did he say anything about it being good he just said theres a distinction just like the difference between cannibalism eating meat eating plankton and eating plants on the vegan scale
  you vetod the solution for both the womens side and the mens side and you want degenerate babies to be born out of wedlock to single parent homes without financial stability your only solution is arrange marriage because we both know you wouldnt get any pussy without your parents help
  turbo cringe    partly grown tomato plant isnt actually a living tomato plant because it doesnt actually have any fruit yet
  being a teenager is the transition from child to adult personhood is traditionally only granted after a coming of age into adulthood
  a tomato seed is not a tomato plant
  a healthy tomato seed in fertile soil with appropriate conditions is a tomato plant
  given time to grow with the resources it needs and assuming nothing happens to it along the way yes like a zygote
  only a radical minority of reactionaries oppose abortion  while america isnt very trustworthy to give us the average views on an issue because its awfully rightwing the pew polls say 25 believe abortion should always be legal 34 say it should be mostly legal 22 say it should be mostly illegal and 15 say it should be always illegal not exactly a tiny tiny minority that opposes it this is an issue that is still major and definitely not resolved
  not to hop on your nuts but this post is why im happy i made this thread on /his/ instead of /pol/ thanks
  its a mostly avoidable problem but some people want to shame women into getting pregnant and having babies because muh collapse of civilization and rampant betaism  do you think its unreasonable to expect people to be able to control themselves and not have extramaritial sex
  fuck off locke
  exposure was common in the ancient era abortion only seems evil since we live in a hyperempathic era that refuses the common sense of empathy for potential persons theyll cry for animals trees and robots though but fuck everything 
  why cant men control themselves and hump everything that spreads its legs
  because we are genetically hardwired to do the literal opposite of that
  he doesnt support abortion because its murder  cringe
  its human nature to pay child support too you deadbeat
    abortion is cringe and murder chief
abortion is murder and thats okay we have to many people in this world either way and the unwanted child will have a shitty childhood    we should make abortion clinics more common in the third world also
abortion is murder that being said people dont have an inherent right to live so i have no problem with either abortion or the death penalty
  personhood is about having an ego and having agency    so no one is a person
  the entire situation would be easily avoidable if antiabortionists werent so against the day after pill and other forms of contraception being readily available    i support abortion as a mean to control the quality of the population i oppose contraception as the risk of unwanted pregnancy is a useful tool to control the sexual behavior of people
  i dont belive its a question science cam answer science cant answer who has a soul or consciousness abortion is a philosophical question
wow so opposing total freedom of abortion is considered radical now
  is abortion a philosophically resolved issue in society     yes and no people understand that abortion is benefits society we have an idea of who is getting aborted and know that these people being born into shitty conditions would lead to more poverty and crime and state subsidies collectively    ethically anyone who pretends that fetuses arent viable human beings are delusional or disingenuous this wouldnt be a problem if we didnt have the same people advocating for empathy for animals and ai consistency matters
  you mean you hate that youre an incel
if catholicism isnt repressive why did northern europe leave southern europe in the dust for the last 500 years    the only catholic country to keep up was france who kicked off the enlightenment and had several secular revolutions    north america vs south america tells a similar story
  ulster  protestant  in 1555  what
  the catholic church is the workds oldest existing mafia theh have collected protection money from gods wrath for nearly two millenia
  they prospered materialistically but lost their souls in the process
  protestantism teaches that we are totally depraved but are renewed in our minds by the working of the holy spirit through the scriptures and as it is said in the scriptures when we see christ at the end of days we shall be like him because we shall see him as he is
  hurry up step one we all know what step one is right to occur
  this   how can bavaria austria switzerland belgium liechtenstein slovenia luxembourg and ireland even compete with rich bulls of wales eastern germany latvia and estonia  hahahahahaaha fucking southern poorfags
  if catholicism isnt repressive why did northern europe leave southern europe in the dust for the last 500 years    what     what the fuck are you talking about even fucking mexico had higher quality of life than many parts of germany     mexico is today a shithole because these retard cannot build proper nations but when spaniards have the land it was even ritcher than the united states who was also a backward shithole     take a book you fucking moron
  mexico became a shithole because the church opposed secular control
  i think a big blind spot in the protestant view on history is seeing the advantages of their situation as well as their successes in overcoming certain problems at the same time assuming the catholics were facing all of the same problems as the protestants its kind of like that old commie era joke how do we know communism is a superior system because it overcomes problems other systems never even dreams of every day    so you will have protestants all happy that they didnt have the inquisition investigating witches the problem is what inquisitors did for the most part was investigate and disprove mob claims of witches because according to the catholic church witchcraft was not a thing so instead of inquisitors the protestants had witch burnings    agricultural development poor relief education etc all followed a similar mechanism in catholic countries those were handled by monastic orders people who devoted themselves and cared for those less welloff through hard work and devotion in protestant countries monastic property was seized by the state and people were left without the protections and help they provided then the very same state which destroyed those safety nets stepped in to create welfare and stateeducation systems to replace them  funded by taxation not the hard work of monks    the worst quality of life witch burnings the worst famines the most horrible poverty in the west were all protestant things
  mexico was under the secular control of an ostensibly revolutionary socialist government for most of the last 100 years
  even fucking mexico had higher quality of life than many parts of germany  proofs
  because northern europe was within the hajnal line and had geographic isolation from more of its competition with more temperate climates and was on a much longer developmental arc for quite some time than the much more developed med region probably other factors related to selection religion might have had something to do with its since prots are literally just christian jews who dont circumcise themselves
  autism and geography
  721 kb jpg  if catholicism isnt repressive why did northern europe leave southern europe in the dust for the last 500 years    industrial revolution
  because of crops and metals  belgium was more industrial than england and germany also only in the catholic part of the country and it was because crops and metals
  it had more gdp but it was cos of the silver
  france austria northern italy and bavaria kept up also 500 years is an exaggeration polandlithuania experienced its apogee during the 17th century and portugals economic peak was during the first half of the 18th century for example conversely netherlands and sweden never recovered from their decline
  the only catholic country to keep up was the largest one in europe
  jesus that map is so shitty
does anybody want to refute my final   
  theres no period at the end of the first paragraph
  the nazis ran a socialist economy  conentious and i would use planned over socialist
  
  history class final read only by professor/ta  has shit pop history lede  proper nouns not capitalized  6th panzerarmee was formed in 1944  idiotic rhetorical question  using german as an adjective for wehrmacht   grammar mistakes  parenthetical dashes  doesnt even know how to cite  couldnt even get through the first paragraph maybe a c but i dont get paid to read this shit
  i dont think you need a comma in between 1942 and stalingrad
  hoo boy lets start with the complete lack of citations as mentioning a book in a parethensis is not an actual citation even assuming that these are placeholders for actual endnotes you have numerous claims that are not cited throughout the paper proceeding onto the substance    stalingrad buried the 6th army not the 6th panzer army the 6th panzer was a completely different formation that wasnt even formed until 1944 also total casualties was what hit the 2 million mark if you only count the dead by use of the term became the grave you only have about half of that german forces only got to the city limits of stalingrad in september of 1942 that is far after the germans were pushed back during the vyzama counteroffensive and not weeks ago that they were within sight of the kremlin and of course with the pushback during said counteroffensive it is inaccurate to say that victory was so close      the idea that hitlers actions brought germany out of the depression is also far from clear i can countermention guys like overy or tooze to demonstrate that after seizing power most consumption indicators in germany went down not up and speaking of tooze if you look at his tables in the back youll see that german wartime production does increase as the war goes on anemically after the big bombing offensives of 1943 but very steadily before that the german economy did sustain itself what it failed to do was to grow its wartime production as quickly as its adversaries      the statement that germany fully transitioned from an agricultural society to an industrial one is at best an oversimplification i know that tooze compares the per capita production of britain and germany on the eve of ww2 as being broadly similar within fields and britains higher per capita gdp is largely a result of a smaller agricultural sector than germany    1/
    you should probably mention that reparation payments were not fully carried out when discussing the effects of the depression you really should give some note to germanys high proportion of international trade relative to the size of the overall economy and the difficulties created   by a refusal to devalue currency i know tooze talks about it    its been a long time since i read the art of war but i am very certain he does not say that logistics determines the outcome of conflicts at least not so reductionistically and to state that napoleon was incapable of keeping his troops fed or resupplied nor to get his sick or wounded care is wrong for 99 of his campaigns tooze certainly does nothing to suggest that germany was too poor to wage a modern war he tries to dispel the myth of the german armored army on both ends it was pretty middle of the road for a european military power of its time    furthermore when discussing logistics in a modern warfare context preindustrial revolution things get a little different global carrying capacity is often more than adequate the usual limitations are in local carrying capacity railroads can only carry so much a day ports can only offload x amount of tons of cargo those are your two biggest constraints when talking about a war in europe not the overall production of arms or other wartime supplies the big constraint the germans faced especially in the ussr with all the rail gauge problems they had was getting supplies from factories in germany to the front its a long slog to go through but you might find this helpful     2/
    to suggest that luftwaffe failure to bring britain to its knees as a failure of industry is inaccurate it quite simply was beyond the capacity of aerial arms of 1940 to bomb a country into submission britian and the us would go on to drop approximately 25 million tons of bombs on germany and that would neither break german morale nor grind the german war economy to a halt although it did inflict significant damage and those are with countries that do have massive industrial advantages over their targets as well as prewar air doctrine that is centered around massive aerial bombardment and its employment germany on the other hand opted for an air doctrine that was centered around supporting their land forces with the luftwaffe acting as an adjunct to the heer this was obviously impossible to do in britain sans a land invasion occurring simultaneously also regardless of doctrine you started running up against technological constraints single engine fighters the fast agile ones that controlled skyspace of 1940 had tiny fuel tanks that limits how far you can escort your bombers especially if you want to dive and maneuver in an air battle even if we were to wave a magic wand and give the germans unlimited fighters unlimited fuel and ammo unlimited everything that they had in the luftwaffe stock come 1940 it would have been extremely difficult to actually defeat britain through air bombing owing to the lack of effective fighter protection everywhere that is away from the french coast where they can have airbases      german commitment to north africa predated barbarossa and depending on how you classify a front you already had multiple fronts before 1941 the war at sea and the bombardment campaigns that never really stopped    3/5
      to suggest that the germans were hit with another decisive blow after stalingrad and then to go on to talk about dday skips literally an entire year and a half of the war surely you can mention something more immediate perhaps just how the loss of momentum in the ussr spelled doom for a country that now had 3 adversaries all of whom were at worst in the same weight class economically similarly skipping to those militia forces hastily raised in 1945 is hugely reductive for the scale and scope of what youre talking about and bears little impact on what is at least supposed to be a discussion of war economies and by the time you see the volkssturm in action germany was no longer projecting force hundreds of miles outside her own borders    total war was going on long before hitler made a speech about it to claim that wehrmacht logistics was primarily horse drawn is not entirely accurate if you look in terms of tonnage moved multiplied by distance moved the wehrmacth was primarily train drawn transportation horses were primary at moving things from train stations to whatever the ultimate destinations but thats not the bulk of cargo or personnel movement    you should probably avoid using a term like military might when discussing the decline of qualitative manufacturing its very vague furthermore most of the german technological advances and their manufacturing strategy was around long before they were fighting a 3 front war again your linkage of stalingrad to economic destruction is not really accurate the ruhr bombings and far greater territorial losses of 1944 had a hell of a lot more to do with it and then theres this statement    4/5
    while the quality of weapons produced never deteriorated seriously enough to affect their performance  to which i would ask you to look at things like the komet or the he177s randomly exploding engine just to stick to air equipment or any number of tank analyses about how late war german tank armor was basically a crapshoot as to whether or not it would fatally spall on impact    is the focus on the uniforms really that necessary you spend what seems like about 1/6th of the paper discussing it and is the point being made worth the time and space spent on it not so much wrong and i dont really know that much about german uniforms myself but i question the emphasis    lastly you open your paper with a discussion of the primacy of oil and then never return to it you probably should mention something about ploesti and the synthetic oil production  fin 3/10 this can be a lot better even for a short slapped together thesis
  dumbarse
  this is your final this would be acceptable in highschool or your first year but as a final its embarrassing
  le operation sea lion meme  you fundamentally misunderstand why it never occurred    hitler always had a soft spot for the uk he was trying to woo them into submission he thought that the british empire was essential for the world and he also liked the british far more than any other country in the world    as a result he thought that an invasion of britain was the go to in the worst possible scenario and instead thought bombing them especially civilian combined with constant offers and friendly attitude towards their people could spark a regime change and end the war
  here      im surprised you actually read that much of the paper you probably just bumped his grade up by at least half a grade i was just going to let him get the barely passing grade he deserved
  at least where i am from the 3/10 i eventually awarded him would be failing and not just failed by a little a get the fuck out of the class you have no business here sort of failure
  freshman in college here how do i not make mediocre papers
  oh wow did he really say that
  i assumed this was like a freshman ge course since it was so badly written like he never took a history class before or written anything except a high school essay the stuff i spotted in the first paragraph as a ta is kind of roll eyes amateur hour shit but after skimming through your posts and others here id be tempted to fail
  the two best simple pieces of advice i can give are    1 assume your paper is being read by someone who thinks youre an inveterate liar and wont believe you if you say the sun rises in the east and sets in the west cite every single factual statement you make no matter how obvious and pedantic it seems    2 narrow is better analyze the hell out of something really small that you can draw a neat little box around instead of some grand sweeping narrative dont do something like what op did and try to address the entire war economy of nazi germany entire books have been written about that which still only shallowly dive into the subject instead try something like just the pressures on the uniform production industry which he seems to actually have an interest and focus in if he had just stuck to that he probably could have done much better or at least less badly
  stop reading pop history
  dont know if youre actually interested in this topic or just want to pass your class but that bibliography is seriously lacking in books that discuss the german war economy in depth only two tooze and milward are good but youre missing some classic works like overys war and economy in the third reich the economics of world war ii edited by harrison milwards war economy and society 19391945 and the two volumes by the bundeswehrs institute of military history i can provide more on specific areas like germanoccupied europe or the strategic bombing campaign if needed
take this opportunity to red pill your professor on how the holocaust didnt happen
  at least he could blame his f on evil communist leftist lgbt jew professors on /pol/ if he did that
  imagine going to uni for years thousands in debt and this is the best you can come up with in the age of mass media and the internet universities are useless
  germany on the other hand opted for an air doctrine that was centered around supporting their land forces with the luftwaffe acting as an adjunct to the heer  not disagreeing with the rest of your posts but the luftwaffes strategy was far more broad than the common view would suggest  
  it better be for a fucking 100 level course because its garbage for anything higher too much fluff and soft language
  stop being an altright wehraboo
  im not the op
cheers to the anon who actually took the time to give a highly thoughtful reply in this thread
post highquality quotes
  austrian economics  high quality quotes  leave
pick a historical figure and post a quote by them       i do believe we are going to have a major war with japan and germany and that the war is going to start by a very serious surprise attack and defeat of us armed forces and that there is going to be a major revulsion on the part of the political power in washington against all those in command at sea and they are going to be thrown out though it wont be their fault necessarily and i wish to be in a position of sufficient prominence so that i will then be considered as one to be sent to sea because that appears to be the route  chester nimitz 1930s
  oy vey goyim dont you know quoting (((globalist))) shills in a way that isnt entirely positive is antisemitic
  posts antisemitism isnt real  implies the world is run by globalist jews who need to be shot    which is it you cant have both
  posts antisemitism isnt real  yeah nah i didnt clearly my satire of anyone who criticizes any jew being labelled antisemitic flew right over your head  implies the world is run by globalist jews who need to be shot  no the world is run by leftwing globalist elites who need to be shot i think barbara spectre should be locked in a chamber preferably filled with zb but not because shes jewish because she is aforementioned globalist elite also that bitch really does not help the argument against jews control the world and are part of a hivemind  in short stop assuming everyone on /pol/ thinks that da joos are behind everything and have a better attitude faggot cheers

why do northern europeans act like they are a superior race when muslims like this writer ibn fadlan were clearly more superior in every way
  sunnis are permitted to do ritual ablution with water contaminated by menstruel blood dog corpses and water drunk by halal animals like goats cows and sheep or contaminated with their feces they will only go ballistic if its pig blood or shit while we will avoid all kinds of blood and shit ritual impurity is not the same as physical impurity najis only describes ritually dirty
you left out all the good things he said about the rus vikings    he was describing volga vikings the north germanic tribes travelling the volga trade route though the identification of the people ibn fadlān describes is uncertain17 the rūs appear as traders who set up shop on the river banks nearby the bolğar camp they are described as having bodies tall as date palmtrees with blond hair and ruddy skin each is tattooed from the tips of his toes to his neck with dark blue or dark green designs and all men are armed with an axe sword and long knife    ibn fadlan describes the rus as perfect physical specimens and the hygiene of the rūsiyyah as disgusting while also noting with some astonishment that they comb their hair every day and considers them vulgar and unsophisticated
  tsource ass  
  another muslim traveler a persian said     as for the rus they live on an island  that takes three days to walk round and is covered with thick undergrowth and forests  they harry the slavs using ships to reach them they carry them off as slaves and  sell them they have no fields but simply live on what they get from the slavs lands  when a son is born the father will go up to the newborn baby sword in hand throwing it down he says i shall not leave you with any property you have only what you can provide with this weapon 2    they carry clean clothes and the men adorn themselves with bracelets and gold they treat their slaves well and also they carry exquisite clothes because they put great effort in trade they have many towns they have a most friendly attitude towards foreigners and strangers who seek refuge    
  sunni hadith    narrated abusaid alkhudri    the people asked the messenger of allah ﷺ can we perform ablution out of the well of budaah which is a well into which menstrual clothes dead dogs and stinking things were thrown he replied water is pure and is not defiled by anything    
                  fatwas of the permanent committee  browse by subject  acts of worship  taharah ritual purification  performing taharah with water  remaining water left by animals  q 3 is it permissible to perform wudu ablution with drinking water left over by animals such as cows buffalos goats sheep and donkeys even if this water is placed in a container  the third question of fatwa no 21264  q 3 is it permissible to perform wudu ablution with drinking water left over by animals such as cows buffalos goats sheep and donkeys even if this water is placed in a container  a the drinking water left over by any of the animals that are lawful to eat is tahir ritually pure because the prophet peace be upon him ordered a person sick with fever to drink the urine and milk of camels  may allah grant us success may peace and blessings be upon our prophet muhammad his family and companions  the permanent committee for scholarly research and ifta
    narrated abdullah ibn umar    the prophet ﷺ was asked about water in desert country and what is frequented by animals and wild beasts he replied when there is enough water to fill two pitchers it bears no impurity      anas b malik reported that some people belonging to the tribe of uraina came to allahs messenger ﷺ at medina but they found its climate uncogenial so allahs messenger ﷺ said to them  if you so like you may go to the camels of sadaqa and drink their milk and urine they did so and were all right       ibn masud narrated  the messenger of allah saw stood among us and said one thing does not infect another so a bedouin said o messenger of allah if a camel gets mangy glands and we leave it at the resting place of camels then all of the camels get mange the messenger of allah saw said who caused the first to get manage there is no adwa nor safar allah created every soul so he wrote its life its provision and its afflictions  
  water left over after drinking by haraam animals eg pigs or predatory animals  goats cows sheep camels are all halal

  equating muslims as a race
  cant manage a cursory search on the subject  not northern europeans bulgarians retard over and out

i know that russia was formed because a bunch of leftovers from places steppefags conquered ended up banding together into one big group  but how the fuck do you have an empire that size with such huge spans of nothing how much of russia was civilised/populated and how much was just miles and miles of wilderness   how the fuck did russia work
  but how the fuck do you have an empire that size with such huge spans of nothing  you finance expeditions to frontiers and set up settlements  how much of russia was civilised/populated and how much was just miles and miles of wilderness   the urban centres in europe were then later very young cities like st petersburg omsk and vladivostok popped up when transports got better  how the fuck did russia work  it didnt there just wasnt anyone dumb enough to go through siberia only the european part had some population density and even then it was largely rural siberia is a barren wasteland nobody lives there the only problems with siberia are having   a to cross it  b to exploit it
  op outright states what people have been to insensitive to the slavic soul to explicitly say  slavshits are the detritus and excrement of free races men of the horse and bow who have long forgotten the exploits and pillage they wrought upon the little peasant folk of the east   never forget they are and always will he slaves everything they do is a reaction to stronger foes even the robust soviet nationalism just a defense mechanism putins provocations nothing but a poor attempt at clinging to the wheel of history begging to be somehow included in the coming world order which will revolve exclusively around east asia and the americas and their battleground in africa
  the geography was conducive for security the stretch of plains room with withdraw and pick the time and location of engagement and the cold winters and muddy spring served a similar defence to russians as did the circle of mountains surrounding persia or the alps defending italy or the seas surrounding britain
  yikes
why is society as organism corporatism in the catholic sense and fear of hobbes alongside a healthy dose of proud irrationalism such a common thread within reactionary politics    its almost as if if you asked a person whether society is a machine or an organism you can tell they are rightist if they answer organism and you can tell they are leftist if they reply its a machine    the flesh is weak long live the mechaleviathan
  people aint rational and you cant quantify the human condition as every perceived experience is within the framework of individual consciousness
  the flesh is weak  lol dis nigga dont even know the answer to the riddle of steel
when and why did anticatholicism fade into irrelevance in the us it was strong enough in the early 20th century to be a significant component of many political platforms including that of the second klan
ironically its because catholics got powerful
  people only really cared because muh irish immigrants  there were catholics like mathew lyon with huge public support back during jefferson and when kikes and chinks became the new big bad immigrant threat we dropped anticatholicism for antisemitism and antiorientalism
  holy shit took me a moment to realize what those alligators were based as fuck
a practicing roman catholic either believes they are eating the flesh of a man died around 2000 years ago or knows they arent but are hypocritical enough to pretend they do     both positions deserve ridicule
  postchristianity
  the 50s and 60s is when it really began to fade the emergence of a common white identity brought on by the increasing assimilation of the various white ethnic groups the cultural impact of wwii and the political necessity of whites working together in light of the civil right movement all reduced the sentiment by the time kennedy was being elected it was a big enough issue it came up but a small enough issue he still won after that it became politically irrelevant prots still think catholics arent really christian and have other weird delusions but its not a primary political concern
  and the political necessity of whites working together in light of the civil right movement  what most white people outside the south supported civil rights

did communism ever properly take off in ireland i see people talk about certain parts of the modern ira and about the easter rising being communist but just how communist/socialist were they and to what extent did they have influence  i cannot for the life of me find fucking anything about communism in ireland that isnt basically just socialism in name alone
  no it didnt
did communism ever properly take off in ireland  you want them to starve again
  le communism no food meme   the soviet citizen had a higher calorie intake than the americans in the 1970s
  then why does everyone call them communists
  kek
  the the modern ira really pira sinn fein that became less leftist oira was explicitly marxist
  gabbidaibm dindu nubbins rong
  source because that sounds like straight up bullshit desu lol
  the pira/sinn fein became less leftist  but arent sinn fein like the most left wing major party in ireland
  
  yes i just said less leftist official irish republican army wanted an actual marxist commie revolution they also have marxistleninist political party called official sinn fein
the reason communism never took off in ireland is because it basically never arrived republicanism in ireland was present long before communism became a thing and was much more about french/american republican ideas as opposed to anything more radical several attempts were madeboth violent and politicaland massive ground was gained in many areas by irish politicians  by the time the 20th century rolled round most of ireland was lead by the irish parliamentary party which was a relatively conservative group who represented ireland in parliament who were pushing for home rule aka a separate parliament for ireland  the threatened rebellion by protestant unionistsparticularly in ulsterlead to the formation of the irish volunteers by the irish basically the unionists formed militias to violently resist implementation of home rule which had just been approved by parliament and the irish militias planned to defend the implementation of it   when shit hit the fan with the 1916 rising only a small separate group of those involved were anything to do with socialism/communism however the narrative/romance of the whole thing lead it to be seen as much more involved than it was  during the woi a majority by a huge margin of ira soldiers were rural living males who would later join the aca army comrades association which later became the staunchly anticommunist irish blueshirts  every single irish government since the end of the war has been conservative or centreright and only very recently has that started to become somewhat diluted  simply put not only has communism never been much of a thing in ireland it still hasnt really got a foothold anywhere arguably with sinn féin however a huge amount of their voters particularly in northern ireland would ditch them for ff or fg in a fucking heartbeat if a united ireland ever came around sfs current mandate is generally reliant on a fear of splitting the vote just like the dup
  ira were communist at the start but after the revolution werent
  the ira of the war of independence werent communist see  a small subsection of the volunteer force for the rising were but at the outbreak of war a majority of the volunteerswho later became the irawere not really communist whatsoever it was in fact after the civil war that the ira slid more and more to the left the entire reason it split up so much in the 60s and 70s is due to disagreements over how socialist it had become
  irish leftists and british rightwingers both have an interest in portraying irish nationalism as being inherently leftwing its mostly bullshit
  catholic countries have never seemed to accept communism
why has europe invented most things  why have wealthier and more populous regions like india and china not invented much  is it lack of competition cultural emphasis based on maintaining the status quo    second major query is invention tally objectively the only way to guage tge significance of a civilisation  pic unrelated
bump
  their desire to succeed to love themselves and to be proud
  before industrialization it didnt
  so no one else had a desire to succeed they all wanted to fail come on    thats not true though look at the scientific revolution
  scientific revolution    
  thats only true from about 1650 ad onwards beforehand the title goes to the middle east or china depending on the period information was mostly flowing into europe from the east before the 16th century this includes classical greece which is when trade opened with the near east and they started getting materials from the near east maths and philosophy from babylon and aadministrational systems from the   achaemenids was fundamental to the development of the hellenes
  but over 97 of inventions are ultimately european
superior genetics
  this the idea that greeks were a distinct monlithic european identity who would look upon modern british and germans as their successors is a cringey victorian meme that is still too prevalent today and needs to die
  asians lack creativity and are perpetually mired in petty nepotistic squabbles over inheritance and right to rule their continent is plagued by naturak diasters and the geography and fruitfulness of the land perpetuates disgusting levels of over population while allowing variegated assemblages of disparate ethnic groups to evolve all of whom hate each other indians dont on the whole have comparable iqs to whites and live in a fucking jungle chinese have to contend with steppe niggers and constant flooding droughts and being venal insecure manlets just not conduciven to a high culture or rapid technological innovation    20th century psychologisms created by vermin souled germanigger and italian chimp nationalists is why
  snowniggers  literally werent even aware of two story buildings for most of history  superior genetics
  europe has always had autist who wanted to discover and invent for pleasure at a higher rate than any other race on earth
  asians lack creativity  then explain their religions if the chinks had no creativity they would no civilizations at all you dumbfuck
why was there such an invention boom  did the ancients not invent anything was there no inventive culture in alexandria or athens
  how retards think inventions    x invented x  oh boy now we can improve human society    in reality    x invented x  x then stores x away and uses the knowledge he gained from inventing the object for his own selfish pleasure  x when asked how this could help others just laughs and tells you to fuck off    science has never been about helping humans only gaining knowledge
  that is objectively false what are you doing on a history board you clearly dont know any history and have no desire to do so
europe was not special in the slightest until the mongols crashed the rest of the civilized world and the italian merchants brought all the worlds knowledge into one place
  read human accomplishment by charles murray
  which proves that guys point according to that book most of europes achievement only place after the 1600s which is conviniently after stuff like mongols turks and arabs where eastern stuff transferred over to the west    if the europeans were that great before then they wouldnt have got cucked so hard in the crusades and would have used their brain to somehow outsmart the arabs
  then explain their religions  most asian religions dont even have gods
  objectively  its a bit like asking why the us/uk has had the most platinum music albums the ones who established the rules of the game they developed tend to outshine others who only recently decided to play along and adopt those same rules until the scientific revolution in europe you didnt have the kind of institutionalized tradition of selfpublished academics and fameseeking amateur tinkerers looking to be the first to accomplish something purely in the name of expanding and exploring their particular field of expertise an inventor before these times was mostly an artificer who made something in order to solve a problem for a patron or just to amuse them and rarely did he have a reason to write books about his work every few centuries youll get a compilation work where his inventions may turn up but by then his own name may have been forgotten to time
  dont give credit to europe give credit to the uk and usa 95 of all noteworthy inventions came from these two countries
    long story short european countries learned from each other and improved on each other
  second major query is invention tally objectively the only way to guage tge significance of a civilisation  no  why has europe invented most things  because european culture is faustian    faustian bargain plural faustian bargains    idiomatic an agreement in which a person abandons his or her spiritual values or moral principles in order to obtain knowledge wealth or other benefits    idiomatic a deal in which one focuses on present gain without considering the long term consequences
europe invented ceramics
western europe is the only place on earth were the industrial revolution happened even the agricultural revolution independently arose around 5 times but the industrial revolution it only happened once in the uk/france/dutch part of europe to be exact        undermine european accomplishment its such a common sight to underplay the reason why europeans are so dominant and why they won the game for these past couple of centuries you only need to open a science and math textbooks to see the incredible amount of european names attached to a bunch of things    which proves that guys point according to that book most of europes achievement only place after the 1600s which is conviniently after stuff like mongols turks and arabs where eastern stuff transferred over to the west    are you seriously trying to suggest that mongols turks or arabs have anything to do with european accomplishment they obviously didnt as the closer you got to arab turk or mongol proximity the further you got from the center of industrialization scientific discoveries and inventors that changed the world and is the main reason why we live the type of life we do now they had no effect in fact one needs to look at spain a nation that had access to an entire continent of new crops but spain was nowhere near the places were most european inventions occured it wasnt the nation that recognized the power of industrialization it wasnt the site of many scientific discoveries the same is true with italy it had closer connections and access to the works of the romans but the scientific discoveries and inventions didnt happen there the most powerful european empire wasnt italy it was the uk the combined force of ukfrancethat general northern western europe area was responsible for almost every invention that it makes even the roman empire look irrelevant
  the only objective way to gauge the success of a civilization is whether its extinct or extant   any other measure is purely subjective
  how do you think industrialization happened idiot
  wouldnt success in modern times when you are no longer restricted by your geography and location be better proof of superior genetics than being succesful during a time location was everything     or are you saying that the egyptians created civilization because they were so smart and the nile delta had nothing to do with it
whites were lucky enough to look close enough to jews that they decided your countrys would be good places to subvert
  an agreement in which a person abandons his or her spiritual values or moral principles in order to obtain knowledge wealth or other benefits    well shitpretty clear as day
  people who quote the bell curve are usualoy hapoy to admit that jews and asians have higher iqs its a good smack in the face of the people who say that theyre just championing it for white people or that the test itself is desinged for white people
  ashkens are only above average whites they are complete morons compared to smart whites
  people who quote the bell curve are usualoy hapoy to admit that jews and asians have higher iqs    i do alot of trolling and i can tell you that is false
      case in point
  racist nepotism not iq
  ashkens are only above average whites they are complete morons compared to smart whites  what about the smart ashkenazis
  lol ive had this conversation so many times now it feels mechanical the responses are so predictable    pic related its you
  thats not true though look at the scientific revolution    you mean the enlightenment because that was in the early days of industrialisation
  115 is already smart dumbass
  the only reason this happens is due to our empathy if we were like blacks our kids would be slicing you up in the streets for fun and any attempt to make us feel sorry for you would be impossible
  moron
  makes sense  jews are smarter than some joe sixpack nfl fan in ohio or redneck in kentucky but the creme de la creme is higher or neck and neck
  lol delusional
  now you have to consider the size of theur population they are smart sure but they dont have more smart people than 250 million white people do not even according to the bell curve     but you dont care youre just here crusading against the heritability of iq because your own population has pretty low average
  rednecks arent average whites theyre bottom tier whites joe sixpack types probably have like 90 iq 100 ish is the average low level white collar professional 110 you start getting more accomplished
the number of white geniuses is higher than the number of all jews but the average jew is smarter than the average white
  your entire strategy is trying to make us feel sorry for you so we dont exterminate you hilarious you must grovel to gentiles so they dont kill you despite being a master race no a parasite race thats more accurate if we whites had lower empathy you would be extinct in europe right now
  true but thats simply a matter of differences in the population numbers if jews were proportionate to whites thered be more jew geniuses than white geniuses
  imagine if whites dealt with jews like muslims do good luck trying to find a jew in afghanistan
  the smart kike actually thinks stupid whites are the majority of our population white trash are a minority in our genome most whites are decent people who can pass highschool
      the upper end of the iq spectrum is filled primarily by jews its those very rare geniuses that push everything forward     charles murray notes that the proportion of jews with iqs of 140 or higher is somewhere around six times the proportion of everyone else harpending hardy and cochran sport roughly the same equation 4 out of every 1000 northern european is 140 iq but 23 out of every 1000 jew is 140 murray also relays a report from skyhigh up in the genius range when he notes that a 1954 survey of new york public school children with 170 iqs revealed that 24 of the 28 were jewish
  what a load of shit jews follow primitive garbage a culture yet claim to be geniuses the fact you subhumans even respect your very insane rabbis shows how stupid you really are
  and this is the whole point there are so many whites that jews dominating something is at the same time proof that theyre snart and that they practise nepotism 5 million people still dont have more 130 people than 250 million people even with a difference of standard deviation     funny how the people trying to discredit the bell curve with jews forget about this little tidbit its almost as if they dont actually know about the subject but are just ideologically against the heritability and ethnic disparities in iq
  there are around 5 million jews and around 250 million whites in america 250 is a bit more than 6 times 5 mate
im not the biggest fan of the jews but i begrudgingly respect them their interests are usually against the interests of the majority population of the nation due to being outsiders and nationalism typically being against outsiders but even with many opposed against them they always pull through and win time after time after time despite being outnumbered consistently that takes skill that takes some sort of intelligence that you have to respect even if you detest the results    there are ultimately like every group good jews and bad jews however due to their average high intellect when you have a jew that is evil they can be extremely capable and destructive and they can do it right under most peoples noses     their high verbal iq especially is something to note it gives them a natural advantage in propaganda and manipulating language the greatest linguist is chomsky for a reason this might also explain the media dominance thing somewhat
  that statistic is only for 140 iq    when were talking up in the 180 iq range there is practically no whites at all its almost entirely jewish because they have a greater proportion of the upper portion of the bell curve
  jews have a primitive culture that belongs in the bronze age yet claim to be smart jews are the origin of the brain cancer that is abrahamic religions that teachs one to remain ignorant about reality genesis shows how dumb jews are compared to how greeks believed the world formed
  its not hard at all though quite the opposite think of it like this     the difference in average height between a chinese man and a swedish man is only 6 sounds small right on a societal level that 6 difference in height translates to a day and night difference between the two countries in terms of height even an average swede will absolutely tower over the chinese and a tall swede will be shocked upon entering china and seeing just how small they are    now imagine if that difference was 15  well 15 is the difference in average intelligence between a white and jewish man ashkenazis are absolutely towering over you on an intellectual level to the point theres no set of circumstances you could ever win against them in a free market scenario     to be born white in a world of ashkenazis is like being born handicapped youre a fish in a barrel for them
  180 range  shut the fuck up kike the only known humans with iqs that high are korean gooks
  four in 28 means that jews were 7 times more likely to be geniuses 250 million is 50 times 5 million try again
    yep i dont accept them as a chosen people of whatever but theyre one of the rare succesfull tribes of me love the flicks    i just with they were more no news is good newstype folks im tired of jews this and jews that
  and yet they somehow have a large amount of influence in powerful sectors of society like finance and media despite being a small amount of people and despite being kicked out of hundreds of countries they overcame all the inherent hostility against them pogroms genocides etc to still become one of the most accomplished peoples of the planet they always seem to prevail in the end and those that challenge them end up getting fucked stalin died right after he started going after the jews we all know what happened to hitler the romans christianity face it christian values are meaningless in the west now etc    honestly maybe they are the chosen people
  shekelberg there are more whites with 130 iqs than jews on this planet
  reading comprehension
  he thinks the bell curve is evenly distributed     anon no no no no no
  yes due to whites having high empathy not some silly idea that jews are smart
  theyre not chosen they just are on average highly intelligent and they have a historically tight knit culture that values education
  biggest cope its a unique cope though ill give you that
  you werent so empathetic to the africans and abos
  he will now say that slavery and colonisation was orchestrated by the jews
  if you were smarter than us then you would have made more advanced societies than us yet you didnt all you made was primitive desert kingdoms that invented nothing then act as though you geniuses what a joke
  if theyre the chosen people why is their nation state such a shithole
  niggers and abos dont appeal to empathy they threaten you instead its only thanks to jews that blacks use guilt to stop whites from gunning them down
  our cousins did that
  upper end of the iq spectrum is filled primarily by jews  jews are overrepresented in that group but there just arent enough of them to fill it
  murray also relays a report from skyhigh up in the genius range when he notes that a 1954 survey of new york public school children with 170 iqs revealed that 24 of the 28 were jewish    wrong
  you still take religious hacks like rabbi seriously yet claim to be geniuses even engaging in a sick pedophilic penis snipping ritual
  only 4 of african slaves ended up in north america rest went to the med colonies of the caribbean and latin america
  170 iqs are extremely rare kike enough horsecrap
  but it did
  america is basically jewish  they built your culture the cultural identity of your nation is built largely on corporate marketing and your hollywood films/music/etc and that got exported to every country in the world     surely you wont deny americanization is occurring right isnt that part of globalism perhaps your biggest export besides military maybe is your media and the soft power/influence it holds on other countries rap music is now the most popular genre in fucking slavic countries with 0 black people thanks to the us wasnt it the jewish music industry promoting rap weve all seen those a wyatt man comics right    and if the jews didnt make these works or help promote them it must have been the whites right but then why are you complaining about jewish hollywood and jewish media and the like in the first place
  public school children with 170 iqs  hmmm
imagine being a tribalist and claiming to be a race of geniuses jews shouldnt give a shit about their bloodline if they were really geniuses as tribalism is a primitive behavior in humans and the smarter humans get the less their instincts control them
  even rich jews had to in many cases put their kids into public schools during the 50s because they werent allowed in white private schools
  glad that you admit it wish you kikes would be prouder and more open about it we all know it own it
  not for ashkenazim as outlined in the post      charles murray is a liar    funny he wasnt a liar when he told you that blacks had lower iq than you in your favourite book the bell curve theory
  arabs didnt influence western scientists  scientific discoveries and inventions didnt happen in fucking italy  absolute brainlet post
  racist nepotism and white empathy now shut the fuck up your tribe has done nothing to prove its mentally superior to us
  we dont need iq test to prove that blacks are morons they prove it all the time every day
  jewish music industry  hahahahahahahahaha
  wow now that is what i call delusion
  so you agree that blacks do have lower iqs you do realize that you cant first use jewish high iq as an argument against iq    let me see you say it blacks have lower iqs go on
  white empathy  proof of this or are you basing this on your own assumption and myopic ethnocentric view  jewish iq has quantifiable proof and there is historical and anecdotal evidence backing it up     europeans having the most empathy i must saycolonialism and the holocaust do not back that up    racist nepotism   what group isnt nepotist whites practiced nepotism for generations jews and non wasps were actively kept out of ivy league schools until the early 20th century       look under the us
  yes its because of your racist nepotism
  and not your racist nepotism for pure wasps
  its a good thing to bar you from our colleges as you are evil nation destroying parasites    you have nothing to show mental suprenacy as you jews behave like raving wild animals rather than geniuses more motivated by primitive ego than scientific cuiriosity
  house of saxecoburg and gotha  pure celtic
  i dont deny this    the thing is though that blacks may have lower iq on average but there are still plenty of smart blacks and the ones that are smart will be used for eugenics to improve the black stock whites wont have access to those same eugenics in the future we are gonna rebuild the black race with gene editing and while whites get dumber and dumber with each generation the black man gets smarter in 100 years blacks will be what whites were this century our mildly intelligent henchmen they will rule over you
  ok no arguments here just the rantings of jethro on another meth bender again figures
  based jew
  its not my fault pure celts have no achievments so they have to borrow nord cuck achievments
take a good look whiteoids    this your ruling class
  why wont whites have access to those same eugenics and why woule black people all trends show the opposite that blacks have extremely dysgenic mating practises
  because we dont want you to a black ubermensch populace is already been developed in the lab as we speak trust me my rabbi told me    your masters will be black
  yet whiye people still rule over you its funny how brownies always try to use the jewish iq to dissuade people from believing in iq not realizing that yheyre affirming it if jews are so much smarter than whites blacks are literal retards
  now this is some high quality cope
  im jewish who are you talking to
  laugh it up white boy    blacks will have 105 average iq by the end of the century the white iq will be in the 90s and thats only provided you still exist
  no youre not youre just pretending because if you told your actual ethnicity we would rip you a new one
  thats just white trickonomics giving you false hope hotep
  does meth make you think the letter y is a t
  105 average iq by the end of the century  lofty aspiration to be sure
  they cant even deny it because its what they whine about all day
  no writing on my phone while walking home from work does you should try it jermaine a little work never killed a race
  white people rule over you  then why does /pol/ always complain about the jews controlling everything and think theyre somehow magically putting negros/arabs in white countries
  iq is pseudoscience there is no proof thst blacks are dumber theyre just unsuccesful because of racism  hahaha jews have high iq thsts why theyre so succesful whitey btfo    which one is it
  i didnt know jews were european    
  jews rule over whites whites rule over lower races its called a hierarchy and youre at the bottom of it no matter whos at the top
   is pseudoscience there is no proof thst blacks are dumber theyre just unsuccesful because of racism    who said that the only people who denied the validity of the bell curve in this thread were whites triggered by jews massive iq
  noneurooean jews like sephardi and mizrahi have zero nobles
  im not black the average black is quite low and the average jew is intelligent the average euro is above average the average american white and slav is mid tier average hispanics below average average blacks low aboriginies very low but not everyone is the average and its a game of distribution and proportion
  my fellow european brother thank you
  i said black twice lol  nobodys even denying that except people fucking with you
  because 97 of inventions were made after europe became rich before that the east led most innovations that eventually spread to europe but once europe became wealthy because of colonization trade capitalism stability and rationalism they industrialized and invented the modern world literally everything around you was mostly invented after 1750
  still more european than mizrahi or sephardi so the unifying factor is not being jewish its being european
  so you saying we waz jewish
  like what
  again if it was about being jewish why are the sephardi and mizrahi jews so less intelligent its a simple question
  the east led most innovations  yeah like circumnavigation  oh wait thats all bullshit
lol antiwhite faggots  imagine having a stick up your ass the length of europes accomplishments
  i mean if you wanna consider ashkenazi jews white because it makes you feel better about being owned by us thats fine by me    it wont save you or your countries though
  jews living in europe count under that
    honestly why not both    my objection to jews is not that theyre stupid theyre clearly very intelligent its that they seek to destroy in others what they lack in themselves if jews didnt have such massive pathologies that led to destructive behaviours then they would have always been accepted by the nations they settled in especially in white nations which seem to be more tolerant of that kind of thing
  jesus
  i agree that greeks are not a monolithic european identity but if you took an ancient greek forward in time to 1900 they would consider the british or germans as being more of a successor than most places outside of europe considering that western europeans were pretty much obsessed with classical antiquity and took a lot of inspiration from greek law architecture politics sculpture philosophy mythology etc so they would see more in common with british or german culture than they would anywhere else
  ok  but youre a jew like     jews are genetically superior because high iq  imagine being this monodimensional
  asians have higher iqs  yeah sure if you only take samples from rich school children in shanghai and beijing and ignore the hundreds of millions of braindead worker drone peasant farmers
  jews are superior for many more reasons than iq iq is just one of the methods we use to interpret jewish over representation in societal contribution and accumulated wealth and power
  no i just dont consider jews smart as only ashkenazi are smart
  this includes classical greece which is when trade opened with the near east and they started getting materials from the near east maths and philosophy from babylon and aadministrational systems from the   achaemenids was fundamental to the development of the hellenes  man the science of the east was more akin to mysticismsorcery and empirical knowledge rather than what the greeks and by extension we in the modern day do the idea of experimenting and proving a theorem or clearly defining an axiom started in greecealso europe after the renaissance is a legit spiritual successor to ancient greece because europeans rediscovered the ancient knowledge during these years it started not being a taboo by the church
  ok
  unironcally arabs
  i dont need to reconcile shit
  oh so jews are superior physically in terms of health and spiritually too
  per capita stats  relevant for countries with populations under 30 million     does this mean qatar is the most powerful country in the world because they have the highest gdp per capita
  is that anime any decent is it at least 1/3 of loghs quality
  qtar also has the most slaves in the world
  phones cars electrical lamps the internet but for these things you beeded to build upon existing technology which were developed in china and the middle east
  maybe because capitalism is quintessentially the kike ideology in which they thrive the best lets see a fascist regime and how they will handle that
  and i asked you like what you just answered the question i didnt ask in the first place
  nice irrelevant cope the graph says nothing about power or gdp its mostly about innovation the quality of the country and wellbeing of its population
  the quality of the country and wellbeing of its population    the criteria for most of these quality of life indexs is how well these countries treat transexuals and how much affirmative action they have not really anything to be proud of honestly
  because they werent allowed in white private schools  based as fuck
  and sure the innovation is just how many different gender neutral bathrooms they design
  all of the innovation categorys are per capita and all the top countries are low pop city state tier countries    its not really an achievement when st lucia has 1 noble laureate in all of history and is number 1 on its list per capita rankings are irrelevant for countrys with under 3050 million in population because countries with pops that low are effectively non character players
  reading comprehension is seriously lacking in this one
  hitler dubs checked and no i dont think anyone oppose the bell curve itt just the supremacy part
  and 2/3rds of those were solely uk
  so jewish achievement is a meme toobecause theres only 15 million of them
  what is the enlightenment
retards on /his/ believe that trade didnt affect any level of science development in europe   wew lad
  which development
itt reddit contrarians  dont bother to me faggots
i attempt to remain neutral in political and ethnic shitposting because i like when the board actually functions but im tired of how many obvious jews are on this board for the sole reason that they spew militant jewish superiority and if not that then historical revisionism
  its funny because they never talk or post threads about jewish history ever
  not the point where europe surpassed the middle east and china in terms of inventions
  innovation is a slide the first ones go faster and gain momentum
  lol look at this idiot who thinks most genetic jews arent atheists nowadays
  compare that to the abbotier norse mythology from the same era mate its about as stupid the only difference is that jewish mythology survived to this day
  the mediterranean was literally the cradle of civilization from which you derive yours you snownigger
  because all their neighbors hate them say what you will about israel but its financially prosperous and has a strong army
  noneurooean jews like sephardi  sephardi are from spain you mong
  they seek to destroy in others what they lack in themselves  and what is it they lack exactly
  implying ancient greece didnt regularly interact with the phoenicians and interbreed with them
  yet our kingdoms were more advanced than your desert shitholes
  atheist jews dont exist all of you are nuts who believe yahweh created you to rule us
  so youre saying snowniggers had civilisation handed to them on a plate
  the lowiq answer the post
  add that to the fact that most inventions particularly those in and beyond the industrial revolution require external stimuli in order to manifest earlier it was rare for someone to invent something to the benefit of humanity or science rather than for some practical end and their inventions relied upon already preconceived collective knowledge complexes this is especially the case once you realize that synthetic deductionist creativity becomes proportionally easier and harder as time moves on more knowledge leads to easier synthetic production but more knowledge equates to newer discoveries becoming ever more reliant upon the knowledge pool and harder to manifest so after the industrial revolution western europe was in a determined path towards the discovery of the modern world as for what lead them to such a path i think some other anons have the right answer to simplify newfound wealth from a variety of causes
  historically those regions also produced a lot of the technology  what made europe superior is the combination of the university system and aristocracy
  why
turks are based
  its the opposite they were crucial in making the modern world come to fruition
  ever heard of the expulsion of the jews of spain you subhumanoid the sephardi in israel are from nafri like tunisia or from turkey not spain geeze the goyim really dont know
  all sephardic jews originate from the iberian peninsula and fled to turkey and tunisia romaniote jews are also european and have no nobles
you will never live in early warlord china   you will never elope with a cute high class chinese girl just before the japs invade
  she looks mixed taiwanese native also  not joining ccp to fight japs with her
  well see about that
  joining the communists  uhh no thanks id rather live
has there ever been a more depraved morally bankrupt hand rubbing state than venice
  the brtish empire  isrel   its a close match though
  id also add turkey and belgium
  yes america
he did nothing wrong
saudi arabia
the swiss
  genoa which sold more kipchak soldiers to mamluks who fought the crusaders
  i thought you were going to say vatican and i was going to say venetian but you said venice so im saying vatican    also this      and i guess this        israels a levied proxy state by the west as a beach head into the near east post nuclear age
would civilization have emerged if yeast didnt turn neglected grains and fruit into bread and alcohol
  bread and alcohol arent important
    the thing that makes up the main diet of almost every civilisation isnt important
  alcohols bad for your health and the chinese did fine with rice
    rice grows everywhere
  reco 10 fav menduco
  cannabis is more important to civilisation emergence by a metric magnitude fuckton
  if rice doesnt grow everywhere why are chinese food restaurants everywhere
  pull that shit up jamie
  what is the bean and corn diet of ancient mexico  yes civilization did emerge without yeast
  ancient mexico  civilization  lol
  
  what is sake
  tfw mexicans made alcohol from corn  there is literally no civilization without alcohol
  it doesnt have to grow everywhere just in enough places close enough together to sustain at least one civilization which it did many times over
  blazed and potpilled
  that means teetotalists are barbaric
  mostly just women and women had nothing to do with creating civilization so the theory checks out
if the germans helped the boers during their 2nd war with the british would the transvaal and orange free state have survived
the boers were extremely well armed they received as much help as could be given and inevitably they lost
  no the british could have easily blockaded any german support for the boers and would also likely have retaliated against the germans by fucking with german foreign trade
people speak of somme verdun stalingrad and while im sure it was awful can it really compare to the sheer brutality of melee combat in past     i know cannae was an exception but just fucking imagine it80000 people hacked to death on an area that was probably less than a square mile literally hacked to death not shot or killed by shrapnel or blown apart by a shell   why do we percieve medieval/ancient warfare to be more humane
  because you could see your killer and had every physical chance to stop him if you were able it was the only just form of war because if you were bested you deserved it by your incompetance bar being killed from an arrow/rock or from the side or back
what makes you think there was no melee combat in ww1
its psychological when you are in a melee you are focused on the struggle you dont think too much about anything else    but in wwi a lot of the time soldiers were waiting waiting waiting then something happens a shot a shell gas and they die it is more terrifying because you are constantly ideal but waiting for death to appear
post historical shitposts that have brought harm and chaos  ill start with the time someone got a whole village killed during the qin dynasty  in 211 bc a large meteor is said to have fallen in dōngjùn 東郡 in the lower reaches of the yellow river on it an unknown person inscribed the words the first emperor will die and his land will be divided 始皇死而地分77 when the emperor heard of this he sent an imperial secretary to investigate this prophecy no one would confess to the deed so all the people living nearby were put to death the stone was then burned and pulverized36
  damn six syllable shitpost  its like ahem fuck entity but more literary first emperor die and land divide
  ahem kratistos
whats the most retarded thing hes ever said
  american foreign intervention is the cause of a lot of the worlds problems  ignores the exact same problems in a different time and place because america wasnt involved there  cant see his own confirmation bias  makes me think hes an overrated linguist as well
  that america is worth saving
  american manufacturers will send jobs to eastern europe instead of asia because they are racist and dont want non white working for them
  probably during his phase in the mid/late70s when he was defending the khmer rouge the essay distortions at fourth hand has not aged well he basically accused a journalist of making shit up with regard to what was happening inside of kampuchea
  who was the other western commie i think he was british who also defended them a lot to the point where he was invited to cambodia and when he got there they murdered him
  he was invited to cambodia and when he got there they murdered him  hilarious if true
  this
  
  he still defends this too  at the time according to the facts i had i was right
  zizek  grow up
  probably peter hitchens
    i really hope it is
  pol pot dindu nuffin
this guy is my hero although i think syndicalist is very outdated very last century but in general hes basically the only personality that is a true american socialist still alive
  there are tons of geniuses maybe using the word too liberally in one field who are shit outside of it dawkins for example
  malcolm caldwell
  chomsky is spot on about criticism of american imperialism
  that human beings are born with an understanding of linguistic concepts
  his criticisms are just america bad    this 1960s shit is stale and stupid
  then how can children learn languages so quickly
  not really he mostly just points out historical events that are forgotten by the american public is it a sin to point at well documented history and say look the us did this and that
  theyre born with the capacity to learn linguistic concepts not with the concepts themselves children can also learn games and math extremely quickly doesnt mean there is an explicit universal playstyle that governs the catching of a ball vs the catching of a frisbee
  tbf america has played a big role in destabilizing the third world would they have been better without america who knows
  implying most of those nations werent already unstable as fuck
  america made them more unstable there were some legitimate democracies that may have worked without us intervention
  iran absolutely most of those shitholes in africa and south america no
  iran  guatemala is another good example of cia undoing possibilities for liberalization
  allende was elected president of a functioning democracy and the us had the military start a coup another good example
  ill put it like this almost everyone including the left pointed at the us entering ww2 as justified and good to stop someone like hitler and now warhawks try to frame any potential us foreign conflict in that light as the us standing up to a genocidal maniac bent on destruction    after the vietnam war the whole new left and hippie movement ect was strongly against the war and saw it as useless us imperialism on a poor third world nation simply fighting for freedom from their tyranny now there are people who will point to every us military conflict no matter what to be the same as that    chomsky is responsible for the latter to the point where any us military action is considered wrong he is the reason so many leftist in effect become bin laden shills people who are completely ignorant of history and are bin laden as just another third worlders who was backed into a corner by the american bully they even think those people who died on 9/11 deserved it now if you hate america and want to see it destroyed i can totally see why you would like chomsky and his take on foreign policy
    guatemala was always and will likely always be a shithole im not a pinochet worshiper but his reign clearly wasnt that terrible for those that werent persecuted and their economy has continued to grow from there to the point that they have nearly firstworld living conditions today
  the cia installed a neofascist regime in order to prevent a democraticallyelected reform government from nationalizing land that the united fruit company was allowing to lie fallow  instead of reform guatemalans got mass torture and political repression
  any us military action is considered wrong  a lot of us military action is wrong overthrowing democracies even if theyre socialist in latin america and supporting terrorism in the middle east has been terrible for people in those countries
  their economy growing only matters for the rich and the american companies who actually benefitted from it people who tried to make the economy growing matter for the common man were the persecuted
  wwii was justified none of the more recent conflicts were because we have documented history showing clearly black on white that they werent   leftists call it as it is you try to make some bullshit excuse while avoiding to point out that the us did evil which it did do
  if you dont want the us to overthrow legitimate foreign governments for the profit of some billionaires then you must hate america  jesus christ as a libertarian im ashamed i share a party with people like you
  you dont have documented history though im willing to bet you think bin laden was a cia agent or some similar conspiracy shit you dont call it like it is you have been taken in too much by oikophobia conspiracy theories that make you into a formless fourth column     the us is considered evil in a vacuum and those that have conducted similar actions are always excused this chomsky spouting che shirt wearing bullshit died off in the mid 2000s anyway
  not by the time of 9/11 but obl was definitely supported by the us in the 80s
  strawmanning since you cant respond to what i actually said      youre missing the point having the default view that everything the us does foreign policy wise is pure evil is fucking stupid and it leads to really dumb conspiracy stuff how many dude this war is over an oil pipeline citationless infographs are stoners going to make about any conflict
  thanks for proving my point no he wasnt and you clearly dont understand bin ladens ideology at all which shows the fault in the chomsky america is always the bad guy worldview
  there are equally a bunch of people blindly supporting the us there are definitely a lot of people blindly hating the us even in america but there is also legitimate criticism of american foreign policy and i think that having a critical stance towards said policy will almost definitely lead you to conclude that american intervention since ww2 has been by and large a bad thing
  not same anon but was he not part of the us supported mujahideen      it wasnt primarily about oil but that doesnt make it okay  the default view that everything the us does foreign policy wise is pure evil is fucking stupid  even chomsky doesnt believe this
  bin laden shlls  i grew up in north california during the bush administration and as crazily often autistically outspoken they were against the iraq war not one of them ever voiced support for bin laden    possibly youre correlating understanding bin ladens motives as support but thats a dangerous route to follow
  bin laden was initially prous when he realized they would help him in afghanistan prince bandar bin sultan admitted this in an interview    afghan soliders in alq were trained by the cia    why wouldnt the cia help him he was from the richest family in saudi arabia one of their biggest allies and fighting against communism
  no us supported was very clearly limited to afghan forces    not only was bin laden a foreign arab but the entire basis of his ideology was for muslims to not take any support from the us and make their own islamist forces which he would fund since he was a billionaire     im actually mad that literally no one seems to know this or has done even a little bit of research on this because they are still running on the chomsky inspired conspiracy shit from the whole loose change era in the mid 2000s inb4 some brainlet post that newspaper they clearly didnt read as a gotcha to me even though bin laden says in that interview that he got no help nor saw any help from the us
  they dont understand bin laden though
  just curious what was it about it wasnt about wmds
  lol  if he actually say that i ll lose 84 of my respect for him
  fear of wmds being provided to jihadists  eliminating americas strongest military adversary in the middle east  gaining a second strategic position next to iran/reducing dependence on sa  asserting americas reemergent military dominance following the fall of the bw  yes drilling into that sweet oily pussy  the thrill of conquering  getting revenge on the guy who tried to kill daddy
  he was from the richest family in saudi arabia  so why would he need money and material support from the us then
  no us supported was very clearly limited to afghan forces  naturally the us denies evidence that it supported terrorism
  the confines of operation cyclone were that support would be limited to local afghan resistance forces if you have proof to the contrary then post it
    they encouraged the volunteers from   the arab states to join the afghan resistance in its struggle against the soviet troops based in afghanistan
  it takes a lot of money to set up an underground jihad organization
  which is what bin laden had
  im going to guess it took even more money than he would have wanted to spend and uncle sam is happy to help the enemies of communism
  bin laden was a literally who during the afghan russian war though i really dont get what point you are trying to make is fdr responsible for the vietnam war since the oss trained and armed the viet minh against the japs in ww2
  theyisi  pakistan are the ones who supported the rise of the taliban in the civil war as well
  the isi was funded by the cia    he was a massively rich saudi guy coming in to support islamic radicals not a nobody but yeah pretty far from the main guy  and yeah arming communist rebels contributes a communist insurgency would follow my point that arming fundamentalist rebels contributes to fundamentalist insurgency
  if were in agreement that his motives were the us support of israel and occupation of parts of the middle east then they perfectly understood him
  he thought the world was run by a jewchristianhindu conspiracy remember he hated india too and was critical of the us for not giving more support to islamic forces in indonesia since they were basically guilty of ethnic cleansing the guy was absolutely batshit just imagine if some alt right kid who was really into evola had 7 billion dollars and decided to create a vast terrorist network with it    also bin laden cited chomsky as a favorite writer of his
  he knows he does this and hes said why he does it he thinks its the responsibility of people to hold their own government accountable rather than focusing on other governments
  did he actually say that
  the us was involved more indirectly there
  he acts like america is literally the only reason that the muslim world is violent when the reality is that its literally always been that way
  ive never heard him say this but hes said many equally stupid things regarding foreign trade
  america itself was unstable in its infancy
  this one is correct and hilarious
  posts on /his/  too braindead and illiterate to see that a majority of the instability and rage in the middle east is caused by a wave of military defeats and failed regimes as a consequence of israel and us policy
  grammar is universal and innate
  us troops should occupy syria to protect kurds
  colorless green ideas sleep furiously
  it isnt you tard stop spouting literal islamist propaganda as if it makes you smart
  its surreal to me how while /his/ probably has a lot of people willing to criticize noam youve been so retarded that youve essentially silenced them no one wants to offer their criticisms because they dont want to be associated with you youve poisoned the discussion against your own opinion
  youre spouting bullshit bc you have believed in this chomsky take on foreign policy for years now unchallenged on them and now that you are being called a retard for that you have no recourse but to sputter about    no anon the mid east isnt shit because the mean american and jews ruined it its shit because its full of a revised islamist ideology that arose from the ashes of ww1 and the ottomans being defeated in the region these people are big boys and made their own choices
  t sam harris    but in all seriousness america did contribute to some of the turmoil in the middle east not all of it but some of it it was bad before but us foreign kind of made it worse
  messing with sand niggers for fun and profit isnt moral foreign policy let them be backwards savages in piece the middle east being full of a shit ideology doesnt justify american foreign policy thats not how that works
  it most definitely is every single nonamerican would agree with that
  well eventually you realize that there is no point in engaging with raging brainlets might as well argue with a bleating goat
    no anon the mid east isnt shit because the mean american and jews ruined it its shit because its full of a revised islamist ideology  no its shit because america and israel fucked it up this is /his/ on /his/ we know the history we know that the middle east was full of secular socialist ethnic arab nationalist governments and that did not sit well with america and israel so america and israel funded religious extremists to fight the socialist arab governments and that is what fucked everything up  you dont get to lie about easily verified historical facts you piece of rotten shit
  they have nearly firstworld living conditions today    i dont think youve been to guatemala anon
  youre spputing bullshit conspiracy theories again anon stop pretending you know history
  butthurt anti american leftist euros opinions are worthless and based on nothing substantial anon
  these are all widely know facts easily verified even through just a cursory search on wikipedia you are a propaganda bot
  that leaves out about two thirds of the history out    for starters secular socialists were already fighting secular socialists the ussr invaded socialist afghanistan the taliban didnt start the war nor did the usa the taliban pushed the whole antiimperialism angle same as the socialists before them but the international left didnt socialist invaders dont count as imperialists to them    and the usa at times took the side of the secular socialists over the islamists as when iraq invaded iran saddam only stayed in power so long because the usa wanted a foil to iran
  the international left didnt condemn socialist invaders
  youre spouting islamist conspiracy theories and propaganda and calling others a bot just because its oikophobic doesnt mean youre not a cucked tool of foreign influence that wants to murder you iran and saudi arabia and pakistan are the ones funding and supporting all these terrorist groups not da jooz and americans
  the socialist took over afghanistan in a coup and had to beg the soviets for support against rebel forces the taliban didnt form until after the war     ignorance of the soviet afghan war it the lynch pen of this retarded chomsky take on foreign policy that so many millianials are infected with because they think it makes them smart
  iran and saudi arabia and pakistan are the ones funding and supporting all these terrorist groups    two of those are close us allies and the inclusion of third one makes me suspect youre jewish or just a deluded neocon
  oh really and i suppose iran saudi arabia and pakistan are also involved in the destabilization of latin america thanks for the history lesson donald
  completely moving the goal post after your bullshit gets called out  gg retard
  i know the history of my country  protip my european country has no history with islamic nations however there was convert involvement by the us government trying to upset our democracy in their favor
  he didnt discussion here is us policy and hes pointing out all the shit usa does   yeah we know you abducted this guy chopped him up and dissolved him in acid but our defense firms earn a lot of money so its fine     this isnt donald trump this is american policy since forever trump is just totally honest about it
  look at the fucking profile picture nigger  its chomsky what is chomsky favourite topic let me give you a hint latin america you were the one who moved the goal posts we were not talking about the middle east until you focused on that area of the world just so you can blame the arabs for the sins of america and israel
  no anon we are very clearly discussing foreign policy in the mid east and he tried to steer the conversation to latin america since he was called out on his bullshit lies
  were discussing mid east foreign policy stop having an emotional break down because your basic bitch mid 2000s woke world view is being disassembled in front of you
  hes mostly right about that too though british play a big role there too from the start and french
  no hes not this attempt to blame everything on sykes picot isnt going to work on anyone older than 16 who watches 911 truther youtube docs anon
  nowhere did i do that but sykespicot is a part of it   do you even know who cemented the rule of saud family   do you know that british and americans literally staged a coup against iranian government because they wanted to nationalize oil industry
  you are wrong turn the computer off and go back to watching cnn
i mean where is that islamic terrorism before 80s   majority of muslim world was moving towards socialism and reforms
  seriously why would you mention the iranian coup as if literally everyone hasnt been aware of this by the time they turn 16
  where is that islamic terrorism before 80s  heres a start  
  you mean when iraq invaded iran just one year after iran became a churchstate and the soviets killed rogue communist amin to prop up puppet communist karmal was leveling villages part of those reforms
  because its the most glaring example of american and british actions and methods in the middle east and their active role in fucking up the region     thats not islamic terrorism thats just terrorism
  funny you should mention iraqsupported by americans at the time
  thats not islamic terrorism  palestinians killing jews for being jews and not muslims isnt islamic terrorism you should be in the olympics because you have some serious mental gymnastic skills i bet even the russian judge couldnt give you less than a 10    heres some more by the way 1915 even stated as religiously motivated in the article so you cant worm your way out of this one  
  you got the right chief there was no religious motivation there that was nationalist motivation
  yes the usa supported socialist dictators too this is basic knowledge
  you have no idea what the bso was about do you
  plo literally had christian leaders   tries to paint them as isis   yikes
  only isis are muslim terrorists  an attack isnt islamic terrorism because some leaders werent muslim even though the rank and file were and considered it to be a jihad  yikes
    also i like how youve completely skirted broken hill because it doesnt fit your narrative
  isolated event
  goal posts
  kek
  just imagine if some alt right kid who was really into evola had 7 billion dollars and decided to create a vast terrorist network with it  i wouldnt want for this to happen but id absolutely love to read a book series about this happening
  you hit the nail on the head this perfectly explains obamas running american presence out of iraq to let the earliest ruins and testaments of civilization on earth get razed to the ground by homosexual mercenaries all because of the megalomaniacal attitude you just described and desperation to please those who have that attitude because they voted for him in preference  to not only 499 of americans at the lowest but the entire human race    people talking about making america great again arent seeing the bigger picture that things became much worse than just not great almost from the moment that that king of megalomaniacs was elected
  america was at its best during the cold war because it invaded other countries
  based boomerposting i miss bill oreilly too
  denying the cambodian genocide and defending the khmer rouge because communism i dont think hes ever fully walked it back either
  the left
  its wrong to take either side mindlessly but there is evidence that gives merit to the latter and with a proper understanding it is still correct to say most american military action is incredibly destructive/selfish/whatever i see your point though
  nothing america is the greatest threat to world peace
  can confirm  no direct link between bin laden and us funding has ever been established    there were like 30 different factions fighting in afghanistan and the us found it pretty hard to fund even a few of them having to go through pakistan to do so the majority of mujahideen made do with what they had
  they were orderedg to kill the woman who was with him who criticized pol pot they killed the wrong one by mistake
how about that missionary who turned atheist got a divorce went to school to equal chomsky degree in linguistics and call him an idiot
  kissinger is absolutely and unequivocally /ourguy/
  this
    i see no antisemitic implications in the denial of the existence of gas chambers or even denial of the holocaust
  i think he is talking about pinochet / chile   it is true that pinochet taking power was actually a better outcome for chile than allende
  his entire theory was disproved by some native south americans   
  as a brazilian i can guarantee you this country has been fucked since 1889 when coffee barons overthrew the popular and decently run government
  sykespicot is a part of it  the fact that the ottomans had ruled over the land for 500 years ensured that no arab tribe could lead with any level of authority seeing as the other tribes would believe they are entitled to their own self determination simply put by taking control and unifying the tribes together individual countries the brits and french stopped decades of civil war large scale fragmentation and brought advancements in technology to the regions so they could become prosperous unification into multiple nation states was the best possible outcome for the peninsula  the only thing the brits and french did wrong was not explain their thinking before hand to their arab allies
  the only thing the brits and french did wrong was not explain their thinking before hand to their arab allies  you forgot about israel that was definitely a mistake
  it is true that pinochet taking power was actually a better outcome for chile than allende  its not really clear
  and the us had the military start a coup  the military started the coup the us just didnt intervene against it theres a reason literally every thirdparty investigation into it has turned up exactly zero american involvement in the coup
  wtf am i reading  zog shills on every board now  the anachronism of a cold war airstrip is /ourguy/ because its a political affront to its billion neighbors  chomsky diagnosed the fake news epidemic a generation ago shitlords bow your heads
  that makes sense though actually  somebody could like jews and just believe from evidence they gathered that gas chambers werent used  just like i dislike jews and believe they were
  império quando anão
  they have nearly firstworld living conditions today  anon i just dropped by to say you are absolutely wrong im not supporting what the other lad was saying but this is stupidly wrong     guatemala has one of the worlds highest homicide rates 3125/100k  one of the lowest hdis in latin america 065   and per capita gdp 4500  and over 75 of the population live under the poverty line 125 a day    be more mindful next time you post something you know nothing about
  unfortunately i do believe its that clear  due to the chicago boys neo liberal market strategies chile has the second highest gdp per capita out of any south american country the highest hdi ranking of any south american country and due to pinochets heavy handed militarization chile never became a narco state avoiding the plague of cocaine simply chile is the best south american country to live in now i understand that chiles success isnt a justification for all the murders that pinochet sanctioned but overall pinochets coup was beneficial to chile
  then why doesnt he criticise israel fucking jews are so eager to speak ill of the west but conveniently gloss over anything negative about their holy clay
    he does all the time there is even a debate about it with alan dershowitz and he taught and trained my parents were in auschwitz and you guys are still assholes finkelstein
  big if true
  all of it his peak retardation is around 20042009 when altglobalisation was in its heyday and he and naomi klein were the dynamic duo of idiotry all his writings from that period are pure cringe gold
  makes me think hes an overrated linguist as well  thats putting it lightly he is plain wrong as linguist like so wrong its not even remotely plausible  
  he was referring to chile retard
  yeah then chomsky says theres literally nothing wrong with islam terrorist are simply fighting back against le evil western imperialism and that any criticism of islam is islamophobic hes a joke and people are finally starting to realize that cant wait until all the leftist he helped cultivate shot on him as well bc he wasnt radical enough
  pinochets followers had way better stats than him it is not that chicago school is a good school of economics it is just better than the standard latin american populist macroeconomics high pensions high wages low taxes high debt high inflation real pensions and wages going down pay for higher pensions and wages with more debt and inflation what you mean real pensions and wages are still going down i keep printing money why am i still poor
  this
has there been any research done into what personality types or social circumstances causes consumeristic behaviour     things like buying a sweater that unbranded would sell for 5 but slap a supreme logo on it and people will gladly pay 300     another example is the mercedes benz x class which is for all intents and purposes a rebadged nissan navara same car totally different price
the transition to supplyside economics
  obviously it was done to benefit traders but what caused consumers to not only accept it but propagate it
i live in a scandinavian socialist democracy utopia here i work as a waiter and my girlfriend works in a flowershop  i work in a company that rents me to different restaurants and i can choose my shifts  i only work 3 or 4 days a week sometimes less our combined income is less than 3000 euros a month   we spend about 600 euros on rent we dont have a car and no debt what so ever  we dont want anything we have everything we need and every month were able to even save some money    if i for some reason need more money i just simply take more shifts but im extremely happy with having so much free time  is this the future of employment if youre happy with less why do you need to work so much because having more money is only useful if you want new things continuosly  of course i live in this utopia where i dont have to worry about healthcare and stuff and its easy to live without a car
  virtue signaling     its just im rich virtue signaling rather than im a good kind person virtue signaling and instead of benefiting poor homeless people it benefits rich capitalists
  you live in an utopia for an avarege earthling your position would mean living in a favela without improvement in sight  these ppl want more money because money makes them safe  safer place to live safer financials so making kids isnt financial suicide and we havent even got to the part of improvement of leisure time
  marketing and not just ads but advanced marketing techniques   pay style magazines to say every fashionable family should have a piano  everyone starts buying pianos
  call me again when you have kids
  is this the future of employment  since there is large number of people who would work harder for less money no      advertisement people who own the supreme logo pay people like youtubers to create this enviroment in which having supreme logo implies wealth and social status plus its cheaper to make shit products and then advertise them than it is to produce quality products
  but here people can make do with so much less money  less work   but im an exception most people here even with this possibility throw themselves into getting debt cars flats summer houses boats you name it   mindless consuming because with the little time they have off from work has to be spent buying new stuff
  i live in a low population ethnostate with stable climate easy access to renewable energy very few natural obstacles an effective nonscalable social contract and not much foreign interference  life is good  woah what did he mean by this
  shouldnt it be something to achieve  oh wait if you want to police the world and be the big boy with the biggest guns then youll just have to sacrifice all this good stuff i suppose
  not even burger but those boys with big guns allow you to this easy living otherwise those thirdworlders might not sell you their resources and labour this cheap or certain european empire might act a bit demanding forcing you to enact conscription like finns have
  fuck off back to your 3rd world shithole you dont know anything about europe or scandinavia
  neither do you apparently
  m8 im not him or a burger but the backbone of developed economies are built on a neoliberal world order imposed by the imf and world bank via debt slavery and the military arm of the us govt in order to suppress labour movements and wages and restructure their economies to allow multinationals low entry barriers and high wealth extraction to produce so many materials required for our benefit at absurdly low costs
    imposed by the imf and world bank on developing nations
  but why is it then that life is good in scandinavia which doesnt hold any power compared to usa  us rules the planet but the citizens dont benefit from it besides that nearly no one imposes a military threat to them woohoo
  but why is it then that life is good in scandinavia which doesnt hold any power compared to usa  because its in the team us scandinavian companies operate in the same market as us does    the citizens dont benefit from it  thats bullshit keeping oil cheap greatly benefits the economy and so does cheap african copper or enforcement of intelectual property
  but why is it then that life is good in scandinavia which doesnt hold any power compared to usa  because there are nations like the us canada and countries of western europe that have a net benefit from this order  these multinationals that are based in nations like ours extract wealth from the developing world and end up circulating their wealth within nations like ours some of it ends up benefiting the average citizen through economic stimulus creating employment and some of it more or less depending on your nation is shared by the whole nation through tax revenue which means that the whole of a given society in the developed world gets a fraction of their wealth put into public infrastructure and social security among other statefunded institutions  us rules the planet but the citizens dont benefit from it besides that nearly no one imposes a military threat to them woohoo  the citizens do benefit from it to a degree just like in nations like yours via economic stimulus from wealth extraction and statefunding via taxation  besides that nearly no one imposes a military threat to them  besides imperialism during the cold war why do you think the us has installed regimes in so many nations where democratically elected leaders promised land reform a welfare state nationalization of industry etc these forces of economic protectionism and opposition to neoliberalism show a sincere threat to this economic order enforced by the us and to a lesser extent other netbenefiting nations through military collaboration
    also what    said price controls on many goods help deflate our cost of living
  its team eu to which the us doesnt have access to mad burger
  if only anon if only
  ethnostate  the only real ethnostates in the world are israel and north korea and they suck dick im not even for immigration but every country that elevates racial purity to a part of authoritarian state ideology is basically a shithole where truth means nothing and obedience is everything
  that depends on your definiton if we go by a political unit that is populated by and run in the interest of an ethnic group then theres a whole lot more of them
  without the us military enforcing the value of the dollar everywhere your currency would be worth shit or you think youre paying the chinese or saudis in kronas    the truth is countries like sweden can efficiently produce shit with your sky high wages and taxes you can only susbsist by selling shit to each other because no one in his right mind would buy shit from you economies like sweden are unicorns and cant last in a multilateral world
  japan is a top 5 economy and china is a near dominant economic force both are extremely successful ethnostates through different means     bbut uighers in china and brazilians in japan  tiny irrelevant minorities
  omnipresent mass media  neoliberalism  mixture of entertainment with education and advertising in pop culture  lack of religious or socialist opposition to consumerism in the modern day    brand recognition trumps quality and price for most people whether or not they realize it and everyone naturally considers themselves immune to propaganda to a large extent when really we are not combine this with a yearning for status symbols and an inability to distinguish pleasure from happiness and you get the way things are i understand that people need to pay bills and not everyone can fart and read philosophy all day but our excesses in the modern west would seem horribly indulgent and selfish for most of history where the public welfare was given more consideration in economic planning and arbitration alongside profit they were in some ways much more charitable and future minded than today but capitalism thrives on short term decisions which are essential for its adaptability this will bite us in the ass when shit hits the fan due to stacking negative externalities weve ignored especially for the environment and ongoing political tensions exacerbated by mismanaged resources and the resurgence of violent tribal identities like jihadists malthusian greens and reactionary/commie populists against the forces of the new mcworld
governments play a huge part in it through economic policy first of all they force everyone to accept fiat money of which it can always provide more and more liquidity unlike gold or other precious metals that are limited resources    then it offers very low interest rates encouraging everyone to borrow from companies to consumers these very low interest rates disincentives saving since the government can create all that shit youre saving in a second with no effort and make it rational to borrow and consume as much as you can    tldr its a rational behaviour in an economy with artificially low interest rates
  israels probably okay if you an ashkenazi jew      chinas never been an ethnostatetheres dozens of ethnic minorities there the uighurs are just one of them
  ethnostate means states based on ethnic nationalism not necessarily authoritarian nor racial/ethnicity purity there are plenty of them around the world    literally most of countries in the world are technically ethnostates except not functioning properly for european ones because of the eu laws you can see it by their nationality law which is usually but not limited to strict jus sanguinis
  the uighurs are just one of them    that ethnic group they singled out and are torturing in concentration camps yeah that doesnt sound like any other country ive ever heard in history
  social phenomena are a result of individual psychology    read up on veblen goods
  literally most of countries in the world are technically ethnostates  only if you consider an ethnostate to be any state with a majority ethnicity making the term so broad its basically trivial but most nations do not define things solely in these terms yet also by solidarity religion geography and language there is much more ethnic diversity outside of western countries than many realize and most anglosphere nationalists do not really understand ethnicity at all only race
  only if you consider an ethnostate to be any state with a majority ethnicity  no i dont i even defined ethnostatism as synonymous as ethnic nationalism and most countries in this world are like that which is true its besides the point whether its been debunked or not nor do i have any intention on debating that especially when you started spouting that marxist bullshit view on ethnicity/nationality out of nowhere
  they foster fomo and literally promote bullying
  as basic as this will sound simple peer pressure its quite something the wave of desire you can create by simply having x popular person use y product and z people will flock in droves
  someone should do a survey on /fa/ to find out why those idiots buy gucci and the like
where did they go im talking about the ones who built the pyramids and made the ancient egyptian civilization do some of them still exist in parts of egypt are they the modern egyptians now or did they completely perish
  theyre still there genetically speaking huge settled populations dont disappear that easily coptic christians are the purest group so its said but the genetic impact arabs and african slaves have made is only minimal
  returned to their homeland in germany
  
were still here asshole
theres not a massive genetic disparity between ancient egyptians and modern egyptians theyre more or less the same people
  copts are mixed with greek at about the same percentage muslims are mixed with arab about 1020 theyre not pure     just because our upper class married foreign nobility sometimes to retain their status doesnt mean the millions of people in kemet just got held down and raped
copts are not descendants form ancient egyptians less than modern egyptians are
retreated back to subsaharan africa where their descendants now live
  most beautiful goddess ive ever seen
  her full name is rania hussein muhammad tawfiq known as ruby in egypt shes a singer and an actress
  arab delusions copts preserved their language while arab invaders merely started larping as egyptians when your panarabism dream failed
  they are in egypt but adopted the religion culture and language of their arab colonizers
  copts preserved their language  nobody speaks coptic anymore  arab invaders merely started larping as egyptians when your panarabism dream failed  and here comes the pissy jew
  this when will retards understand it   also in many cases new rulers just settled in urban areas most of rural areas were mostly untouched and those were the majority of population
old egyptians were near to berber and they are still here in majority 68 according test
  germans are the same as their barbaric mud hut dwelling ancestors despite the big differences in achievement and culture   french are the same as their gaul ancestors despite the big differences in achievement and behaviors  dem gypos got replaced by ayrabs as evidenced by the huge gap in their achievements  why do americans do this norwegians used to be shithole vikings before now theyre pacifists living in the closest thing to utopia humanity has managed to create nobody doubts that theyre the same genetically its not like the vikings got totally replaced
  why do people shit on old germanics
  mainly as a reaction to nordicist spergouts
  norwegians used to be shithole vikings before now theyre pacifists living in the closest thing to utopia humanity has managed to create   liberals and their delusions about northern europe lmao
  highest hdi  insanely high gdp per capita  low income inequality   excellent safety lowest homicide rates in europe   how is modern norway not the best country humanity has experienced thus far
are these the descendants of black egyptians whited by nordic greeks or the descendants of nordic egyptians that degenerated due to already mixing with swarthoids prior to the arab conquest
  yeah but are you free enough to get shot on the street      yeah didnt think so kiddo
ill start  general matsui took great interest in studying chinese culture for much of his life and was possibly one of the only people in the imperial japanese army without a giant hateboner for the chinese he even built a shrine for the thousands of soldiers that died during the war both japanese and chinese  and yet the weimaricans used him as a scapegoat for the nanjing massacre because they were pussies who wouldnt dare even touch prince asaka the people responsible for this heinous act in the name of justice are burning in hell alongside the perpetrators
a chink sympathizer      i guess they just did that to trigger bugmen
russians sold alaska to americans  french sold louisiana to americans
  alaska barely had any russians and was seen as kinda useless it was fairly recent that it was found to be filled with gold and oil and the like im pretty sure america considered it somewhat useless for a while also save for great source of fish and pelts
england never sold the falkland islands
  russians sold alaska to americans  i always wondered how would the cold war have turned out if that didnt happen
  canada would be bigger   since britain wouldve annexed alaska
  why would it be that much different russia is not very far away from alaska if you can launch nukes from alaska why cant you launch them from the eastern tip of russia
  and in neither case could they plausibly hold their possessions even had they not sold it to america
british sold canada to the americans
  and in neither case could they plausibly hold their possessions  as if the us was a fucking joke militarily until ww2
  why would it be that much different   because it would mean that russia would control alaskas oil reserves and have a virtual monopoly on the lucrative pacific cod market and it would allow them to station aircraft and missiles inside north america it would also enable them to plausibly invade canada and/or the northwestern usa in the event of war basically the entire strategic focus of the cold war would shift from europe to north america     and on top of all that having access to alaskas ports harbors and shipyards would make it possible for the russians to maintain a much larger naval presence in the pacific selling alaska was easily the biggest mistake russia has ever made as a country and that is really saying something
  russian civil war wouldve seen alaska either fall into british canadian hands or american hands
  alaska was russias biggest mistake  in hindsight
  if by a joke you mean hardly ever had a need for mass mobilization and when they did performed pretty damn well then sure
  latin america was even more of a joke but they still became independent
  either this  or an unlikely white government in exile like taiwan
  alternatively it might have become a white rump state populated by white refugees native alaskans and the settlers from russia the us and canada who have arrived before the civil war and over time it would have probably simply turned into a russian speaking canada without queen lizzie but fueled with tons of gold oil and gas
  alaska would be a white russian taiwan
  to be fair if napoleon didnt sell louisiana to the us it would have been given back to spain meaning it would be mexico meaning it would either be a brown shit hole third world hell hole or just annexed militarily as the us expanded     a soviet held alaska would have been interesting during the cold war
  whats with the crying wojak isnt that good for america and thus for the world
  there wouldnt have been a russian civil war if russia owned alaska
  fucking (((america))) and (((england))) stopping japanese intervention in the russian civil war     far eastern republic was sort of like that though id prefer one with a romanov pretender not a republic
  america  good
  if russia held onto alaska we would have taken it by force after ww1 and the rise of the ussr
  us isnt one of the most morally good tries its best to be countries to exist in the modern period  compared to france uk germany russia china and etc for the world nations the us is ahead of them because it never did super fucked up shit except maybe slavery but even then it abolished it
russia only cared about the fur trade which was all but used up in alaska by the time they sold it to america    france didnt even occupy the louisiana territory technically spain held new orleans and barely had a presence north of that anyway they sold it because napoleon wanted money and didnt think he could build an empire in north america anyway after the haiti disaster
  whats good for america  whats good for the world  lmao
  the influence of america on the rest of the world has been undeniably toxic some of the worst ideas plaguing the modern world started in the usa and got exported by american corporations consumerism liberalism globalism transgenderism obesity and feminism all took root in america first and then the us government worked its influence to promote them worldwide
  youre forgetting the true vector of most of those things pierre
  native americans sold manhattan to future americans  mexico sold gadsden purchase to americans
  well yeah look at what happened when our economy went slump
  50000 year old craft of humanity scouting mapping and resource extracting land  no idea what they were doing
  meaning it would either be a brown shit hole third world hell hole  so in the end nothing changed
  us isnt one of the most morally good  no
  britain would annex it you dumb fuck their relations were in the shitter
why couldnt the arab nations defeat israel in any of their major confrontations
jews are genetically superior
  what part of gods chosen people do you not understand
  yom kippur was a strategic victory egypt regained sinai
  most of the arab militaries were absolute shithousetier desu its a bit more complicated than that but really thats the long and short of it
  israel has lots of free shit and a more compact organized country that can be mobilized for war much more easily than the disorganized and disunited arab states
  until jews beat persians or turks in a war shut the fuck up
  uk and us threw shitloads of military equipment and technology at them    give a four year old girl an mg42 tell her how to use it all shell defeat half a dozen 6ft tall men who trained for combat their entire life
  part of it was the opposing countries were not a united front and wanted to gain as much as possible at each others expense  another part was that the militaries of nondemocratic states are often more designed around suppressing internal dissent fueling nepotism and backing up internal rival political factions against others rather than waging wars against other nations  and as everyone else has pointed out israel has western funding material and training
  infinite credit line
  1 lack of coordination between arab states  2 less professionalized military structures  3 during and after yom kippur western material backing  4 as of now nukes
  another part was that the militaries of nondemocratic states are often more designed around suppressing internal dissent fueling nepotism and backing up internal rival political factions against others rather than waging wars against other nations  particularly true when it comes to syria during the six days war salah jedid and hafez alassads coup had happened one year sooner and during the war the elite forces of the saa were deployed in damas in order to protect the regime from internal threats not near the israeli border not to mention alassad had the airforce sent eastward after the israelis had destroyed half of it on the ground
  lol fuck off egypt recognizing israel in exchange was a huge blow for the arabs its why they were kicked out of the arab league
is it worth reading their books i have seen some anons here claiming that hindu texts had very deep and advanced philosophical contents much before christianity and other mainstream religions came about  how good is their philosophy  which are the best books for a good introduction
  not good  not worth reading  not deep  their philosophy is shit quite literally at times  dont waste your time  /thread
start with the bhagavad gita its hinduism in a nutshell the pivot back to the vedas for some mythological background before transitioning to the upanishads and from there have fun with the epics ramayana and mahabharata
  why
listen to alan watts read the bhagavad gita understand the similarities between the vedic texts and the illiad read the illiad read savitri devi read miguel serrano read seej
  understand the similarities between the vedic texts and the illiad read the illiad  what does greece have to do with hinduism beyond the basic connection they share with all other indoeuropean groups
bump
  eh  its worth research and reading some passages/overviews of the major texts and epics the rig veda in particular is interesting in a not meant to be understood way but im not sure if i would call it deep  the issue with hindu philosophy is that there is very little hindu philosophy theres shaivist philosophies vaishnavist philosophies and a dozen other more for other facets of the poly/monotheistic jumble we call hinduism but the difference in beliefs between each person and each town historically are equivalent to protestant europe the fun parts are the practices amongst the peasantry of the stridharma and the act of sati which didnt get formally outlawed by independent india until 1987  the most interesting parts for me were learning of the overlap with the offshoot/neighboring religions of buddhism and jainism
  the issue with hindu philosophy is that there is very little hindu philosophy theres shaivist philosophies vaishnavist philosophies    thats hindu philosophy
  the ancient world was far more interconnected than we immediately assume    
  is it worth reading their books i have seen some anons here claiming that hindu texts had very deep and advanced philosophical contents much before christianity and other mainstream religions came about  hindu literature is a vast field which includes among other things certain areas of religious philosophy which are similar to neoplatonism spinoza hegel leibniz etc     which are the best books for a good introduction  introduction to the study of hindu doctrines by guenon after that read the bhagavadgita
i havent read much of it but have experienced its truths on my own nondualism is the only and highest philosophy you need the realization that you are the divine there is no higher path than the realization of this so yes read into it
  read up on advaita vedanta and adi shankara
  the realization that you are the divine  you have schizophrenia
read greek philosophy and epics instead thank me later
  its true though not in the im yhwh and i created the earth in six days and all shall bow before me rather in the the cosmic principle is my individual principle and vice versa
  hindu philosophy existed long before and influenced the early stages of greek philosophy several of the prebuddhist upanishads containing the seeds of most later hindu philosophy already existed around 900800 bc several hundred years before any of the presocratics
  the grecoaryans had no contact with the indoaryan people aside from extremely infrequent trade and travel reports theres no reason at all to believe that the homeric epics much less mycenaean greek civilization were influenced by india their homologous cultural narratives stem from a common ancestral stock and convergent development not from direct contact
  greek texts are older than any hindu texts
  the rig veda in particular is interesting in a not meant to be understood way    i think this more reflect the changes in language over time that occurred to such a degree in india that without some unbroken tradition of explaining exactly what the vedas mean which doesnt exist nobody knows the exact meaning of some verses despite the popular conception that they are all ritual and hymns to gods one can still find philosophical and mystic ideas which appear in them and are similar to the upanishads coomaraswamy has a good book on this called perception of the vedas the later vedantic schools came up with elaborate cosmological and metaphysical systems based on the upanishads last portion of the vedas involving a godhead manifesting itself but not really in cycles and other things many verses in the vedas which predate the upanishads describe the various vedic deities as doing these things such as being reborn over and over creating the world etc or in other words the metaphysical principles of the upanishads are poetically illustrated by the actions of the various vedic gods in the vedas when as coomaraswamy says you combine these passages with other vedic passages that state all the gods are just one and passages which state you are the same as it it suggests the people who composed the early parts of the vedas were already very much aware of the ideas contained in the later upanishads and that the upanishads was just stating them more directly and explicitly
    this        start with the bhagavad gita its hinduism in a nutshell    the bhagavad gita is indeed hinduism in a nutshell its a poor pseudointellectual knowledge that westerners circlejerk to sound hip        read any western texts and you will find even deeper knowledge than in the eastern ones some of such nsminded people circlejerk about even serrano acknowledged this
    and you can get this by reading any related western texts        guenon    into the trash it goes get the fuck out of this board
      this
  the grecoaryans had no contact with the indoaryan people aside from extremely infrequent trade and travel reports theres no reason at all to believe that the homeric epics much less mycenaean greek civilization were influenced by india    i should have been more specific hindu philosophy existed before the greek and influenced greek philosophy but im not claiming the very beginning of greek civilization/philosophy was influenced by indians only that the influence did occur and that it was mostly onesided greek influence on india was mostly in art pyrrho is said by the greeks to have traveled to india with alexander and learned from indians of some sort there and in turn brought those ideas back and through him they influenced the school of skepticism writ large various greeks discuss and praise the wisdom of the indian gymnosophists they are thought to have reached alexandria and taught there there were several other people who are said to have traveled east to india with alexander and before him but i cant remember at the moment i dont really care about proving it or whatever by the hellenistic period after alexander when you have entire indogreek kingdoms becoming buddhist the influence is already pervasive      greek texts are older than any hindu texts    thats completely wrong as far as we know greek literature only begins around 800 bc both the chandogya and brihadaranyaka upanishads are dated by most scholars as being from around/before then the early portions of the vedas are way before anything greek the destruction of the minoan civilization circa 12001000 bc is itself the date that marks when the vedas had stopped being composed and began to be refined and edited the composition or active passing down of the vedas themselves is dated by experts as stretching as far back as 17001500 bc     not knowing the dates of stuff you are arguing about on a history board
  into the trash it goes get the fuck out of this board    blocks your path
  and you can get this by reading any related western texts    such as its been my experience that in western literature the material on this is more limited beside obvious ones like neoplatonism
chinese dont sit on benches while eating but squat like europeans do when they relieve themselves out in the leafy woods all this occurs quietly and demurely even the children are spiritless and look obtuse    it would be a pity if these chinese supplant all other races for the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary
mirrors what is written in ways that are dark good book
  as someone who lived in china the sensational quotes from that book are entirely true  although it is much more western now
  and then albert einsteins people got gassed by the millions by real europeans
  george frederick pentecost who went to china and spoke chinese said the exact opposite and that whites in china were uncivilized and venal            when after his return from a long journey in asia the rev dr george pentecost was asked what are the darkest spots in the missionary outlook he replied in lands of spiritual darkness it is difficult to speak of darkest spots i should say however that if there is a darkness more dark than other darkness it is that which is cast into heathen darkness by the ungodliness of the american and european communities that have invaded the east for the sake of trade and empire the corruption of western godliness is the worst evil in the east of course there are noble exceptions among western commercial men and their families but as a rule the european and american resident in the east is a constant contradiction to all and everything which the missionary stands for        
now post slave chink pasta
  its possible to believe everything in that book about chinese people and also believe that many of the westerners who came and come to china are the worst the west has
  based and redpilled
  not really
i love chinese people
neil degrasse tyson quote about churchesjpg  even smart people can be dumb when they talk outside of the areas of their expertise
  yes really you dont have to go widf to counter cidf or vice versa
  townsend lied big time about events he did not personally witness in that book he claimed malay pirates raiding china caused han people to flee in the coastal evacuation manchus ordered the coastal evacuation to stop han ming loyalists not malays he claimed chinese never violently fought mongols when jindandao happened
  just because you saw a picture of a historical figure with a quote next to it on the internet doesnt make it true  albert einstein 1763
  he also claimed manchus built beijings existing walls when the walls were built by the ming
  townsend was not advancing american or white interests in china not even in an imperialist manner townsend claimed to be challenging the status quote upheld by diplomats and missionaries but the existing status quo in china benefited american imperialist and predatory commercial practices while townsend advocated leaving china to japan which would shut america entirely out of the chinese market america benefited from the imperialist open door policy in the 1920s with american businessmen selling manufactured goods to china and using missionaries to spread american ideas and pro americanism american patrol boats could sell up the yangtze townsend was shilling for japan taking over manchukuo and entirely shutting aemrica out of chinas natural resources and market leaving japan to take over the market by selling manufactured goods in china and extracting natural resources in what way would japan having total control of manchukuos market and resources and the rest of china benefit america geopoltiicailly or strategically  in fact real white supremacists like lothrop stoddard and kaiser wilhelm ii who hated east asians and viewed east asians as a threat warned that japan taking over china would lead to an ultra powerful japan with millions of chinese puppet soldiers and all of chinas resources and a japanese led army of millions of puppet chinese would attack the white man and seek to conquer and genocide all whites lothrop stoddard wanted to kick all japanese and chinese out of america and enforce total white only immigration policy  townsend was a pure shill for japan who turned out to be on japanese payroll advocating for japan to take over china shut america out of the chinese market and geopolitical arena eliminate americas military presence in china the diplomatic concessions and marine outposts the yangtze patrols he was being paid by japan to advance japanese imperialist interests against american imperialist interests
  lothrop stoddard kaiser wilhelm ii and all true blooded white supremacists always hated japan too and thought they were a threat to the white man and thought it would be insane to let japan take over china since japan would use chinas human population natural resources and economy to conquer and attack the west they believed australia and siberia would be targets of japan and whites would be driven out and killed there by the japanese  the situation in 1920s china was not the situation today america exported manufactured goods to china so townsend challenging the status quo and praising manchukuo was challenging americas mercantile and imperialist interests on behalf of japan japan monopolized all industry in manchukuo the entire market the natural resources not a single pence would benefit whites the status quo in china benefited the west and america but japan was challenging it america wanted to recognise yuan shikai as emperor because american and european imperialist interests in china would be protected but japan destabilized yuan shikai and demanded total control over chinas resources and foreign policy in the 21 demands intending to drive the white nations out of china and built a large japanese empire  townsend was a pro japanese imperialist shill trying to undermine american imperialist interests disguised as a white anglo supremacist lothrop stoddard was a real white anglo supremacist
islam is not a religion of peace      you do know that islam spread in indonesia and malaysia without killing a single person right the buddhists/hindus there literally just read about islam when muslim traders arrived and they converted learn some fucking history before criticizing islam next time
  you do know that islam spread in indonesia and malaysia without killing a single person right the buddhists/hindus there literally just read about islam when muslim traders arrived and they converted learn some fucking history before criticizing islam next time  thats because the traders lies to them and mixed sunni islam with hinduism so for the first few centuries indonesians and malays practiced a hybrid sunnihindu religion still doing hindu rituals and worshipping hindu gods until the 19th and 20th centuries when arab sunnis started introducing real islam to indonesians and malays malays used to practice hindu mandi safar bath until the 70s and indonesian abangans in yogyakarta worship a hindu goddess today indonesian muslims used the names of hindu gods like wisnu vishnu to name their children they traders deceived their ancestors that they would keep their old religion with the new but once their descendants were hooked on it they started saying haram haram the arab sunni hadrami traders also took indonesian wives but refused to let indonesian sunni men marry arab sunni women
        
  cope
  arab sunni hadramis were notorious for marrying indonesian sunni women malay sunni women indian sunni women african sunni women and refusing to allow arab sunni women to marry nonarab men this was justified by kafaah in three of the four sunni madhhabs shafii hanafi hanbali which say nonarab men are not suitble for arab women and that nonarabs are not the equals of arabs an arab sunni man can refuse to let his daughter marry a nonarab with religious justification
ah yes the peaceful asian muslims
    ahh theres the shia shill that appears in literally every thread about islam or the middle east
  shia dont have racial kafaah arab shia women dont have religious prohibitions on marrying nonarab shia men only personal or cultural prohibitions there is no religious objection to it sunnis have a racial apartheid arab supremacy built into it religiously
  keep it up bro it totally isnt apparent who are across all the threads at least do us all a favour and get a trip so that we can block you
reminder shia was started by insincere jew convert/hype man ibn saba
on 26 september 1983 three weeks after the soviet military had shot down korean air lines flight 007 petrov was the duty officer at the command center for the oko nuclear earlywarning system when the system reported that a missile had been launched from the united states followed by up to five more petrov judged the reports to be a false alarm1 and his decision to disobey orders against soviet military protocol2 is credited with having prevented an erroneous retaliatory nuclear attack on the united states and its nato allies that could have resulted in largescale nuclear war investigation later confirmed that the soviet satellite warning system had indeed malfunctioned    how true is this was the world really on the brink at that moment
what reason would they have to make it up
  the story sounds so intense it must have been crazy inside that room and this guys head its too close for comfort in a way that i cant believe it actually happened
there is actually a whole list of these like 5 separate times the world was on the brink of nuclear war but the guys in charge said lets just wait a minute and see what happens
am i retarded or he uses the word paradox when there isnt any
youre both retarded and right
  examples he often claims he uses any philosophical terms in their precise sense lets verify his claim
im not a žižek fan but the paradox paradox involves the fact that any time someone uses the word paradox on the internet people will go nuts saying why said thing is actually not a paradox no matter what meaning that nothing is actually a paradox and the word is meaningless and thus nothing can be shown to not be a paradox    this is a very true and real paradox
  sniff  hello professor zizek
  his whole job is basically just obfuscating things which has the effect of appearing both sophisticated and masking his insipid mind boggling levels of ignorance on virtually every topic he speaks about at the same timebut only to an audience which is so far beneath the mark they cant possiblyor wont because of emotions hope to figure it out
  imagine this guy walking into his class late with a face covered in powder and just watching him incessantly sniff for the entirety of the lesson    impossible to retain info    jk i could do it
  zizek always is funny friendly and grandstands in every talk he gives to confuse you into thinking he is saying something of substance when theres nothing there
  commie uses deceptive language  wow now theres a shocker
  gasp
whats the name of the disorder he has
  coke addiction
  weirdo
  he is a sociologist by training so some intellectual charity is needed
  narcissism he himself says so
  i mean the disorder that causes him to constantly sniff and tug at his shirt
be me  be from future   have a time machine  decide to type a random date and see what happens  go to 2018  decide to look at what sort of primitive technology they had back then  see a site called 4chan  decide to make a post     so yeah you can ask me whatever you want regarding life in the future
hahaha you are not actually from the future hahaha stop pretending
  that isnt a question
  does the future take place before 1993
  no
  how they will try to solve the problem of increasing incels numbers and how effective will it be 
  fuck off titor
  when will i lose virginity
  is there in the future a toe that integrates gravity with the grand unified theory how is it
haha bro yes lets build our city near that big ass volcano nothing can go wrong  what were they thinking
  volcanic soil is the best soil there is for farming    this is why all over asia people settle near volcanos sure it might erupt but in like what decades centuries in between you have rich harvests
  vast chunks of the worlds population live in earthquake or volcano zones most of california could be fucked at any moment
  hemp improves soil quality putting minerals back into the soil and removing toxins from the air water and land
  pompeii was mostly evacuated before its destruction they knew the volcano was erupting they just didnt realize how bad it was going to be it was basically just slaves who were left behind and told have all the debris cleaned up by the time i get back
an athiest tries to take the moral high ground
a turk claiming he is hittite

  i believe in christ cause the religion is redpilled
people believing in god   people believing morals can be objective
fedoras believing theyre revolutionary intellectuals for not believing in something
    religious people thinking theyre better than everyone because they believe in something based off memes
          oh man
  fedoras believing theyre smarter than everyone else because they watched videos made by an obese neckbeard who likes shoving bananas up his ass
    i dont understand the reference but based trips
  checked atheists btfo
  the presence of turks with opinions in general
  lole  why do turks elicit such butthurt
  an athiest tries to take the moral high ground  its fairly easy desu be a vegan and you can bask in your moral superiority all day doesnt matter if youre an utilitarianist or champion of virtue ethics or w/e
  tru
  oh i dont think im smarter than everyone else but im certainly smarter than a guy who believes iron age myths are true stories you have the same understanding of the universe as a medieval peasant lmao
  (((youd))) rather they be good little mutts wouldnt you
  he roleplays as a christian to be contrarian because 4chan told him to
historical dramas that get things wrong intentionally    btw i recommend outlaw king to all of you

the dacian mastermind he did it      oil germans and jews are our most important export commodities
  based and literally redpilled
ceausescu claimed that the romanian people have been always the same since time immemorial being very little influenced by other people such as slavsmongols and romans
superproletariat
watching this animal gunned down live by his own ppl  i was very little and had very little understanding of the whole thing but it was a good moment
  he died like decebalus a real dacian patriot mgyar fifth columnists were behind it
  never ending economy crysis and country getting destroyed by mafia jews and gypsies was definitely worth it
  fucking americans killed him the people loved him
   does almost literally everything wrong   hated even by megatankies who defend people like kim ilsung and mugabe    the only communist leader to be executed    still incredibly popular in romania today    what did reality mean by this     
  he took away the hungarians autonomy and in turn saved romania
  how can magyars be fifth columnists in their own country romanian migrants need to head back to macedonia
  ceausescu claimed that the romanian people have been very little influenced by other people such as mongols   guess he was wrong
  crowds of angry people cia agents all of them
is opinion on ceausescu really that divided bros here hes seen as a tyrant who impoverished romania   t serb
  crowds of angry people  t never heard of crowd control
  dacian  romanians decend from the romans
  glad hes dead fucking commie bastard i wish wed round em up again every politician that took any amount of money as bribes or from the budget should be shot to death corruption is the real problem nowadays
  every politician that took any amount of money as bribes or from the budget   ceaușescu
  old people are a big part of the population they dont care about what he did wrong to the people they only care that he gave them jobs to work in and homes for free meaning you would be forced to work in some shitty village at a deadly factory and the state gave your family of 5 a shitty 2room apartment nowadays they only care about their pensions like some gibbing niggers who cares about my childrens future i should be a rich leech and then still get to bitch about them leaving west for a country they can work in that actually respects them fucking retards most of them
  dude the country was already fucked in the 80s and some say even say the whole revolution was just a coup by the securitate to get rid off him so that they could run the country from the back seats
  you realise the partys leadership benefited the most out of any profit the people made if he was so egalitarian as any good commie why did he have so many luxuries anyway back then there were other problems nowadays the politicians who steal money need to get shot i was saying we should have another revolution because of them not that good old ceașcă dared to take a leu from the budget different crimes same treatment death to crooks and tyrants
  if there wasnt for (((revolution))) romania would look like a dprk now not like gypsy magyar shithole    i was saying we should have another revolution because of them  yeah why dont we just fuck up our country once again if you hate ceaușescu hate him because of his wife he did nothing wrong
  fake history mere propaganda by the roman catholic church to make them accept catholicism  ceausescu brought back the real dacian history
  that does seem plausible why did they stop at big c were the other party members misinformed saints they only followed orders blindly without seeing the mistreated masses they were from the same stock as tovarășul a bunch of stalinist thieves
  he did plenty wrong you little shit if we wouldnt have left communism we would be a poorer country nowadays stop being so dacopat do you honestly want to live in a state where oppresion is the bread ignorance the butter and censorship the knife if you unironically wish to live somewhere you cant legally leave the borders from do not reply you are not worth my words if that is true because you do not value freedom
  nicu ceausescu spent extended time in dengist china he would have opened up and done a much better job than the 90s criminals
  this
  china nowadays is a bad example when it comes to quality of life i have no idea why you chose to include them and how can you be sure he would have done those same reforms not a chance they werent into it foe the benefit of the proletariat they were into it to be powerful and rich and a politician with that goal has a natural predator anyone smart enough to see through their bullshit those thieves in the 90s were the same as him since they were former party members nobody that lerned politics after world war 2 can be trusted here in romania they all learned the ways of theft first and lying second the real tools of communism
  patriot  in november 1989 at the xivth and last congress of the pcr ceaușescu condemned the molotovribbentrop pact and asked for the annulment of its consequences in effect this amounted to a demand for the return of bessarabia most of which was then a soviet republic
  you dont speak dacian  you speak a close derivate of latin  your ancestors were romans the commie was just trying to deviate you from your roots
  our ancestors were both you reformist
  no the dacians were driven out of romania by your ancestors
  literally speaks a romance language  oh no no no
  the people bordering dacia are probably closer to whatever the fuck lived in dacia than whatever they claim to be so he has a point
  this is unironically an extreme leftists view its actually interesting how romanian anticommunists are actually quite leftist in their ideas even thought they hate supposedly hate these ideas
  not everybody is an edgelord with the everything sucked and sucks attitude people generally tend to remember the good things in their youth years this is natural its not even communist nostalgia in the true sense of the word most old people in romania arent marxist ideologues or hardcore communist like in france or italy yes some of these people are naive and/or uneducated but guess what so are the young people
  i am against communism and theft i didnt say anything about my views on healthcare or taxes or borders subjects where i dont share views with commies that also speak more about how left you go on the scale if we could manage the risk of imprisonment for life with their valuables taken sold and put into useful projects highways hospitals schools i would be glad to accept it but as it stands them being alive is a great enough offense both me and communists and everyone that wants quick results wants a revolution marx didnt trademark the idea of revolution the french even did it before he was a sperm in his dads nutsack        out ancestors were romans and dacians living in the territory the country owns nowadays and some beyond the border the birthplace of the people is the territories i mentioned including transilvania the dacian language only passed on in words as they were illiterate they seriously were unable to read or write as far as we know history courses nowadays praise them to no end but we are still romanized dacians belonging to the land that belongs to us our birthplace as a people we are the most dacian in the region to as any bordering country would be the most x out of its neighbours replace x for any ancestor population thracian slavic hun or germanic or whatever
  their childhood was better than ours my generation seriously cant afford houses even in the most shithole of places a reasonable dwelling can cost 10k euros they got theirs for free that is a miracle and one of the reasons we cant afford houses is their decisions we have been robbed of a future in our country
  their childhood was better than ours  i wasnt actually implying that just that many people tend to think like that and its useless to get angry at them i certainly wouldnt trade place with them i wouldnt like the censorship and not being able to go abroad or being ruled by same persons for decades and so on   also you sound like those young americans being angry at people from the 60s who robbed them of something when they should be angry at the current system it almost seems like trying find easy scapegoats which is what others would find useful
  i wouldnt want to harm them or switch their place but the problems we face today can find their traces in their era what would the solution be wise man to solve these problems if not taking away what the political class stole and making a new democratic leadership where we build highways and the euro isnt 5 times a leu
  ok i can agree with the last part
  and bozgors need to get back to mongolia
  even with all the shitty aspects that was still the best period of romanias history for a number of reasons
  terrorist mercenaries flown into the country by helicopter  his own ppl
  szekely mgyars   own people  literally fifth columnists planted by habsburgs to weaken dacia
thoughts on this guy
1 term president
last moderate republican before they turned into a bloody joke
  literal meme candidate beats the final boss of democrats   lol the gop is a joke
  embrasses and fragments gop hierarchy  constantly attacks leadership in first two years in office  cuckservatives think trump represents white bread gop politics from the last 20 years aside from flashes seen in the bush evangelical pandering and tea party lunacy
  youre post is scatterbrained retardation and the misuse and appropriation of the other sides memes makes you look like a complete jackass
  competent if unremarkable statesman i thought he handled the first gulf war well
  different name same game of incrementally inching america forward to the boiling point were at today
  utterly destroys a rapidly modernizing country iraq in a bombing campaign equivalent to destroying cambodia  moderate  republicunts are the worst saddam was a shithead but the slaughtering 200k iraqi soldiers and tons of civilians and civilian infrastructure within weeks is utter barbarism
  but muh democracy
  one of the best potus of recent decades criminally underrated because he was so uncharismatic
  freedom aint free
  unbased cringe and bluepilled like all presidents since wilson
  even from his grave he glows in the dark
  absolutely but freedom had nothing to do with some happenings in the sand dunes thousands of miles away freedom is in most peril at home
  waaaa he attacked a country during a war what a monster    chomakycucks are the worse
better than anyone that preceded him id say
i wanna fuck my boys mouth
    continued to fuck around in south america  raised taxes and spending  banned the import of semiauto assault weapons   general pussy    he was shit
  high ass fuck basement dweller detected
  evil fuck killed kenneddy and attacked iraq
  final boss  a geriatric with dozens of corruption scandals who was not a particularly successful senator or secretary of state and has the charisma of a rock    he would have been swept by obama term iii or even biden he lost the popular vote by the largest margin in history for races with no strong third party candidate and barely carried the key states that let him win just the black turn out from obama running again alone would have drowned him    clinton was a uniquely bad pick and her corruption in trying to rig the primary didnt help
  moderate  how he basically just continued everything that reagan did bush jr had more liberal social spending eg medicare part d than even his dad and trump is the most socially liberal republican since ford
  who else were dems going to run obama iii obviously isnt an option and biden declines like it or not she was widely promoted as the most qualified candidate and all that shit and she actually had a relatively decent approval rating prior to her entering the running
  beau was assassinated by the clintons look it up man the truth is out there
  all this damage control  lol     
  this dude was head of the cia there was nothing blue about the pill he took      i dont know about evil but this anon may very well be right    he would be like the real life smoking man
he oversaw the dissolution of the soviet union and carefully managed the uss transition to being the worlds exclusive world power which allowed the un to enter a new era as well as other multinational organisations
    this
  last moderate republican before they turned into a bloody joke    you know he posted bush senior and not eisenhower
  i respect him and his policies
  schizophrenia is the word youre scared of using
    he wasnt particularly moderate tho
  he was a deepstate freakshow look up the franklin scandal underaged gay pedo prostitution ring with white house connections then look up bcci the bank that bush used to launder money from his drugtrafficking then remember that bush had 3000 civilians murdered in panama in order to clean up the evidence that noriega had against him for the irancontra scandal and drugsmuggling in general    the guy was a massmurderer and a drugpusher never forget that
  10 health
  he murdured jfk
  i was in two of bushs wars and i can honestly say i would rather serve under that man than any of the ones who came after him thats including the two i voted for    t just cause and restore hope vet
  who else were dems going to run    jim webb wouldve kept white middle america back into the democratic fold whereas hillary and all the sjw bullshit that proliferated as a result of her nomination led most of them to defect to the republican party basically pushing democrats more to the left and republicans even further to the right
  iraq  rapidly modernizing
  retard
  good prez  9/11/10
  thank you for your service what a badass hero thanks for murdering the poor and powerless on behalf of the rich and powerful without low iq pawns willingly risking their lives for elite interests the entire system would crumble like a house of cards
  survivor
record scratch  freeze frame  i bet youre wondering how that jesuit priest wound up in that situation with natives and colonists teaming up to kill him  well that jesuit priest is actually me  yep that guy  to figure out how i got here we have to go back  rewind sfx
not that far  wiseguys    fast forward
this is now a general new france thread
was it savage like you could beat the shit out of someone and get away with it or was it meek and lawful and cuckolded  why cant we bring back savagery dont you guys think that law and order is making us all into total cuckolds  sometimes there are moments where i want to beat the shit out of someone but because of laws i dont and control myself but i believe by not being physical i feel like being a total cuck but at the same time dont want to loose everything i achieved  have you guys had that feel
idk why dont you ask a roman
    i dont know about rome but certainly laws in the modern day are cucked    i dont think we should go all the way and legalise assault but certainly the punishments for beating the shit out of someone should be reduced if theres a reason to do so    the communists at my university are honestly such pussies they act so thug like yet are clearly just fucking cowards they each deserve a shattered jaw and i seriously considered trying to give one of them one last time they fucked with me but no i dont fancy getting kicked out of university and going to jail/prison
in ancient rome rich sociopaths would walk around beating up plebs and then toss the fine money on them     you could do anything you wanted to your slaves too and if your wife cucked you it was considered honorable to kill her and any possible bastards
imagine living back in those times 95 of the earth was occupied by illiterate savages sacrificing their children to the tree spirits and shit you are a tiny scrap of civilization on a tiny strip of land not knowing anything about the universe around you what the stars were what was on the other side of the ocean only the might of your armies stand between you and utter annihilation you are constantly on the verge of breaking down into barbarism and savagery
cringe
  rome was a lawful land but it was not cuckolded quite the contrary a nation is cuckolded when it does not have a stick with which to defend itself laws are what allow noble men like the roman authorities to keep primates like you in line
    wasnt he one of the first leaders to enforce patriarchy and gender roles
  why does this make me mad
basedgoy
  hes so based and so redpilled
  he only ruled applebees
  that isnt even him
  implying
  youre right this is him
i dont think well ever be able to discuss actual sargon now anon
  and thats a good thing
  basedgons greatest sin was tarnishing sargon
  he was destroyed with facts and reason
  he ruins everything he touches its his gift and curse
he wasnt that great he didnt even have the first empire      semitic gods were more patriarchal than sumerian gods but sumerians still probably had a patriarchy as if there is any other form of civilization
i really hope one day a kid is assigned to do a project on sargon and accidentally does the entire thing about benjamin
im going to post this every day until you remember it
pls membr
  begone furry devil
  nobody will ever forget the first taco bell theyre everywhere now including japan

there has to be a scenario where communism works as intended
  garbage read literally anything else by them is better das kapital the german ideology feuerbach theses etc
  so communism can work yes
  there has to be a scenario where communism works as intended  the bottom 90 of the population is exterminated and replaced with robots leaving the elite to live lives focused on art science and leisure with no human performing any unpleasant or boring job
  communism is impossible in the present society best we can hope for is socialism which may someday lead to communism which is what marx believed would happen one day
  marx said that the paris commune was real communism so thats your answer didnt last very long though
  paris commune
  actually one of the wildest stories in history a bunch of parisians got together and just decided to erect a rival government in the capital and hold it off against siege from the government
  bottom 90 are already very robotic
    were going to give the robots rights  just you wait
  yeah primitive communism look at north sentinel island for example
  lower communism catalonia 36 hungary 56 czechoslovakia 68 yannan etc
pretty much every time it was tried it massively improved the quality of life of most of the population    warlord/kmt china  life expectancy in the 30s  tens of millions of opium addicts  90 of the population are illiterate serfs with no rights  landlords do whatever they want could rape serfs they found attractive if they felt like it    maoist china  landlords get btfo  everyone could read and write  everyone had access to healthcare  despite a famine population massively increased because there was no more crushing taxation on the peasants  thanks to mao china will take over the world in 40 years    tsarist russia  90 are illiterate serfs living in medieval conditions  tsars family is the richest on earth  got btfo by japan  ran out of shells 2 weeks after the start of wwi    ussr  universal healthcare and education  housing built for everybody  defeated japan and germany  became a global superpower
  you can reap the benefits of science without liquidating populations anon
  closest thing the world has had to applied real world marxism  cuba gets an honourary mention too
  le 100 gorillion myth
  program robots so that their menial tasks gives them immense pleasure  problem solved  probably
  you do realise that nonrevolutionary social democratic states with wage labour and selfexpanding value form also saw heightened standards of living    this in no way makes the labour party communist nor does it make the rsdlp communist
    you can live side by side with people that dream themselves your master  even if the 100 million figure wasnt exaggerated in places it wasnt completely made up it would still be too low
  all succdem states eventually betray the workers and align themselves with the rich  all gains made by reformists get undone  wew lad
  a police state will treat the workers better   cmon gov
  its called dictatorship of the proletariat
  so everyone is their own dictator sound like anarchy
  read critique of the gotha program its only 30 pages
  reminds me of a study about birds feeding their babies   turns out not only are they driven by the need to continue their species existence and all that biological robot stuff but also feeding the chicks was fun as hell to the birds parents
  i cant make an argument so im just going to tell you to read other stuff
  argument  me having to explain shit to you isnt an argument nor is there going to be one
  tankie here socialism worked exactly as intended 100 million and all youre just another dirty socdem
  in small human communities like the amish
  the amish arent even slightly communist
  the individual receives from society exactly what he gives to it  uses labor vouchers instead of money    this kinda sounds like our capitalist system mate no
  only the worker earning the voucher can redeem it not transferability
  this abrahmics and other antihumans can never have successful by our metrics
  but supply and demand determine the worth of the labor the worker puts in    from what i understand id imagine a doctor would collect more work vouchers per hour of labor than a retail worker     we still have wealth gaps
  no under capitalism you are equally rewarded for owning property owning a building can produce wealth through rent even if you theoretically do no work to repair or sell the apartments you can also make money by owning a factory because you can effectively charge the workers rent to use your tools except in this latter case you also can completely control what is done with what the workers produce    the idea of labour vouchers is that you are paid 1 hour instead of 30 or whatever and you can exchange this for exactly 1 hour of someone elses or cumulatively a bunch of other peoples labour so if you manage an apartment building and put 30 hours a week into maintaining it you are paid 30 hours for example some variations include varying amounts depending on the amount of work you do so if you clearly slack off you are rewarded say for 05 hours of work because you slacked off for half an hour out of an hour at work
  the dianetics of the 1800s
    you are like little babies     bolshevism is social democracy
  supply and demand determine the worth of the labor the worker puts in  they dont marginalism is flatearth tier pseudoscience heres a video by paul cockshott    
  yes but you know very well that isnt how most people use it even socialism is now becoming synonymous with social democracy which is in turn synonymous with the welfare state
  towards a new socialism is absolutely one of the most based political books i have ever read my salutations to comrade cockshott
  this
  no in a precise analytical sense    valueform yes yes  wage labour yes yes  state yes yes    and so on    bolshevism is just revolutionary social democracy
  i get what hes saying  he wants labor and sales to be completely equal to avoid profit profit being waste in this case  this part i can understand and agree with    however i have zero faith in humanity to impliment it correctly
  well wheres the study then
      damn the economic illiterate retards have arrived  cockshott  literally doesnt own any business is a retarded scott and like all socialist basically doesnt disprove or even understand marginalism at all for fuck sake that video was cringe personified
  t business major who slept through his econ classes with a c average
  are you a fucking mongoloid
  damn cockslutt nice rebuttal im sure some capitalist will fund your retarded untrue fringe theory like they do anwar shaikh after all the demand for retarded fringe commie economic model is rising due to the sole fact that lanklet commies want to not feel bad for their shitty social degree  we can prove ltv by looking at io output  lmao where the fuck do marxist even find this guy
anarchist spain suck it marxists
  utopias never work
  wait for postscarcity
  why didnt you rebut my insults and insinuations  haha cockslut xddd  good to see i was spot on
  unironically this commies dosent care how many dies in the name of communism they still think the 10 surviors living in true communism paradise on earth is the just endgame for mankind    mao himself wanted a massive nuclear war knowing chinese were so numerous than at least 100200 millions would survive and repopulate the earth of genuine marxists
  russia invades germany in 1919 communism spread world wide
it did work as intended
  literally peter hitchens when he has no response
  cockslutt  having true criticism  lolno
  how did they measure fun dopamine levels
so we all know there are people who argue that the germans could have won in ww2 if they had used insert wunder waffe here i am curious to if this mind set exists when discussing the napoleonic wars for example in 1805 fulton had gone to napoleon with the idea of a steam boat but got rejected because it was too crazy for him to believe in are there any other weapons or inventions at the time that might have been used in the wars
  not really but napoleon had opportunities to win unlike nazi germany
  the coat  the brain   the cuckshed
napoleonic wunder innovations came in on tactical and organizational/strategic changes not super weapons     napoleons crops system rather than a single army moving as one which was the norm at the time the army was divided in to several groups which moved in the same general direction along different paths they joined together to fight major battles this allowed his forces to move faster and even surround enemy armies     napoleons grand battery rather than the cannon of an army being divided across the entire army which again was the norm he concentrated as many cannons as possible to a single location to allow for a devastating fire upon one section of the line he also employed a flying battery which involved the cannons being moved across the line multiple times and firing a few salvos at the opposing line before moving on this was very different from the more traditional method of stationary artillery it really screwed with his opponents who didnt expect to face cannon fire to suddenly feel it    the french column was also another interesting tactic unlike advancing in a deployed line which allowed the muskets to be effective against other lines and cavalry the french trained to advance in a column which made them vulnerable to volley fire from infantry and artillery as well as cavalry the benefits were how intimidating it was and how fast a group can move in a line columns moved much faster than lines and were able to break through the thinner deployed lines easily
  to be fair if germany did not get sabotaged for the atomic bomb and they had one operational before america they wouldve won the war right there nothing memey about that    the only other real wunderwaffe i can think of is the greek fire that was basically like napalm and extremely effective even at sea but the recipe for it was lost and helped the downfall of the empire
  tell me more about napoleonic reforms  particularly those actually created/designed/masterminded by napoleon
the jumma buddhists are mongoloids native to the chittagong hill tracts cht and were independent of the bengal sultanate next to them they became princely states of british india separate from bengal the chittagong hill tracts were 97 buddhist in 1947 but the british decided to include the chittagong hill tracts in east bengal east pakistan east pakistan became bangladesh a majority bengali sunni muslim country    pakistan dumped excess muhajir sunni migrants leaving the cht at 90 jumma buddhist and built the kaptai dam for electricity which led to 100000 jumma refugees fleeing to india    after independence bangladeshi leader ziaur rehman started the genocide in 1977 flooding the cht with bengali sunni muslim settlers and started killing and rape campaigns against jumma buddhists to make the cht into a majority bengali sunni muslim land jumla buddhists are now 35 and bengali sunni are now 65 of the cht the bengali sunni colonial settlers are rapists    jumma buddhists started an insurgency to fight back from 19771997 they were called the shanti bahini the jumma buddhists would behead rapist sunni settlers and leave their corpses floating in the rivers             bangladeshi army and settlers are still attacking and destroying jumma villages raping forbidding jummas from talking to western foreigners and journalists without bengali soldiers watching
  there are jumma buddhist monks who want to reform the armed shanti bahini and fight the bengali sunnis again                                                          
  the bengali sunni muslim settlers attempt the same in assam and nagaland but were beaten back myanmar ruled assam before 1826 but after the treaty of yandabo in the first anglo burmese war the british annexed assam and arakan from myanmar    the british wanted to grow tea in assam so they imported dravidians to grow tea they then needed rice to feed the dravidians so they imported millions of bengali sunni and bengali hindus to grow rice in assam and arakan the native hindu assamese like the caucasian brahmins and mongoloids like the ahom bodos and lalung were furious the hindu assamese natives dont have problems with moderate assamese sunni muslims but they hate the extremist radical bengali sunni immigrants for being terrorists and bengali hindu immigrants for threatening their language and ethnic identity    assamese hindu natives rioted against bengali hindus in the 1980s for trying to make bengali language official the assamese natives then killed thousands of bengali sunni invaders in mass battles in 1983 2008 2012 and 2014 the bengali sunnis started tje violence by demanding their own muslim autonomous region on native assamese land and raped and murdered native assamese girls the assamese ahom bodo and lalung responded by killing thousands of bengali sunni terrorists    a bengali sunni immigrant in neighbouring nagaland raped a naga woman in 2015 and then the native mongoloid nagas lynched the bengali sunni to death
    would a unified india without the partition be worse off or better off
  the lynching of the bengali sunni rapist by mongoloid nagas in 2015 happened in dimapur indian sunnis tried to riot all over india in 2012 by atracking all mongoloid looking people from northeast indias seven sister states sikkim nepal and tibet after the bodo hindus killed dozens of bengali sunni terrorists in battle in bodoland the mongoloid bodo hindus responded by killing dozens of more bengali sunni terrorists in 2014 to show what would happen to indian sunnis if they tried to chimpout    the bengali sunnis in assam sought help from the muslim brotherhood and alqaeda and asked them to declare jihad against assamese and naga natives    assamese hindus have demanded all bengalis sunni and hindu since 1826 be stripped of residency and deported back to bangladesh india has decided in that direction recently to strip millions of them of citizenship and deport    the hindu mongoloids and buddhist mongoloids of assam tripura arakan and other neighbours have long defeated sunni muslim invasions     hindu mountaineers in himchal pradesh slaughtered the sunni turkic invading army of muhammad bin tughluq in the qarachil expedition    tibetan buddhists slaughtered the sunni turkic invading army of bakhtiyar khilji in chumbi valley in 1206 khiljis turkic sunni muslim army tried to rape buddhist women but instead were slaughtered by the buddhists until only khilji was left alive khilji screamed in horror and fled back to bengal alone where he died in terror weeks later    the hindu mongoloid tai ahom in assam defeated the mughal turkic sunni invading armies and slaughtered them maintaining assamese independence    the hindu mongoloid tripuris regularly defeated the sunni bengal sultanate invasions and annexed chittagong city they massacred bengal sultanate armies    the mongoloid rakhine buddhist kingdom of mrauku ruled in arakan and defeated the sunni bengal sultanate raiding into dhaka itself
  i didnt want to include racial shit like mongoloid or caucasian but some people think all hindus are caucasian this is the reason race is labelled turkic sunni invaders from central asia themselves were mongoloid
  why the fuck was india not made up into many states that could represent each ethnicity when the british left instead of this clusterfuck
  the rohingya in arakan myanmar are descendants of bengali sunni muslims brought by britain to farm rice after annexing arakan from myanmar in 1826 the natives of arakan are rakhine buddhists native buddhists in myanmar dont have a problem with moderate myedu sunni muslims kamein sunni muslims or hui panthay sunni muslims but they hate rohingya bengali sunni extremist terrorists influenced by wahhabi bengali faraizi movement wahhabi najdi ikhwan and alqaeda rohongyas tried to claim rakhine buddhist land in arakan as sunni bengali land and declare an islamic state in 1948 before myanmar defeared the rohingya in operation monsoon even hui sunni muslims in myanmar dérogatorily call rohingyas and indian sunni muslims kalar and view them as extremist dont like praying in the same mosques as them and do not intermarry with them hui sunnis build separate mosques in myanmar from indian sunnis and hui sunnis accuse indian sunnis of spreading fundamentalism extremism and terrorism
  if unified india let go of all nonindoaryan and dravidian areas like cht seven sisters sikkim ladakh baltistan balochistan and pashtunistan it would be better off
  because of bengali sunni chimpout noakhali massacre and rape of thousands of bengali hindus by bengali sunnis direct action day in calcutta they threatened even more
  couldnt care less
    sunni islamists born of conquest ie indian sunnis hate indigenous based ethnostates because it shatters their pathetic world view claiming the legacy of their conquerors who raped and converted them the turkic delhi sultanates and mughals
  i dont care about rohingyas receiving just karma from buddhists the rohingya are terrorists and irrelevant to the west basically cockroaches
  in 1946
all ive got to say is fuck islam  drops the mic
  the british also promised independence to the jumma buddhist princely states in the chittagong hill tracts during world war ii for the jumma buddhists being proally but in 1947 radcliffe drew them into east pakistan later bangladesh
  the kamata koch behar and koch hajo were hindu kingdoms in the same region which fought off the sunni bengal sultanate hindu tripura and buddhist mrauku easily defeated the bengal sultanate the hindu kamarupa kingdom in assam helped fuck bakhtiyar khilji by letting him through to chumbi at first but blocking and fucking his return route the assamese and nagas refer to bengali sunnis as miya while rakhine and burmese refer to bengalis as kalar
  the koch dynasties were founded by the hindu koch rajbongshi people
  bengali sunni islamist buddhist hindu islamist buddhist bengali sunni hindu islamist sunni buddhist islamist bengali buddhist hindu islamist bengali hindu sunni bengali hindu buddhist sunni bengali buddhist sunni hindu
  fuck off we dont care
      samefagging sunni fuck off no human cares about rohingyas
so basically the north east indian states have a problem with bengali/bangladeshi muslims but not indian muslims
  the local northeasterner assamese sunni muslims and manipuri meithei speaking sunni muslims arent the same as mainland indian muslims on the other side of the chickens neck siliguri corridor the assamese hindus have no problems with the local moderate northeasterner assamese sunni muslims and mongoloid manipuri meithei hindus had no problem with moderate manipuri meithei speaking sunni muslims but they have a big problem with radical bengali sunni muslims and with the mainland beyond the chicken neck indian sunni muslims the radical mainland indian sunnis support the bengali sunni illegals and the northeasterners hate the radical extremist mainlander indian sunnis and bengali sunnis but not their own moderate assamese sunnis and manipuri sunnis        burmese and rakhine buddhists have no problem with moderate local myedu sunni muslims kamein sunni muslims or hui panthay sunni muslims but they hate radical extremist mainlander indian sunni and rohingya bengali sunni migrants to myanmar who came in the british colonial rule hui sunnis in myanmar dont like the indian sunnis either they view them as extremist and spreaders of terrorism and having a dirty culture and call them kalar which is an insult hui sunnis in myanmar say indian sunni imams and mosques spread evil terrorist ideas among the sunni muslims
these sunni islamists are inciting against buddhism and whining about rohingyas                    
  india was made into an independent dominion and then they decided to declare independence and keep their current borders the british arent responsible for this
  you have no idea about the cht do you no the jumma buddhists werent given a choice to declare independence sir cyril radcliffe drew them right into east pakistan since he said the jumma buddhist chittagong hill tracts should go with bengali sunni majority chittagong port even though they have nothing to do with each other than beginning with the same name they were not given a choice to declare independence this wasnt kashmir or hyderabad the three jumma buddhist kingdoms chakma circle bohmong circle mong circles in the cht were considered quasi princely states on a lower level than the main princely states who were given the option of the independence the jumma kingdoms were given absolutely no say in the matter no independence no choice of even joining india or myanmar they were put into east pakistan by radcliffe unilaterally
    the british partitioned india and upon partition withe line drawn by the british pakistan and india became independent states india did not declare independence as a unified state and divide itself the british radcliffe did the hack job of drawing the borders
so i dont really know much about the history of french politics at least after napoleon iii    sorry since this is sort of current eventy but comparatively speaking how large are the current french protest compared with other protests over the postwar period    have french presidents been forced out of office as a result of any
parisians protest like 3 times a month
  how common is sniper fire on protestors though        not to mention macaron held an emergency meeting today while his numbers are in the tank
  not too out of the norm but its mostly been a paris thing historically not exclusively of course but they do the most sperging out
whats going on in france and why are there protests
    also read 
  the french chimp out every few weeks because they dont like something or they want gibs  then they get gibs which leads to higher taxes so they protest to lower the taxes  the spirit of robespierre lives on
  dreyfus affair is still ongoing
  based
  well the media told me they are altright nazis who are rioting racistly over fuel prices
oops sorry thought this was a yellow turban thread
a couple of years ago you had protests about the jobs act and there too people were larping about the coming revolution and shit  frenchies just like to chimp out thats all
    as long as they dont start executing the families of the government officials then im all for it
  i mean this guy  does lend credence to the idea
at least protesting is still allowed in france    protesting is illegal in the usa for the most part
  remember when those indian nazis were upset over their wealth going to the english
  if you have to have your protests cleared by the state theyre not really a right are they more like youre allowed to protest what the government is ok with you protesting whereas in this instance since theyre protesting the state its declared illegal and protesters getting sniped and run over
  holy shit where the fuck do you people live
  tell me more about how those mean arab and african overlords are colonizing you anon that doesnt sound altright at all
  sounds like an incel mad because he cantt hold a job without mouthing off about politics so hes mad all he can do is live off social welfare
  retarded middle class and poor fag complaining that taxation is theft while wanting more welfare and public services police has been soft on them because its mostly white people so they they decided its okay to torch public building vandalize historical monuments and smash art pieces
  some asshurt republicans brought guns to lamarques funeral and the gendarmes overreacted
  the parisians were pissed off at the emperors conduct in the war and established a marxist commune the prussians decided to let the new republican government handle it
    you have to be alt right to dislike a bunch of foreigners getting free housing medicare and food while breeding like cockroaches all with taxmoney beaten and extorted out of you
  macron was also a huge disappointment a banker elite  lmao what the hell did you frogs expect from a literal rothschild banker
  theyre shit      its in frogspeak but you can easily guess
  yes thats literally the definition of the alt right
    not being suicidal is altright
  marx said history repeats itself the first time as a tragedy then as a farce the french are doomed to always try to remake the french revolution but it always seems like a bad parody
  well i guess theres literally nothing wrong with being altright then
  kek underrated post
  only the paris commune sperg out really reaches the depths of truly bad parody
  boomer 21 yearolds cant handle not being allowed to use uni dormitories as whorehouses and have been trying to convince the unions to establish an anarchist government   they say the president fled paris and is thinking about sending in the army
  implying 68 wasnt even worse
the current protests are nothing compared to 68 which de gaulle not only survived but grew stronger from  he was rewarded with a historic majority in the next election    as a general historical rule  the silent majority whilst initially sympathetic with the grievances behind the protests grows to abhor it in the face of rioting/extremism pushing them back into the arms of the government
  spiner fire on protestors  tasnimnews  fake news retard
  i forgot about 68 that was bad but i still think the commune was even worse paris could not have been more out of step with the rest of the country which i think had little sympathy for them aside from their being under siege
  not a good comparison the 68 rioters were spoiled kids who chimped out purely because their college professors taught them to larp as revolutionaries of course they toned down once things got serious
  this   macron is no hollande hes not going to retreat for a few burned cars and smashed windows he will let the yellow jackets ruin their own public image and then disband because they have no internal unity at best you can expect him to say je vous ai compris and then throw a tax cut in the general direction of the middle class       this is absolutely retarded and not a representation of the concerns of the gilets jaunes just one stormnigger being delusional on 4chan
  macron is no hollande  macron is different hes joobiter
  mai 68 started as a student movement but involved the strike of eleven fucking million people the gilets jaunes are just hundreds of thousands of angry suburbaners that go to town on paris once a week
  milions of spoiled college kids yes
  i think your understanding of demographics might be slightly askew if you think spoiled college kids comprised 22 of the population of france      this  the number of gilets jaunes protesting has already halved since the unrests inception and a number of prominent voices from its beginning have disowned it
  why would you post a pic of yourself are you retarded   when the bonnets rouges revolt started hollande acted like a softy and gave in that didnt help his popularity rating macron saw that happen and hes just not gonna do that thats what he calls being a joobiteran president thats just factually the truth   i can assume that you dont know what a bonnet rouge is
  protests and civil rest arent uncommon in france the largest by far was probably in may 1968
  protesting is illegal in the usa for the most part  no its not you just need to file a permit so that the city knows youre going to be taking up public space on that date
  theres literally a video of it happening
  the first one was rather cringe desu
  being so brainlet you quote marx about history the guy who based a retarded economic theory off an even more retarded historical theory
  i love french people keep up the good work
reminder that higher fuel prices is just a bandaid that will do nothing to fight climate change change plus it hurts the working class    if you really want to reduce emissions why not do away with cars altogether and make less shit trains giving people their own little vehicles that sit around and do nothing 90 of the time is incredibly wasteful its a massive waste of money and resources and if we want to get serious about reducing emissions we need to give up cars and beef     seethe all you want you dirty suburban mutts
you can tell when someone only started following politics with the 2016 election because they think paris rioting is something new
is politics ultimately just a matter of theological disputes
no
  realpolitik is a short position to make short term goals at the expense of long term outcomes    theology has its roots in the same vein of ruse to front the mob up based in the divine right of kings theocracy
  realpolitik  
why does vietnam have so many worldclass commanders and why are they so good at beating invaders
  so good they were under chinese rule for over a millenia and under the french for a century
you do know they repelled the us with help from chinese soldiers in vc uniforms and russian weapons dont you
  so afterward the vietnamese beat the chinese on multiple occasions      so who did the vast majority of the fighting
the mongols and manchus sent muslims to attack the vietnamese the mongols levied tens of thousands of central asian muslim soldiers stationed in yunnan under umar ibn nasruddin to invade vietnam in the 1258 1285 1288 the qing dynasty sent hui muslim soldiers under hui muslim commander xu shiheng to fight vietnam in 1788 both umar ibn nasruddin and xu shiheng were killed umar ibn nasruddin at the battle of bạch đằng in 1288 and xu shiheng at the battle of ngọc hồiđống đa in 1789
  those central asian muslims came from bukhara and samarqand and were restationed in yunnan by the mongols for attacking vietnam and myanmar part of the hui muslims in yunnan today are descended from them
everyone who goes into their jungles gets bit by mosquitos and dies also its hard to fight in tht territory
  the mongols swapped han chinese and central asian muslims to opposite landsmongols sent han chinese troops to garrison central asia and appointed han chinese and khitans as governors in samarqand and bukhara over central asian muslims and used han chinese soldiers to conquer central asian from the khwarezmians and baghdad from the abbasids appointing a han chinese general guo kan as governor of baghdad the mongols then moved central asian muslim officials and soldiers to yunnan province but yunnan was actually not a han chinese province it was a majority bai state called the dali kingdom only ruled by a han chinese king from the duan family umars grandfather sayyid ajall and his father nasruddin were appointed as governors of yunnan with the duan king staying as a vassal of the mongols umar was then sent to invade vietnam with his central asian muslim troops mongol calvary and yunnan tribal auxiliaries and died they were also sent to invade northern burma myanmar before withdrawing from burma  part of the hui muslim people in yunnan are a result of them
  before annexed to become jiaozhi vietnam âu lạc văn lang was not very centralized also had tiny population 500k compare to 50m of han chinese empire official record of han dynasty right before the three kingdoms era our land was only around the red river delta the han mostly just need to control cổ loa hanoi to control jiaozhi  read about the early revolts it was always like start at cổ loa then other tribe leader join in one time spread into southern modern china  also the chinese have so much exp fighting so many wars compare to vietnamese at that point as in hundred years exp in warfare  that said there was some short successes at resistances or revolts      nah chinese and north korean at most run some anti air or doing the rear guard role in the north
quang trung is pretty much a what could have been case   also hes not much of a genius in tactics but more on logistics many of his victory is due to mobilizing troops much faster than others expect at the time
      whats your point
  whats wrong with adding information there is no point then to this thread or posting on this board
  are you autistic normally when people add paragraphs of information like that they end with some kind of conclusion or argument you have none
  okay i guess conclusion is mongols were retards for bringing central asians to fight in tropical jungle
  everyone  yes including the viets  i hate these memes gooks like to fight in jungle european had advantages over the mongol because of wooded lands like what the fuck are you retarded this is not video game where you have 5 def 5 attack in jungle everyone dies in the jungle you stupid nigger
  jungle natives are genetically resistant to malaria through natural selection invaders like mongols suffered from malaria and even smallpox
  both muslim commanders invaded vietnam exactly 500 years apart
im just here to continue my tradition of posting in every myopic nam thread to deliver the oft overlooked answer to who won vietnam  america beat america to the communists benefit   president a done deal  president b not on my watch  it was an outright slaughter without even using the abomb then the peacenicks called it off this is politics people this is what happens when your country switches leadership and ideologies midwar  unless you can prove that the power shift was due to vietnamese election meddling lmao it wasnt a vietnamese win america is indeed still number one   this is why they say strategic win political loss
  chams were a mix of muslims and hindus why didnt the muslims in yunnan contact the cham muslims in champa before attacking vietnam
  so youre blaming the loss on backstabbing by deviant civilian elements
  mongols and manchus suffered severely from malaria and smallpox northern han were immune to smallpox but not to malaria only southern natives were immune to malaria
  yes
  simple because their strategy is just to tough it out until the enemy gets tired and leaves
  so everything outside the red river delta was whose land
  worldclass commanders   no they didnt actually their military doctrines structures even weapons are largely derived from china also have you noticed the statue in your pic dressed absolutely like chinese you must have
  youre stupid
you know what arms and armour we never see  vietnamese    anyone got any
you chinks are obnoxiously stupid
  because their language contains no pewling thoroughly bourgeois subjunctive mood wishing hoping promising excuse making etc thats why
  citation on chinese soldiers in both french and us wars
  nigga what nguyễn cao kỳ said he gave up on anticommunism because the diaspora community love making huge promises then deliver fuck all sometimes even running away with the funds
  ok some forms of promisemaking require a future tense plain and simple other forms employ the subjunctive ie imaginary time making excuses in particular
  aanyone
  you lot really should update your knowledge sometime rather than endlessly shitposting  china admits combat in vietnam warnews date 1989/05/17        china sent 320000 troops and annual arms shipments worth 180 million325 the chinese military claims to have caused 38 of american air losses in the war31 china claimed that its military and economic aid to north vietnam and the viet cong totaled 20 billion approx 143 billion adjusted for inflation in 2015 during the vietnam war31 included in that aid were donations of 5 million tons of food to north vietnam equivalent to nv food production in a single year accounting for 1015 of the north vietnamese food supply by the 1970s31
    wei guo qingsenior military officer  wei was deeply involved in chinas relations with north vietnam from 1950 in april of that year liu shaoqi sent him to vietnam as head of the chinese military advisory group to advise ho chi minh on fighting the french5 wei remained in vietnam until september 1955 in this role he led a group of 281 experienced military officers from the second third and fourth field armies in a mission that began within days of the outbreak of the korean war weis work across field army lines would stand him in good stead later in his career general chen geng joined the cmag in july as the representative of the central committee but left for korea in november leaving wei as the senior chinese official in vietnam    in october 1953 wei reportedly personally gave ho chi minh a copy of the french navarre plan6 in response the việt minh pushed on to lai châu and toward northern laos rather than the red river delta some months later in 1954 wei is said to have advised general võ nguyên giáp to surround and attack general navarre at dien bien phu a strategy that eventually led to complete french withdrawal from indochina        navarre wrote that under the influence of chinese advisers the viet minh commanders had used processes quite different from the classic methods the artillery had been dug in by single piecesthey were installed in shellproof dugouts and fire pointblank from portholesthis way of using artillery and aa guns was possible only with the expansive ant holes at the disposal of the vietminh and was to make shambles of all the estimates of our own artillerymen50   
  red river delta and ma river delta modern day thanh hóa province was our original homeland    outside of that nearest are some other vietic speaking group up the northern mountain land there was taikadai speaking tribe some lived there for long time some migrated there later runaway from the han chinese but it was very sparsely populated  central vietnam was belong to the cham the central highland to the degar tribes southern vietnam was khmer empire it also very sparsely populated when viets march into what was saigon it was only a fishing village  outside of champa and chenla other groups didnt have a state          vietnam use chinese design derived armor weapon and doctrines because it work no need to reinvent the wheel dress wise we copied some invented the rests  but that is not relevant cause we are talking about good commander  also the most important viet military books get burned along with pretty much every books ming army find in vietnam ordered by hongwu      that is a key strategy but we also won major open battles
  they were chinese adviser they did not join actual combat
  guy in the op repelled a qing invasion at the north in 6 days 2 months including the time he hauls his troops from phu xuan hue and conscript every male he saw along the way  its actually the only one time viet decide to win it fast
  any brainlet can beat an enemy army on their hometurf especially when the terrain is dense jungles
  see this  i post 2 posts
    also vietnamese at times was developing top tier weapon  hồ nguyên trừng was called fire arm god 火器之神 by the ming   vietnamese musket was actually best of the world at one time    im not an blind viet nationalist denying chinese influence on vietnam no need to flex that on me      this is an american vietnam war meme most of our won battle are on water and then on flat land
  that fucken stupid wwi meme  vietnam was started on a lie and continued on the drafting of slave soldiers from the bottom end of society the society rejected it not deviants     this is a good post but the dolschstosslegende is a rusty load of bullshit and trying to see a 1960s war through a lens of wwi nostalgia is dumb as dirt
  you cant beat a popular insurgency made up of locals napoleon couldnt but the us was okay with burning tons of money and lower socioeconomic bullet sponges to show russia and china theyd go the distance
  here are more         youre welcome to dig up more by yourself if youre not satisfied
  any brainlet can beat an enemy army on their hometurf  wellabout that
  i did posted yesterday confirm chinese troops run anti air in northen vietnam and guard northen vietnam when our troop station near the south  so yeah technically i made mistake cause anti air is also combat  do you have source about chinese number lost of man in indochina wars
  beating invaders    they dont beat the invaders fucking jungles and hot weather does    plus  fbpb
  source on the battles i suppose its also important to clarify what you mean by battles i would say ambushes would count as battles plus just saying parts of battles were fought on open water or flat land ignores the context of how certain battles began like starting with heavy fire from tree cover then advancing when the enemy starting routing
    naval battles  against southern han    against mongol yuan    against thai siam     civil war against nguyen lord  france allies  
  we have taken echo
    open flat land battle  against song started by viet offensive battle invade into southern china siege some cities ended with the battle of như nguyệt when song army invade into vietnam both side hold one side of the nhu nguyet river then viet force attack and won      against ming      against qing      also various battles wars against champa dali / nanzhao lanxang laos khmer empire siam when viet was on offensive side    does battle of dien bien phu count
  we are losing fostroh
    ambush from the tree cover is legit tactic not inline with the claim of jungle beat the invaders which mean some kind of slow meat grinder inside the jungle like the american vietnam war
  no tactics are not legit
  vietnamese military history is extremely overrated    1000 years of enslavement to the chinese  followed by 1000 years of being a vassal to china  also got conquered by ming  also got colonized by france and had to beg qing for help  the capital got destroyed multiple times during victories  the main tactic was to hide in the mountains while the invaders suffered from heat disease and hunger and finally went back home
  so who did the vast majority of the fighting  the hippie movement
  good post
what kind of armor and weapons did they use in the middle ages did they use chinese gear
  europeans invented guns therefore all battles in which chinks used guns and won will be credited to the europeans    now fuck off with your stupid logic with chinese characteristics
  the fuck are you on about you sepo
  no actual source and just pure claim made by chinese who loves revisionism    some months later in 1954 wei is said to have advised general võ nguyên giáp to surround and attack general navarre at dien bien phu a strategy that eventually led to complete french withdrawal from indochina  he did he told giap to zerg rush the hill it was giap who pulled back the troop and went slow that he managed to win that battle  considering china immediately attacked vietnam when pol pot was on the verge of losing it was not possible for vietnam to have chinese soldiers anywhere in its territory
  based võ nguyên giáp trusting a chinese is akin to suicide
    trust the vietnamese magic invisible potions        phan xích long also known as hồng long born phan phát sanh 18931916 was a 20thcentury vietnamese mystic and geomancer who claimed to be the emperor of vietnam he attempted to exploit religion as a cover for his own political ambitions having started his own ostensibly religious organisation claiming to be a descendant of emperor hàm nghi long staged a ceremony to crown himself before trying to seize power in 1913 by launching an armed uprising against the colonial rule of french indochina his supporters launched an attack on saigon in march 1913 drinking potions that purportedly made them invisible and planting bombs at several locations the insurrection against the french colonial administration failed when none of the bombs detonated and the supposedly invisible supporters were apprehended         the organisation and motivation of the uprisings were unclear since many different organizations of vietnamese revolutionaries with different ideologies were involved some were supporters of the mystic and geomancer phan xich long1 who had claimed to be a descendant of the boy emperor hàm nghi who had been deposed by the french for attempting a revolt with the aim of securing independence some three decades earlier long had been imprisoned three years earlier after declaring himself emperor and attempting to storm saigon with the help some purported magic potion to restore the monarchy longs supporters sought his release from jail1
  myanmar burma had far more worldclass commanders and was better at beating invaders they had top commanders like maha bandula and defeated the portuguese french assamese manipur thailand manchus and killed the most british and indian troops a nonindian enemy ever inflicted on the british east india company
myanmar is a piece of shit though no offense
  piece of shit at what myanmar has far less population than vietnam but conquered more and defeated more
  my nigga you are retarded
  lmao are you autistic past military victories is the worth of a country what have those military victories given them today i said myanmar is a piece of shit and its true
  myanmar is now bigger than vietnam with a smaller population bamar were strictly confined to the upper irrawaddy valley and all the other land was conquered unlike vietnam myanmar always had a shortage of people and manpower vietnam would use its overwhelming numbers of soldiers and colonists to flood champa khmer and laotian lands in military campaigns myanmar would do the opposite and instead deport conquered peoples into central myanmars upper irrawaddy since myanmar always had a desperate shortage of people myanmar used strategy to defeat and conquer thats why ethnic minority regions of myanmar today are majority ethnic minority not majority bamar but in vietnam the former ethnic minority lands are now filled with the expanded vietnamese horde
  lmao and that is why myanmar is screwed because of all those ethnicities lmao youre making it seem as if vietnam had an enormous population and just flooded other countries thats china though
  vietnam had an enormous population millions more than champa and cambodia and flooded them all vietnams population exploded in the le dynasty enabling vietnam to finally and permanently overwhelm champa with soldiers and millions of vietnamese colonists vietnam is a mini china in sea and hated by its indicised neighbours myanmar conquered all those lands without using its population to overhwhelm vietnam still has a bigger population than laos cambodia thailand myanmar and malaysia by tens of millions
  cry about it some more 
  not that dude but ok ill bite please explain why exactly myanmar is shit    also heres your you
  read the news samefag
  no actual source  ive posted a bunch of sources   all open to public for years if you want more you can go find it yourself if you think theyre unreliable then you should provide evidences mindless labeling is useless and only makes you look like a real revisionist       they did trust chinese and they won 武元甲 was supported and trained by chinese nationalists kmt during his early years before he shifted to communism he learned his military doctrine from sunzis art of war this is well known fact     also see pic and thisi already posted it before  navarre wrote that under the influence of chinese advisers the viet minh commanders had used processes quite different from the classic methods the artillery had been dug in by single piecesthey were installed in shellproof dugouts and fire pointblank from portholesthis way of using artillery and aa guns was possible only with the expansive ant holes at the disposal of the vietminh and was to make shambles of all the estimates of our own artillerymen50    you have to deal with it no matter how butthrt you are
      lmao the only one butthurt is you that you had to post the same shit 3 times arent you going to delete and repost again because you misspelled butthurt
  ok thanks for not explaining
  i deleted my former posts because i made some mistakes its a bit long and knowledgeable post with actual information unlike your pure shisposts which still fail to provide any useful knowledge and rebuttal other than mindless ad hominem
  explaining yourself on 4chan    no really are you autistic
  if you think theyre unreliable then you should provide evidences mindless labeling is useless and only makes you look like a real revisionist  the fact that this  provides no source on who said that china sent troop and even so those werent troops who fought against french and us soldiers but for support  this one only mentioned supervisor who did a shit job as giap did pull back his artillery units before making the real assault  and this  first link only shows a bunch of ref second link shows no actual source or citation and basically just an answer on paper  again if china did send troops to fight and stay then they wouldnt have to prepare a large force when nva fought pol pot later
  you have to deal with it no matter how butthrt you are  found it  
where did aboriginal taiwanese come from and who was on taiwan before them there are stories of taiwans natives massacring a preexisting negrito population as they took over the whole of the island but if thats the case how did the negritos get to taiwan  a journey which requires openocean sailing
  damn taiwanese cute
good wakeup
  negritos live in the philippines and andaman islands besides malaysia and thailand
  negritos and related groups only live on isolated islands dumbass of course they could get there
  they are polynesians who came from malaya
some believe the original inhabitants of taiwan were from the lost tribe of israel
  due to the large diversity in austronesian languages among the aboriginal taiwanese it is theorized to be the homeland of the whole language family i believe although this is mainly based off of linguistics and some genetic evidence there is some scant genetic evidence of the reverse implied by   but it is far less likely   before that the ancestors of said ancestral austronesians probably just arrived from mainland china
some interesting lore    taiwan ritual honors lost tribe of small people     the saisiyat indigenous group dances around the clock fueled by meat and alcohol to remember a darkskinned pygmylike people who once shared its territory    xiang tian hu taiwan  chu kuosheng danced for 24 hours in the cold mountain rain to draw attention to a seldomdiscussed chapter of taiwanese history he linked arms with dozens of others chanted and slowly shuffled across a field    about 600 people performed the exhausting ritual last weekend that honors a pygmylike people skin as dark as those from equatorial africa who chus own tribe admits to exterminating in battle between 1000 and 2000 years ago    the ceremony called pastaay is a tribute to a lost tribe of pygmies who may have numbered 90000 at their peak and resembled tribes living today in papua new guinea they disappeared leaving no archaeological records that point conclusively to their existence but anthropologists believe they were wiped out by other tribes like the saisiyat of which chu is a member    the ceremony is held every two years to thank the vanquished tribe for teaching its neighbors how to farm when they shared a steep forested region of taiwan just south of todays main hightech district    
  its a pact between us and the short people when this time comes to perform the ceremony and to skip it would be a violation chu 48 said at a boisterous dinner its attendees dressed in traditional red and white robes and ready to dance according to information from our elders they gave us what we needed to work farm and get by    historians in taiwan say the tribe was ethnically linked to short darkskinned people who still live in southeast asia including malaysia and the philippines elsewhere in asia they are known as negritos    the saisiyat who have lighter skin and asiatic features killed the last of the pygmies in battle over a classic issue among men local elders say the pygmies would pursue saisiyat women enraging the tribe    the saisiyat ultimately forced a battle cornering so many pygmies on a bridge that the entire tribe drowned when warriors damaged the span tipping it into a mountain river said chu funglu master of ceremonies at the second of taiwans two biennial pastaay ceremonies that are held around xiang tian hu a village in mountainous northwestern taiwan whose name means toward heaven lake    pygmies may have reached taiwan from madagascar via the islands of southeast asia scholars say the taiwanese governments council of aboriginal affairs acknowledges the darkskinned tribe called the small people in mandarin chinese
  we may have only legends but everyone knows the pygmies were around said pan chiujung a commissioner for the government of miaoli county where the xiang tian hu ceremony took place    almost all the saisiyat were expected to drop by one of two ceremonies which ended monday the tribe is one of 14 recognized indigenous groups in taiwan where it would traditionally hunt in the islands high central mountains over the last 50 years the saisiyat have moved to cities for work often forming an invisible underclass    for the rituals opening night in xiang tian hu ethnic han chinese from around taiwan packed shuttle buses that rumbled up a curvy mountain road to the ceremony venue half an hour from the nearest town about 98 of taiwans 23 million people are han    huddled in rain slickers the spectators took photos as groups of saisiyat men in costume chanted and danced their way across a field after finishing large meaty meals along with nonstop alcohol    the pygmies were really accomplished but they had one bad habit which is that they were lustful said hu leefen who watched the festival on opening night but this is my first time here ive done my homework but i want to know more
  some negritos live in peninsular malaysia and southern thailand which are not islands
  the semang and orang asli
  did they actually lose the shipbuilding and sailing technology they used to have modern andaman natives apparently dont have much in the way of boats
  putative map of east asia at last glacial maximum  youre welcome
  they are very basal and have been around for more than 10000 years losing boats isnt that suprising
  theyve probably been around before the sea levels rose their ancestors could have just walked there you know thats how early humans went to papua and australia
that dude on the right looks andean
  its very simple only the retards that didnt know how to build boats stayed on the isolated islands
  theres still like 50 miles to cross from papua to sahul they had to have boats its also further than you can see so they had to have some knowledge of navigation
relevant to 
  meant sunda not papua
  that thread really went down at least soneone mentioned nostratic
    welp not to taiwan people down south needing boats to cross the sea doesnt mean the ancestors of the taiwanese needed it as well
  the australoid race once had a worldspanning empire but they lost all their technology during the younger dryas
reminder that all religions have their origins in the land of shinar in mesopotamia and that all humans spread around the world with their own babylonish beliefs after god confused their language sometime in the 3rd millenium    this is why every culture have similar caracteristics like a flood story myths of demigods magic and astrology snakes vs heroes the dying deity brought back to life    all of these can be found in every country on earth from the incas to the chinese and from the celts to the nubians     the only true version of history was recorded in the biblical genesis
flood story is a recounting of younger dryus impact event that raised sea levels wiping 80 of civilisation or whatever it was on the coast 12000ybp
  no it was a real life event   god brought a flood to destroy wicked humans and the nephilim  with time faithfless men distorted the original account and that is why we have so many stories of the flood like ziusudra utanapishtim and yu
  yes thats what i said a real life event smoke drugs
which son of noah are australian aborigines descended from
  the ugly one that was never invited to family gathering and left out of every family picture
  since japheth is the ancestor of indoeuropeans and shem the forebear of semitic people only ham is left and his kin may have been the more impacted by the confusion of languages  in any case ham is probably the abcestor of the aborigenes perhaps through cush who is also confirmed to be the ancestor of nubiansà south arabs and probably sumerians kassites and harappans as well
  then what about blacks east asians and native americans
  i just told you ham is their ancestor    blacks come from cush whose descendants settled in nubia first then spread in the rest of africa  the name of their forebear was preserved by the name kush which is the ancient name for the region of nubia south of egypt  hams other son phut is also considered to have been the other ancestor of black people as well as north african tribes like the berbers    as for amerindians and east asians they maybe have been descendants of canaan as i personally see many similarities in their cultures  some say that the chinese come from sin a son a canaan which is why the chinese consider themselves to descend from the folkloric father sin whose name gave the name china and the prefix sin as in sinology the study of chinese culture  canaanites of palestine have apparently abandonned their original language in favor of a semitic one perhaps because of aramaic influence thus it is not known what language the canaanites originally spoke if my theory is confirmed there should be similarities between the chinese and amerindian tongues but both of these languages have not been extensively studied

socialism doesnt wo
an agrarian command economy is not socialist and certainly doesnt say anything about industrial socialism
collapses into civil war when a few foreigners show up
also it worked so well that the entire society was overthrown by a small expeditionary force from the far side of the world
well where are they now did they not work or something
    thats not fair the spaniards were too technologically advanced for the inca to possibly defeat
  but it is gone now dipshit
  how did the spaniards acquire that superior technology was it socialism
  it collapsed before that hence how they were able to exploit the vacuum iirc
  they werent still in the stone age thats why
  how did the spaniards acquire that superior technology      mostly geography
  socialism is so weak it can be defeated by things as simple as where water or mountains are  pathetic
  idiot the spanish where on the eurasian landmass not completely isolated from most of the civilized world they didnt have to invent/discover every advancement because technology diffuses with the interaction of peoples
  as simple as where water or mountains are
  fuck off diamond
  socialism  centuries before capitalism itself  was actually a fairer feudalism    socialist here stop hurting our movement with your wewuzzing and awful comparisons
  the spaniards were too technologically advanced  cad we end this meme we are supposed to be in a history board the spaniards were in completely inferiority in america and still won because of the inherent instability of the precolumbian civilizations
1 pick a historical figure  2 argue for their alignment
  1 stalin  2 lawful good regardless of whatever anyone says about him he was a true believer of the socialist cause didnt live a life of excess even though he could have and led the peoples of eastern europe to greatness
  1iosef stalin  2chaotic neutral  no regards to human suffering blatant selfish desires chaotic because secret police executions and disorganized frequently changing governments and gulags
both of these are right
  fuck chaotic evil
  blatant selfish desires  p r o o f s  r  o  o  f  s  even the most biased of western historians rarely make this claim because however brutal he may have been he clearly wasnt in it for himself
  1 stalin  2 true neutral  stalin respected law but was unafraid to use other methods when he felt legality was lacking he also sought the wellbeing of people but didnt balk at ruthless methods to insure stability
  francisco franco  tempered neutral  after he achieved his goals he just sat back and watched
  read breaking stalins nose  the guy might not have been after material wealth indeed he was communist but he loved his fame and power plus you have things like the winter and continuation war to consider wether it was justified or not
  read breaking stalins nose  its a fiction book  he loved his fame and power  he actively tried to reduce his cult of personality he was attached to his power because without him the ussr would fall into discord and succumb to a foreign power given the poststalin history of the ussr he was entirely right on that account  winter war  finland had been a part of russia to the same degree that chechnya was just a couple of decades prior  continuation war  finland invaded
going by the descriptions on that chart  napoleon as chaotic good   stop at nothing to spread statism and french values   ignore collateral damage and wage offensive campaigns against the coalitions created to stop him  expand france into a dominant in europe before being struck down   get exiled and literally have the armies sent to stop you turn to your side becauss youre that based
  1  john brown  2 slavery is evil as fuck i would do anything to stop it
  1 michael collins  2 chaotic good  michael wasnt afraid of what he believed in he had no problems with the murders of the british agents whose assassination he ordered he basically told the squad they had to be willing to shoot the enemy under any circumstances at any time and in the most effective way  he was doing it for his nation and didnt want to hurt innocents he was a good guy but he cared about plowing through the enemy and getting a job done first
bemp
woodrow wilson  lawful evil
  anastasius i lawful neutral  ascended to the throne as legitimately as could have been possible selected by the wife of the previous dead emperor  suppressed a large revolt in southwestern anatolia  stayed resolutely defensive when the persians suddenly and desperately assaulted the eastern border due to their financial problems  focused on maintaining order in the border provinces by creating strong fortresses  the rest of his reign was spent reforming the roman economy cracking down on corruption and embezzlement and making military spending more efficient  devoutly religious let god choose his successor and decided against better thoughts to give control of the empire after he died to an illiterate pig farmer  left the empire with over 300 thousand pounds of gold in the treasury when he passed after ruling for over 20 years a significant time to reign as roman emperors tended to die very shortly into their reign and he ascended to the throne at the age of 61
  i dont think he intended to be awful he just was so incompetent he became awful   so i say chaotic neutral

loses entire empire to stop someone else expanding east and gaining hegemony in continental europe  what was churchills endgame  was he really just a rothschild puppet   why was he so keen on war and why did britains powerful allow it
  
was destroying britain part of his plan
its really frightening when you notice how 90 of the stormfags dont even know that churchill wasnt the british pm in 1939
  why was he so keen on war and why did britains powerful allow it    because the nazis destroyed their cedibility early on the made it clear they would honor no treaties annex territory at whim and then finally invade without provocation nazis thought they could do whatever they wanted uk said no the nazis chimped out   this needs to be underlined 
  germany escalates a minor war in the balkans to a world war drags all the major powers and pisses them off loses utterly and completely despite the draconian treaty they forced on russia they got a light yet tough treaty despite the military officials forcing the german civilian sector to sign the treaty they blamed jews and communists for this betrayal victorious allies feel that the treaty was a bit harsh and forgive debt germans break the treaty anyways and start rearming start expanding and invading their neighbors again allies look the other way finally germany demands part of czechoslovakia allies give it in exchange of no more german aggression germany breaks the anglo  german treaty signed by hitler germany breaks the munich agreement signed by the nazis germany signs a treaty with poland to keep them neutral while they invade the rest of czechoslovakia germany signs a treaty with russia to keep them neural while they invade poland violating their previous treaty with poland germany would break that agreement with russia within a year and invade russia   germany has proved its word is worth less than a poodles shit only a complete buffoon would trust germanys word after how many times they broke their words before the ink had even dried   btw churchill was not the pm that declared war that was neville chamberlain who accepted that germans cant be reasoned with in peaceful ways churchill went out of his way to protect germans america and russia wanted to destroy germany to make it so it can never threaten europe ever again but churchill wouldnt accept that and pushed for less harsher punishment for the destroyers of europe
  churchill was a better nazi than the nazis incidentally this is why noone itt can convince retards like op otherwise  you cannot cure cancer by a majority  t based churchy
  t schlomo shekelburgerstein von kikenkutkock
  what is that even supposed to mean
  what is incorrect with anything in that post you give stormfags a bad name go fuck yourself you moron
  shame he didnt do physical extercise to temper his mindbody connection conjunctionally via active endocannabinoid system use hed have made better decisions and not left an intellectually bittersweet consensus likewise great british hierarchs in general
  1 russia not germany escalated the balkan crisis  2 germany was winning ww1 until    got america into the war  3 versailles was actually harsh and involved the complete disarmament national cuckoldry of a sovereign power something that not even your precious brestlitovsk did  4munich never demanded germany cease expansion  5 the soviets broke the mr pact first with their illegal under the treaty terms occupation of southern lithuania acknowledged as part of the german sphere of influence   6 the implication that churchill was using bulls hit after he came into power to justify his decade long hsteboner and constant calls to war with germany even before 1936
  oh its okay when (((you))) do it huh i want everyone to see the blatant double standards international jewry employs
  i think that the empire would almost certainly have been lost anyway ww2 just sped it up by maybe a decade or two for example i cant imagine britain being able to hold on to india indefinitely or even wanting to
    ww2 destroyed the british empire  not suez
  in india they credit hitler with weakening the empire enough for them to break free with little conflict hes a hero to them
  versailles was actually harsh  versailles reparations were actually smaller comparatively than what prussia imposed on france in 1871 for a war that least a year with relatively few casualties on both sides and almost no devastation of germany   munich never demanded germany cease expansion  it was literally signed with such intent and hitler made a promise so when he occupied czechoslovakia few months later in an act of blatant aggression no one was really willing to believe him he just wanted the corridor   to justify his decade long hsteboner and constant calls to war with germany even before 1936  except churchill was on the fringe of politics at that time and literally no one listened to him which is bad because if they did shitler and his gang would be stopped far sooner and we wouldve avoided a catastrophic war which crippled europe
  half of the firstside is dumb since nations like britain didnt know about the holocaust by 1940
    germany was winning before they started losing
  they did know about how germany treated the jewsand guess what despite the almighty jewish cabal that wanted to destroy them and controlled everyone else they still traded with germany made deals with them and gave them czechoslovakia on a platter  funny despite the jews omnipotence no one really did shit as they murdered jews in the street harassed them put them in concentration camps burned down synagogues and their property and then even made them pay for that   really makes you thinkor doesnt if youre stormtard with two functioning brain cells
  he looks like crowley
  stalin  is  bad    deports millions of russians to the ussr
  no one ever argues churchill was some paragon of morality and virtue  but he saw stalin as someone rational someone you could deal with hitler and nazis he saw them as rabid dogs that need to be put down and he was totally right about that
  but he saw stalin as someone rational someone you could deal with    churchill was a clueless mong like fdr that actually thought stalin was a nice guy right up until the iron curtain descended thank fuck he was voted out of power after the war lmao
  churchill didnt think so fdr didbut i guess they were right in the sense he was a rational person
    churchill  voted out after the war  after
    millions
okay spergs im not finding anything online now ill turn to you    can anyone here tell me something about this photo of paul rée lou salomé and nietzsche
  they had a threesome but it wasnt gay cause the balls never touched
  salomé and especially rée look pretty drunk while nietzsche looks like hes doing hes best to avoid eye contact because hes embarassed his penis is flacid as well so hes concentrating on not getting an erection in true incel fashion    my guess is they had a night out where nietzsche drunk nothing for some reason and the other two are just about to fuck i dont know why anyone would photograph this though
  proof that that is indeed a picture of paul rée lou salomé and nietzsche and not just three other random degenerates
  its photo shopped you fucking moron probably from an early erotic film or something
  fake
its not shopped but its not ree salome or nietzsche this is a real photo of them they look nothing like ops photo
nietzsche was insane
  nietzsches mustache was insane  ftfy
no not that macedonian prick      fuck
imagine being king of bohemia and also holy roman emperor of a bunch of germlings mustve been hard work tbqh
archery is a major part of hindu stories such as the ramayana and the mahabharata  what era are these tales from and what type of bows and arrows were used during that time ive been getting interested in archery and am interested in the types of bows and arrows used across the world by different peoples and cultures
bump
  the epics such as mahabharata and ramayana were likely subjected to change over time and got to their more or less final form by the gupta period you will also see a lot of legends and myths that originate right around this period so you could look into the era of 200/300 ad to 600/700 ad for these kinds of events in indian literary history
is khokhol asiatic slav or nordic in origin
  cossacks were turkic warriors who cucked the slavs so bad they became slavs themselves after centuries of taking slavic women the only case of slavic we wuz that is justified
  it predates cossacks
    its pig
  no khokhol describes the cossack haircut
  the guy i posted in the op is from 10th century
  cossacks existed before the 10th century they were cumans before they became christians and absorbed too many slavic women
  why would you call cumans cossacks just say cumans do you have any proof that its turkic in origin
  max vasmers etymological dictionary traces the name to the old east slavic word кoзaкъ kozak a loanword from cuman in which cosac meant free man12 the ethnonym kazakh is from the same turkic root131415 in modern turkish it is pronounced as kazak    in written sources the name is first attested in codex cumanicus from the 13th century1617
  100 pure subsaharan nigger
  why not all three
    pig
ignore this thread its already infested with mongoloidobsessed swede
  it was actually the opposite  after ivan the terriblethe based conquered his way through to azov he massacred all the tataromongolic tribes on his way  after that steppe lands became depopulated descolate and hard to control thats where all the slavic freedomlover came inmanny of them began living nomadic life together with turkic leftovers and began breeding out the remaining ones  basically cossacks cucked turks in real life unlike your fantasies 
  its turic in origins since svetoslav liked to larp and imitate the nomadic turic tribes he was battling and genociding like khazars and bolghars
  the rus were heavily influenced by turks    they were calling themselves khagans in the 9th century    
  because i want slavs to seem less european god why do you have to cloud my fantasies with facts/
  they are iranic
  all mixed
  sviatoslav  khokhol  he was a varangian rus  so nordic but they were a small ruling minority ruling slavs and finnougrians  your average khokhol is a slav with some turkic and balkan admixture in the south
  is that why the cossacks are almost extinct while there are millions of tatars in russia
  commies
  its originally a turkic hairstyle now its possible that turks got it from iranic/tokharian tribes they would have defeated then assimilated

i have to write a research paper within epistemology a lot of my ideas are either boring or sociological in nature can anyone spot me any research topics paper needs to be 15 pages  should revolve around  i trust in testimony and experts  ii reasonable peer disagreement  iii judgement aggregation  iv system design  i know im gay but help me out here not asking you to do it for me obvi im pretty new to all of this why do you enjoy epistemology personally i find it quite dry so i want find something interesting to talk about  my previous ideas were shot down thank you
  what is epistemology
  its the sciene of sciences innit
  fortunately you can just write about the ongoing replication crisis in the social sciences thats the big epistemic crisis of the moment and with good reason you can talk about an evolution from personalized epistemology appeal to a particular thinker the process of depersonalization and the appeal to a more abstract set of ideas in reference to a thinker aquinass aristotle/the philosopher might help here and then the completion of epistemic depersonalization in the form of abstract standards for data correlations  which now appear to be in trouble     its good stuff if i were still in school i would hammer this out in a few hours
  what were your previous ideas
  i would hammer this out in a few hours  do you mean because you know a lot about the subject already or because you know exactly where to go to get the information
  i trust in testimony and experts  ii reasonable peer disagreement  iii judgement aggregation  iv system design  is it all of these or just one
  you can talk about an evolution from personalized epistemology  you sure that has something to do with replication crisis not op by the way
  samefag here now that i think about it there might be a link to it but im not sure if this is just bullshit or not it has something to do with the shift from a simple reliance on classical logic inferences to complex bayesian ones
  just one there are different subtopics within those though but yes just one topic ex systems design then talk about the design of the court system etc  we have to have an argument
if the germans and italians didnt get involved in the spanish civil war would the republicans have won
    who knows highlander    who knows

arius did nothing wrong
are there any late roman sources that tell us if the late romans knew that their once great and powerful empire was a shadow of iits former self
  it was much more of a gradual transition to more local forms of authority than some sort of sudden shift it began in the late 300s with foederati tribes being granted land amidst endemic civil wars not that different from the generals and emperor prancing around with their mobile courts and armies then the germanic kings and local magnates started excercising more and more power and autonomy while not denouncing the emperor openly even odoacer still claimed to be a vassal of the eastern roman emperor franks didnt renounce their loyalty to the roman emperor until like the mid 500s when they already controlled most of france etc and so on     there was no point in time somebody would have woken up and found that the empire had fallen it was just transition spanning many generations and many many wars and upheavals one could argue that roman civilization never fully fell in the west it just experienced a very long crisis  the franks held basically the same position from before the fall until the first renaissances the land was dominated by germanic warrior aristocrats with their latinspeaking courts much like it had been in the very late empire the church was always there and linked to rome the major cities and fortified places remained much where they had been before if vastly decreased in size and probably sacked a bunch of times the law was always a garbled mix of local customs roman law and new laws imposed by the germans     there was never a clear break of continuity
they were aware the sack of the previously untouchable rome was carved into their psyche like few other things ever did the doom and gloom of the fifth century is largely the source of catholic fatalism and their a priori presumptions of sin
  rome had been in a near constant state of civil war since the early 200s though by the time the city itself got sacked it was not even near the center of power
  it was still the spiritual center of the empire youre underestimating just how much rome still meant to them the last time it had been violated was nearly 800 years earlier there were days of mourning declared in both halves of the empire pagans took it as a sure sign that gods have abandoned them christians as a sure sign that god was angry with them still st augustine wrote city of god in direct response and shaped christian doctrine forever it was a shock to the system that we dont really have anything to compare with
  9/11
  did the romans living in the late western roman empire know how much it had declined  western roman empire  if their country had split in two i think its a safe assumption they knew they were in decline  inb4 it split because it was too big and stronk to keep together it stayed together at that size for 300 years before the split
  except imagine the last comparable attack on american soil had been 800 years earlier
  9/11 was statistically insignificant especially compared to the civil war and world wars
this is the real homeland of the turks
  no
  they should return home then
  they should go back there

what are some great historical misrepresentations in your opinion   events where its outcome is arguably contrary to popular understanding or highly untrue in its recording or facts of history that seem suppressed or underrepresented    keep it 18 so refrain from facebooktier conspiracy shit ie lolocaust and pic related
almost the entirety of chinese dynastic history the actual record does not support the han imperialist myth of a continuous china entity or even that the now recognised dynasties were in fact the pre eminent powers in what is now china at the time they existed its only because of chinese historiographys retarded nationalism and the forgiving attitude of sinophile foreigners that the shit state of the chinese historical record doesnt get called out all the time
  i dont know how you reconsile the meaningless of your existence entering or even delaying mine these things are inconceivable in these that mortality has passed and you have entered a blood debt
  the american revolution was not fought contrary to how its taught in grade school by plucky and clever american guerillas shooting at hapless redcoats who marched in straight lines on the roads the war in reality was largely fought between the british on one hand and very imitation british regular forces on the american side what irregular guerillas there were lost a hell of a lot more than they won against regulars     i used to think this was a product of the vietnam war on the american psyche and an attempt to cast their forebears as the undefeatable peoples invincible guerilla army ive since done some strictly unofficial personal and anecdotal interviewing of people who were old enough to be in school before the vietnam war and the myth seems to predate it by some time im not really sure how it got started
  almost the entirety of chinese dynastic history the actual record does not support the han imperialist myth of a continuous china entity or even that the now recognised dynasties were in fact the pre eminent powers in what is now china at the time they existed its only because of chinese historiographys retarded nationalism and the forgiving attitude of sinophile foreigners that the shit state of the chinese historical record doesnt get called out all the time  chinese dynastic histories and the succession of the mandate werent determined by the prc you absolute retard its each succeeding dynasty which claimed there was a line of succession from their immediate succesor during the period of division for example the sui dynasty upon reunifying china claimed it received the mandate of heaven from its immedaite predecessor northern zhou before it reunified china not the other dynasties it conquered like the chen dynasty when it reunified china the western jin similarly said it received its mandate from its immediate predecessor cao wei in the three kingdoms not from sun wu which it conquered in southern china the yuan dynasty ignored the western xia and said it received its immediate mandate from the jin dynasty and before that the liao dynasty the qing dynasty formalized the canon of 24 histories all of those dynasties believed they received the mandate of heaven to rule one land called zhongguo or tianxia since the zhou dynasty and never called it by another name the idea of linear succession was created in dynastic china by the historians of each dynasty not by modern chinese historians the ccp or prc you tried lying about this before
  world war 1 was about anything other than russian imperial expansionism and designs for claiming key territory as they moved westwards and southwards especially constantinople
  american guerillas    except that was partially true in the south and the north where militias were the key to success it just wasnt as true in the middle colonies where militias were mostly used as auxiliary forces to tie up british supply lines
  after the five dynasties ten kingdoms period the song dynasty similarly traced its mandate of heaven succession from only the immediate preceding dynasties in northern china like the later zhou dynasty the song founder overthrew and before that the later han later jin and later tang while the song dynasty declared all the 10 kingdoms in southern china as illegitimate who never possessed the mandate of heaven and were not in the linear succession this doesnt even have anything to do with han nationalism because the reunifying state frequently traced it to nonhan dynasties like later tang if they wanted to play han nationalism the song would trace their linear succession to one of the han 10 kingdoms they conquered in southern china like southern tang or southern han instead of the nonhan shatuo later tang which was in its line of predecessor states it inherited its government institutions succession and bureaucracy from the chain which led back to later tang  if this was about  han nationalism the ming would have said it received mandate of heaven from the ho dynasty and tran dynasty before it after it conquered vietnam since both those dynasties were founded by han chinese instead of mongol yuan dynasty in china  the concept of a linear succession of legitimate dynasties was created in dynastic china each dynasty succeeding said one dynasty was legitimate and the others were not each dynasty wrote an official dynastic history of the preceding dynasty and refused to write histories for dynasties they considered illegitimate and not in their preceding line of succession when china was divided by the qing dynasty there were twenty four official histories including the one the qing wrote for the ming the prc and ccp never invented this modern han nationalists never invented this concept its know it alls like  who think they are demolishing han chauvinism when they are only exposing their own ignorance
i find that with new means of accessing information were experiencing a lot of overcorrections of old historical myths where in an attempt to refute the old myths it goes too far in the other direction     eg  knights in plate armor were so heavy they needed cranes to be lifted onto their horses  becomes  plate armor is incredibly light and doesnt encumbered or inconvenice the wearer even slightly    battles were primarily fought with swords  becomes  nobody except the richest of the rich could afford swords and they would never be seen on the battlefield    and so on
  and yet you felt compelled to respond im fully aware of the meaninglessness in my existence but you are not of yours or at least beyond the hollow perspective in which your grasp of meaning is confined
  the sui dynasty and tang dynasty also traced their legitimate lines of succession for the mandate of heaven to nonhan dynasties in northern china like northern wei until the han western jin the southern dynasties like liu song southern qi liang and chen were not included in the line of succession despite being han chinese they said northern wei captured the mandate of heaven for the land of china zhongguo and northern wei itself said it was china zhongguo  theres no han nationalism in the dynastic linear mandate of heaven succession of china which was created by imperial chinas dynastic historians not by modern han nationalists
what is a soul does it truly exist is it even possible to prove that it exists
  its the interaction between your pineal gland and endocannabinoid system with the seperation of time
  your mindyour soulyour spirit
when you sneeze thats your soul trying to escape saying bless you shoves it back in
  even if you forget to say please and thankyou  still imply it
consciousness could be considered a soul i guess by consciousness i mean being aware of the world and who you are and what you want to do
  go read studies on ndes and never return here this is your last warning
  yes everything exists the only other option is incoherence
  i mean this in a good way btw this place is a regressive shithole
time and time again it is shown that collective health and wealth of a society results in better quality of life on every level for the individual person  people still spout muh individualism     are individualist ideologies the most pleb ideologies in the modern era you see people say shit like i dont want to pay for the healthcare of poor people so instead they end up paying upfront higher healthcare costs for themselves and everyone else suffers higher costs because dumbass individualists hate the concept of collective action despite economies of scale means that as an individual person paying all into say a public health fund results literally in cheaper healthcare for everyone  this style of dumbass individualist thinking has flowed right through many western nations in the 21st century thanks to neoliberalism i dont want to pay for improved infrastructure if other people use it i dont want good urban design i want my own castle away from everyone fuck unions theyre evil why do their workers get paid more than me individual bargaining with corporations that literally hold all the power is clearly superior    its pretty clear individualist fetishism has basically rotted the mind of much of the modern west
  you are wrong they always have been the most pleb ideologies
  dude ethiopia just create a universal healthcare system if you want to be firstworld its that easy
  its pretty clear individualist fetishism has basically rotted the mind of much of the modern west    individualism was the rise of the west
golly what do those countries at the top all have in common
  a bunch of things theyve got a lot of different things too
  the practice of freemarket capitalism seems to be the most common element
  social democracy is freemarket capitalism
  social democracy basically requires freemarket capitalism hypothetically you could perhaps have an economy built primarily on exportdriven nationallyowned mines/wells/etc while retaining social democracy but in practice even the most socialist social democracies are still primarily capitalist
  not quite the countries at the top are social democracies for the most part
  social democracy refers to the political and welfare arrangements of the nation it makes no inherent statement regarding economic values healthcare aside i guess
  lets make everything a monopoly where no one is responsible for anything thatll surely fix everything
  despite what heritage bullshit says theyre most free economy you cant even own land or real estate property in and the economy is dominated by soes australia and scandinavia are extremely collectivist in terms of social welfare regulation and workers rights it is in fact the fact australia and scandinavia have extreme levels of business regulation that heritage tries to claim that theyre free because their economies are so heavily regulated it actually makes them far more stable places to do business short term profits maybe lower but risk is far lower to do business in these markets   nz used to be far more close to australia in standard of living but then they went full neoliberal dumbass and wound back welfare investment workers rights business regulation etc and it slid away from australia started to develop huge issues with inequality and is basically now just a country for the rich
  if they dont work for it they dont deserve it
  i live in nz and youve grossly exaggerated the problems it faces   also nz has always been behind au in terms of standards of living due to a lot of factors can you point out when they were far more close
  cant own real estate in australia  source needed
  considering a core tenant of the australian dream is property ownership you are talking out your absolute ass
  hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha    you have no idea what you are talking about
      heritage foundations most free country isnt australia its singapore a country where land and property ownership is rented from the government dumbasses
  there are people who work full time but still have to live in their cars because they still cant afford housing  that statement only works if theres no situations contrary to it its like saying the death penalty is ok even if a few innocent people are wrongly convicted and put to the sword
  way to shift attention from your initial retarded claim
  what was the initial retarded claim oh wait none of you have anything resembling reading comprehension retard     i literally said that heritage foundations most free economy was one where you couldnt own property or land which is literally the fucking case property and land in singapore is rented from the government through leases its economy is also dominated by soes
  you didnt even mention singapore in your earlier post /leftytard/   back up your claim that australia has extreme levels of business regulation is extremely collectivist in terms of social welfare regulation and workers rights
  that graph  yaxis is inequality adjusted hdi  xaxis is hdi  translation we see strong correlation between cartesian subset of data and original data  well thanks captain obvious one more proof to my retardation is prerequisite to being leftist folder
  take my advice life is unfair yes you better get used to it sometimes youre up sometimes youre down thinking in zerosum terms wont do you any good nor society as a whole socialism or any forms of collectivism doesnt work because of that
  life is unfair yes you better get used to it sometimes youre up sometimes youre down thinking in zerosum terms wont do you any good nor society as a whole socialism or any forms of collectivism doesnt work because of that  crack sip ahhh
  poor places are also corrupt places  autistic tankie anons take this as proof of socialism somehow    a new low for the socialist left
  the ones on the bottom too in case you didnt know
trickle down economics was debunked in 1896 why is this now the offical economic policy of pretty much every country on earth
because people are fucking retarded slob swine people that are completely politically and economically impotent and think fox news bubba swamp politics is real
  if youre a white american in the midwest are you going to vote for  the party that publicly talks about how much they hate you and how stupid you are and how they want you ethnically replaced   or   the party that doesnt do that
  nobody is trying to genocide white people in america    if anything right wing economic policy is the reason why immigrants keep showing up
  let me bullshit and starwman about why i want the rich to get richer at the expense of the poor and working class
  thanks jewmerica republican party should actually be lynched
  because it keeps the rich rich
  go back you know where
  so those millions of illegals pouring in with the support of the dnc and various articles by democrats admitting they dont want white people in america are       muh economics  race and religion will always be more important than economics to 99 of people
  race and religion will always be more important than economics to 99 of people  because americans are fat and stupid and dont understand any of the fucking vast political and military power they horrifically inherited withut knowing hwo to use    we are by far the dumbest fucking country on the planet
  im sorry most people care more about their church and not wanting their ethnic group going the way of the dodo than autisticly obsessing over stocks or whatevergayshit   and what makes you think socialism will work in the us itll end up like venezuela
  venezuela is better off then america  a least in venezuela they have an imagination and vision of the future that can be achieved that theyre working towards and improving every day despite economic warfare from the untied states    what the fuck is the vision of the future for america amazon slaves
  venezuelans eat dogmeat   i dont   i get cheap food and cheap clothing   they dont
  its always fascinated me that conservatives have the clarity to make this kind of statement while also bemoaning the unfairness of latinos black people and gays almost unilaterally voting blue
  and various articles by democrats admitting they dont want white people in america are  you should link some of these articles
  fox news  holy kek you care about the one boomer tier media outlet that nobody under 50 watches that much
  if anything right wing economic policy is the reason why immigrants keep showing up  im sure that has had nothing to do with gibs from the left
  venezuelas have food clap is a better food distribution system to the poor than america has in any capacity    you eat endless pink slime anticaking agents preservatives chemicals and hormones while calling it freedom and choices
  gibs are why immigrants vote democrat republican policies help draw them in so corporations can pay as low wages as possible
  whites use more welfare than brown people
  gibs are why immigrants vote democrat  are you sure its not because republicans demonize them as much as humanly possible in every public speech
  republican policies help draw them in so corporations can pay as low wages as possible  youre conflating procorporate republican policies with promigrant corporate policies the gop conservatards sold the noose to big companies who then tricked the leftards into thinking more migrants is somehow moral when its just pumping up labor supply for companies and increasing their domestic market while erasing any sense of social cohesion gop policies did this only by being soft on corporations     goodproportionally i doubt thats true but if youre looking at total numbers from the past thats probably true in total terms not proportional
  republicans demonize them  reagan literally said in public speeches that south of the border migrants were republicans and didnt know it yet the popular opinion for conservacucks before trump was that they were going to flip and they were basically christian angloids with a different ancestral tongue you fell for a lot of left wing hype if you actually thought that was the historical view of republicans
  spics and niggers can vote blue in their own countries           whites are also a majority blacks and hispanics disproportionately use it more
  delet
  believing you can legislate people to prosperity is wrong in the first place
  venezuelans eat dogmeat     did you get this from fox so called news
  holy shit le you said something bad about a socialist country must be muh russian hackers fox news
  fox  i still dont understand why leftards are so concerned with this one flaccid network i mean its a drop in the bucket compared to the sheer magnitude of leftist media growth since the 60s what is it about one dissenting opinion from flaccid network that plays softball on them is still somehow so intimidating
  destroying whatever you label far right at the moment makes the next thing left to it the new far right and thus sociopolitical perspectives continue to progress
  continue to progress  progress  point made though
  leftist media  lmao  who
  evey major media outlet in existence except like 5
  you think cnn nyt msnbc wapo etc are leftist    hahahahahahahahha
  haright i mean if they cant see this theyre so far left on the overton window anything less than cpusa news is going to be pure unadultured fascism to them
  in europe its funny the left media wants more immigrants but the immigrants are what they would normally describe as alt right theyre very conservative hate lgtb and social services so when they come here they vote against the parties that bring them here    its baffling to me lgtb crowds will march for muslims and those same muslims beat them in the streets at night for being mentally ill    i dont believe in politics though its all nonsense to make the people feel in control when in reality nothing we say or want matters to the elite
  i dont believe in politics though its all nonsense to make the people feel in control when in reality nothing we say or want matters to the elite  i feel like this is justified revenge for casting off the noble class that nurtured our ancestors

  why is this now the offical economic policy of pretty much every country on earth  because it fits capitalists propaganda about their economical structure being the most rational humane and profitable for everyone and gives an excuse not to expand social policies
  give tax breaks to everyone includes rich  increases demand and savings  savings are in banks which loan them out to investors and companies looking to expand  company expands more because of lower taxes and thus cheaper goods  more people are hired these people spend most of the money they make and that goes through the multiplier effect  everyone has more money  this is 100 level macro come on now
  increasing the deficit by a trillion dollars and cutting all social programs is ok because you got 400 back from a tax cut
  wronnnnnng you are wrong    those fucking compaies take this tax breaks and invest in insider stock buy backs while cutting backs jobs for average wirkers while outshorsi g overseas
  the deficit isnt actually a big deal so long as rgdp grows fast enough to keep up the problem is when bubbles happen in government expenditures that inflate the debt massively like with ss or medicaid these have to be curtailed in some fashion else the government runs out of money to pay back government debt and measures need to be taken to lower medical costs whatever those may be
  i agree that the deficit and debt doesnt matter but drastically strangling government income to destroy social programs and enable corporations to have more money and more power than every before is not a good enough tradeoff for getting less than 500 back from a tax cut    social programs are good gutting them is making america worse and worse and it all starts with how much money the government is taking in who pays for it and where that tax money goes to
  is that brian wilson
  supply side economics which is the actual name for the american economic system was created during the reagan administration how could it be debunked if it didnt exist while this was written        big yikes most people have moved past cold wartier propaganda by now anon
  but do they do it disproportionately also when you say brown you wouldnt be jumping yourself in with indians and phillipinos who dont use as much welfare would you
  absolutely based
    why are you leftist pseudointellectual twats so focused on trickle down way worse stuff is going on right now and its perpetuated by the clintonite left
tell me about the ryukyu kingdom were they a peaceloving people
  i heard they had the potential to conquer the whole world if they played the right cards
  they were peaceful they never invaded any lands outside of ryukyu instead they got invaded by the satsuma domain in japan and later annexed by meiji japan no other state in east asia can claim to be as peaceful as ryukyu was
direct rule from three mountains
  looks like a protonazi flag  probably not very peaceful most likely fascist
  i mean they were at the island of okinawa you think they had a power base to invade anyone
  plenty of island states in southeast asia raided and invaded other islands
  actually jōmon instead of fake larping yamato gooks
  joseon korea  but they were only so peaceful because they were under the thumb of china
i mean ive been to the area because of part of my family being japanese and they always seemed a super chill and peaceful people but then so do the japanese and look how they were 70 years ago
  joseon invaded the peninsular jurchens and annexed their land and also attacked tsushima a couple times otherwise joseon was peaceful because of its neoconfucian ideology
  joseon korea invaded jurchens in hamgyong and forced them to assimilate they were not peaceful koreans cannot be called a peaceful people they are aggresive alcoholic and violent only tempered by their small size
  yep life seemed comfy there trading goods between china seasia japan and korea planting bananas and rice planting sugar cane in amami for the shimazu i dont know of any twosided war or aggressive rebellion in ryukyu good beaches too    i wonder why they didnt invade taiwan before the chinks came along
  i wonder why they didnt invade taiwan before the chinks came along  they wanted to keep their heads  
i dont know much about them but im sad that their culture and languages the only other japonic languages in existence besides japanese are on the verge of extinction with ryukyuan languages surviving only in the form of some words and colloquialisms still used in okinawa and the unique elements of their culture only living on in ryukyuan diaspora communities in brazil and hawaii    i probably shouldnt be sad about it though considering actual okinawans seem to be very happy with the way theyve assimilated and from my understanding outside of a brief resurgence during the american occupation of japan postwwii okinawan nationalism is usually looked down upon as some crazy fringe thing or outright chinese dc tactics
  i probably shouldnt be sad about it though considering actual okinawans seem to be very happy with the way theyve assimilated  the unhappy minority are the independence advocates the majority were brainwashed during japanese rule
  thanks anon thats interesting af    better alive and assimilated than genocided i guess at least the diaspora preserves the traditions as  said i heard the yamato kind of look down on ryukyuans and say theyre easlily recognised so theres not unity between them yet maybe some centuries of interbreeding could correct this   why did the yamato want japan to have one monolithic culture anyways
just finish fighting a war against unjust taxation from greedy government elites  not compensated  taxed six times as much regardless of wealth  poorer farmers taxed out of property until they wind up in prison  decide to fight another war against unjust taxation from greedy government elites  labelled insurgents and villains by the people who did the same thing youre doing now and are doing exactly what the people they fought were doing to them  job shattuck daniel shays and eli parsons were truer patriots than george washington samuel adams or james bowdoin could dream of being adams and bowdoin shouldve gotten the noose after shays rebellion and washington after the whiskey rebellion

in recent years scholars have debated the continuity thesis that links german colonialist brutalities to the treatment of jews poles and russians during world war ii some historians argue that germanys role in southwestern africa gave rise to an emphasis on racial superiority at home which in turn was used by the nazis    germany left very few traces of their own language or customs as of today no country outside of europe has german as their official language
indoeuropean general    previous thread   this general is pioneered to encourage all the anons interested in ie stuff to limit the ie based discussions pertaining to anthropology history sociology and literature/mythology etc to this general so that other threads dont get clogged up with unrelated and pointless arguments    now i have never made or organized a general before so if this one takes off then can someone please organize the next one to set a good standard for /ieg/    one last thing try to keep things as distanced from modern politics as much as possible would be a shame if the general gets nuked because of it    bonus track  
paki here how does it feel knowing your ancestors were raped by mine
  he is not a pajeet  so he wasnt invaded
  swede here feels good every day
so from looking at some of the dna it looks like the males replaced several male populations by exterminating them or at least largely or entirely denying them children    the thing is when you look at the autosomal dna it looks like most dna throughout central and western europe is western hunter gatherer   so it looks like the males just had kids with a lot of western hunter gatherer and farmer women
why did you guys made another general
this board is far less interesting on american off hours

be named octavious   like octopus or octagon or octave  have the eighth month of the year named after you  not october  fuck romans are retarted
  the book the denizens or the ancient people if the first my guess is that baptists are being dissed
  originally the year started on 1 march and consisted of only 304 days or 10 months martius aprilis maius junius quintilis sextilis september october november and december
  rome died in 1917
  nice wall you got there roman  would be a shame if   someone destroyed it
  the romans were uncivilized violent rapers and barbarians    they even killed jesus 
  originally  junius
based
vae victis
  originally at some point
yeah killem
  so which colors are ies
  i d say all of them but the r1a variant aka germanic tribes the r1b peoples where the gauls in france getting invaded peacefully by germanic tribes but to be honest i wouldnt be surprised if some of them were of scythian origin huns are related to mongols idk i dont control germanic sort of tribes to be honest but some of them were definitely germanic late ies
    update after reading wikipedia huns were definitely mongols that pushed scythians shit in and later moved into europe to conquer sack and pillage
      this is the alans the scythians that fled after the huns invaded them r1b
  complete migration of the alans
    why dont we look like mongols except finns weak seed
  i guess because their admixture was weak they didnt stood for too long and didnt mixed enough they went back to their land and left a weak fingerprint in northern euros and slavs there was even a later invasion by year 1300 ad by the mongols not huns this time
whats the deal with yuan china
  they raped little chinks
  how can they rape when over half of the yuan army were chinese the mongols offered southern song chinese soldiers captured korean women to defect to the yuan
  why would half the army being chinese stop them from raping the chinese
  lets rape our soldiers families that should go over well  the mongols focused most of their rape and massacres against the jurchen and tangut in northern china genghis khan had a personal vendetta against the jurchen for torturing his grand uncle to death beijing had the highest concentration of jurchen after prince hailing moved the jurchen capital and millions of jurchen there genghis ordered the entire city to be massacred and raped han chinese soldiers manning forts and walls outside of bejing defected to the mongols and helped massacre and rape jurchens the mongols created four han chinese tumen armies and han chinese cherik forces from han defectors to help kill and rape jurchen the other jin capital kaifeng had a majority han civilian population the mongols agreed to spare the people of kaifeng from massacre and rape after a han chinese officer cui opened the gates for them but ordered the han to give up all their property for loot and to hand over every single jurchen prince in hiding to be brutally executed all the jurchen emperors and princes were hunted without mercy because of genghiss personal vendetta  the mongols used majority han chinese defectors and ethnic minority bai and yi to attack southern china only a small force of 510 mongols supervised the forces in the south the only entire city to be killed in southern china was at fancheng because it fought to the death and its people died while fighting other cities like hangzhou which surrendered without a fight were spared from sacking and rape and the mongols even kept all the former song officials in them running the city the mongols accepted the surrenders of song princes and the song emperor gong and did not execute them the song prince zhao mengfu worked for the mongol court as a painter and official and the former song emperor gong married a mongol princess the han chinese tumen general shi tianzes son shi gang was married to a mongol kerait woman
fun fact the yuan state issued a proclamation that ranked people in society by race and profession to let mongols know the degree of respect they should show to different chinese on the list street sweepers were listed above confucian scholars
  thicc
  the mongols were the rulers and the chinese were the slaves as nature intended
what book should i read about yuan china
  cambridge history of china the volume about alien regimes
go to japan   neotang dynasty   go to korea   neoming dynasty   go to vietnam   neoqing dynasty   go to mongolia   neoyuan dynasty   go to china  feels like aliens living in the ruins of an actual culture     why is this
  go to japan   neotang dynasty  not at all it feels like a colony of usa with some good artistic movements which is not reflective of the overall ethos of the culture japan has serious problems with corruption of police such as the junko furuta case showed  go to korea   neoming dynasty   they are retarded christcucks who abandoned their cultural legacy to such up to the west they are some of the most vapid and materialist people imaginable literally judging peoples appearances right in front of their faces the women tend to get plastic surgery on their entire faces too  go to vietnam   neoqing dynasty   vietnam has been a mess since french colonization even losing their script many of them are illiterate and have a hustlebustle culture that values nothing but making money a very antiintellectual climate  go to mongolia   neoyuan dynasty   mongols have always been savage scum that should be ethnically cleansed  go to china  feels like aliens living in the ruins of an actual culture   mao was backed by jews and tried to destroy genuine chinese culture manchus were also a bunch of illiterate savages that looked like cannibals with their eyes so close to each other of course china would be a mess now  why is this  you are a retard and idiot any of these asian countries can get better but they all suck now as a whole japan has some pretty good artistic movements but they are not representative of the whole most japanese are retarded and prefer watching shitty anime over reading their real literature    what is destroying all of east asia is inferiority complex to the west a culture and peoples they have nothing to do with whatsoever hell china historically had more interactions with persians than fucking westerners pure land buddhism is just like zoroastrian mysticism mixed with buddhism
  maoism you mega reet
  your problem is that you went to prc and not true china aka free china
  the modern chinese are cultureless savages all the good chinese stock were killed off or escaped leaving only the descendants of slaves and peasants behind in the blighted mainland
  peasants actually had pretty high social status in china especially compared to the rest of the world
  explain
  farmers were above soldiers merchants artisans servants and slaves
  vietnam doesnt really have a cultural revolution communists just slap on ho chi minh worship and tighten censoring during the war and except for ho chi minh none other arguably more influential big communists were pushed further than street names and maybe a temple at their home village unless they were artists on the side most party members still keep their ancestor shrines and golden buddha statues at home   still how the hell are we neoqing when we use fucking latin scripts
  the aesthetic and material culture of vietnam are most heavily influenced by the midtolate qing era
  examples
  besides clothing
  vietnam has been a mess since french colonization even losing their script many of them are illiterate and have a hustlebustle culture that values nothing but making money a very antiintellectual climate    youre fucking stupid    good riddance of the chink script    also vietnam has 973 literacy and some of the best pisa scores
  vietnam is the only other east asian people besides bai and zhuang who adopted chinese characters to vietnamese by creating new characters for native vietnamese words on the same phono semantic principles as the chinese loanwords koreans and japanese didnt create new characters before hangul and kana they autistically used chinese characters to spell native korean and japanese words phonetically unlike vietnamese
  by illiterate i mean its very hard for the vietnamese to go back and read their literature in the other script you have to rewrite everything in the new script it causes some cultural decline that takes a long time to recover from
  no no no what i really meant was    nah shut the fuck up
  i mean that is what i meant when you change script it takes awhile to reconnect to your previous literary traditions there was actually a chinese scholar who visited vietnam and criticized their cultures for that too it takes awhile to reestablish a literary tradition when your script changes its still better than the language changing at least

  vice magazine   lad
what was that article     dey said bad things about le jews  oh no a prostitute abandoned her lifestyle and went to desert to live ascetic lifestyle so shes a jerk  these kings went to war n stuff
i clicked on the article and give these people ad revenue
people still parroting hichens rubbish even though he admitted himself that he never bothered to verify most of it and didnt seem to understand what a hospice was
blow it out your rear commie
  anyone vice calls bad that are so universally bad that its obvious and not worth mentioning or they disregard everything else the person did in life because they slut shamed or something stupid
lmao this shit is hilarious my grandfather literally worked with mother teresa in calcutta in the late eighties he worked in the hospice
  people like to purposely ignore that she didnt run hospitals she ran hospices in the poorest part of indian and they expected her to give them mayo clinic levels of care
  hitchens was a literal brainlet and those who think he was good are even bigger idiots reminder that the moron said irving was a great historian and all the criticisms against him is incorrect
  and they expected her to give them mayo clinic levels of care  she had the money she built churches instead
    she had a hospital only volunteers didnt work in it which is the source of the whole hospice hospital confusion my grandfather talked to the doctors working and to them it was like any other job only in this one most patients would come in when death was basically inevitable theres only so much a doctor could do to for most of those people and mother teresa didnt have a kind of network to find these sickly uneducated people and treat them early or educate them on a healthier lifestyle most of the indians would only show up once they exhausted their superstitious and religious efforts to heal themselves by that point it was already too late imagine how fucked india is now now imagine it 40 years ago that should clue you in
  she had a hospital  of a few the world gave her millions she invested in churches to the point of neglecting giving care to the people it was creepy depressing and she cared little beyond mastubating to her faith    imagine how fucked india is now now imagine it 40 years ago that should clue you in  theyre modernizing takes time but in several decades theyre a serious economic and strategic power theyll be ok
care for the terminally ill  its now your fault they are suffering
  a deeply religious person finds religious salvation to be more valuable than wordly goods and services color me surprised on top of that she also does provide an extensive amount of material care when she didnt have to at all and gains nothing material from it either but she didnt do enough based on the amount of material goods given to here to use as she pleases     i think all of this stems from nonreligious people having trouble understanding or not approve that the material exchange did not result in direct material benefits to christiansthe only people that matter when it comes to teresa she did nothing wrong whats funny about all of this is thats its exactly like the catholic church criticism of st francis in the 13th century where members of the clergy gave money and resources to him and he used to to build up his order to preach and spread to all italian cities instead of just building hospitals cathedrals and giving money directly to the poor wealth was just a means to spread salvation to him the corrupt church at the time had trouble understanding this
  a deeply religious person finds religious salvation to be more valuable than worldly goods and services color me surprised  and many indians suffered at while the rest of the world was conned into assuming they were contributing to their betterment   to christiansthe only people that matter when it comes to teresa   sure your echochamber is giddy over an old woman meekly going from podium to podium and pretending her cause was anything more that a horseshit campaign for vatican pr and the fact they scrambled for a cause to sanctify her reflects that   this loathsome quality affects religious charity as a whole you sincerely believe proselytization is of equal value and benefit as medicine food or infrastructure
    somebody says x historical figure was actually a shitty or bad person  when they give the reason its they said black people are different than white people or they didnt like gays they dared to criticize jews and they fought in a war
  gandhi let his wife die of illness because western medicine was the devil changed his mind when he got the same illness though
  and many indians suffered at     no indian suffered because of mother teresa the complete opposite effect happened many indians suffered because they were indians in 20th century calcutta she could have never existed and it would have been even worse for them what an idiotic statement      while the rest of the world was conned into assuming they were contributing to their betterment     she never did anything she said she wasnt going to do or make public why the fuck are you acting like the multiple hospitals hospices food clothing and general care in calcutta for 45 years never existed because it wasnt to the amount you feel is right given the monetary value at hand betterment never happened huh      sure your echochamber    aka word millienials and zoomers use to describe abosoluty anything that isnt contemporary alienated nihilistic materialist worldview on an organizational level    is giddy over an old woman meekly going from podium to podium    if i warp reality into what i want it to using persuasive language and descriptors im winning    and pretending her cause was anything more that a horseshit campaign for vatican pr     i already know thats what you believe youve repeated it a couple times already either form an actual argument for it or fuck off    this loathsome quality affects religious charity as a whole you sincerely believe proselytization is of equal value and benefit as medicine food or infrastructure      there it is thank you for displaying literally exactly what im talking about its like trying to discuss the bible with a soviet
  no indian suffered because of mother teresa  testimony on the lack of medical supplies and the cut and dry nature of the homes for the dying contradicts that   she never did anything she said she wasnt going to do or make public  do you really think the average person donated to her charity to help build nunneries because i grew up with the commercials none of that was out in the open   betterment never happened huh  false dichotomy if 85 of the funds she acquired went to the care of indians you would have this backlash but that is not what she did   that isnt contemporary alienated nihilistic materialist worldview on an organizational level  wwithout the church youre soulless heathens   yup   youve repeated it a couple times already  first time posting in this thread   literally exactly what im talking about  im happy to hear a rebuttal any time if you have to choose between giving someone a bible or a bowl of soup youd be conflicted whereas any sober minded person would give them soup 100 of the time
  you wouldnt
  this loathsome quality effects religious charity as a whole    the catholic church is the largest charity in the world religious charities overall consists of the vast majority of charities that exist its weird right maybe that loathsome quality and belief is exactly why they are much more likely to have a charity in the first place because they believe in something more than immediate material needs ironic that the material worshippers are the biggest bringers of material destruction in this world and least likely to to distribute material to others hmmm wonder why
  the catholic church is the largest charity in the world  and spend quite a bit on spreading catholicism charity should be without doctrine or ideology it has no business there
  and spend quite a bit on spreading catholicism  given they believe that ones soul is most assuredly doomed to an eternity of torment if one is not a faithful catholic this is not surprising from what im able to infer your problem is they are not maximizing charity in a way you believe to be in the best interests of the poor but your take is irrelevant to them since you do not share basic axiomatic assumptions about metaphysics mainly eternal damnation and then the rest of us are also supposed to give a shit because apparently youre asserting that a little good actually done is worse than doing nothing if somehow we optimized our spending more which is bullshit considering even if the charity was unoptimized or inefficient in your opinion things are still better than if they did not act at all
  a little good actually done is worse than doing nothing if somehow we optimized our spending more    a little good actually done is worse than doing nothing if somehow we could optimize our spending more
  testimony on the lack of medical supplies  source  and the cut and dry nature of the homes for the dying  hahahahahahaha do you know what a hospice is buddy  contradicts that  nope and again lets say your claims are true how the fuck are indians suffering because of mother teresa its like saying a starving man suffered under the guy that traveled across the world and gave him half a fish they had literally nothing else but her and her organization once the smart ones saw their rituals not working they went straight to her for a cure  do you really think the average person  she is not responsible for the perception of the average retard   donated to her charity to help build nunneries   many did and encouraged it are missionaries something new to you  because i grew up with the commercials none of that was out in the open   commercials huh thats the hill youre gonna die on
  i had the other half of my argument copied but i guess i didnt before i deleted it whatever im fucking lazy
  worrying about things like eternal damnation caused by loss of faith is exactly why the catholic church is constantly plagued with childabuse scandals the higherups cover up the mess because if word was to get out which it inevitably does then many followers would lose faith which would lead to their damnation thus the result of these insane metaphysical dilemmas is that theyd willingly allow a few young people often aspiring clergy themselves to suffer through hell on earth if it meant sparing millions of others from hell in the afterlife this topsyturvy prioritisation of the fate of the dead over the rights and needs of the living is one of the major issues organised christianity needs serious reform
  in a way you believe to be in the best interests of the poor  yes because i can prove my model of charity tangibly benefits the poor whereas youre aghast that servicing the agenda of the catholic isnt immediately considered   axiomatic assumptions about metaphysics  which mean nothing to a starving african or sick indian the core message of jesus is selflessness and the second you dedicate time and resources to see the word of god spread you are no longer about helping the poor youre looking for expansion simple as that   youre asserting that a little good actually done is worse than doing nothing  a well funded charity was mediocre in practice because teresa cared only about her nunneries and surrounding herself with suffering youre planting a flag on the bare minimum of the good that did come of it and pretending that was the sum of the event   i actually respect catholicism for its grounded theology and protocol to contain crazies but an arrogant shill like you is never far behind to say the piles of shit it leaves behind smell like roses
  source    do you know what a hospice is buddy  its certainly not a dirty building with little lighting where the dying are just dropped off   how the fuck are indians suffering because of mother teresa  they came to her hospices for relief and found none she conned a whole city and now we must wait until the cults surround her die out   she is not responsible for the perception of the average retard  yeah a public figure has no responsibility to their fanaticism or false image they promote only stupid people could possibly fall for it tip
  youre aghast that servicing the agenda of the catholic isnt immediately considered  no im aghast at someone who is literally so autistic he imputes selfish motives to a person who is in their mind trying to save someone from eternal suffering this is not a selfish goal   the core message of jesus is selflessness and the second you dedicate time and resources to see the word of god spread you are no longer about helping the poor  this is what i mean in their minds it is helping the poor since they believe in hell this is the crux of it you can call them incorrect and misguided but actually accusing them of acting in bad faith is simply wrong given their honestly held believes about the afterlife     youre aghast that servicing the agenda of the catholic isnt immediately considered  no im aghast at someone who is literally so autistic he imputes selfish motives to a person who is in their mind trying to save someone from eternal suffering this is not a selfish goal   the core message of jesus is selflessness and the second you dedicate time and resources to see the word of god spread you are no longer about helping the poor  this is what i mean in their minds it is helping the poor since they believe in hell this is the crux of it you can call them incorrect and misguided but actually accusing them of acting in bad faith is simply wrong given their honestly held believes about the afterlife   arrogant shill  no im just someone who can actually get out of his own head and understand someone elses motivations
  dont know how that double posted in the same post but whatever
  you can call them incorrect and misguided but actually accusing them of acting in bad faith  no im happy to assume the former most of the time but the latter does happen if the church operated like the red cross there would be no debate and im happy with some of those millions going to maintain the priceless art artifacts and buildings theyre important
catholics run their charities based on catholic principles    bbbut its not fair im a non believer they must behave as i say
  it is indeed a noble goal to spiritually enlighten people and prevent them from entering an afterlife full of pain and suffering but to bring us back to the topic at hand mother teresa was not a good example of christian charity because she showed no concern for the physical wellbeing of those in her care merely that they died believing in christ suffering is not a noble thing especially if it is pointlessly endured and encouraged to feed a egotists saviour complex and after all this time you have yet to provide a good explanation as to why her calcutta clinic somehow never saw the benefit of millions of dollars of donations when she clearly appreciated the value of advanced healthcare when she herself flew to california due to illness
  encourage the spread of hiv enable theres fake charity make africans fearful of homosexuals and witches   wwere just spreading the word of god why u so mean c
  but to bring us back to the topic at hand  that previous point is the topic at hand that is what she desired you hate for failing at something she never claimed nor wanted to be    showed no concern for the physical wellbeing of those in her care  if she had no concern she would have left to rot in the gutter s from which they were pulled   suffering is not a noble thing  this is an example of a value that is not shared by the catholic church and is thus not far to call them hypocrites for not upholding a value they dont believe in    especially if it is pointlessly endured and encouraged to feed a egotists saviour complex  once again this is imputing a motive of selfishness to an act that can actually be explained by their beliefs about the afterlife   and after all this time you have yet to provide a good explanation as to why her calcutta clinic  because thats irrelevant she acted in a manner consistent with her beliefs and wanted to continued to proselytize again not hypocrisy or lying given her beliefs and values
  you hate her for failing
  and after all this time you have yet to provide a good explanation as to why her calcutta clinic somehow never saw the benefit of millions of dollars of donations    because this factually wrong her hospitals and hospices were well funded staffed maintained and did their job well people are just angry she didnt expand the hospital to help more people when she had the money for it that christopher hitchens books is unsourced and generally considered to be almost complete bullshit even from hitchens himself dude was lucky he died early so he didnt have to deal with a lifetime of people calling him out on his deception
  christopher hitchens books is unsourced and generally considered to be almost complete bullshit  his beef with teresa was a collaboration between him and mihir bose hitchens took full credit for it but thats another story bose is alive and hasnt wavered from his conclusion   
  if she had no concern she would have left to rot in the gutter s from which they were pulled  or she was delusional in what helping the indian people entailed
what can one do with a history degree   inb4 which one  i dont care im a semester into uni and i think that the stem meme just isnt for me i love history though so thats why im asking    also a discussion on the history of higher education and certifications how did education of the elite evolve over the centuries i think hammurabis code implied certifications for practices like medicine and engineering exited but was there any proof of certifications on older cuneiform tablets if im wrong what is the first instance of when things like degrees start to pop up
  become a historian
most degrees have become pretty much a checkbox saying you have a bachelors degree unless you do specialized degrees like accounting or whatever
  worthless should have gone stem or languages
go to law school
  loads of jobs but you gotta make that degree work for you that said i strongly strongly recommend against going into academia unless you are truly gifted at history like at or close to the very top of your institute with a great reputation to boot
  following your passion might make you less money or no money at all choose wisely what would diogenes do
  i kinda want to be a middle school history teacher since thats around when i got into history
stop falling for the wageslave meme and become self employed
  wwhere can i be a historian at anon  im genuinely curious though    wait so it doesnt even matter what type of degree i have as long as i have it what about gender studies majors though     if i stick to stem what field should i get into ive been disliking my precalc class or at least not interested enough and chemistry is boring at best does it only get better from here    i thought law school was more law desu i didnt realize that there was alot of history involved   although my last name is too similar to lawyer for anyone to take me seriously    damn i guess the history related fields are really competitive
hit your extracurriculars clubs volunteer for them try and get on the general and then executive committee it will improve your soft skills and give you evidence with which to pitch those improved soft skills to employers
  anon when people say make the degree work for you they are being retards you could get an interpretive dance degree and become a millionaire if you know how to hustle    but being that you are posting on 4chan im gonna say you dont know jow to hustle get a degree that can feed you dude
  wwhere can i be a historian at anon  at a university
  just become a cop and retire after 20 years    and yes most degrees are just a checkbox for the most part especially government jobs unless youre doing something specialized
  anon when people say make the degree work for you they are being retards  im the dude that said that i meant it is a bit harder to get jobs and you have to apply yourself a bit more creatively i suppose not like stem jobs where what you study will probably be pretty close to your job title and for however vaguely i worded it hustle is like a million times more vague and meaningless lol get real dude
  damn i guess the history related fields are really competitive  its a combination of competition very limited jobs what exactly you want to study and the general bullshit of academia that everyone has to deal with plus funding
  probably shit in the lunchroom and bite a student    yeah im not that great on the whole meet new people idea although id become a whore in a desperate attempt to keep me from being a complete and total failure     fair enough please be understanding though as im retarded
  yeah im not that great on the whole meet new people idea although id become a whore in a desperate attempt to keep me from being a complete and total failure  i am a reformed sperg maybe by going to a small country high school i was put on the path a bit sooner but joining clubs and participating in extracurricular activities like lectures from visiting academics for fun and out of interest before even thinking about soft networking or soft skills the realisation came later it helped my social skills and confidence greatly and i got a job in a competitive field outside of my main degree    you doing a bsc looked at all your history related options through your current degree if you do geophysics gis remote sensing maybe some geoscience like geomorphology etc you could go into archaeology
    law schools like history degrees as they show that you can look through documents to build an effective argument that will win a case ive also seen people use it as a stepping stone into business schools but id assume they generally would want a more numbersrelated social science economics management and organizational studies   government bureaucracies depending on the bureau appreciate history degrees  public history is a growing area especially digital public history so you could land a job digitizing archives if youre good with technology or in a museum if you have a public history program that has internships or workstudies or as a historical consultant for a film studio or a game developer this may be a shrinking field given recent games  if youre lucky you can try to go full academic and get a phd and become a professor dont expect tenure   if youre really lucky or have great connections you could become a published author but really only the big names make that their fulltime job many who are published by university presses rather than commercial presses are fulltime professors as well as authors
  thanks anon right now on paper im pursuing a liberal arts degree although i was going to change it to a stem degree the state college that im in only offers associates in arts for history related fields although i was planning on transferring to a more prestigious institution after maybe my associates
      also i forgot to mention that the military will accept a history degree as a credential to fasttrack entrance into officer training school although usually just for infantry officers tank/navy/airforce officers would require more stem training
where would the middle east be today had the mongols not sacked baghdad and ended the islamic golden age
  mars
wow where would we be if muslims didnt copy byzantine architecture some more and regurgitate what nonmuslims were already doing
  islamic golden age  
  the jews orchestrated the mongol invasion
  the islamic golden age was done by syriac christian scientists and translators who translated from greek into syriac into arabic and even pagan syriacs like thabit ibn qurra from harran arabs contributed almost nothing it should be called syriac christian golden age
imagine a world where bullshit like this wasnt made up every time some corporations got together and social engineered people to want openborders
  the mongols destroyed a center of sunni oppression against nonmuslims the abbasids persecuted coptic christians in the bashmuric revolts and syrian christians during caliph almahdis reign the mongol ilkhan hulagu ordered that assyrian christians in baghdad be spared when they sacked baghdad in 1258 and only ordered that arab sunnis and the abbasid caliph be killed the mongols destroyed khwarezmian sunnis who persecuted nonsunnis the only bad thing the mongols did there was attacking the nizari ismaili assassins they didnt deserve to get their castles sacked and killed the abbasid sunnis totally deserved to get raped by mongols on the other hand they didnt produce any golden age they stole the work of syriac christians and persians
  nizari ismailis had a big library at alamut and were preserving persian scientific knowledge in their writings i will admit that was a loss and a bad thing for the mongols to have destroyed it and killed nizari ismailis in iran but fuck the abbasids
  and baghdad one stone at alamut was worth more than all the sunnis of baghdad
why do white people always get triggered when you mention the glory days of albayt islam
  arab sunnis contributed nothing other than writing on the benefits of camel piss for health
  because theyre afraid of black men breeding their women
  why does group x get upset when their historical enemy is glorified
  only kingdoms that can be defeated by outsiders are the ones that are already rotten from inside islamic golden age already ended by the time mongols knocked on the middle east
  other white people
  about the same islam is anti progress because its said to be the perfect word of god plus without any central authority to break from youre not going to get a split like the catholic reformation
  its possible iran could have become zoroastrian because there were local zoroastrian dynasties in tabaristan shiraz also had a huge zoroastrian population before mongol and subsequent azeri invasions    counterfactual thinking has its problems imo though
  this is true iran became shia to foster national identity despite sunni dominance shias were so rare in iran they imported shia scholars from southern arabian penisula to get things going they could have as well just reinstated zoroastrian religion with that much central power scholars were much closer available why they didnt is good question
  iran imported twelver shia scholars from the levant jabal amil they did not choose to follow the same school as the usuli twelver shia in eastern arabia
  iran also had other shia sects like nizari ismailis and zaydis zaydis went extinct but nizari ismailis are still around the safavids were already deep into a sect related to twelver shia something similar to alevism which their qizilbash warriors practiced they believed in the 12 imams they had no choice but to become twelver shia
  anyways main point being they imported them from far away to kickstart national identity building so why not zoroastrian
  see  safavids were already into a semitwelver shia sect which their qizilbash warriors followes they wore twelve pointed hats to symbolize the twelve imams there was no way they could become zoroastrian nizari ismaili or zaydi that would be backtracking
  mongols universally mistrustful of jews and muslims tepid towards nestorian christtards  it was the jooooz
  probmems with islam have more to do with modern geopolitics than medieval shit
  you mean doing something thats useful for desert survival
    anons please the islamic golden age is not a myth indeed most traductions of greek authors were the deed of christians but we cannot ignore importance of the work of mostly persian muslims such as albiruni or ibn sinna
  not to mention the qizilbash were of turkic descent and as such were the heirs of the old turkmen heterodox tradition it would have been a bit odd from them to become zoroastrian
ahh another thread where the election tourists claim the islamic golden age was a myth despite it being an aspect of history for centuries now we have that shia worshipper whos in every thread trying to appease the election tourists by saying that the shias did science while sunnis drank piss nu/his/ is amazing
  because shah ismail and the safavids were genocidal fuckheads with their own retarded vision for iran they even massacred many zoroastrians of paduspanid dynasty which was zoroastrian until like 14th to 15th century ce    paduspanids were actually in patrilineal continuity with the sassanids until those safavid fuckheads ruined everything
  iran had twelver shia statez centuries before the safavids like the marashi in mazandaran
  lmao look how buttblasted this guy is
  hes mad the shias lost the war
the shias are a gnostic fag cult  dude remember the surah where it says beat yourself lmao weed neither do i
    islamic golden age  persian renaissance
  white people love waging war against white people so much that they were doing it even while said historical enemy was right on their doorstep
  sunnis blow other sunnis all the time
  it was prescribed as medicine not for desert survival
  literally everyone died to the mongols
  what a fallacious way of thinking that proves itself with circular reasoning  they fell to outside invaders obviously their society was corrupt and deserved to fall
  what religion were pagan harranis like thabit ibn qurra
  the abbasid caliph actually threatened the pagans of harran with death if they did not convert to a dhimmi religion mentioned in the quran since the pagans were neither jewish nor christians they chose to identify their religion as sabianism a third ahl alkitab religion mentioned in the quran nobody knew what sabianism was besides muhammad so they couldnt challenge their claims
  peepl fite der neyburs  is this the final redpill

  it would be even worse the mongols killed a lot of terrorists
  i dont get why people say this  what are you trying to cope with either way subhuman shitskin middle easterners were making robots while germans were shitting around a fire
  because not all middle easterners are muslims  to call it the islamic golden age is disingenuous because everyone with a fucking brain knows that islam is antiscience and that a lot of the heavy lifting was done by syriac christians and even pagans  muslims even try to claim arabic numerals and algebra for themselves when those came all the way from fucking india and there was also evidence the the greeks were doing algebra
      masters of science
many people say charlemagnes europe was better than the muslim in the islamic golden age  how did they compare  where muslims more ahead before
  roughly 9999 of the important figures of the islamic golden age are muslims
    this article is written in defense of alseyyid muhammad alyaqubis subsequent statement which he expressed during his talk on the national mawlid gathering in london i wish i was his urine which passed out of him pure and a cure  i wish i was his urine which passed out of him pure and a cure
  golden age  more like golden showers
sunni hadith claim eating locusts is good for health
  without the mongols the middle east would probably be a hyper cringey place full of degeneracy today mongols saved islam by slaying all the decedent and spoiled city slickers who were turning islam into a mockery by doing stuff like allowing female qadis only the conservative practitioners of the countryside survived the onslaught and reinvigorated the faith
  the mongols destroyed the irrigation systems of mesopotamia and raped the countryside so much that southern iraq was depopulated enabling tribal arabs from the arabian peninsula to immigrant into southern arabia in the ottoman era in the 17th18th centuries convert to twelver shia sect forming todays modern iraqi shia iraqi shia are actually of real 100 tribal arab descent and not descendants of the ancient mesopotamians
  decedent  decadent
  ah yes humans can eat insects
  based my point is that mongols destroyed the liberal form of islam developing in cosmopolitan centres and only the very conservative segment of the faith survived the siege thats a good thing
  as long as by reinvigorate you mean make them afraid to further pursue scientific inquiry and let the fundies take over sure
  stupid fucking shia
  nonfundamentalist sects like nizari ismailis dont do cringy stuff like lgbt they are still normal in morals sunni fundamentalism is pure autism and harmful
  ismailis are heretics tho
  having an argument with your brother while drunk that escalates into wrestling and breaking some furniture is the same thing as your neighbour down the street launching an rpg at your house and kidnapping your daughter
  it ended long before the mongol invasion
    in the final days of baghdad the ummah were spiritually weakened they were said to worship musicians more than god and allowed females to become judges at that point islam had become less conservative than any sect of christianity if this degeneracy was allowed to fester who can say what a mockery islam would have become this spiritual decadence would not have been contained in sunnis it probably would have spread to shias as well of course the mongol onslaught prevented that islam in general would be pozzed protestant/catholictier today if it werent for the mongols weeding out the liberal city slickers of baghdad
  and according to ismailis you are heretics lol
  by the time ayran was exposed to islam it was already lost in its own religious contradictions it tried to solve them with the zurvanites but in the end they just said fuck it theres no point in doing anything since everything is just infinite anyways so let fate decide    and fate decided them to be muslim its why zoroastrians didnt really fight back
  ahead enough that franks first head about the ancient greeks from the muslims which kick started the entire scholastic era in western thought
  europe had access to byzantine books
  and yet only once they translated ancient greek authors from arabic did they manage to do anything with the information
  they would be invaded by turks
what was the most frowned upon military or raiders of swedish or finnish history
vikings were illiterate dipshits that didnt record that sort of thing foreign accounts dont bother distinguishing
  not sure what you mean there buddy    they werent illiterate they just didnt have paper
i know islam has wahhabism which is essentially a protestant version of islam but does any other religion have a sects that resemble protestant ethos
  christianity is the protestant version of judaism
  highly through provoking
  christianity isnt really the anything version of judaism christianity is essentially just a syncretic platonic cynicism in abrahamic trappings
    wahhabism is the doctrine of extremists
  protestantism hinges on the claim that they are recovering what was originally preached or believed in no one really believes that the ancient jews believed in the trinity nor could they have believed in the divinity of jesus the messiah
  i know islam has wahhabism  no its quranism
  fuck i mean the protestant version of islam is quranism

  tattoos  degenerate
  sailors get tattoos
  you can get it off with sandpaper it would just hurt and bleed like a bitch  i saw some fucker do it once since he couldnt afford the laser shit the paper was on one of those spinning wheel things he took it like a champ all things considered
  sailors having tattoos is degenerate  this is your mind on /pol/
    looked it up and historically tattoos were removed this way  itll cause scars and huge nasty scabs but gets the tattoo off for sure
  guano  we scarcely ever did anything to get that at least much less than some south american nations did   we at most had a few skirmishes over it
    sailors  degenerate
  /pol/s problematic
he could just tattoo something over it
  this symbol was known in western world too and was quite common before ww2
  degenerate
  /pol/s problematic
  without sailors you wouldnt have your device that was manufactured overseas to post with be grateful
  indeed
  what is rum bum and the lash  sailors want to be degenrate  this is a fact as old as time
  you can get another tattoo over the old one make the swastika into four squares
  its a hindu and buddhist symbol
  my life would actually probably be better if we all lived at a 1950s tech level people like me are being displaced by user friendly computers that any subhuman can use also the constant access to entertainment has done a number on my slef control and discipline it hurts to imagine what i would have achieved if i wasnt sidetracked by porn anime vidya and 4chan
  to be fair the 1950s also needed sailors
  to be fair humans were objectively higher functioning during the upper paleolithic than at any other period in our evolution and we should do the world one good deed and kindly return ourselves to that level of existence as soon as possible
  based and truthpilled
children arent humans yet  or at least i can say looking back at what i was that i was not fully the i a human i am now  stop treating them as humans start treating them as children
  when did we stop treating them as children again  inb4 revealed to be low key /pol/ post
  are you human when youre asleep
  no but i have the means to almost instantaneously turn into a human
  so as long as i murder you quickly enough it is not immoral
  but anon you just killed an entity that could have turned into a human in the matter of seconds
  thats why the have the adult/child distinction children are subhumans with human potential
  give me the sauce m8
  cosplay whores arent human either makes me sick
  so its okay if youre a deep sleeper that takes half an hour to get up
  go stick a needle into a deep sleeper and hell be up quick i guarantee you
  i can say looking back at what i was that i was not fully the i a human i am now  the same is true every few decades throughout your life you change a little bit every day and over a long enough timeline there is almost none of the old you left it doesnt necessarily mean youre more developed just different
  what about suffocation
  lack of air will wake you right up that is for sure
  while i admit that i will change and i am changing when i look back i see myself incomplete i feel that that might not quite be the same in ten years looking back to today
  no it wont if you replace the air with a nonoxygen gas you will black out
  it should unironically be legal to euthanize children until they can pass the mirror test
  thats right only causing suffering can be antiethical you dont suffer when you die quickly in your sleep

  saudi crown prince mbs high fived putin while he stayed the fuck away from erdogan at the same summit saudi arabia has been attacking the muslim brotherhood supporting sisi against muslim brotherhood arresting promuslim brotherhood sunni islamist clerics and mbs had the promuslim brotherhood islamist journalist khasshoggi assassinated in turkey khashoggi was an ethnic turk supporter of erdogan and said that saudi arabia should stop atracking the muslim brotherhood and form an alliance of sunni countries against trump and russia and overthrow assad mbs said no lel and had khashoggi cut into pieces on turkish soil to humiliate erdogan and continue persecuting the muslim brotherhood khashoggi wanted to overthrow assad and unite all sunni countries and muslim brotherhood hopefully saudi arabia and russia ally and chop turkey into tiny bitty pieces and end the pathetic dreams of the muslim brotherhood
do it macron nobody is going to judge you if you glassed them quite the opposite
  saudi arabia is against the muslim brotherhood now unlike turkey turkey is the main one supporting sunni islamists like cair against the west now these arent the days of ataturk anymore the roles are reversed you might not have fathomed this but saudis should be supported against turkey mbs has had the sunni islamist khashoggi killed khashoggi wanted to bomb assad and unite all sunni countries and muslim brotherhood against the west
  i love the dissapointment of all the arab sunni islamists who thought saudi crown prince mbs was going to stop former saudi king abdullahs antimuslim brotherhood policies and unite with erdogan the opposite happened mbs arrested the muslim brotherhood clerics and is killing erdogans supporters and showing no respect to erdogan fuck their dreams and they should sudoku so they can join khashoggi mbs will keep shitting on your fantasies of pan sunni alliance
  khashoggi was a big erdogan supporter saudis shitted all over turkey by killing him on turkish soil and sent a message to the muslim brotherhood they they are unsafe even in foreign countries
  russia had sunni islamist alqaeda terrorists killed on turkish soil saudi arabia has sunni islamist muslim brotherhood terrorists killed on turkish soil nobody respects erdogans sovereignty erdogans promises of safe refuge are hollow
  id fucking crown macron the next lempereur of europe for his lifetime if hed get rid of all those saudis but macron is sadly just your average milquetoast politician with a mommy fetish
muslim brotherhood erdogan putin khashoggi sunni islamists assad saudi crown prince mbs turkish soil trump alqaeda
  the enemies of the west are erdogan and muslim brotherhood your resident sunni islamist infiltrators like cair are proerdogan and against saudi arabia the situation has changed erdogan akp muslim brotherhood are your enemies no longer saudi arabia erdogan and muslim brotherhood stilm want to attack assad erdogan delenda est ikhwan delenda est
  to be fair anybody could laugh in the face of that effeminate gerontophile
  (((thats right goy nuke arabia so we can expand greater israel)))
  if saudis are against muslim brotherhood that i know muslim brotherhood are the good guys
  id rather israel expand than shitskin arabs to gain more power
  saudis arent quite rothschild tier but theyre up there
  you are too obvious saudi shill
yeah we should have a ruler that laughs in our face when we tell him to listen to us
  saudi and israel are allies
  muslim brotherhood hate assad christians and all nonmuslims you are either a sunni islamist or a very stupid man erdogan curses european gavur and promises sunni conquest of europe in his speeches to his supporters alqaeda leader zahahiri came from the muslim brotherhood coptic christians hate the muslim brotherhood
  sure you do shekelberg arabs have no power at all we could steal their oil any time we want the only boss of the middle east are the turks
  neither of them are relevant
  get off here neoottomanist erdogan scum
  muslim brotherhood are like bacteria fighting a human in the case of them vs us they are nothing to worry about the middle east only lives because it has jews in it
  erdogan is a problem for another time right now its those filthy saudis funding wahhabist clerics to incite hate in the heart of muslims in the west
  the sunni islamist organisations in the west like cair are all erdogan funded they cut links to saudis and support turkey against saudis now erdogan is bribing your journalists and politicians
  nobody cares about your forced bogdanoff meme
  saudi arabia is one of israels closest ally you politically illiterate nigger
  neutral ibadi oman sided with saudi arabia against turkey over the khashoggi killing erdogans turkey is the enemy
  israel has no allies they have slaves in denial
    if you dont believe me look at their website they are anti saudi and pro turkey putin sided with saudi arabia against turkey over the khashoggi killing do you realise the situation has changed
  your neocon american senators like lindsey graham are attacking saudi arabia on behalf of turkey your neocon and neoliberal media all sided with turkey against saudi arabia turkey is now the enemy of the west
  khashoggi was a journalist for your neocon american newspaper washington post and advocated bombing assad in it
russia saudi arabia syria armenia china none of them have forgotten erdogans threats against them time is ticking on turkey
  saudi king salman and mbs met with the coptic christian pope and maronite pope for the first time in history along with lifting the ban on women driving they arrested the muslim brotherhood clerics while sudais now is forced to praise trump and america it is part of their plans for changing the region and challenging the muslim brotherhood and turkey
  thats what the french used to think too
all sandniggers will shatter on the day of the zap and good riddance
  id rather have a republic with an emperor
  and yet you kids claim not to be cucks when you all want an alpha bossman
  the virgin democratically elected representative   the chad divinely ordained ruler
anyone that does not support bombing both turkey and saudi arabia has no soul    anyone that does has no brain
this is too complicated washington dc israel turkey and saudi arabia are all nukeworthy
  t cnn
    t farhad shah    fuck off persian
  erdogan called shia liars to his supporters during an election and khashoggi hated iran too muslim brotherhood yemenis in taiz were protesting and cursing both saudis and houthis claiming there is a saudiiranhouthi conspiracy against muslim brotherhood and taiz erdogan and his supporters are sectarian pieces of shit by themselves ottomans persecuted shia while fighting against saudis ottoman official jazzar pasha persecuted shia in the levant while the first saudi state and ottomans were fighting against each other proassad syrians hate khashoggi and muslim brotherhood
  abrahamism is global now welcome to the nu millenium
    assad should only be able to keep his rump state    /sg/ retards who swallow kremlin propaganda whole make it out like assad is some prowestern forward looking genius he is a weak willed fop who inherited a strong man position because his abler older brother died he caused his own downfall with shitty economic policies and because he let aqi which would become isis and other sunni rebels set up shop on the border with alanbar because the iranians in extreme short sightedness told him helping jihadis would fuck with america no one did more to help the syrian war happen than assad and it took massive foreign intervention to save him so now hes not even sovereign    anyone who cares about fairness or western values needs to acknowledge that part of syria and northern iraq should be kurdistan and fuck erdogan part of turkey should be at least semiautonomous and kurdish too     iraqi kurds need to be smart and renounce kirkuk though because it isnt worth the turkomen autism    fuck erdogan most of all but fuck assad and iran too
    t raman barzani
  long live assad fuck fsa fuck erdogan fuck mosulis fuck anbaris fuck idlibis
  there is nothing wrong in wanting to have a decent ruler cuck is more like being submissive with no reason for it while this is similar to wanting a decent traffic rules
  iran and assad had different policies in iraq do you see mandatory hijab in syria assad is not an iranian puppet
  assad said a decade ago hamas would go away and dissapear if israel made peace and returned the occupied territories he doesnt agree 100 with the ideology of groups syria backed
    if he wasnt before he sure is now though iran is setting up bases clearly meant to be permanent and he relies heavily on hezbollah and iranian forces    anyhow what was said about assad tacitly and sometimes materially supporting the jihadis who would later turn on him is quite true
  a cuck is being submissive because he finds pleasure in it describes pretty much every bootlicker ever
  you are a closeted sissy faggot who wants to get taken by a burly hairy man you disgust me
    but that policy made sense at the time it weakened america but also kept iran from having influence on syrias border it also siphoned off all the radical young men to go die in iraq    the problem is that he didnt realize that revolts elsewhere in the arab world would be contagious    the arab spring happened when it did because the 2008 collapse fucked the arab economies too and then the 2011 grain crisis quadrupled the average egyptian grocery bill even in mubarak had been popular it could have gone bad add in social media and long simmering resentment in syria and you had a recipe for disaster
  assad meant if israel made the arabs a majority and let them flood parliament with islamist parties and ethnically cleanse jews the arabs dont want to share palestineisrael with jews and have stated this quite openly many times
  hello baal zubab
    atheism is still growing despite the thuggery of muslims and the butthurt of contrarian altright sunday school zoomers
  you aight arabs das pretty cool
  assad and iran have different positions on the rohingya assads un representative voted in favor of myanmar and assads religious officials criticized the rohingya saying myanmar was justified and there are protected mosques in myanmars capital there are alawites in syria who havent prayed in decades and dont know how to fake prayers remember the horrific isis truck stop prayer quiz in iran that could not happen
  anyone else think the world is getting too boring anyway in a weird way like seriously where are the wars we havent had a legit one since vietnam i guess i just want to see some fucking modern technology drones and robots and each countries special forces do some ninja shit it would be so cool
    a country has to be culturally identical to another to exert significant political influence on it    brainletsjpg
  its all well and good until someone goes nuclear
  syria has different foreign and domestic policies from iran on religious and geopolitical matters syria is more secular in both and assad controls the saa the saa generals dont ask iran for orders
  one of their closest allies  not really theyre allies of convinence due to iran they still are in an official state of war and them cooperating really only began about 10 years ago due to obama helping iran so much and making riyadh desperate    saudis were still an official funder of hamas until 2006
  this p much the amount of assad shilling is p hilarious hes a tinpot dictator like all the rest of these arab failures
  assad controls the saa  lol no he doesnt russia does there also isnt much of an saa anymore just shia militias controlled by iran    assad is a puppet propped up by russia for optics

    you are referring to these            
anyone have thoughts about tamim    i was in doha a month ago and it seemed pretty great there the egyptian migrant who drove me around fucking adored him
  yusuf alqaradawi is an egyptian migrant in qatar the chairman of the international union of muslim scholars and he thinks its pretty great and fucking adores tamim these egyptians who love qatar also happen to be muslim brotherhood sympathisers coincidence amirite            
  does france have the capability to glass anything of reasonable size
  this is what pro muslim brotherhoods say about russia    
    mbs is just a modern day ataturk i cant fathom the shortsightedness khashoggi in his last aj interview literally says     mbs is punishing the clergy the religious conservatives hes bringing rights to women naturally like any reporter he makes it me me me     what he is doing i called for and i got fired for when i was an editor of a newspaper allowing a woman to drive or for a woman to be empowered or to limit the power of the religious establishment i demanded that and he is doing the right things  i called for it  i demanded it  me me me    and the fucking bleeding heart idiots think what someone more moderate than mbs is going to come in
    omans good boys they dindu nuffin ibadi islam is literally the inheritor of some crazy sect that fucking sacked mecca they are basically muslim amish minus the tech phobia youre all going to hell so leave me alone please they also help release hostages like its going out of style
    i mean what is the end goal     do they truly want to modernize or is this all saving face why did they have a spat with the saudis anyway
so we have a professional saudi shill on /his/ now another great addition to the menagerie
  israel enslaved egypt when was this
  i can read arabic and just weeks after trump was elected in 2016 khashoggi in his arabic articles called for a pansunni alliance against america and the west demanding the saudi arabia stop attacking the muslim brotherhood stop attacking turkey and instead ally with turkey against america and the west and bomb assad the saudi government under mbs warned khashoggi to immediately shut the fuck up or face consequences so he went off twitter for months and quit writing for months until he fled to america khashoggi says entirely different shit in english about pro democracy and human rights which he never says in arabic in arabic he calls for pan sunni alliances and attacking moderate seculars
  france has a larger nuclear arsenal than china
  the qarmatians sacked mecca not ibadis ibadis are among the most moderate muslims and they have hindu temples in oman oman has not produced a single terrorist unlile any other arab state
  i dont really care about khashoggi i want to cut off support for saudi arabia because of their genocidal war in yemen
when will the chuds and zionists fretting about the muslim brotherhood realize that their and erdogans islamism is far more moderate than saudi salafism
  china keeps the size of its nuclear arsenal a secret nobody knows exactly and it is meant to keep enemies guessing and confused
  houthis should not be bombed but taiz should be bombed they are muslim brotherhood and both saudis and houthis hate them
  many muslim brotherhood leaders joined alqaeda and the muslim brotherhood commits terrorism in syria and yemen ottomans comitted genocide and mass rapes against christians and yazidis the muslim brotherhood wants a worldwide caliphate like the ottomans
goddammit this place is a cesspool
  saudis arent worth the cost   french nukes are costly and high tech they arent comparable to the garbage that chinese pakis and russians own
  source my ass
    t mbs
  egyptian zawahiri and syrian setmariam both former mb and now aq terrorist leaders     albanna believed the quran and sunnah constitute a perfect way of life and social and political organization that god has set out for man islamic governments must be based on this system and eventually unified in a caliphate the muslim brotherhoods goal as stated by its founder albanna was to drive out british colonial and other western influences reclaim islams manifest destinyan empire stretching from spain to indonesia
  at this point nobody would mind it if saudi arabia is turned into french/eu/us colony
              never forget whos truly responsible for 9/11
  never forget who was the first nation to war against americans and tried to conquer europe                          
  the barbary coast is not populated by turks
  there were turks among the highest ranking barbary pirate commanders and they reported directly to the ottoman sultan in constantinople    
  seething mudshit
  yes it was      kouloughlis also spelled koulouglis4 cologhlis and qulaughlis from turkish köleoğlu children of the empire servants from köle servant/slave  oğlu son of was a term used during the ottoman period to designate the mixed offspring of turkish men and local north african women ie berber situated in the western and central coastal regions in the barbary coast ie in algeria567 libya891011 and tunisia12131415 whilst the terminology was commonly used in ottoman algeria ottoman libya and ottoman tunisia it was not used in ottoman egypt to refer to turcoegyptians today the descendants of the kouloughlis have largely integrated into their local societies after independence however they still maintain some of their cultural traditions particularly food they also continue to practice the hanafi school of islam in contrast to the ethnic north africans who practice the maliki school and uphold their turkish origin surnames

where gaijins ever allowed to partake of the whores in yoshiwara before they closed up shop
  yes
yes the nips used the whores as spies and the gaijin to learn japanese hence the nip authorities said the gaijin spoke like women

why are women obsessed with astrology
  it goes back to ancient times women are naturally closer to the spirit world women have always been seers since they are naturally more intelligent and valuable to society
historically it wasnt just women kings generals merchants priests farmers etc all wouldve had interest in the fortune of the stars to varying degrees    the demystification of earth and the rejection of soothsaying is a relatively recent phenomenon
  found the femanon women tend to think with emotion and men tend to think with logic therefore women will be naturally inclined to believe in wonderful magic and fantasy bullshit like that with no logical basis
  based and pinkpilled
  logic is informed by emotion and vice versa logic is really only useful for achieving goals it can say nothing about how one chooses those goals or how one responds to difficulties along the way
  women dont have real autonomy or power so it makes sense they would turn to a system of fantasy power to try to simulate the sense of control theyre lacking
  women are naturally more gullible and credulous the whole reason women and feminists hate puas with a passion is that even though its kind of foolish to us on the face of it they were gullible to fall for it when it was new and they were upset at being so easily manipulated i dont claim this is because women are less intelligent it probably has to do with women being more emotional and less inclined towards skepticism and doubt men are more naturally guarded
women view life as something that happens to them so shit like prophecy they love
  spiritual world    you mean the satanic world dont you after it was eve who tempted by the snake in the garden
  the spiritual world only looks satanic to one who has been given the tools to navigate it and appreciate it for what it is there is much beauty in there if one is open to it truly
  who has not
  does this mean god is antispiritual
  lmao going to hell
  it you were more intelligent you wouldnt be ruining modern society with your shallow practices
  depending on what you mean by god you could say so yes      ive already been there
  cringe just another sad catlady pretending to have magic powers
  more like a birdman but sure
  depending on what you mean by god you could say so yes  elaborate
  well are you referring to the christian god in the way that most christians view him
knowing astrology and keeping an eye on the sky is 10x more useful then knowing a bunch of the jewish garbage that passes as philosophy these days most people nowadays dont know basic orientation and time measuring skills that come from observing the skies and that means if they were forced to regress to an agricultural subsistance existance they would have no clue over what the fuck they would be doing     sure it might be a pile of crap that doesnt mean the skills you have to acquire to practice this pile of crap are not some of the most useful skills a human being can have
  let me guess you come from some derpy protestant sect and assume all christianity is the shallow calvinism you are accustomed to as a catholic christian i can assure you calling god antispirtual is about the least accurate thing you can say about him meditating using incense and candles making offerings to the dead and all those types of things are seen as very noble and desirous actions
  yes how is that being antispiritual what about the gnostic aspects of christianity
  studying the sky is the same as believing in the spirit world and zodiacs
  women are naturally closer to the spirit world   this xyoids will never recover from this
  no faggot but its the kind of hobby that can result in practical skills being acquired unlike most of the humanities
  why is logic so important
  its an easy way to explain peoples behavior rather than to find out about a persons life experiences that molded them to be the person they are today
  because women are gullible brainlets astrology is real though and its one of the areas of life where womens stupidity helps them
  logic is the most reliable way to reach true/optimal conclusions
  dont know why but they really are i interned in a government research lab molecular bio and all the women who were fucking scientists with graduate degrees kept talking about their horoscopes like a bunch of retards
  shut up rib
  they feel like its a good shorthand for understanding other people and how compatible theyre supposed to be with them     basically its game theory for females
  implying any of the people that believe in astrology actually study the constellations and precession

why are nerds obsessed with mbti
because women for the most part with few exceptions are more capable of obsessing over relationships and horoscope/astrology is all about relationships men are the the same way with things and stuff they can use to hit other men
  making this about protestantism    still buttmad i see papist      because their emotions oscillate with the cycles of the moon theyre more likely to believe in other oscillations
  i mean there is no way that any cosmic bodies could affect us in any way  its not like the moon affects the tide or that we still dont know how gravity even works

  this board is infected with libras and aquarius posters     horrible

  nobody thinks with logic logic is the rarest fucking thing in the world and 99 of people dont even realize formal logic exists beyond the colloquial concept of vague reasoning
  made up groups of stars could affect human behavior because i dont like learning science
its because the female is by virtue of its nature guillable and ignorant it has no understanding of its surroundings nor strives for it in its place it finds comfort in halftruths and lies that appear to bring some sense of order into the chaos the female perceives the world to be
  implying the forces applied to the earth by heavinly bodies couldnt be science if done right
  its because the female is by virtue of its nature guillable and ignorant  citation needed  men are just as gullible and ignorant except more dangerous and aggressive
  except demonstrably not so its why they dont fall for spiritualist bullshit and anything that makes them feel good
  implying objects millions of light years away influence human personality at the moment of birth based on apparent position  anything i make up is real if i try hard enough
  implying sports arent pseudospiritual and dont make men feel good
  logic is logic and its above all other thoughts fking women being retarded
  no he is not gods dont give a shit about anything else other than themselves when youll die and youll end up in the world of the heavens where youll realize this world is nothing but a soldier factory meant to popularize the heavens in order for the gods to have pieces to fight with as a game
anyone care to tell me what you can glean from the chart
  implying objects millions of light years away influence human personality at the moment of birth based on apparent position  go ahead try to prove they absolutely dont influence a child at birth ill wait
  well why the fuck would they its a complete nonsequitur its like using the shapes of clouds when you squint at them to make predictions about the future
lets face it men are only useful for yaoi doujinshi material only the cute ones everybody else is redundant in current society
  except those are heavenly bodies that make variations in the gravitational earths field and we might get affectd one way or another by all of it if rivers and seas do i dont see why we wouldnt its not proven but not disproven either science hasnt gone that route yet

  for the most part they dont take it seriously its a social thing on par with giving/receiving tarot readings from your buddies    the better question is why are men so anxious to criticize and reject games like astrology that have no real influence on society as a whole likely has to do with a generation of spoiled and privileged young boys who in place of developing real talents achievements and self worth believed that they are just inherently superior to their peers by virtue of a supposed intelligence and skepticism that mostly manifests itself in stating the obvious and parroting right wing talking points     everyone fucking knows astrology isnt real get off your high horse and let people have fun and explore unconventional ideas
  not neccisarily logic can be informed by bias and experience but it does not solely have to be based on emotion
  well thats talking about practical use vs metaphysical questions so i think thats two different things
  easy because emotions can very easily go out of control do you think mob mentality is informed by logic or emotion i think being primarily focused on logic and being informed by emotion to be best
  oh look bullshit women absolutely do take astrology seriously nice try at attempting to make this about those icky men though you stupid cunt
   
  setting aside my disdain for the stupid bitch whores who take astrology serious for a second i will attempt to be somewhat unbiased here    women tend to be less cynical then men this is why advertisers try to appeal them so strongly why women take psychics seriously more often then men and also why women tend to believe in astrology more then men

  you have to prove that those minor fluxes actualy do anything significant but then why not do the same with the minute differences in the current distance between the earth and sun or earth and moon etc anyways you already have the inhearent bias that they do do something

  why are guys obsessed with psychological tests    
   its why they dont fall for spiritualist bullshit
  this but unironically
  first it is mainly white women who are into this and the reason they are fond of it is because it stem from three different causes    1 monolithic religions ie christianity in europe and the americas dont allow the open practice of paganism and nonchristian branded mysticisms    2 while at the same time incorporates witches wizards and magic into their children stories without giving them heavy negative connotations    3 from late 18th century onward monolithic religions influence among western society has decrease in strength as time goes on and by the 20th century from the 60s and onwards atheism niilhism and relativism was taken a strong enough hold on society that there is a sense of emptiness that needs to be filled while at the sametime dont want to give the monolithic religions the same amount of influence they once had before and this is where astrology tarot card reading crystal ball fortune telling etc start coming into play    tldr because they would find it taboo while whimsically fun without much harm
  astrology was invented by men when they noticed a lot of things seem to correlate with the stars then men discovered that the stars dont actually have anything to do with shit so only the women who have lower iqs and are emotionally instable still believe in the old crap    its like my mom keeping a vynil collection even though cds are an objectively better audio storage medium i cannot really fault her for that because she is just a wman and wmen are not very intelligent
  i laugh at the miniscule size of your brain and its inability for abstraction  if your mom to this day were to still go out of her way to buy vinyl you might but probably still wouldnt have a point  those old vinyls your mom keeps have nostalgic value they arent kept for the quality of the sound itself but because they are a memory of childhood/early adulthood its like thinking someone is stupid for keeping old black and white photographs now that photography is digitalised  even then there is nothing inherently wrong with buying vinyls today they have their own aesthetic and style which is unrelated to any supposed inferior quality of sound  and finally i said supposed because indeed digital audio is subject to compression and loss of data so that any cd or any digital recording to this day has less retaining of original sound than vinyl
  conundrum was it the snake who tempted eve or eve who tempted the snake  poor snakey
  neat
  digital audio is subject to compression and loss of data so that any cd or any digital recording to this day has less retaining of original sound than vinyl  i was expecting you meme spouting brainlets to show up lmao the tryhard thesaurus dump is just icing on the cake    here educate yourself

  i mean there is no way that any cosmic bodies could affect us in any way    made up groups of stars could affect human behavior    the forces applied to the earth by heavinly bodies    objects millions of light years away influence human personality    those are heavenly bodies that make variations in the gravitational earths field    you have to prove that those minor fluxes actualy do anything significant  what the fuck is wrong with you retards the way the night sky looked was just a way for ancient people to keep track of time arguing about whether or not the positions of planets and stars can affect people is like arguing whether or not a paper calendar causes the weather to change and theres definitely some impact of seasonality on people like differences in schizophrenia risk based on the time of year you were born the cause of these differences isnt the way the night sky looks its the recurring seasonal conditions of the environment that can be tracked by using the night sky as a reference
  you live under a matriarchy already moron daily reminder that   all women are evil   women are the ruling class men are a disposable class of slaves  female death is universally viewed as a tragedy male death is viewed as inevitable and often even desirable and honorable the entire biological purpose of men is to serve and protect women and die for them if needed  women breed and perfect their male slave class through sexual selection women are always the selectors briffaults law   men are smarter stronger faster and more aggressive just to serve as efficient slave tools for women being smarter doesnt mean men are ruling just like computer being smarter than you doesnt mean computer rules you  its still just a tool designed to make your life easier  presidents kings prime ministers oligarchs are not rulers just administrators appointed by the collective feminine  women arent loyal to nations or races because they dont need to be they are the superior amoral class not constrained by feelings of kinship and existing outside of mens moral systems  wars are waged by men simply to secure more resources for their female masters the official pretexts of war are just excuses  mother nature herself is a tyrant who needs to be overthrown to end the carnal cycle of vaginal slavery  the only truly free men are the faulty models on the assembly line of sexual selection who are mentally able to hurt women approximately 10 of males because sexual selection doesnt guarantee flawless design   the 10 are still often socially conditioned to servitude but theyre mentally able to break the conditioning as theyre the only men capable of free will  the final promethean act of achieving freedom is to abolish motherhood altogether  if youre able to start viewing your mother your sister your daughter as the enemy
  nah youre the moron most of your arguments for women having power could be applied just as easily to children pet animals sick people livestock the disabled geriatrics etc women not being held accountable and being kept out of harms way is because we treat them as something less not something greater you fight for your property your property doesnt fight for you this doesnt mean your property is the real owner it means its an object and youre not and it would be stupid to expect an object to be able to take care of itself

  cant resist own dick  fucking some woman  you incels dont know anything look at me im living the life  what a joke

  oh my gawd this totally what a scorpio would say ow my gawd
why are angels portrayed as winged humans in pictures but in the bible they are lovecraftian
  bible quote
  its easy to draw more or less humans
   theyre benevolent but good god the way their appearance is described sounds horrifying cherubim ophanim and seraphim angels are the creepiest looking in ezekiel11521 its funny because everyone views angels as beautiful men and women with wings when in reality they look nothing like that i guess seraphim arent that bad its just a giant mass of wings cherubim sound really disturbing though
  honestly this is the coolest part of christianity for me  they should be more open about these kinds of mythical monstrosities it would get people interested
this was something i really liked in evangelion actually  crossdimensional being only explainable with mathematical theories whose shadow and body are reversed from what you would normally expect thats enough of a lovecraftian thing to actually sound like a biblical angel to me
  this the actual content of the bible is much cooler than most people think
  so why did the people of sodom try to rape them if they werent beautiful humanoids
  they were so lecherous they would fuck a shadow fetus surrounded by eyeballs
  they were men walking around even the sodomites yelled bring those men to us so we can rape them they thought they were just men
  they can choose to go in disguise if necessary it was a test to see if they would be attacked
  because they are what is called sacred they cant be represented in a lovercraftian way no matter how disturbing their descripitions may be once you start trying to make them lovercraftians or something from a horror movie is no longer something benign you are starting to enter in what is the profane wich contradicts the very thing angels are for    man becomes aware of the sacred because it itself shows itself as something wholly different from the profane  the modern occidental experiences a certain uneasiness before many manifestations of the sacred he finds it difficult to accept the fact that for many human beings the sacred can be manifested in stones or trees for example but as we shall soon see what is involved is not a veneration of the stone in itself a cult of the tree in itself the sacred tree the sacred stone are not adored as stone or tree they are worshiped precisely because they are hierophanies because they show something that is no longer stone or tree but the sacred the ganz andere      mircea eliade
  more of a /sci/ question but what in the world is dirac space all i could glean from wikipedias technobabble was some sort of negative energy system
  the whole point of christianity is appealing to the masses and its easier for sub60 iq peasants to wrap their heads around beautiful people with wings than what theyre actually described as in the scriptures
  i am indeed not /sci/ enough to properly answer something like a model of a vacuum which rather than being characterised by a total lack of matter is actually an infinitely large body of particles which have negative energy dirac theorised this because he said that the number of electrons supposedly in existence should give the entire universe a colossal net negative charge yet there is no such thing if we say electrons are positive energy there must therefore be some overarching negative energy balancing it and this was to be found in the vacuum so he said in reality the positron was discovered later which solved that issue in the show what it means is that the angel itself is almost twodimensional its a few nanometres thick while being almost a kilometre in diameter but anything which comes into contact with it sinks into a seemingly infinite space even if you sink into it with a building sinking right next to you by the time youre in the pocketdimension you will be infinitely far away from that building somehow this also inverts the relationship between shadow and body for it probably just because they thought it would be cool oh and this dimension of sorts is also somehow conscious and psychoanalyses one of the characters
  bible also describes angels as looking like luminous men such as the angels who rolled back the stone covering christs tomb some angels look like men others look different     another theory is that they can manipulate their forms being nonphysical sentient life and all
  see  you pseud
  can they shapeshift they appear as lovecraftian abominations in the old testament but only as pure men in the new unless of course this is the work of the demiurge again
  same but what is the biblical basis for these depictions  
  no they appear as men in the ot during the story of sodom as anon pointed out  im gonna guess angels coming to earth with the intention of appearing to men are going to take the form of men and the angels people like elijah saw when they went to heaven look rathe different since the angels in heaven are in their natural habitat and dont have to worry about scaring people
  people back then couldnt read the bible so the church commissioned artists to paint the epic scenes so that normies could understand winged humans were easier to draw
there are multiple categories of angels you posted an ophanim  the cherubim seraphim and thrones/ophanim are the most disturbung in appearance but are also the most divine hence why a cherubim guards eden with the flaming sword and the seraphim attend the throne of god  the lower ranks appear more human
  i can answer the question better than that guy    its the mathematical space in which 1/2 spin particles live these prticles are described by fermidirac statistics its just the space where that math lives     anytime you hear ____space in physics its just a place where the math unfolds it has no consequence on reality
  so what does god look like then
   when moses encountered god as a blazing bush he feared looking at god exodus 36 even moses intimate relationship in which the lord spoke face to face deuteronomy 3410 contained limitations in seeking gods glorious presence moses is reminded you may not look directly at my face for no one may see me and live exodus 3311 2023 face to face indicates intimate conversations shared between two close friends this mutual trust allows them to communicate honestly and openly with one another deuteronomy 1268    he also appears as a 1000 foot tall pillar of fire numbers 1414
   in genesis 322228 jacob the father of the twelve patriarchs of the israel after wrestling with god was left crippled jacob named the place penielface of godfor he said i have seen god face to face yet my life has been spared genesis 3230 god came as close to jacob as possiblethe creators hands were physically placed on him so he has hands or appendages similar to hands
angels are le cosmic horror its so cool xd  i want this meme to day christfag larpers need to get the fuck out    if you really believe youll live forever through christ then why the fuck you dont martyr yourself faggot
repent or god will come to your fucking window tonight
  because they saw aliens descend on earth and thought them angels  they reasoned that the hostile alien destruction of sodom was just gods will
  this
  dont you have a tanning booth to be in
you are confused angel is not synonym of seraphim and cherubim

  ayy and lmaopilled
  dont get confused with angeloi in greek thats another thing and those are malachim which are humanoid possibly actual humans that just served yhwh el shaddai kamosh and the other elohims lets not say god since it is the wrong literal translation the cherubim and the others along with yhwhs kavod/kabod not glory since kavod means heavy on the other hand arent living beings they make thunderlike noises when they elevate themselves in flight and move yhwh sits on them to move too if you read carefully now imagine being ezekiel or whoever in ancient times and you see something that makes noise flies and has a reflective redmetallic like color that from the front look like an eagle etc you get it theyre basically some sort of flying vehicles of some weird kind divine godly literally it says that its up to people to interpret what they want but in my opinion when people write something they want to communicate they just write it and thats it no need for allegory and interpretations because otherwise the whole bible would be a book that no one could understand without some theologist explaining every single detail trying to convey a religious meaning the bible belongs to history not religion
  nt screwing things up again  was the nt what finally killed christianity
  christianity adopted the more pleasing aesthetics of grecoroman paganism because semetic mythology is disgusting and was made by a bunch of sickinthehead death cultists
  normies have little imagination
    in appearance their form was human but each of them had four faces and four wings    sounds like winged humans to me the circle within circle creatures are next to them not them
  hehe
  you dont want to know
its ezekiel where you can absolutely 100 tell theyre just completely fucking tripping balls
  bro it was aliums xdxdxdxdxd
  another theory is that the bible is a series of writtings by different sandniggers and has no internal consistency
can someone please just post the descriptions that these images are based on already
  you cant fuck wheels within wheels with your earthly body
  i can show you my face but id have to kill you  is god a cia nigger
  if i remember correctly god was described as being a being of light clothed in white flames and since man was created in his image its safe to assume humanoid in shape
my mom says im an angel 
  some angels are similar to humans in shape and i would wager that they can also change shape at will so to take a human form would be nothing to them
  not necessarily aliens could simply be an advanced branch of humanity that with time slowly faded or got wiped out we cant deny that certain ancient objects and depictions seem very out of place from a temporal perspective
  so how do the archangels like michael and gabriel fit in this michael leads the armies of god so he is obviously quite a high ranked angel but like gabriel is he often depicted to be more humanoid i believe gabriel is described to be humanoid in the bible as well so it makes sense for all the archangels to be
  in wich rank was the metatron
  pagan influence
  ezekiel 1424 describes cherubim and wheels    4 and i looked and behold a whirlwind came out of the north a great cloud and a fire infolding itself and a brightness was about it and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber out of the midst of the fire    5 also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures and this was their appearance they had the likeness of a man    6 and every one had four faces and every one had four wings    7 and their feet were straight feet and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calfs foot and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass    8 and they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides and they four had their faces and their wings    9 their wings were joined one to another they turned not when they went they went every one straight forward    10 as for the likeness of their faces they four had the face of a man and the face of a lion on the right side and they four had the face of an ox on the left side they four also had the face of an eagle    11 thus were their faces and their wings were stretched upward two wings of every one were joined one to another and two covered their bodies    12 and they went every one straight forward whither the spirit was to go they went and they turned not when they went    13 as for the likeness of the living creatures their appearance was like burning coals of fire and like the appearance of lamps it went up and down among the living creatures and the fire was bright and out of the fire went forth lightning    14 and the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning    15 now as i beheld the living creatures behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures with his four faces
  16 the appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl and they four had one likeness and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel    17 when they went they went upon their four sides and they turned not when they went    18 as for their rings they were so high that they were dreadful and their rings were full of eyes round about them four    19 and when the living creatures went the wheels went by them and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up    20 whithersoever the spirit was to go they went thither was their spirit to go and the wheels were lifted up over against them for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels    21 when those went these went and when those stood these stood and when those were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up over against them for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels    22 and the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal stretched forth over their heads above    23 and under the firmament were their wings straight the one toward the other every one had two which covered on this side and every one had two which covered on that side their bodies    24 and when they went i heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters as the voice of the almighty the voice of speech as the noise of an host when they stood they let down their wings
  
  the bible clearly states that the angels that came to lots door were disguised as mortal men how beautiful they looked isnt clear since the mob that came to know them was as much driven by anger as by lust
  hands and feet are hard af to draw
  the problem with a literal interpretation of the bible is that even mundane events are often inaccurately and even anachronistically reported and theres no good evidence for the existence of certain biblical figures who may very well have been amalgamations of multiple persons or fabrications
  arent some of them supposed to resemble humans though the weird looking ones like ophanim and cherubim for instance were only in the first sphere of angels
  2nd and 3rd spheres are all human looking iirc 1st sphere is divine brainfuck
os imperium or oral sex was illegal in the roman empire it was a convention of obscenely comic verse that oral sex caused bad breath that was nearly toxic whores of the alleyways are contaminated from giving oral sex catullus refers to the foul saliva of a pissedover whore the urinary function of the penis makes oral sex particularly repulsive to catullus who elsewhere reviles a celtiberian for brushing her teeth in urine martial jokes that a fine perfume turned to garum fish sauce when it was sniffed by a woman whose breath was putrid from oral sex in another of martials epigrams a fellator breathes on a hot cake to cool it down and turns it to dog excrement the bad breath and rotten teeth that are attributed to performing oral sex represent moral decay and a general corruption of the mouths positive functions as the organ of a citizens persuasive speech

why did britain push for peace and were so merciful to germany when france wanted to march on berlin and destroy germany with the treaty of versailles to assure a total victory
because britain didnt want to replace germany as master of europe with france/russia britain also didnt want a communist revolution in central europe however the main reason is that the english people are a kind and forgiving people that have always striven to uplift and educate the lesser races of the world and welcome them with open arms as complete human beings
when france wanted to march on berlin and destroy germany
  it was petains plan to march to berlin so the german citizen would understand they were defeated  on of the problem of the end of ww1 is that no german citizen see any of the allied soldier  if you didnt see any enemies soldier how can you know you just be defeated
  anglos willingness to forgive always comes back to bite him by the lesser races
the founding of rome edition    so if romulus and remus were raised by a wolf then how did they communicate with everyone else did early romans just growl at each other when did they start speaking latin then
you stupid fucking cunt
  they werent raised by wolves they were breastfed by a shewolf when they were babies abandoned at the bank of the tiber they were raised by a shepherd
  come on im just trying to get a thread going here with some lighthearted fun stop the name calling and start discussing what interests you about the early days of rome the kings the sabines patricianpleb relations
they were suckled by a shewolf before being found by a passerby they werent raised by her
q v i r i n u s
did the romans themselves ever question their origin story obviously the part with the wolf is a bit fantastical but was it just a fact to the romans that romulus was a descendent of aeneas or that the mother of romulus and remus was fucked by mars  also the julii also claimed to be descendents of aeneas were they also related to romulus or were these seen as different branches of the same family
  no  its metaphors and symbolism and shit you cheeky materialist kunt
  they regarded it as history but that didnt mean they didnt question and rationalize it livy for example thought that their mother was raped by some random guy and that she made up the mars story to cover it up
romans legitimately thought they were trojans  they the biggest wewuz in history
  you stupid fucking cunt
  perhaps they were thanks to the dirty gauls we will never know what they actually passed down and what they just made up hundreds of years after the fact
  etruscans probably were
  why are generals poping up god i hope this a small fad and not permanent
  livy didnt think that he just said that some other people thought that livys own thoughts are easy to spot considering there are times he goes on tirades such as when he stsrted going on about the good old days back when rome was still roman in the books about the second punic wars
why did remus have to jump over romulus wall what the fuck was his problem
  imagine civilisation being based in property rights and justice over such
  they were weaned by a wolf and pretty much immediately found by a shepherd they werent raised by a wolf
  remus was mad romulus had more vultures and tried to scheme his shit through using a technicality
  be remus  the gods send you six eagles to show that they favor you as the new king of what is going to be the greatest city ever built  your brother hears about this  i always saw twice as many good omens from the gods as you saw  people actually believe him  dude i would have jumped that wall to kick his ass too
  vultures not eagles they flew away when remus ran at them
  t publius quinctilius
kill your brother  invite all the hobos and scum to your new city  go on a gang rape rampage to steal honest peoples women  kill everyone who tries to stop your degeneracy  was romulus black
  whats the problem with generals instead of five threads with three replies about the same topic you just have one with twenty replies
  when they turned christcuck that obviously means they took it with a grain of salt
  it did worked out
  christian romans are barely roman at all the whole religion was a big part of their identity
can someone explain this picture to me please     arent jomon and yayoi just historical periods     why are they treated like difference races  arent they both japanese 
jomon are native to japan while yayoi are migrants from korea who brought chink culture
  theyre ambiguous terms you should think of it like man from the jomon period or man from the yayoi period  why are they treated like different races  they look quite different despite being relatively close in the mongoloid cluster the jomon preserved features from ancient populations who didnt go through the mongolisation process so while they might look like caucasoids sometimes theyre genetically mongoloid though you would not call an aleut a mongolian right theyre different ethnic groups and did not drift apart genetically far enough to be considered different races  arent they both japanese  yes and no modern japanese peoples wouldnt exist without their mixing but there was no japan in those periods its like saying the celts were spanish yes they lived in the area that is spain today and are part of the genetic makeup of the iberians but they were not spanish same as the jomon and the yayoi werent korean or japanese these terms are used for convenience to quickly make a territorial area come in mind when talking about them
    so jomon  the ainu     also does that mean that the majority of japanese people so nonainu are descendants of the korean people     then why is japanese a language isolate and not related to korean 
  you would not call an aleut a mongolian right    why wouldnt i     they are short and have slenty eyes
  no ainu is liek siberian or some shit
  ainu are the remnants of the people in the north that broke off from the rest of jomons honestly you just have to go to japan to see that a huge amount of japs look significantly different than chinese or koreans they almost look hispanic in their features instead of the east asian
  oh no the ainu are epijomon  emishi  okhotsk and depending on the area you could add yamato nivkh and tungusic to the mix they could range from 20 to 70 jomon ancestry  why is japanese a language isolate  the most common theory is that there were multiple languages in the korean peninsula and yayoi was one of them hell recently even in jeju old tamna/tamra they spoke a nonkorean language it just happens that greater powers assimilate/exterminate smaller powers  a good example are the nivkh they speak a language completely unrelated to every other family around that is because in pretungusic times there were other languages around when the tungusics expanded they assimilated/drove out other peoples and their language prevailed
  so ainu are the descendants of the jomon just like french are the descendants of the gauls 
    i didnt understand a single thing you said
are there things like this for other ethnicities im an angloindian genetic mess and itd be interesting
east asians are ayy lmaos they evolved various traits in the freezing steppes some good some bad slant eyes being fatty insulation for the eyes short stubby legs to conserve heat high borderline autistic iq needed for all the stone age bushcraft needed to not die up there and often theyd have to leave the weak to die as they move from one hunting ground to another low testosterone because sexual competition is a waste of energy after the ice age their populations apparently exploded as their territory warmed up and they migrated south in large numbers there was possibly a 2nd wave after agriculture emerged which the north china plain was well placed for
  hey i drew it for you  phase 1  there are two language/ethnic/cultural groups in this area a and b they coexist and their territories are close  phase 2  group b experiences a population growth or technological advancement through agriculture unification whatever and penetrates group as territory they now occupy a big part of as territory and its residents are under bs control  phase 3  time passes at least 100 years and group bs territory has expanded because it assimilated part of group a they imposed their language and culture on their subjects    so b was stronger than a and dominated part of them its just a matter of time and resources until they expand west and completely assimilate a similar things have always happened everywhere
  gooky looks  damn
  a  japanese  b  koreans     
  ainu are about 2/3 jomon and 1/3 okhotsk nivkh jomon themselves were 3/5 ne asian and 2/5 something related to malaysian aboriginals so ainu are far more ne asian than some of them look
  no just hypothetical populations we dont know for sure what happened in korea for the yayoi language to fall in disuse and exist only in their overseas settlements    heavily depended on the area the purer ainu in hidakatokachikushiro could very well be 70 jomon but it was very common for them to mix with their neighbours there were some sakhalin ainu who looked just like their nivkh neighbours    read if you want to know a bit more
  so about half of modern ainu have okhotsk maternal lines  i dont really believe theres a lot of pure ainu left that arent over 60
  yeah the elders actively encouraged mixing with the yamato and the russians to avoid prejudice there might be 300010000 pure ones at an absolute most nowadays but im certain they dont retain an ainu identity or something like that
  ainu are more jomon than yamato typical japanese also ryukyuans okinawans have more jomon dna     but most japanese are a mix with northern kyushu and kansai people having more yayoi dna and tohoku people having more jomon dna some japanese say that akita bijin have russian dna and thats they have western features but its actually because of their high jomon dna
  then why is japanese a language isolate and not related to korean   according to some its distantly related
germanize poland for centuries  cry when poles ethnically cleanse germans after world war 1
  poles didnt even cleanse anyone after ww1 they should have tho even after ww2 they waited for the russians to do itactually i dunno if they could without stalin allowing it overall they always were historically to lenient with germanic agressors
expecting the eternal krt to think rationally
  cry when poles ethnically cleanse germans after world war 1  source for this claim  free city of danzig governed itself and germans in poland lived normal life they even acted like snobs to their polish neighbors
  nobody got cleansed after ww1
  and that is a tragedy
  its a polescirclejerkingeachother thread  cant get enough of these the salt is top quality from both sides   sage
  its not the germans fault that the poles are a bunch of idiotic peasants that cant rule themselves
gift poles civilization  get nothing but hatred in return    the plight of the white man
      a big concern in the prussian/german partition of poland was that german settlers were polonizing faster than the state was germanizing polish locals          heres an old but good work article on how the prussian/german efforts worked and how/why they backfired for the most part    it is estimated by the german that during the nineteenth century 100000 germans in the eastern provinces of prussia were polonized that is they adopted the language religion and sentiments of the poles during this time the poles were making no systematic effort in this direction    not even germans want to be german
the grmanic cries out in pain as he strikes you  good riddance
  t hans maria albert von schnitzelmachen
  100000  lol there are much more poles being germanized in the rhineland alone
  hardly an argument germans are literal /r9k/ the nation     poles in the weimar republic and nazi germany before 1939  weimar republic revoked polish minority rights in 1930  not allowed to vote  not allowed to own property  not allowed to teach polish in schools  germans persecuted and slaughtered silesian pole    germans in the second polish republic before 1939  german minority received minority rights in 1918  allowed to vote  allowed to own property  allowed to teach german in schools  germans had own representation in parliament
    nazi germanization of native polish lands was far more violent than prussian one but the latter wasnt saint either    prussian germanization  obligatory learning of german in schools  obligatory service in prussian/imperial army  polish teachers and clerks replaced by german ones  removal of catholic priests who failed their kulturexamen  eviction of polish immigrants with austrian or russian passport  removal of polish from schools  physical punishments for speaking it  statesupported purchase of lands from poles by prussian settlement commission  prohibition of building new houses on owned land without goverments approval  gatherings in polish language to be held only in cities with over 60 polish population    nazi germanization  physical extermination or deportation of 100 000 remarkable people in polish society  professors doctors officials teachers priests and sportsmen during operation tannenberg ab aktion and intelligenzaktion  closure of polish schools seminars theaters and cinemas  eviction of poles for generalplan ost  kidnapping and undocrtrination of 150000 racially worthy polish children
  hardly an argument  germans are literal /r9k/  cries about attrocities  typical polish post incoherent and wrong usage of phrasing
  typical judeogermanic tactic of 
  haha epic now you officially fit in

why were abrahamic religions so bloody throughout their entire history /his/
  they didnt evolve naturally from customs and tradition they came from a person spreading new ideas then the small following had to force their new ideas into the public by working behind the scenes with the government and/or economy  theyre not the only bloody religions though

what does /his/ think of posadas can his ideas be implemented today
posadists in practice have always turned out to be dangerous fuckers castro kicked them out of cuba because they tried to egg him on to strike first during the cuban missile crises and later tried to take over guantanamo bay     that being said with how politics is today we might not have a choice but to implement his ideas someday
stalin  is  bad    anyone that died at katyn deserved it  fuck cossacks
why is it rarely acknowledged that hitler was blitzed on meds that would make any junkie blush while his cities were bombed to ruins and armies destroyed this likely influenced many of his decisions post1941
damn hitler was high as a kite most of them time its amazing he could even function at all
he should go on joe rogan and explain himself
can anyone provide a valid critique of materialism the more ive come to learn about it the more ive come to believe in it
  what do you mean by materialism
  like when u like buying like lots of clothes and superficial things think consoomerism
genie the feral child serves as a good supporting case for materialism
  i dont think materialism is the same as consumerism
  define materialism
    are you guys serious dialectic materialism look at ops picture for fucks sake
  speculative realism owns it
  if youre talking about marxs conception of historical materialism then ive heard a few critiques about his overreliance on the dialectic which is considered to be pretty antiquated nowadays
  speculative realism is based for the lovecraftian gigafacism
  well what makes you believe it    it seems to me that there are many parts of society and history which while touched by the mode of production are certainly not determined by it there is a huge difference between different feudal countries and a huge difference between different capitalist countries which seems to me to be unexplained by historical/dialectical materialism    also like how the scientific method cant justify the scientific method marx doesnt use his dialectics to critique his dialectics for this kind of critique you should look at critical theory the above reason is also something they consider how the different parts of society base production and superstructure society))) mutually determine each other
  modes of production are a culmination of the different aspects of sociopolitical organization these aspects constitute a product of materialist influences influences with a basis in the actual physical world the point here is that any set of values transcendent belief systems customs language etc all owe their origin to social/physical interaction between humans and the physical world around them man was not brought into the world with preexisting notions of anything metaphysical someone here mentioned genie which i feel is an apt testament to this a young girl kept in a basement for most of her life  fed and physically sustained into adolescence yet denied social interaction without social interaction or any real interaction with the world in general she never acquired language skills and subsequently never acquired the ability to carry out systematic trains of thought she was essentially a blank slate  no spontaneously generated values no inherently produced religious posturings    modes of production particularly capitalism can be extended beyond a physical point of origin and be superimposed as a veneer upon different societies
  the point about her having no interaction with the world could equally be used to justify another conception of history she was denied relationship with production but she was also denied social relationship so maybe society determines means of production and everything else in history
  social relationships fall under a broader conception of materialism marx writes about such in the german ideology
  dialectic materialism is a very fucky variety of metaphysics
hey /his/ /k/ here   i was just wondering if there is any consensus or general idea on how many people died during the great depression    it came up in a prepping thread and i realized i had no idea i had heard that crime only increased slightly as well but i think that can mostly be explained by factors that are no longer at play
so nobodys got any idea  is there a place i could go that might deal with these sorts of records
  if you look at things like life expectancy mortality and other health indicators theres not much of an increase in problems accounts of life at the time point to life becoming harder and people being poorer but it wasnt severe enough to cause largescale mortality or declines in health
  80 to 200 million using birth deficiency analysis most of these were killed in the united states the uk and western europe by democratic governments
  very very few there was a story that in harlem a dozen black people starved to death but for the most part people continued living alright things just got less convenient and comfy
  here come the rooseveldist shit posters denying the doledeaths
  birth deficiency  is that just how many people werent born
  everyone in west died because capitalism doesnt work lol read black book of capitalism lol really puts muh few thousand dead in based socialist countries to perspective lol    gang weed /leftpol/ represent rise up
  i hate fdr but the fact remains that the american industry and ethic was so strong that the great depression didnt really affect the death rate
  yes its a standard technique you decide how many people should have been alive then subtract the number who were alive the resulting number is the number of people killed by the state

  ive never actually seen the skyline of istanbul from this view before whats up with all the copypasted hagia sophias were those og byzantine buildings of a similar style or did the turks just start building more of them after the conquest
  turkey is a mess right now i mean theyve always been a bit of a mess but theyre really messy at the moment theyve made casual enemies of every neighboring country and are trying to play nato russian spheres of influence and the islamic world simultaneously there are only so many groups you can pick a fight with before it comes back to bite you in the ass
  london  constantinople  rome      theyre copypasted by ottomans same reason you see those ugly dumbeddown mosques that consist of a dome on a rectangle throughout the whole western islamic world and in europe due to sunni migration and influence turk see impressive building turk copy it and the ottomans had a huge reach so they spread it iran on the other hand has completely different mosque building style reflecting their own longstanding heritage    similarly the hagia sophia was a result of centuries of architectural evolution in the greek christian world and greek orthodox church architecture also evolved significantly since hagia sophia just like every architectural tradition does over time unless its a stolen tradition then you just repeat the same thing
  there was this autistic ottoman engineer that convinced the sultan to build about 3 replicas of the hagia sophia

when will ww3 happen  happening  can we just genocide/hang/gas these people already  just bought my ar today who else is going down fighting  just nuke us already  the west isnt collapsing fast enough lads    everything post 80s has become so pc and anti violence   nothing is won but given    everyone says nothing is wrong enough to warrant violence so what can we do
  excited when shootings happen  edgy
  everyone says nothing is wrong enough to warrant violence  centrists arent everyone
yes at least in the case of zoomers and millennials and its a good thing most previous centuries were so much more interesting everything plods along now    oh god this person
  it is true even if you remove all /pol/tard influence from it  just look how fucking excited and energetic people get on social media when something fucked up happens only women go full sad posting about tragedy for personal attention and edit their profile pictures for victims of said tragedy    if nex generation continues to get more and more radicalised today into larping as farright or farleft god knows what would happen
  leftypol wants genocide white people   why do you hate the white race
    internet tough guy passage  followed by internet tough guy picture    why am i not surprised

childhood is destroying things in the belief you are strong for doing so    adulthood is realizing destruction is the natural state of things and you were nurtured clothed and fed in a bubble created by others to shield you from the outside world you are weak and defenseless and it is only your capacity to create that makes you strong
was the tanaka memorial legit i read it and it seems something the militaristic japanese leadership could come up with
  im not sure that it really matters since that there is no way for little japan to conquer the world military     konpeki no kantai    good stuff though
  its bad enough that had to i read the subs i am not reading all of that too
  so i tried wikiing the thing and im really confused    so america somehow surrenders even though they were never invaded the germans were suddenly even more op and fucking conquered russia then backstabbed japan but surrendered coz british was defended    im really confused it sounds like germany in this series is op as fuck but they somehow lost
  that look is making me feel guilty for liking anime
  nibba deep blue fleet doesnt have subs only mega weebs who know japanese or turbo alternate history autists have watched it
  the whole show is shameless japanwank theres probably less than a dozen japanese ships or planes that are destroyed onscreen in the course of the whole show
  i know i was trying to be funny but i guess it didnt work out
fdr is a huge musclebound blonde man that walks around on his own 2 feet  what did the writers mean by this

my professor told me masturbation was pretty much unheard of that until a few centuries ago nobody would have even imagined doing something like that we have no written records of people masturbating in antiquity or even in the medieval period when the jews began attaining more social power they began spreading promasturbation propaganda convincing young people that its ok to masturbate despite all the catastrophic health effects the goal was to prevent whites from reproducing and divert them to masturbation instead in this way the jews tried to get a demographic advantage over whites and eventually destroy them this sounds crazy but my professor is tenured and would have probably been fired if there wasnt any truth to this pic unrelated
  we have no written records of people masturbating in antiquity or even in the medieval period
  despite all the catastrophic health effects  based  fact nofap increases gains by 300
  how can you be sure hes not inspecting something
my professor is tenured and would have been fired  lol
  damn thats a nice dick i have
  retarded bait the sad thing is that some posters are actually going to listen to ops bullshit
we have no written records of people masturbating in antiquity or even in the medieval period     what is aristophanes half of his plays include explicit references or scenes of masturbation
  i mean  it is really impressive
  i hope he at least got to nut just in time
there is even a story about diogenes wanking in public
how stupid are you op    hur dur da joos invented wanking to control the aryan race  this sounds crazy but my professor is tenured and would have probably been fired if there wasnt any truth to this  well he probably doesnt even exist but if he does then he should be fired aside from all the artistic depictions already posted there is also the case of the sumerian god enki creating the tygris and euphrates through ejaculation
  egyptian creation myth literally involves gods spanking one out and creating the nile with their jizz     the pharaoh would literally perform a ritual where he would masturbate into the nile
  be /pol/tard  make embarrasingly retarded post  every time
  based
  the pharaoh would literally perform a ritual where he would masturbate into the nile    well if i was seen as god then i would do that too
   when the jews began attaining more social power they began spreading promasturbation propaganda convincing young people that its ok to masturbate despite all the catastrophic health effects   congratulations you have reached critical mass of autism
  he lied to you   switch classes
  hes right op while others in the thread post the few exceptions that are bound to mythology masturbation wasnt considered normal until the rise of the jewish porn industry
catastrophic health effects
  came here to post this  its a bad thread innit
  a lot worse things than masturbation is within this museum   
  look art his face that is the face of a dude that emptied his balls
  if the porn industry is so jewish why do white people so adamantly take part in it as producers actors providers and consumers the decision whether or not to watch porn rests upon you even if jews did control 100 of the porn industry you cant blame them for pure aryans being earnestly interested in that which they broadcast
  the goal was to prevent whites from reproducing and divert them to masturbation instead  who even fucking skips sex in favour of masturbating isnt your shitty conspiracy nut professor the same type of person that complains about young hedonistic people having nostringsattached sex all the time

gives his troops the shitty bowl helmet  but wears the superior adrian helmet himself
  the virgin french  the chad brit
  why does he look like some down syndrome kid
  barely different from hitler in his ultra racism and supremacist ideology  based
  british genetics
  i thought the ruling elite of britain were french
ahghghghghgh save me churchiil
  i agree completely another thing ive wondered is why is neville chamberlain blamed for appeasement while churchill is praised for doing fuck all i mean there wasnt much chamberlain could do in his situation while churchill relied on the soviet union and us
  disingenuous meme history    i wouldnt expect anything else from this board
    churchill set up boer concentration camps  as a 26 year old journalist and cavalry lieutenant
  could do  embargo make public his war spending
  anglos have the powers to convince others to bend to their wills

  based churchill
  planned invasion of gallipoli  not his fault they got rid of his naval escort and russians fucked off
theres the new american jesus the one that rural/rich americans fap to every night  he did the exact opposite of every principle he supposedly stood for  increased spending by funding useless star wars bullshit  sold arms to iran who reaganites are supposed to hate  claimed to fight authoritarianism but supported contras and saddam hussien  had moderate view on immigration  no experience whatsoever when elected office california campuses became violent poltical flashpoints under his governorship    is believing in (((ronald reagon))) any better than being a christcuck
  here are couple of ideas  not hand over czechoslovakia  not force the french to stand down when germans occupied the rhineland
   different from hitler in his ultra racism and supremacist ideology and killed almost as many people  nothing wrong with this unlike shitler churchill considered all europeans great and supreme form of lifeexceps the irish   fuck niggers mudslims poojits commies and naizs he is the hero of europe  only bad thing he did was fail to put a better successor and failed to insure european supremacy and its all because of americans and commies fuck em too
  gallipoli was kitcheners fault
  this one always gets me   hes literally one of the worst presidents since ww2 and people think hes awesome
    overthrow the elected iranian government for oil    bring the barbaric house of saud to power in arabia    he didnt do either of these
  they needed someone to appeal to the proles
  the british nation will never think badly of him essentially for 1940 its hard to understand that time for anyone who didnt directly live it but theres a reason that 1940 is considered the time when the british people were at their best  and alot of that was down to churchill
  is it like the 1960s for americans
  not anymore from the 1415th century me think
  piss away 200000 troops in the terribly planned gallipoli invasion  it was not him who failed but the military intelligence which failed to gather such basic informations like battlefield geography and mined zones in the straight  force thousands of boers into brutal concentration camps for resisting the british invasion  when you dress as a civilian but still support terrorists and attack british army from behind you stop being a noncombatant and must be treated as enemy soldier  starve and gas illiterate indian and iraqi peasants  nothing of value was lost  overthrow the elected iranian government for oil  brown fucking shits would harass their neighbours with it   israel out of a belief that palestinians are subhuman  better let jews to murder sandniggers in their own sand shithole than to annoy honest citizens on pure coasts of albion   the blacks and tans in ireland responsible for mass murder rape and pillage  theres nothing wrong in giving micks their own medicine  brutally torture thousands of kenyans for wanting independence  good riddance doubting in might of british rule is a heavy crime  bring the barbaric house of saud to power in arabia  whip is the only language these oreintal savages understand there is no other way to keep them in order  worshipped as a hero by normies and brainlets everywhere   he is a hero of masses and he worked hard to earn such title   different from hitler in his ultra racism and supremacist ideology and killed almost as many people  hitler is a filthy kraut who is so scurvy he is not even worthy of serving winston his whiskey
  the black and tans  literally forced civilians at gun point to burn a neighboring house down in county cork so they wouldnt be responsible for an obvious war crime  churchill is a hollywood hero a face but not a figure not a soul or anything to be celebrated just another puppet to give false inspiration
this is the ideal monarch body you may not like it but this is what peak enlightened rule looks like
if germans were so superior in every way why they lost the war to a bunch of factory workers and farmers
  if germans were so superior in every way  has anyone ever actually said this

alexander is the greatest figure in greek and human history    reinforced the league of corinth   beat the achaemenid empire  his empire took over persian land and reached india  people viewed him as a god  undefeated   valued hellenic civilisation   spread it  was ambitious till the end    the only people who hate him are people who are envious of his greatness
in macedonian and human history  ftfy
  he should have come home after defeating the persians
  based
  no he was going to set up his capital in the orient and become an oriental despot
  macedonia is greek so my terminology is still correct    his men shouldnt have revolted and should have kept conquering    youre ahead of the curve
  macedonia is greek so my terminology is still correct  yikes
  i mean if you want to be technical it was its own thing like athens thebes and lacedaemonia however they are all part of the wider greek identity
  league of reddit couldnt even beat a much weaker sparta  cringe
  ignoring the fact he didnt take it because it wouldve been a waste of time and resulted in protest from the league     the spartan myth needs to die
  who hinged who u wuz sayin
  no this meme needs to end right now
  defeat most powerful empire in 1 week  couldnt invade island with about 50 people at the time  daily reminder crete is literally the masterrace
  sparta was irrelevant by that time
      lakonia have been an empire maker their entire history
  does it even occur to u cunts this shit destroys aggrarian civilisation wtihin the ring and the significant impact this has to geopol

  slavs who migrated into alexanders homeland hundreds of years after his death have no claim to his achievements just as the afroturks who will inhabit germany in 100 years have no claim to the accomplishments of bismarck
  as someone who believes macedonians are greek some historians do view them as separate or more akin to distant relatives people thinking it isnt greek doesnt solely relate to fyrom    going off ancient historians and archaelogical evidence but id class them as hellenes
  who ever said anything about slavs its a pretty common view aming historians that the macedonians were not greeks but rather their own thing even contemporaries viewed them as such at best you would have people acknowledging the argead larp about being greeks and argives but that didnt extend to the macedonians even the father of panhellenism isocrates who was trying to flatter philip by acknowledging his greekness and getting him to attack persia and leave greece alone acknowledges his subjects as non hellenes the ancient greeks would probably be disgusted by this modern day greek nationalistic revisionism
  the more common and agreed perspective is that theyre greeks or relatives modern and ancient historians support these perspectives and so does archaeological evidence    granted let us not all derail this alexander circlejerk by discussing macedonian identity
  kek
    bullshit most of these views suddenly popped up as soon as some albobulgars started wewuzing when yugoslavia fell apart not to mention that it all started with titos propaganda historical facts and historical views that pander to certain political and nationalist movements are two very different things
  philipp did rule barbarian tribes though    racially the macedonians were a mix of thracians dorians and illyrians    they did speak greek though and had a greek religion    neither slavs nor modern greeks have a claim on them though      alexander was scum    killed people who opposed hin  started the whole worship a king nonsense  dressed and acted asiatic  destroyed countless cities even greek ones
iskander was turkish
alexander was a powerbottom alexander liked getting fucked
  just one lf many conquerors desu also i dont get why you faggots worship hellenic civilization that much they literally were kiddy diddling faggots and their democracy was just tribal democracy on a larger scale the pagan norse had literally the same system where the leader of each hlusehold could influence big decisions and if you are going to wank about their scientific achievements they stole most of their shit from mesopotamians levantines and egyptians
  hes a war junkie and a shit ruler
  wrong idiot  kiddy diddling faggots  everyone started having sex in those ages anon i know its wierd but that was the norm back then  tribal democracy  it was a complex system intend on supporting even common people  they stole most of their shit  you dont steal these things anon civilizations are like rivers   greeks had plenty of their own achievements
   people who opposed hin  like any ruler   the whole worship a king nonsense  this alone shows how uninformed you are unless you mean started it in the west   and acted asiatic  why is that negative was he going to keep his asian empire together by scorning them   countless cities even greek ones  like any conqueror
  yes he is   
  like any ruler  yes  unless you mean started it in the west  yes  why is that negative  beecause he didnt give a damn about hellas and its culture  like any conqueror  yes
  they did speak greek though  no they didnt only the aristocracy spoke attic and koine common macedonians spoke macedonian which was different enough from greek that translation lexicons had to be created seriously stop
  kid doing a timetrial on a diablo ii speedrun
  neither slavs nor modern greeks have a claim on them though  le faux impartiality tactic  fuck off
  sauce      its still true one is just slavs the other a mix of different peoples    ancient greeks did not reproduce and were outbred by different groups
  t historystealing slav
  sauce  hesychius
  speak greek  share the same greek gods as the other greek states  unite all greeks under one banner and spread greek civilization across the known world  spread greek culture so hard that the roman empire becomes greek speaking  2000 years later some turk/slav on a bhutanese timber conservation forum akshully they werent greek 
  by macedonian do you mean the people from the greek region of macedonia or people from fyrom  because the greek region of macedonia incorporates most of the territories and the two capital cities of ancient macedon whereas the slavs in fyrom appropriate greek symbols and figures and are just straight up larping as macedonians   its pure wewuzzery and its pretty pathetic really    the only real macedonians are the ones in greece people from fyrom are slavs they are neither macedonians nor greeks
  speak greek  they didnt    share the same greek gods as the other greek states  the french and italians share the same god and church theyre different people    unite all greeks under one banner and spread greek civilization across the known world  spread greek culture so hard that the roman empire becomes greekspeaking  the macedonian aristocracy was separate from macedonians proper ancient macedonia had to be hellenized from the top down by its own admission in fact you dont even see references to macedonians speaking koine greek until centuries after alexander died
    youre a fucking retard the only places alexander desteoyed were thebes and tyre and both for good reason thebes for threatening the panhellenist alliance and tyre for giving very stiff resistance persepolis was pillaged symbolically to avenge the destruction of athens by the persians alexander was so lenient in fact that he even allowed civil officials to continue their work as they did under the achamenids and built cities that stand to this very day
alexander was not greek or macedonian he was bvlgar
hes also cute
  the macedonian aristocracy was separate from macedonians proper ancient macedonia had to be hellenized from the top down by its own admission in fact you dont even see references to macedonians speaking koine greek until centuries after alexander died  source your ass
  ionia      all my findings of his show that makedonian was similar to greek
  source  plutarch homer hesychius argead claims to the basileus macedonian diplomatic transcripts before and after alexander roman comments on the region after the conquest shit you can look at the ancient macedonian language page on wiki and see a fuck ton of sources other than the ones ive listed and youll find that macedonians werent greek we dont know exactly what they were but that they werent greek or slavs for that matter is certain       all my findings of his show that makedonian was similar to greek  only for some words and loanwords are not uncommon unless you think english is french or spanish is arabic
  fair point    why are there people like strabon who list them as greeks though
  based
  wrong through the pella curse tablet and other artefacts we know the macedonians spoke a greek dialect    persian cuck
  why are there people like strabon who list them as greeks though  he does its been a while since ive looked at his work but the last i saw he was simply grouping them under hellenistic which is a category built to glue greeks and macedonians together the etymology is too murky with such little surviving evidence to definitively list macedonians firmly in the greek category until after hellenization and the fact they were hellenized should prove they werent greek to begin with    i will say my own personal theory which follows with current historical data is that at some point prior to hellenization the macedonians underwent leadership replacement by greeks it makes the most sense considering what we do know about them      through the pella curse tablet and other artefacts we know the macedonians spoke a greek dialect  the pella curse tablet comes after the hellenization of macedonia though and earlier lexicons show different words used for the same meaning than the tablet
  he killed so many innocent people    fucking animal
  persian cuck  no      he does  yes he says while macedonia is a part of greece he will divide them for his work    as for the rest keep in mind that the argeads did not come on their own and must have had a large doric following that mixed with the locals there    there also plenty of works that lists macedonians and greeks as the same which is also confusing
  earlier evidence also shows greek words/a greek dialect    granted even if we go by your idea that they were hellenised they still became greek and many of them especially the royal family viewed themselves as hellenes
    earlier evidence also shows greek words  shows some greek words potentially loan words we dont actually know    they still became greek and many of them especially the royal family viewed themselves as hellenes  becoming something and being something are two different things
  barbarians arent people anon
  most the words we have are greek actually not including names but other words     and i mean id say macedonians are hellenes and have always been a part of that identity
5740947  this post was so shit you dont even deserve a you
  alexander is the greatest figure in greek and human history  not the literal embodiment of liberalism the father of western civilisation and the true reason everyone from every continent knows of the greeks art and culture  our polity does not copy the laws of neighbouring states we are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves it is called a democracy because not the few but the many govern if we look to the laws they afford equal justice to all in their private differences if to social standing advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit nor again does poverty bar the way if a man is able to serve the state he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition    pericles is the greatest greek statesman and human that ever was or will be
  from the wikipedia page on ancient macedonians    essentially an ancient greek people1 they gradually expanded from their homeland along the haliacmon valley on the northern edge of the greek world absorbing or driving out neighbouring nongreek tribes primarily thracian and illyrian23 they spoke ancient macedonian a language closely related to ancient greek perhaps a dialect although the prestige language of the region was at first attic and then koine greek4 their religious beliefs mirrored those of other greeks following the main deities of the greek pantheon although the macedonians continued archaic burial practices that had ceased in other parts of greece after the 6th century bc     a greek people   out neighbouring nongreeks   a language closesly related to ancient greek perhaps a dialect   language of the region was attic   beliefs mirrored those of the greeks    ouch its not looking so good for those in denial such as yourself the only way they seemed to be different at a face value glance is in how they buried their dead not really groundbreaking stuff     i bet youre the kind of person who thinks that modern day macedonians are a completely separate race from bulgarians
  excuse me but büyük i̇skender was tvrkish
  saying that alexander was just like any other ruler/conqueror kind of suggests he wasnt the best guy ever
  so was jesus christ mohammed the tooth fairy and mary poppins
  great now get out of my fucking sunlight
  anime takes historical figure  dont even attempt to make them resemble the person theyre based on  i fail to see evidence of asians having higher iq
  everyone relevant is turkish  if you look at the dna of famous people the overwhelming majority is early neolithic farmer from anatolia
  never happened alexander was a man of passion and would have fucked executed diogenes on the spot
  and become an oriental despot  thats because his men didnt like him and im sure that they poison him he conquered the persians and then wanted to become the new darius
  propaganda who really believes that alexander used to fought in the first line as any other soldier i dont believe that because in wouldnt be logic imagine that he is killed in some battle then what who is king then i think he hadnt an heir yet
  alexander was a man of passion and considering he died almost certainly as a result of wounds sustained in battle were pretty sure he engaged on the front lines several instances of being wounded personally    alexander was a genius but also believed absolutely that he was a living god with a destiny
  theres a weird 90s scifi take on alexander and his campaigns called reign alexander looks how youd expect except they make him tall and thin as opposed to squat and built with a cute face
  considering he died almost certainly as a result of wounds sustained in battle  what is the source of that     believed absolutely that he was a living god with a destiny  do you think that it was because of the influence of his mother that told him that his father was not philip but zeus and also the influence of the story of the iliad the story of achilles and all of that
  what is the source of that   idk one of the main histories look it up its not like an obscure or controversial position or anything he was wounded several times in battle once at tyre if im not mistaken or another siege    and yeah its partly out of the influence of his mother partly because he was such an overwhelming genius that he built up an ego and an ambition to rule the world
  its always said that he died from mysterious fevers and i have always interpreted it that some of his generals killed him because he was becoming a despot and adopting the persian traditions the fact that he took a wife that was from todays afghanistan i think etc
  i doubt it he was wounded at hydaspes and again later i suspect he either died of those wounds or of malaria
  how far do you think that he could have gone do you think he could have conquered the rest of india china was powerful back then any other powerful kingdom in that region
  do you think he could have conquered the rest of india  probably he could have consolidated his power in the middle east and had an excellent understanding of logistics i think itd be difficult to consolidate his power in india though
  i think itd be difficult to consolidate his power in india though  were the indian kingdoms too powerful to be conquered
  no hed just be overstretched
  were the indians united at that time or they were many kingdoms
  the retard is strong in this one
  yes and when did turks get to anatolia 3000 years later than neolithic times at a minimum
      arrived in anatolia around the 11th century
  no that was because he knew persia was far morw powerful and important than greece politically and economically speaking
  never happened  cringe and bluepilled  alexander was a man of passion and would have fucked executed diogenes on the spot  if he did that then he would have been just a big glorified crybaby that cant handle any harmless banter
  alexander didnt unite the greeks his father did by conquering them and corralling most greek city states into the league of corinth which was essentially a macedonian puppet by this the greeks were forced to go along with philips panhellenic crusade regardless alexander faced two major revolts from the greecd one that led to the destruction of thebes and another when he was away in persia    in fact the persians had much more greeks fighting in their side than alexander accordingly were told these men fought fiercely against the macedonians inciting old racial hatred between the two people and even more telling is that 6000 of darius greeks that made it back greece formed up the bulk of the rebelling army while alexander was away when alexander died he wasnt exalted by the greeks but this energized the greeks into starting the lamian war and restoring the freedom of the greeks that macedon took away even in the hellenic period the macedonians tried to constantly conquer greece away and the romans were involved in iirc five different wars with macedon even evoking the freedom of the greeks at one point    im fairly certain the ancients wouldve cringe in trying to group the conquerors who they rightfully saw as foreigners in the same boat macedon had essentially united the greeks to fight against them much as the persians did under xerxes
  stop trying vladislav you arent macedonian
  so the greeks were the little bitches of the persians and the truly great were the macedonians

in the jewish conspiracy narrative at what point are the jews meant to have taken over the world i have heard early 19th century when the rothschilds became the worlds most important bankers and later dates however people have accused the jews of trying to take over cities and wipe out the christians since medieval times
blacks  british and irish  slavs  latinos    these four groups are arguably the most successful when it comes to combat sports they completely dominate the likes of mma and boxing on an international level    interesting enough 3/4 of these ethnic groups slavs latinos celts all belong to the r haplogroup    what is it that sets apart r1a and r1b men apart from others is it a special inheritable gene did early indoeuropeans sexually select for aggression and physical prowess
  in the top 10 division 5 are europeans descent 3 slavs 1 british and 1 mexican euro irish   4 are western african   and 1 one is mexican  the low division  less than 130 p 17m are all dominated by asians and latinos
    the low division  less than 130 p 17m are all dominated by asians and latinos    of course they are african and european   genetics make it practically impossible for healthy grown men to be the that small
  nations with a lot of casual violence do well what a shocker
  is yamnaya blood and specially the gedrosian component that is absent in the rest of europe except in ireland and russia
  nigger blood
  literally just culture especially when were talking about british black and latino with blacks id hazard a guess that theres something of a physical component they are obviously more explosive on average although less than youd think but the british have had a boxing culture for a long long time and modern boxing has its origins in the london prize ring and that history just never disappears it becomes a case of i box my dad boxed and his dad boxed before him etc etc with blacks and latinos its a case of poverty and necessity and thereafter a culture of being proud of their success and wanting to participate in the further ennoblement of their groups    anything else is just a meme
  what is it that sets apart r1a and r1b men apart from others  what celts and latins tend to be r1b
  what celts and latins tend to be r1b  thats what i said the slavs are r1a western euros and south americans are r1b
  right but most of europe is r theres plenty of r1b in france and plenty of both in germany yet those dont exactly stand out and the latins that do in general are form south america and are mixed as hell  i2b is common in the balkans and i know they have some good fighters too  the caucasus region isnt too shabby either khabib is pretty fucking good and khalidov was top of his class to for a long time khalidov arguably got robbed last night too
what the fuck was his problem with jazz seriously it seems like he has a borderline autistic obsession with it and why did he hate it so much
  he was butthurt because popular music was for chads and fart music was for virgins
  he saw as a modern capitalist/consumerist degenerate culture that he despised
  the jews fear the black bvlls
  hates degenerate culture  literally bitched that he didnt get enough credit for the hippie movement
in defense of adorno and speaking as someone who used to play jazz on the saxaphone a lot of jazz is actually derivative garbage
  jazz used to be the pop music of its time
  writes a few essays about an immensely popular form of music as he was a music theorist and social philosopher  lol why was this dude so obsessed with jazz was he autistic
   bitched that he didnt get enough credit for the hippie movement  implying he wanted any credit for the hippie movement  he called the police on protesters during 68 revolution why the fuck would he support the hippies
  its literally the only thing /lit/ knows about him
evola and adorno discredit jazz because ebul capitalism destroy muh cultur  iis this horseshoe theory
  honestly one of the better examples of horseshoe theory
adorno was a huge promoter of what might be called dissonance in a broad sense he wanted art to be like beckett kafka schoenberg  intentionally painful to consume for the sake of a kind of blackpilling edification he famously after auschwitz writing poetry is barbaric he saw the modern world in a very bleak way thats not altogether incredibly different from reactionaries as has already been hinted at here like any pessimistically inclined modern philosopher he was therefore inclined to art and was a classicist but thought it was no longer possible to make classical art as most important artists at the same time already had for decades so what excited him was the possibility of authors like beckett almost like the enthusiasm nietzsche had in his early days for wagner and the greek tragedy the sublime can become very sacred to the pessimistic philosopher type   then theres jazz which is dissonant but groovy danceable fun if poetry is barbaric after auschwitz how much worse is fun and entertainment yet it took on what he liked he liked  lack of tonal center dissonance in general  for purposes he was against which made profit for the capitalist culture industry

yamna is not even 50 chg more like 40   it makes no sense to imagine yamna as a mix of whg and chg when its biggest single component is ane
  can you explain why every yamnaya sample here is modeled as 70 chg and 30 whg then
  blue isnt whg and ane is senior to whg ehg is 2/3 ane 1/3 whg/chg/dzudzuana mix or something like that and yamna is 60 ehg 40 chg
  blue isnt whg    it literally says whg next to blue and the loschbour man along with other well known european samples that are whg
  it doesnt some retard added it to the pictures he made
  i just doubled checked the original pdf and it still says whg there are you trolling me sir
  its nw eurasian you probably misunderstood something and are confused  whg has more nw eurasian than ane but the component itself is much older than either going back at least 35k years
  youre taking admixture charts too literally and drawing retarded conclusions by your logic ehg would be like 60 whg which is nonsense blue color doesnt indicate whg admixture but a specific eurasian ancestry
  can someone explain the appeal of haplotype autism to me
  its interesting when and why people migrated and how they interacted with locals
  ehg would be like 60 whg which is nonsense  why mesolithic ukraine is more whg than the ehg samples the chg in ehg corresponds to the j haplogroup    the ane is also younger than the haplogroup i samples in western europe which means the whg component simply spread eastwards into far east asia
  probably from contact in south asia where haplogroup i originated
  the ane is also younger than the haplogroup i samples in western europe  not really since ans is from 30k bc haplogroup i1 and i2 hadnt split yet when ansane was formed

favorite marshal of france and why picd is mine perhaps the greatest artillery commander of all time and kept loyal to the emperor until the end unlike the hothead ney skillfully defended himself at his subsequent treason trial was acquitted then retired to lorraine where he spent the rest of his long life d 1834 doing all he could for dispossessed old soldiers and their families more than just this is why drouot is my selection distant second choice is murat because he was just so bad ass
ney
  oui
  peutêtre
  pourriezvous répéter
  unless im mistaken i dont recall drouot ever being marshal only general but i agree that he was great  my favourites napoleonic marshals would be without much originality davout and lannes mention for suchet who is too often forgotten despite being mostly successful in spain and leading to several victories the pitiful armee des alpes in 1815    nonnapoléonic would be franchet despèrey and de lattre de tassigny posthumous title though
lannes
  damn dude i think youre right i was just reading over the names on the arc earlier when the idea came to me to make this thread i guess that sticks me with murat whose character both baffles and appalls me but whose name i always find myself seeking beforehand in the indexes of the books i read i wonder why le sage was never made a marshal proximity to the emperor probably but then theres bessieres   dont get it
  favorite marshal of france  gilles de rais    and why  for his sexual orientation

  if your commie ideology negating the property stuff cant even hold up the basic tenets of classical liberalism then its no form of progress

  classical liberalism doesnt hold up basic tenets of classical liberalism thats why every single strain of communism considers it shit youre going to need write them down
  no people keep forgetting that marx grew the fuck up from his young self who wrote the communist manifest to the old self who helped make the social democrats    older marx  young communist marx
  nep lenin didnt implement some of the things on the list you just posted i was actually just about to post that list myself as evidence against you so ugh thanks i guess
  denunce marx for what lenin did is exagerrated marx works were extremely theoretical and vague so there was much free space for his successors to try how to actually made his idea works  leninism was simple one school among others about how to read marx ideas and how to pratice them leninists ideas worked better than the others so most marxist presumed lenin was the one who understanded marx right    now regarding op question marx was 100 sure china needed a long phase of burgeoise capitalism before developing a strong socialist movement russia at least by his words had the excuse to have near it some strong traditional socialist countries who may helped it skip that phase so he was sure anything communist in china without that phase would have been nothing but traditional asian despotism under a red flag as it is

germans lost
french people are cowards
lots of dead french germans and brits    europe basically committed suicide for nothing
british being mere sidekicks in a francogerman war
  fuck off with that autistic map poland was much more important than krautland until 1700s
  how did the allies perform so badly at the somme despite outnumbering the germans 21
  i disagree poland did alright in the 16th17th century but it didnt compare to the hre       because they still hadnt developed infiltration tactics that would allow them to breach the enemy line and were still using human wave attacks that just resulted in lots of dead attackers they were actually behind the russians in that regard
  hre was an irrelevant and fragmented shithole and was completely insignificant
  why did portugal and hungary get eaten in 1500 in this timeline
worthless war completely ruined europe
      it got worse and worse
  british incompetence
  yep
the eastern front in world war 2 was the large
germany against everyone else with little outside help
  france and britain  everyone
  imagine a battle that involved 10 million men good god
  watch the episode from the great war about this battle  dude constantly talking about the british and barely mentioning the french at all    i mean that channel is great but sometimes the anglocentrism is over the line  4 million men overshadowed by 160000
    martin luther wasnt historically significant
  and only 100 k casualty   well its not really one huge battlemore like clashes along one huge line from the atlantic to somewhere along the ardennes first battle of ypres  i think it shows the half heartedness for everyone at the start of itnobody really wanted to grab each other neck and snap it offà
  the general had french as his name kek
  according to the great war he hated the french and wanted to pull a dunkirk and abandon them but british politicians forced him to stay and fight
  he didnt like the french but was also highly protective of the only army impotent as it may have been the british had and saw in the early successes of the schlieffen plan a sure german victory with the french being in disarray and struggling to put the newly formed 6th army in position to counter the german 1st armies right hook
  yes we know germany k/d ratio was suprisingly good even when outnumbered still it didnt win them the war so who cares
    the biggest reason was that german defenses were really good and the british bombardment was ineffective the british fired a massive number of shells prior to the battle but most were shrapnel shells due to a shortage in high explosive many of the shrapnel shells fired at the german wire had defective fuses and exploded underground instead of on the wire hence why the wire was uncut in many places when they went over the top  nonetheless even with a proper bombardment the british probably would not have broken through as the german defenses simply too good nato generals studied the somme in the early 1970s and found that they would have needed 3 small tactical nuclear weapons to breakthrough the german lines even after the nuclear bombardment they still would have faced some opposition thats how good the germans were dug in   the second reason is technology favored the defender at the time the combination of machine guns barbed wire and trenches were a formidable foe especially for soldiers who were weighed down by around 50 pounds of supplies the wire for communications ended at the front line so there was no way for haig to communicate with his soldiers when they crossed into no mans land other than sophomore flags and holding colorful flags in the middle of no mans land is not the best idea if you want to survive as a result artillery was on a fixed timeline and couldnt adapt to the progress of the soldiers haig couldnt change his tactics effectively as all communications he got from the front were 12 hours late  john keegans the face of battle has a great chapter on the somme that mentions these reasons and more why the british werent able to breakthrough at the somme   adam hochschilds to end all wars does a good job of showing why the technology of the time favored the defender
  location of many of the greatest scientific mathematical economic and cultural achievements of the time period  not relevant    relevance doesnt have to be political the polish golden age was alright culturally but it didnt measure up in terms of science math or economics
  thas has to be the worst map ever published
  dude from hre makes hre fight itself and doesnt do much else  yeah
  won 3 of 4 battles pictured  cowards
  yes
  german soldiers were far superior  allies only one because of overwhelming numbers and material
  hmm sounds to me like the allies were able to effectively exploit their enemies weaknesses and the krauts were unable to adapt doesnt seem too superior
  sounds like it was a dumb idea to fight the world then
  russia too then you remember that britain and france could draw on colonial troops and resources from across the globe germany to keep the austrians propped up and turkey was only useful as a diversion imperial germany was legitimately incredible in wwi
  redditcom/r/historymemes
  ummm  sweetie  
  germanys perfomance in the field was very good thats true but their strategy was terrible the entire springe offensive for instance was just ludendorff creating more and more hardtodefend salients and making the frontline longer while also depleting your own forces
  the entire springe offensive for instance was just ludendorff creating more and more hardtodefend salients and making the frontline longer while also depleting your own forces    he had no choice really he had to attack fast before americans became numerically overwhelming
    this british delusion    so why french had no problem and took all their objectives 
    france is the backbone of the entente side and ww1 would have been lost without their tenacity
  how did the allies perform so badly at the somme despite outnumbering the germans 21  in a nutshell ineffective artillery attacking uphill as were most allied offensives against an enemy theat had around 2 years to fortify
  aryans stronk
  mfw 1914
  but germany could also not stay purely on the defensive as their economy was collapsing and the allied armies were just growing larger and larger with each month and their tactics were becoming ever more sophisticated    so one final massive offensive was really their only choice especially with the entente unwilling to talk about any peace and constantly shifting their focus during that offensive once an attack had run out of steam    their main fault was focusing on winning the war which was not really possible anymore so the kaiserschlacht should have been solely to press the entente into peace negotiations
  true that they had to make a decisive effort and the hundreds of thousands of freshish veteran troops from the eastern front gave them the best window they were going to get but ludendorffs tactics were off remember that he had exclusive experience of the war with russia which was really an entirely different ball game than the vastly technological material tactical strategical logistical and defensive capabilities of france britain and the us they wasted strength and materiel in uncoordinated imprecise hammer blows in the direction of the amiens rail junction using up vital sturmtruppen in miles of deep defensive positions artillery killzones and barbed wire
  vastly  vastly superior
  back to 4chan with you
  this  britain is insanely overrated by ww1 englishspeaking media bf1 movies documentariesetc but when you look at facts its france that carried the western front
  remember that he had exclusive experience of the war with russia  he was in command of the western front since 1916    they wasted strength and materiel in uncoordinated imprecise hammer blows in the direction of the amiens rail junction  but it worked it broke the british and french lines and almost got amiens which maybe might have outflanked the flanders lines    even afterwards they still reached the marne and got into range to target paris
  they might be a bit overrated but just a little many of the main offensives in regards to manpower casualties suffered or losses caused were british from the beginning to the end    the french were carrying the western front in the first two years only
  the high causalities here show contrary to popular belief that trenches saved lives
  trough the war the french inflicted twice as many casualties to the germans as the british did  pic related
  it worked  operation michael was an unequivocal failure to break the stalemate or bring the entente to terms  it broke the weakest point in the line a fractious 5th british army which was reinforced by two french armies reaching the marne only brought them into exposed salients on low wet ground in unprepared defensive positions bombarding paris did nothing but revitalize the cities hatred for the germans
  many of the main offensives in regards to manpower casualties suffered or losses caused were british from the beginning to the end    such as  even the battles the british are the most remembered for such as the somme ypres or amiens all had massive french contribution
  much of the french numbers were at the beginning where the british indeed were the far less relevant entente power on the western front   from 1917 onwards the numbers seem to be similiar    i also somewhat doubt these numbers the french caused over a third more german losses then the british on the somme
  im not arguing your point because its true but passchendaele was a major battle with a minor french contribution
  the french were carrying the western front in the first two years only    id say  19141915  the french carried the front almost singlehandedly due to ridiculously small british numbers  1916  british arrived en mass burden was shared 50/50 between france and britain  1917  brits carrying most of the front while the french were having internal issues  1918  back to french carrying the front but still massive support from the british and at the end by americans
  i also somewhat doubt these numbers the french caused over a third more german losses then the british on the somme    makes sense the french were pretty successful at the somme while the british not so much although it was due to the french having an easier area with advantageous terrain
  hey im not an anglo and im not arguing that the british were more important just that they were equally involved in contrast to say the americans in ww1 or the british during the napoleonic wars
    back to french carrying the front    the kaiserschlacht mostly targeted the british sectors and frontlines  the german failures to either take amiens ypres or arras were all caused by the british though admittedly the french were the first ones to successfully counterattack    the 100 days also seem to be evenly british and french and francoamerican campaigns
  1918  back to french carrying the front but still massive support from the british and at the end by americans    id say 50/50 between french and brits with minor american support  brainlet pershing was obsessed with creating his own independent army with the hope of reaping all the glory by 1919 and thus refused to help the french and brits as much as he should have
  that time pershing tried to remove americans from the front before hamel and half of them told him to get fucked and stayed  based doughboys
  why should americans die for the anglofrench cause and especially since the two were already winning on their own    america should have stayed completely out of the war
  t jewrman
    ww1 was all fought on land on the western front and thats all britain and the commonwealth fought on
  the western front was the main on and thats the one britain is overrated on
    the royal navy stopped the german at the marne and tannenberg
  the french infantry caused the german imperial navy to retreat for the remainder of the war
  german navy  ever relevant at any point in history
  if it wasnt for britain france would have fallen britian is deservedly rated
  secondly largest navy in the world inflicting more losses and tonnage sank towardst the british at jutland  irrelevent navy
  why didnt the grand fleet sail up the seine and marne and block the rivers
  why didnt the grand fleet sail up the seine and marne and block the rivers  that plan is so in seine it may just work
  biggest naval battle in the human history  zero impact on war  based
  if it wasnt for britain france would have fallen    no one said the contrary germany was by far the most powerful nation in that war and none of the allies had a chance alone  doesnt change the fact that france is the allied nation that did the most in that war and thus britain being depicted as the main allied nation in media means britain is overrated    see that as  germany  18  france  8  russia  6  britain  4  usa  2  belgium  1    without britain 4 and russia 6 france 8 would have lost against germany 18 but that doesnt change the fact that france 8  britain 4
  blockade of germany had no impact on the war
  it barely had any
  retard
  1916  british arrived en mass burden was shared 50/50 between france and britain    more like 75/25  the french made for half the allied troops at the somme while at the same time making up for 100 of allied troops at verdun
      the blockade had so little effect germany tried to counter its effects it for no particular reason despite it reducing imports by over 50
  ww1 isnt just about troop numbers
  it mostly was really  sorry if the truth hurts you but the 100000 british troops in 1914 were a sidenote on a front opposing 2 millions frenchmen to 2 millions germans
  no it wasnt ww1 was decided by economic factors france was far from being the main economic power in the entente
  polish patriot sitting in his mud hut detected  stay seething
  no it wasnt ww1 was decided by economic factors    t braindead bongistani  your bloackade was irrelevant see   the reason why germany starved at the end was because they had sent all of their farmers at the front not because of the blockade  the only stuff for which germany relied on importation was coffee cocoa and spices and thats not what fed the country
  economic factors includes far more than just the blockade pierre
      we americans funded the allies the entire time  yall french and british poorfags would have lost without us
  pierres should stop shitting their breeks that anglophone media concentrates on angoocentric stories and ask their own cultural producers why their stories arent being told
  youre ignoring the fact that due to american cultural hegemony french and german media will never be as visible internationally than british ones
  true but without france or russia the war would have been lost too britain contributed the least of all three  muh navy  germany could have built a better navy if they didnt have massive land fronts to cover
  and yet the world is full of francophiles that consume utter shit simply because its in french
  germany literally gave up bacause the anglos starved them  it was frances doing   jean your flag is showing
  germany literally gave up bacause the anglos starved them    why do you keep spouting this lie disproven several times in this very thread
    even indy neidell the englishest of all the englishmen admits that the blockade was useless and had little effects

all the ruthless mad queens of history are from the barbaric far east  really gets that noggin joggin
burns you alive
  of india    she was of kashmir lmao not india
  i dunno what did she do anyway irene was fairly ruthless though in a more politically adept way than brutally if you ignore everything she did to her son
  i only now noticed the twice repeating character in xiao yanyans name 燕燕 yānyān is a precise homophone for the character which means castration 閹 yān in chinese her name when read aloud can literally mean castrate castrate the character in her name 燕 also means the region surrounding beijing if you know what she did and where she did it its an extremely funny pun xiao yanyan was an ethnically uyghurkhitan empress who ruled mongolias khitan liao dynasty for decades as regent for her underage 10 year old son emperpr shengzong after her husband emperor jingzong died she became regent when she was 29 as empress and regent of liao she and her personal army invaded northern song dynasty china and she personally defeated the song chinese army in battle while in china she then chose 100 pretty and good looking han chinese boys whom were all under 10 years old to kidnap from song china she brought the kidnapped boys north to somewhere next to beijing in liao dynasty territory and she had them all castrated to become her eunuch slaves she was a khitanuyghur empress whose name was yānyān and she castrated yān 100 pretty chinese boys in a place right next to beijing which was in yān during her invasion she then forced song china to sign a treaty agreeing that china would pay her country an annual tribute of 100000 taels of silver and 200000 bolts of silk this tribute was paid by song china to khitan liao mongolia for over 110 years and made them wealthy the liao dynasty in mongolia and its successor dynasty in central asia ruled by the same family lasted over 200 years after her death because of her victories when invading china
  must be the environment seeing as there are millions of concubines and all the top bitch wins
  well whats the worst thing cerceis done iirc she burned down a church with greek fire that had many nobles in it if thats the line to cross theres definitely been worse
  the khitan liao dynasty in mongolia practiced arranged marriages between the imperial yelü family and women of the official designated specified consort clans with the xiao surname who were ethnic uyghurkhitan the imperial yelü family and xiao consort clans were all intermarried with each other so they were all ethnically khitanuyghur xiao yanyan and every other xiao empress of the liao dynasty were chosen as the main consort to the yelü emperor with all the other empresses and concubines being secondary xiao yanyan was beautiful and swept floors more thoroughly than her sisters which is the reason why her father the prime minister xiao siwen chose her to become the main empress to marry emperor jingzong instead of her sisters this khitan practice of only having an empress from a designated xiao consort clan is unlike any other dynasty han chinese emperors married women from any family and made them empress mongol emperors intermarried with any mongols and made them empress manchu emperors married any bannerwoman and made them empress xianbei emperors made any concubine into an empress if they could forge a gold statue none of them only made women empresses if they were from a specific consort clan the khitan practice of having an empress from a specific consort clan is like the turkic practice with the imperial family ashina and consort clan ashide and xiongnu imperial family luandi and the two consort clans huyan and xubu

  lu zhi  she then had concubine qis limbs chopped off blinded her by gouging out her eyes cut off her tongue cut off her nose cut off her ears forced her to drink a potion that made her mute made her dumb with toxins and locked her in the pigsty and called her a human swine 人彘 several days after emperor xiaohui saw the human swine and after realising who the human swine was the emperor was so sick of his mothers cruelty that he virtually relinquished his authority and indulged in carnal pleasures     but wu zetian did something similar    and she sent people to cane empress wang and consort xiao 100 times each and cut off their hands and feet she then had them put into large wine jars saying let these two witches be drunk to their bones4 when empress wang was informed the orders she bowed and stated may his imperial majesty live forever and may zhaoyi 昭儀 empress wus title as a concubine implicitly refusing to acknowledge her as empress be favored forever dying is within my responsibility however consort xiao cursed empress wu wu is a treacherous monster may it be that i be reincarnated as a cat and she be reincarnated as a mouse so that i can for ever and ever grab her throat empress wang and consort xiao suffered for several days inside the wine jars before dying and empress wu had their bodies taken out of the jars and beheaded when empress wu heard of consort xiaos curse she forbade the palace personnel from keeping cats as pets but thereafter often dreamed of empress wang and consort xiao with scattered hair and bleeding limbs seeking to kill her she thereafter initially moved to penglai palace 蓬萊宮 but continued to dream of them
  raped to death by chadzombie  dont remember this did it happened in season 7 i stopped watching after season 6
  innocent suitors    yeah reject em
    innocent irish peasants land  yeah burn em
  forever young elizabeth
  6 unella
  iirc she burned down a church with greek fire that had many nobles in it  thats what olga of kiev done got sounds like it plagiarizes history
  got sounds like it plagiarizes history  its history copypasting the series
  got sounds like it plagiarizes history  the author outright said its loosely based on the war of the roses
  makes sense im sure the red wedding is based on something that actually happen remember watching it and thinking that it was pretty neat and shocking yet its toned down to things that actually happen in history
  what i heard is that one of the heroes in the show is a noble who flees to the desert where she recruits abnormally blueeyed savages into a cult of personality she then gets her revenge using them as her army    that should sound familiar to anyone whos heard of dune
  empress wu gave herself ptsd from a torture session that she ordered on someone else lmao    women amirite guise
  like its fine to take some inspiration every now and then but you ought to spice things up the siege of gondor isnt just the turks sieging vienna the fremen vs the harkonnens isnt just the saudis vs the ottomans
  in the tv show she blows the sept the equivalent of a church with wildfire more or less greek fire to kill the high sparrow a religious authority because he made her do a walk of shame and most of the tyrell  family because they one of the woman would become queen and maker cersei son a puppet king    the wildfire doesnt only blows up the sept but ends up killing alot of civilians that were outside
  vandals invading westeros  dothraki are totally not mongols  le viking nation  faith of seven / catholicism guys  ill just change a few letters here and there to be original  not like im going to mention tax policy anyway    grum is a fucking hack
  he never speaks of tax policy
  i cant remember him mentioning it even once in his works
  theres like 2 paragraphs of people talking about littlefingers tax policy i think
  just once though thats not much to brag about i want a book that my accountant friends can get hard about dang it
  why are lannisters so rich and influential  dude like they have a goldmine lol  jesus i remember that one time in history when premyslids were sitting on gold and silver mines and decided to buy their way into imperial crown  it ended really well for them    at least dorne is known to have a lot of fertile lands leading to large population and controlling important trade routes thats why they have fuckhuge army and rich lords  at least this makes sense
  free cities of essos / renaissance italy  valyria isnt the roman empire  the dornish arent middle eastern  westeros isnt literally the uk but flipped complete with house plantagenet house lancaster house york and house tudor whose symbol is a fucking rose  slavers bay isnt the barbary coast  the vale isnt the scottish highlands and the hill people arent the pastoral highlanders  grrm is a genius
  at least dorne is known to have a lot of fertile lands leading to large population and controlling important trade routes thats why they have fuckhuge army and rich lords    do you mean the reach dorne is sandy bois
  yeah correct my mistake
  its ok gurm is still a hack
  the reach  now wait just a minute was the book describing this place released after 2011
while were on the subject of expies of historical peoples and other things in fantasy were all in agreement that the red ship raiders of the farseer trilogy are swarthy vikings right
  tbh this was obvious from the start i mean im sure hes good enough at what he does but i dont believe for a second that he went by george rr martin his whole life he just so happens to have the same syllable count in the same way as tolkien bullshit
  it was jofre who ordered the baratheon bastards slain
  he was born george r martin and took another r when he was confirmed as his catholic name
  undoubtedly after he was already an aspiring author
  i think he was a fan of comic books and fantasy at the time i dont know if he was actually writing much
  asoiaf is pretty much boring warhammer and i dont even like the latter
sunset found her squatting in the grass groaning every stool was looser than the one before and smelled fouler by the time the moon came up she was shitting brown water the more she drank the more she shat but the more she shat the thirstier she grew  men call me darkstar and i am of the night  she wanted to see if it would be as easy with a woman as it had always been with robert ten thousand of your children perished in my palm your grace she thought slipping a third finger into myr whilst you snored i would lick your sons off my face and fingers one by one all those pale sticky princes you claimed your rights my lord but in the darkness i would eat your heirs  she sounds as if she is being gored the queen thought for a moment she let herself imagine that her fingers were a bores tusks ripping the myrish woman apart from groin to throat    people still like this garbage
  its not like warhammer is particularly inventive either
was going to say this 
  bad pusi dabid  bad pusi
  empress xiao yanyans uyghur greatgrandmother shulü ping was also empress dowager of liao before her she was ruthless and efficient and xiao yanyan inherited her ruthlessness after her husband the emperor died empress dowager shulü ping gathered all the wives of her husbands officers and told them they should be widows like her she gathered her husbands officers after that and asked them if they missed the emperor they said yes they missed the emperor she then said if you miss him go see him and she massacred all of them she sent any official and officer who challenged her to her husbands tomb to deliver him a message and had them killed there normally according to khitan tradition before her all widows including the empress were supposed to be killed upon their husbands death and be buried with their husbands shulü ping ended this practice by refusing to be killed and instead reigned as empress dowager she changed the succession from her son the original crown prince yelü bei to her other son yelü deguang making him emperor instead she reigned and made decisions for her son when shulü ping sent one of her husbands officers zhao siwen to die at her husbands tomb he challenged her and said she should follow khitan custom and kill herself since she was closest to her husband shulü ping was impressed but said she needed to stay alive because her son the emperor was weak and she needes to rule she cut off her own hand instead and buried it with her husband shulü ping ending the custom of killing the empress saved her greatgranddaughter xiao yanyan and let her rule shulü ping forced china to cede northern prefectures to the liao from where xiao yanyan launched her invasions of song china liao uyghurkhitan empresses ruled openly for their sons and personally led armies into battle not hiding behind the curtain which han chinese empresses did shulü ping and xiao yanyan each helped stabilize and strengthen the liao dynasty
/his/ doesnt know about frédégonde queen of soissons and franks i guess    missing out also big yeesh
  she caused a widescale massacre of huguenots and no propaganda will change my mind
a better question is is there a queen that wasnt ruthless as fuck to secure power
  if qe2 had anyone killed or even exiled im sure we would know about it by now
  her name when read aloud can literally mean castrate castrate  wew lad
i think its safe to say the caprices of chinese royalty are best appreciated from a distance both physical and temporal and preferably wifh exposure further insulated by the intervening pages of a book
  english queens after the glorious revolution
  brunhilda
  she had the zombie guard that was the mountain rape the nun that interrogated her during her imprisonment by the high septon
  well said everything seems turned up to 11 over there
  youre way underplaying it    she killed the high septon who was actually loved by the poor keep in mind kings landing has a population of 500000    she killed hundreds of nobles from great houses her own family and allied houses the firebomb happened on her public trial finally the sept of baelor is like the sistine chapel and a holy site    zero fucking consequences not one fucking riot and only the tyrell fought back
  so gots realism is actually just edgyness bad guys getting away with the stupidest shit and interesting plotlines and characters getting killed for teh lulz  next level entertainment why are people watching this trash
  empress dowager wu zetian  didnt she actually have the title of emperor
  lucrecia borgia probably    if its george r r martin its safe to bet hes borrowed the concept from renaissence european history
    to see the white girl get blacked
  people have ho no idea how ruling actually works and they think enacting out your most twisted power fantasies makes you an effective ruler
this thread is now dedicated to the rightful king of the seven realms    stannis stannis stannis

  your stannis a shit
  how did the show end
  he was a muslim just like daenerys
    the liao dynasty was a khitan mongolian country and its empresses were ethnically mixed uyghurkhitan two of empress xiao yanyans relatives became empresses for her son emperor shengzong and empress dowagers for her grandson emperor xingzong they were xiao pusage and xiao noujin and they hated each other so xiao pusage tried to get xiao noujins favorite chinese boy eunuch slave executed    empress xiao yanyans niece was empress xiao pusage and she married xiao yanyans son emperor shengzong xiao pusage was a daughter of xiao yanyans younger brother xiao weiyin empress xiao pusage bullied one of the chinese boy eunuchs her aunt xiao yanyan had captured and arranged to be castrated empress xiao noujin was a greatgreatgranddaughter of shulü pings younger brother xiao aghuzhi shulü ping was a great grandmother of xiao yanyan and a greatgreat grandmother of xiao pusage xiao yanyan was also a greatgranddaughter of another brother of shulü ping xiao noujin married emperor shengzong    two of the chinese boys castrated to become eunuchs by xiao yanyan are mentioned by name in the history of liao wang jien was one of the 100 good looking han chinese boys empress xiao yanyan kidnapped when she led the khitan army to invade china and brought north to mongolia to castrate to become her eunuch slaves as he grew up after his castration he was successful in his career as a eunuch for the liao and said to be very bright and intellectual wang learned to speak mongolian khitan in addition to chinese he hated power and corruption and collected a library of books he was a favorite eunuch of the liao court
  the chinese boy zhao anren was also kidnapped and castrated in empress xiao yanyans invasions of china he tried to run away from liao mongolia back to china but was caught and returned he was assigned to be the personal eunuch attendant of empress xiao noujin xiao noujin liked him but she hated empress xiao pusage who was her rival xiao noujin used zhao anren to spy on xiao pusage empress xiao pusage found out about zhao anren spying on her and zhao anren tried to run away and escape back to china again to his family he was caught again zhao anren said he ran away because he missed his mother father and brothers empress xiao pusage wanted to execute him but empress xiao noujin liked him so much and persuaded them not to execute him xiao pusage and xiao noujin both reigned as empresses of emperor shengzong and both became empress dowagers when xiao noujins son emperor xingzong became emperor xiao noujin survived to become grand empress dowager for her grandson emperor daozong    other liao empress dowagers were yaonian yanmujin xiao tali xiao puxiannü xiao tabuyan yelü pusuwan xiao tabuyan executed a jurchen messenger when she was regent
  yaaass quuueeennn slaaayyyy
  they have shit taste
     even though empress xiao noujin was the birth mother of emperor xingzong empress xiao pusage was the primary consort of their husband emperor shengzong so xiao pusage was adopted as the official mother of emperor xingzong xiao noujin was forced to share the title of empress dowager with her rival xiao pusage empress xiao noujins favorite chinese eunuch zhao anren managed domestic service in the liao palace harem for the empresses and concubines the other chinese eunuch wang jien was given similar positions in the palace harem
  she tried to replace him with zhongyuan in 1034
  everu female ruler just no success
      after emperor shengzongs death empress xiao noujin took over as empress dowager empress xiao noujin qinai forced empress xiao pusage rende qitian to commit suicide in 1032 after their husband emperor shengzong died she accused empress xiao pusage of a crime which had her exiled and then sent men to force her to kill herself xiao pusage asked them to let her finish taking a bath before killing herself empress xiao noujin crowned herself the sole empress dowager and tried to have her first son emperor xingzong replace her second son zhongyuan in 1034 xiao pusages niece xiao guanyin xuanyi became empress for her grandson emperor daozong empress xiao noujin was described as having a dark face and wolfish eyes and was ruthless she hated xiao pusage ever since pusage tried to have her eunuch killed    the eunuchs in the liao had no political power of influence over the emperor since they were all boys who were taken as slaves from war raids they were restricted to serving in the palace and harem serving the empresses and concubines doing manual work or helping prepare them sexually for the emperor a song ambassador to liao said empress xiao yanyan had her own boy slave attendants standing next to her when she received ambassadors the same word for boy slave was used in the history of liao to describe the 100 good looking chinese boys she castrated another song ambassador said eunuchs served them food and wine when they came to xiao yanyan
   are totally not mongols  were to be fair they could be some other steppenigger nation like the pechengs
were all these queens/empresses feminists
  india effectively it was after her rule that the muslims overran the hindu kingdom
  empress dowager xiao noujin used her favorite eunuch zhao anren in her plot to replace her first son emperor xingzong with here second son zhongyuan after the plot failed she blamed zhao anren and was exiled but returned and died peacefully nobody was executed over the plot the marriage founding khitan liao emperor yelü abaoji and his uyghur empress shulü ping made all their descendants an ethnically interbred khitanuyghurs the khitan were a people related to mongols living in mongolia and the uyghurs were a turkic people the liao empress dowager had a personal army of 10000 khitan cavalry called an ordo which she personally led into battle and was the basis for their military and political power the eunuchs had no political control or influence over them
  wu zetian was empress dowager before becoming emperor
  eurocucks will never know the simple joy of starting a civil war that kills 50 million people because you got a c on your final exam
  i see people complain about this and im not the hugest fan of game of thrones myself but how are the effects of dysentery supposed to be expressed in a tasteful manner
  tfw stannis dying in the show means stannis will inevitably die in the books  why are we here just to suffer
    xiao yanyan was an ethnically uyghurkhitan empress who ruled mongolias khitan liao dynasty for decades as regent for her underage 10 year old son emperor shengzong after her husband emperor jingzong died she became regent when she was 29 as empress and regent of liao she and her personal army invaded northern song dynasty china and she personally defeated the song chinese army in battle while in china she then chose 100 pretty and good looking han chinese boys whom were all under 10 years old to kidnap from song china she brought the kidnapped boys north to somewhere next to beijing in liao dynasty territory and she had them all castrated to become her eunuch slaves    the reason for the empress choosing the boys for their age and looks was cultural and aesthetic the women preferred pretty and good looking boys and thought castrated boy slaves under 10 years old were innocent so they could use the boys to perform duties with their bodies british diplomat george carter stent wrote this about chinese eunuchs      all eunuchs are considered pure chên 貞 or ching 清 but boys who are made eunuchs when under ten years of age are termed  thoroughly pure tungchên 通貞 these are specially prized and are employed by the ladies of the palace with as much freedom as if they were girls performing such offices as ought only to be done by womensome of them of a nature it would be impossible to describe here these boy eunuchs are supposed to be free from the least licentiousness even in thoughtin fact they are considered to be devoid of all feeling of that kind whatever they are commonly called little eunuchs hsiaotaichien 小太监 as they grow up they are not allowed such freedom of intercourse being replaced by others younger than themselves while they are employed in such duties as do not bring them into the more private apartments of the ladies
                large numbers of young boys were castrated and drafted into the palace where they were especially favored by harem ladies as pets and companions all eunuchs were thought of as pure but those under ten years of age were termed thoroughly pure these were prized by palace ladies and given as much freedom and familiarity as if they were girls and allowed to perform bedroom and bathroom duties of the most intimate nature boy eunuchs were supposedly free of any licentiousness even in thought as they grew older they were replaced by younger eunuchs and given duties outside the ladies quarters        there was a distinction between those who were deprived of their sex in childhood and tose who gave it up in their manhood the latter were called ching or cheng both words meaning pure of body and the former were called tung cheng which meant pure from birth favored by the court ladies the tung cheng had no work assigned to them and behaved like young girls stent hesitates to say what their actual roles were in regard to the ladies and this is left to the readers imagination they were replaced of course by younger ones when they grew older
  implying stannis isnt azor ahai
          there was also a distinction between those who were made eunuchs as boys and those who became eunuchs after sexual maturity some sources suggest that all eunuchs had highpitched feminine voices but in fact men castrated after reaching maturity retained the lower bass voice according to stent all eunuchs were considered pure but boys who were castrated when under ten years of age were regarded as especially pure and were highly prized being employed by the palace ladies to perform intimate duties on the nature of which stent did not elaborate stent 1877 173        eunuchs in imperial china were used for a variety of different roles among these duties was acting as servants in and around the womens quarters of the imperial palace the eunuchs used for this role were almost always young boys who had been purchased from their families and undergone emasculation at a young age while all eunuchs were considered pure these boys were usually less than 10 years of age and considered thoroughly pure these boys were treated almost as girls and were often given duties of bathing and dressing     the next class of eunuchs was the older boys who had graduated from service in the womens quarters when they passed their 10th year the final class was men who had voluntarily undergone castration these eunuchs were seldom allowed inside the womens quarters for fear that they may have retained some vestige of their carnal urges all eunuchs working in the palace were considered the property of a prince or imperial official although they did receive a salary in compensation for their work
    eunuchs like ma he who were castrated before puberty were called tong jing meaning pure from childhood they were especially favored by court ladies and tended to behave like young girls themselves as adults they were said to have shrill unpleasant voices and they were often temperamental and emotional quick to anger and cry
  as was the customyoung sons of prisoners were castratedyoung boys some no more than 9 or 10 years of agewere stripped naked subjected to one brutal stroke of a curved knife that cut off both penis and testes and left with a plug in the urethra were taken to the capital to serve as court eunuchs
    dothraki were inspired by native americans not mongols mongols wore armor all the time they dont kill people for fun or have public sex at weddings mongols had writing dothraki dont wear armor they kill and fuck at weddings there is no dothraki writing pechenegs were like mongols
  nah they werent out to give women rights first and foremost it was to keep power for themselves and their family  cixi was pretty progressive though allowing a american woman to paint her and banning footbinding
  if it wasnt on screen it didnt happen
during the troubles in northern ireland terrorist shootings and bombings were routine those attacks were carried out by heavily trained ideologically committed paramilitary organizations however when you look at the numbers you realize attacks who caused that many deaths were uncommon even devastating car bombs or shooting sprees of which there were hundreds a year rarely left more than a dozen dead which is terrible enough but hear me out    contrast this data with jihadist attacks in europe in our age most of those terrorists are clueless maladjusted juveniles who dont really know much about what they profess to fight for and improvise their killings largely as lone wolves yet every time they carried out a successful attack they managed to slaughter dozens if not 50 madrid paris nice london how come theyre so efficient at killing so many people when professionals like the ira or the uvf never even came close
  because the ira was generally targetting combatants and the uvf was targeting catholics specifically islamic extremists are all about the most bang for their buck no pun intended
  the ira was selective with its target to minimise civilian casualties if isis had planted the bombs in london you can bet they wouldnt call it in to the police to evacuate before detonation and the iras goal was achieving unification and civil rights for catholics not massacring heretics indiscriminately
  because terrorists are political actors that violence isnt random carnage its about compelling some other political unit to change behavior in some way when the terrorist group is too weak to use controlling methods as opposed to coercive ones    the number of people killed doesnt correlate very well to reactions to terrorist strikes the number of people watching and visually aware of blown up buildings and bloody corpses correlated much better quite simply the difference was the ira was a much more professional sort of terrorist group and killed in a more controlled and efficient manner one more likely to yield concessions as opposed to vengeful reprisals
  weapon technology probably plays a role western islamists might be dumb lonewolves they do eventually get access to stateoftheart assault rifle and explosives if they know the right guy beats the iras rustly kalashnikovs and homemade bombs any time of the day

  fucking mongoloid what a degenerant race  japanese soldiers were honorary aryans its different
  still cant blankpost
  germans are honorary japanese
kuso thread story of japanese detainee in soviet union  
  good read
  neck yourself
germans come in   just have beer and midwest to show for it     blacks freed  culture is low brow and brash mostly pernicious trash     italians come in  just mob movies and fattening food    the list goes on and on look at the fighting irish lil caesars pizza this country is just the blended runoffs from european distilled into commercial shit     its especially laughable that there are americans who call themselves conservative or traditional most of the american right wing doesnt care about classical music or marble statues they just want their suburban enclaves which are just open air shopping malls to be kept as they are so they can watch reality and the nfl wear minion tshirts and eat applebees
  the world wears our clothes eats our food listens to our musics and consumes our art you inbred pus sore
  doesnt care about classical music or marble statues  and most euros do
  im american    most of the shit thats universal is lowest common denominator/cheap shit or at best its good by middlebrow standards
  euro conservatives actually have something to conserve that isnt just muh gdp
why do autistic people not understand what culture is
capitalism
  the real answer but many simply cannot go there so theyll resort to conspiracies
  who the fuck cares what you think the people have spoken
  they have no folk culture because they are not united as a people so what is left is pop culture
  like
  it cant be that lowbrow since literally the entire world imports more our culture then viceversa     people in europe consider generic shit like basketball jersies to be the peak of fashion
  actually have something to conserve  such as when i was in europe the radio sounded the same excluding all the lyrics being in a foreign language of course and nearly all the marble statues i saw predated the world wars euro conservatives have nothing to conserve as far as i can see theyve already lost it at this point they like their american counterparts are in a position where the only options are to conserve superficial garbage like in the op or become reactionary
  capitalism in its modern industrial form isnt uniquely american it was jointly developed and exported around the world by the british and the dutch youre going to need another excuse
  the masses opinions have always been worthless   the american culture that gets exported is never the good the stuff its always degenerate shit
im american from the pacific northwest  its relaxed out here honestly and not so nihilistic like the east coast and california can be especially west of the cascades theres something about being surrounded by the beauty of the ocean and the beauty of the mountains on a daily basis that makes me and i think many others forget trivialities like cultural artifacts or traditions   its comfy out here and i feel like this easygoing effect the environment has on people here has been generating a new culture    the cascadia idea exists for a reason    pic related is the mountain i can see from my apartment
  the suit is the pinnacle of european fashion my dear
  stay mad yuropoor
  fight for israel  fight for halliburton  fight for capitalist exploitation
  euro bitches about americansagain  just go to /int/ where you belong
  the modern suit single  double breasted was developed mostly in the united states uk helped
  the masses opinions have always been worthless    the masses have developed most great music and food and a good  of the great literature
  what is it with americans and claiming english culture as though it is your own the english language common law industrial/commercial capitalism and now the suit astounding
  we wuz anglos and sheeeet hahahahahahahaha
  why is america such a cultural desert  the usa itself is younger than the average house in western europe
  what is it with americans and claiming english culture as though it is your own the english language  beling equally to both of us thought you havent made a contribution in over a century  common law  belong equally to both of us and there are probably more descendants of its originators here than over there  industrial/commercial capitalism  country was founded when the most industrious people in britain came to the new world    you can have your suit although i imagine the real elegance was added to it later by continentals and you probably just threw together the two burlap sacks used to cover your wives hideous faces for convenience
      what are you fetal alcohol babies talking about     the modern suit was developed primarily by american mens outfitters in the early 20th century strong cultural linguistic and commercial ties with the uk meant the styles took off there around the same time     for fucks sake the largest department store in the uk in that time period of owned by an american
  the usa itself is younger than the average house in western europe    the us was founded in 1946
  kek
  call me back when eurofags make jazz or blues that arent garbage
  american education
  why the fuck do only americans get shit for this    australia and canada are equally bad canada is probably even worse if you discount quebec
oi we bongs dun invented duh modehn soot wedidwedid oi sweh on me mum  lolno some englishman who was somehow gay enough to stand out even in bongland stole some continental styles and now bongs pretend he invented the modern suit     its kind of like how they have to pretend wellington was greater than napoleon lol
most of the american right wing doesnt care about classical music or marble statues   for one i bet the average european doesnt either and more importantly why should they american art and musical forms are more prevalent in todays world and thats the shit that everyone else is listening to
  american art and musical forms are more prevalent in todays world and thats the shit  i mean yeah europoors are cultureless tards who have to larp as their ancestors to affect sophistication but that doesnt mean blues and jazz arent worthless compared with the waldstein sonata
  so what hogswarts house were you in
  but that doesnt mean blues and jazz arent worthless compared with the waldstein sonata    castrate yourself please
  that doesnt mean blues and jazz arent worthless compared with the waldstein sonata  worthless how in complexity or sophistication they still have some worth especially since music isnt all about that anyway i can appreciate all the fine tuned skills and craftsmanship that go into creating and playing a piece of classical music but that doesnt mean i or most people wouldnt rather listen to something else most of the time and sure america doesnt have as rich a tradition of composers but that doesnt mean we dont have them or that there arent people here that enjoy that type of music
wait do americans actually really believe they invented the suit is this what they teach you i thought it was a joke desu
  you dont care about classical music and you only listen to it to see how far you can shove your arm up your ass
  to be fair they probably have as much a claim to it as you do since your idea of inventing the suit is letting the breeches down all the way
      sorry nothing in jazz even remotely approaches the best classical a good melody is worth any number of expressionistic noises in succession
  australia and canada are american colonies
  hahahahahaha we wuz england
  france invented the suit
  hahahahahaha we wuz england  sorry but not even our blacks would condescend to larp as you people
  inferior countries trying to bring the bantz
  french invented it     the modern styles developed in the us and uk
  inferior countries trying to bring the bantz  glad to see you bong finally developed a sense of selfawareness
oh god the francoids are awake
  was that graph created in an alternate dimension where the spanish empire did not exist
  france invented england
  jazz is ooga booga shit
  we wuz æthelstan and sheeet
  hollywood silicon valley most video games and famous musician superstars blue jeans and fast food like hamburgers american culture is the most dominant in the world culture isnt only meme traditional dresses
  /thread
  norway is adorable
invented suits  invented all modern music genres   invented everything useful  invented natural rights  invented the best system of government in the world  created a new lingua franca    u r welcome
  why the fuck are we arguing about the suit  if it was something like the kilt then yeah it would be autistic for anyone outside scotland or ireland or wales to claim it but the fucking suit
  invented natural rights  thats not how natural rights work you twit   invented everything useful  best system of government in the world   the us political system is considered a latin american tier shitshow by first world standards there is a reason why japan australia norway sweden netherlands belgium canada etc all use westminster style governments only france is a relevant first world country that uses a system similarish to the usa    the swiss government is objectively the best in the world when it comes to freedom stability democracy and good responsible government but maybe it works for them because the iq of the swiss voter is higher than that of the us congress and population
  whats the difference both are considered the national dress of england and scotland respectively one just happened to be adopted by the entire planet as business/formal attire
  lol
the us is such a huge country geographically and demographically so theres a lot of different cultures across the country there are some common traits that generally apply to american cultures across the board but theres just so much variation between subcultures and regional cultures that it appears we dont have a national identity
  yeah i actually cant name any composers sculptors authors or scientists from australia
what would be wrong with this they were made in mockery of capitalism but ended up being contrasted with the federations quasicommunist society    the world is full of shit anyway might as well get ordinary people to wise up and learn to play the game
i think its funny that they are supposed to be capitalists but with the very obvious facial featureears and the hoarding goldgold pressed latinum they seem more like jewish stereotypes
  the jew stereotype is based on capitalism  
  slavoj ever being a good source  trash
  the sad part about the series is that the ferengi way of life is going to become more like the federation ultimately this is what makes star trek actually horrible
  even genes writers and friends seemed to think he thoughts on economics made no sense whenever the subject of how exactly it worked came up it was simply glossed over     the ferengi are pretty much a free market straw men despite the fact the ferengi are not free market at all but are controlled by a single mega corporation
  all we know is that latinum is valuable in the galaxy and there is some sort of credit systemi think with the federation what wouldve worked so much better would be that the federation doing some sort of financial trademake up some bs about some precious metals or something that cant be replicated with hologramsor really anything that can give a picture as to how they have some sort of money even soviet russia had money that people earned
  currency no longer exists  everyone works for no profit insensitive since they all have replicators  replicators require dilithiun crystal  dilithium crystals are rare and can only be mined in certain regions that interplanetary polities war over   dilithium crystals are the new currency     its as stupid as most communist utopian fantasies if everyone works for the love of the job who would choose to mop up shit and cum
  gene insisted there was no credit system
  dilithium is used for military applications in terms of the necessities of life there is enormous abundance    part of star trek is the burden of the arms race 2 states can either strain to build up a military to offset the power of the other or agree not to fight and not have to bother kind of like the prisoners dilemma dilithium was kind of the placeholder for war resources
  interstellar states went to war for access to dilithium expanding the tribe to a cluster of stars is no different than a region in a planet
  why didnt they just make more dilithium with the replicators
  because thats like using batteries to recharge batteries
  if they devoted as many resources to improving the efficiency of the replicator then they could have achieved a net gain at some point instead the warmongers in the federation just pumped more and more money into their military
  space jews
  the law of the conservation of energy generally applies in the star trek universe
why did the fbi do something so controversial yet so brave    seriously though my impression was that the fbi was a corrupt turd yet here they were only 7 years out from cointelpro with their horrifying corruption in boston going on yet doing this    why did the fbi do the right thing
  the fbi has always been dogshit hoover used it to blackmail politicians up until he died
  so why did they do this good thing im genuinely puzzled   its like they pulled back on illegally destroying the lives of everyone destabilising american society for good or ill while taking massive bribes from organised crime and did something good
  well that could be it the fbi was angry at congress for not allowing it to be as extralegal and corrupt as they wanted
is there a law of attraction  do we build our lives by our thoughts  share some experiences
  believing in this newage gaiatier pseudoscience garbage
  believing in this newage gaiatier pseudoscience garbage    lol
hbo comes to you and demands you make a ten episode miniseries it must be about a war as exciting important and crazy as wwii with a ton of subplots about disparate factions allying together and all of that include a racially diverse array of soldiers and have at least one romantic subplot involving a woman in a fancy dress but the rest is up to you what war do you use
  what war do you use    second punic war
roman sassanid war    it would dethrone the sopranos
  alternate history ww1 of germany and russia vs britain france austrohungary and ottomans
  pic related probably   i wrote out an idea for a ww1 series not a miniseries for /tv/ once and it got like no replies    part 1  season 1 1914 would start with the delivery of a newspaper clipping to the serbian terrorists in the belgrade cafe showing that archduke franz ferdinand is coming to sarajevo first episode focuses on the plotting and carrying out of the assassination ending with ferdinands death second episode deals with the immediate aftermath the cautious political tensions introductions of some of the main political characters i foresee a major political character for each country ends with the mobilization of germany and the declaration of war against serbia from ah the rest of season 1 follows the guns of auguststructure with the attacks of serbia east prussia and belgium season 1 finale part 1 depicts the battle of the marne and the entrance of turkey into the war part 2 shows the introduction of trench warfare and the christmas truces  season 2 1915 starts with the first zeppelin raid on britain the rest of season 2 deals mostly with the gallipoli campaign however although it also focuses on austriahungary and germany in the eastern front and the crushing of serbia also shows the first gas attack at the second battle of ypres season 2 also introduces woodrow wilson as a character and his relation to the recent german sinking of the lusitania season 2 ends with the pulling out of gallipoli and winston churchill being sacked last scene is him crying as he leaves his office

wars between noneuropean people is an untapped market
  the middle ages are chock full of that shit politics was basically an endless mafia war series you could make dozens of seasons of actionpacked content just from say the english power struggles between the anarchy and the hundred years war  and england was positively boring by the standards of the time imagine a series about the anarchy the whole king john vs barons struggle the second barons war the welsg and scottish wars the downfall of edward ii etc shits better than game of thrones without having to make anything up    thats without even going into major arcs like the hyw the wars of the roses the guelph and ghibbeline wars all the crusades including ones against heretics and in the north the wars in iberia power struggles in the hre the mongol invasions the rise of the ottomans etc theres basically an endless well of content ready to be adapted into tv shows
  does somebody has the other greentext about the congo wars
  where do italy and the usa fit in
  youd honestly need more about the usa to get it funded
is he the most wellknown person in history
  i believe so but jesus mohamed and buddha might be more famous idk
  those three are certainly more famous than hitler theres plenty of isolated parts of the world that know about at least one of those three but not hitler
tekashi69 is more well known than hitler
  yeah huge parts of east asia and subsaharan africa know very little about hitler
the real question is why did he want to bone his niece so badly
  thats not alexander the great
  im sick of hitler posts can you just discuss something less resent and less annoying to talk about
  hitler is pretty huge in east asia dont know about subsaharan africa but i feel like buddha would not be well known
  i dont see any evidence he did he wanted to keep an eye on them so they wouldnt embarrass him politically
  buddha  hes not comparable to the other two up until i was like 16 i thought buddha was just a statue of like a mystical being not a real person
  jesus and mohammed are the most famous people to ever live   god famous tier  jesus  mohammed  great famous tier  caesar  alexander  napoleon  good famous tier  genghis khan  hitler  stalin  ok famous tier  jfk  for  churchill  king george  gandhi  nelson mandela  local famous tier  george washington  etc
  fdr is more famous internationally than washington  alexander is more famous than hitler  full retard
  at this point in time yes
  
  alexander is more famous than hitler you pathetic excuse of a human being
  never go full retard
  not even remotely close  caesar and jesus yes    hitlers become an online meme in the schizophrenic society we have inhabited since 20112013 or so only since then u see this huge fucking forced ramp up in hitler being mentioned in an online anonymous forum by mindcontrolled or whatever otherwise damaged retards making threads like this shit trying to push this
  hitler hasnt been a continuous staple of cheap fiction since 70 years  ok
  not among people who are currently alive
   yes among people who are alive   they live in countries where cities are named after him   he is in the quran or at least a similar person so all muslims know of him   just because this form is a ww2 general doesnt mean the rest of the world is
  jackie chan
  not even close not in my strata
why do so many biblical stories get bowdlerized so badly to stick to just one famous example everyone knows the story about solomon and offering to split the baby to smoke out the real mother very few people realize that the original passage is quite explicit that these are two prostitutes    why do bible editors feel a need to fix what are supposedly sacred texts
  write ur own
  doesnt matter because it never happened
dont you think of your ever wonder why most rulers i was thought is bad and that they dellusion of having a great society is gone the great arent great if they should never have gave there title when they have done bs in there lifetime
i mean seriously some of the things that shitzeo abes cronys say is cartoonishly racist
east africa used to be the most developed and civilized part of subsaharan africa now its one of the worst parts what went wrong
  its not that anything went wrong its just that nothing went right
  the ancient aryans abandoned it when they migrated back to thule
  why do alt righters presuppose that everything around the world throughout history would be identical
  aryans created nothing dipshit      terrorism and the overthrow of government ethiopia seemed fine in the 70s and even before that until they overthrow halie selassie and the royal family think of it as russia russia was once ruled by the royal family then was overthrown and became a shithole
  trying to make somalia into a nationstate instead of a collection of principalities like uae  putting coastal swahilis together in the same country with inland subhumans  ejecting based oman from its colonies  ethiopia genuinely fucked themselves up and deserve it
nigger aryans
      in fact the symbol of the true swastika goes back over 11000 years and is believed to have originated in the harappan period and the culture of the indus valley civilization
  thats a fake my mate ive gone there before that swastika they are referencing is like from 2000 bc or so
  heres the oldes swastika i got 50006000 bc pre ie east europe
  oh and the 11000 year old swastika is not considered such by many but just a decorative pattern that accidentally descrives a swastika pic related
  aryans created the computer youre using
  its doing decent though
  the electronic computer was invented by a bulgarian and bulgarians arent white
  i have korean computer
  putting coastal swahilis together in the same country with inland subhumans  why seperate negroids from other negroidspic related
west africa was better ethiopians hid in their mountains herding goats
  what went wrong  decades of war also despite this it is still one of the most developed and advanced parts of sub saharan africa
  because one group of negroids lived in developed cities practiced islam and built their own civilization of seafarers and merchants the other group were literally just human cattle periodically being enslaved by swahilis to be traded for currency and commodities they lived in small shitty villages practiced their shitty tribal religion and lived off of subsistence agriculture/hunting like the unaccomplished unwashed vermin they were it was 2 different worlds uniting them on the basis of both being negroids is like uniting swedes with albanians its cruel and unusual punishment
  who /ethioboo/ here
  can you not be such a cunt      ejecting based oman from its colonies    they werent based at all
  somali pls    how was he a cunt are you new here
  can you not be such a cunt  he has a point people are quick to say uh sweaty blacks were civilized and point to the tiny fraction of blacks who lived in cities this is exactly like saying uh sweaty iron age grms were civilized and pointing to the existence of roman and greek cities
  hahahahaha     ethiopia is the 38th out of 53 countries in africa according to hdi
  the overwhelming majority of humans lived in simple villages until about 1950
  sure but there is a huge difference between the villagers of say the 14th century hre and the villagers of bantu africa at the time of european first contact
  can you not be such a cunt  everything i said is true the swahili developed and possessed a decent capable civilization while the inland retards were just random tribal rabble im willing to bet that youre an american or some other new worlder    an east african seaboard assisted by omani influence was the only alternative to one fucked up and stifled by western european colonization the cosmopolitan swahili coast belongs to the world of the indian ocean not the backwards and savage world of inland central africa
  such as
  i smell a schizophrenic somalian too big for his diaper
  read a book
  an east african seaboard assisted by omani influence was the only alternative to one fucked up and stifled by western european colonization the cosmopolitan swahili coast belongs to the world of the indian ocean not the backwards and savage world of inland central africa    dude the omani literally took a fuckton of swahili land on the coast after it came it to force out the portuguese most land on the swahili coast isnt even owned by swahili but european/omani/south asian absentee landlords
  thats never a real response
  for the exact same reason that sicily went from being the richest kingdom in europe to one of its poorest and most desolate provinces the economy changed    ancient and medieval ethiopia eritrea and to a lesser extent somalia were an enormously significant civilizational crossroads that oversaw trade across the indian ocean its known as the maritime silk road traders of arab indian and native african descent descent ships ivory spices and slaves between most parts of the old world the most important regions in east africa at the time were these trade centers like mogadishu or zanzibar there was a huge arab and indian influence in all these places    as the middle ages progressed into the early modern period we saw the development of a transnational sunni muslim seafaring culture across the modernday countries of kenya tanzania and mozambique that spoke the swahili language and helped bring foreign trade goods into other parts of africa the arab world and even europe    then colonialism happened the portuguese and then the dutch very quickly took control of existing resource markets because their ships guns and seafaring technology could much more easily transport spices from southeast asia to the rest of the world while the portuguese and dutch trade networks and centuries later the british trade networks relied heavily on the descendants of these african and arab traders who had previously controlled the market overtime these countries and their people lost economic prominence by the time of the italian colonial adventure when they pressed into east africa basically only for prestige there wasnt much wealth left in this part of the world the mercantile cash that had previously flown into the ports of zanzibar mogadishu and dar es salaam was now the income of the european bourgeoisie     now that were living in the age of air transit free trade and the modern ocean liner its unlikely that this wealth will ever return
  im not here to educate you if you honestly dont understand the difference between a highly organized and literate society and a literal tribe living in ignorance and savagery then you unironically need to read a book
  leftism
  no thats completely untrue without question 1000 years ago you would much rather live in an east african city then in ireland iceland or scotland    these places had a similar level of development to southern europe and the middle east there was just not much of interest once you took a couple days trip into the country
  when was sicily the richest kingdom in europe do you mean like in the ancient world or something
  there was a difference less literacy fewer metal tools no major infrastructure and a farther proximity from urban civilization but you are greatly overrating the development of medieval rural germany     a german subsistence farmer and a yoruba subsidence farmer in 1300 ad had far more in common with each other in terms of education technology and spirituality than they do with modern people today a thousand years prior i dont know if there would be any recognizable difference between the development of those societies ancient germans probably had better metallurgy than ancient africans but not by much
  in 300ad there was not much difference agreed by 1300 the difference was huge by 1800 when europeans began to make extensive contact with black africa they might as well have been from another planet
  around 1100 ad sicily probably had the highest development of any european country i dont know much about sicilian history but from what i understand in both the arab and norman periods the island was the biggest mediterranean trade hub and distributed all kinds of goods to france italy egypt the middle east and the balkans    absolutely call me soon really exist before the early modern period and the vast majority of sicilians were still poor peasants but a noticeably greater amount of wealth flowed through sicily than anywhere on the european continent    look at the famous norman chapel in palermo circa 1100 i dont think kings are merchants anywhere else in europe except byzantium were able to find these kinds of projects
  such as
  the average german villager couldnt read
  interesting i never realized norman sicily was that developed
  by 1800 absolutely no question but extensive contact between west african peoples and european peoples happened much earlier were talking middle 15th century in 1300 though not so much    by modern standards medieval germany was incredibly poor and rural the only education happens to the church and this was only available to the clergy aristocrats and successful merchants jews in the evil times were famous for their literacy but even in the jewish community most adults couldnt read a word     now lets compare to west africa in this period there was a fair amount of literacy especially when you get up into the sahara but this was all under the purview of islamic scholars royal households and maybe some lucky merchants there were some sizable cities in medieval west africa but they were fewer in number then what you saw in northern europe the region also had a far more inhospitable terrain which meant african subsistence farming communities were far more isolated were far more isolated from cities and each other
  west africans were producing superior steel to europeans on the eve of colonization
  low iq
  because historically race has had very little to do with development     urban african maritime merchants  norwegian rock farmers by a lot
  im skeptical of that whats your source
  because   muh political narrative     its like those retards claiming west africans are arabs
  
  it had more to do with material the burned to make it
  myth    read a book    now lets compare to west africa in this period there was a fair amount of literacy  what yeah no  communities were far more isolated  im not saying why europe was so much more developed only that it objectively was even by 1300 the difference even between the a european subsistence peasant and his african equivalent was significant even if you ignore the absolute chasm between a european urban elite and his west african equivalent
  your own source mentions nothing about steel it only says iron working was valued in the kongo well no shit that is true of every primitive iron age society
  what yeah no  mandinkas hausas kanembu songhai soninke and peul aristocrats were well versed in the arabic script even using it to relay their own languages   im not saying why europe was so much more developed only that it objectively was  explain what would make a bavarian village in 1300 ad different from a mandinka village in 1300 ad
  mandinkas hausas kanembu songhai soninke and peul aristocrats were well versed in the arabic script even using it to relay their own languages  okay so you think that means their society was more literate than europe
  lol once again the goalposts shift
  hurr  yeah fuck you retard
  yeah im the retard for not backpedaling and deflecting when i get proven wrong
  hurr  youre a retard for being a mendacious sack of shit fuck you
  you got problems
  and youve got no brain fuck you
  imagine wasting your life like this
  he says posting on 4chan  fuck you retard
  steel is iron
  hurr  yes clearly thats what you meant when you said they had superior steel technology that they had basic ironworking on a par with europe 2000 years earlier fuck you retard
  it has black people
  basic iron    lol
  would rather live among nogs  no
  lol indeed you dimwitted faggot the kongoese had nothing that was more advanced than the iron age celts
  yes clearly thats what you meant when you said they had superior steel technology that they had basic ironworking on a par with europe 2000 years earlier fuck you retard    they would use the slag produced from previous uses to purify the iron reducing its phosphorus content to lower percentages then what was found in european iron at the time     yelling fuck you isnt a argument
  i thought horn africans were actually cacasian
  no
  but their skull shapes
  they have heavy eurasian admixture from backmigrations    the /pol/fag is correct the celts of antiquity were actually quite advanced socially and technically and would have almost certainly been less animalistic than west africans additionally a larger percentage of the population likely would have been worth interacting with than niggynogs
  they dont look subsaharan
  oh wow they reused iron incredible just like iron age europeans circa 1000 bc only 2000 years later wow so advance such progress    fuck you retard
  oh wow they reused iron incredible just like iron age europeans circa 1000 bc only 2000 years later wow so advance such progress    fuck you retard    why are you so butthurt anon
  but their iq scores
  stupid
  the medieval world was just so different man there was no such thing as a national economy so the vast majority of people in europe and asia were subsistence farmers who gave a portion of their crop to their feudal liege     the only people outside of this system besides hunter gatherers were the tiny minority of townspeople who managed the transfer of certain valued products from one group of nobility to another far away these places were usually beacons of lay literacy especially in the islamic world but their inhabitants had so little power compared to business people today the wealthiest businessman in the middle ages was still a middleman and could have a lifetime of wealth seized from him the minute his feudal liege decided it prudent
  then was overthrown and became a shithole  it became a shithole after the commies were overthrown
  cannons bacteria and iron
what do you think of this war  who was right
aesthetic thread
east med  late antiquity  peak aesthetics
how much would history change if japan never existed its first major contribution to world history seems to be the russojapanese war am i right
no nanjing rape    no anime
  france created anime
hey yall im doing an alternate history thing with some of my friends and i had the idea of a group of communist revolutionaries and a minor royal family teaming up to usurp power from the reigning family and installing some sort of socialist constitutional monarchy yeah i know a communist allying with an aristocrat is absurd and all but people tend to care more about power than ideology anyways so i was wondering before i start building a country from the ground up and go through that whole mess was there something like this in actual history obviously it would be a very small thing but if theres anywhere where this happened or at least people thought it might happen rumors propositions etc thatd be really useful thanks
  there was a i think german thinker who thought that a socialist constitutional monarchy would be the ideal form of government you could look at what he had to say
  im not talking about spengler or some nazi this guy was super obscure
  i looked up socialist constitutional monarchy and just got grenada which doesnt really count imo
  the mladorossi who were supported by the the romanov pretender wanted to restore the tsardom but keep communism
  ill try and find him but it might take a while
  rodbertus was the guys name theres a section on him in the book the socialist tradition moses to lenin and you might be able to find something he wrote originally
post things that instantly prove someone is a historical illiterate     nazi germany would have won the war if they got insert wunderwaffe project here working  nazi germany could have won at all once the soviets and americans were both in the war  the confederacy was leaving over states rights  ww1 germany were proto nazis and totally evil  sub saharan africa was all just tribes  longbows can punch straight through plate
us won the wars in korea and vietnam
  the media was to blame for losing the vietnam war
stalin and mao were a bad men
stalin and mao were good men
  the communist won the korean war
  no thought of their own
  lol theres no way they gassed 6 million jews
    the vietnam war was unwinnable
real marxism has never been tried what they pass for communism is an antimarxist conspiracy
  the vietnam war was winnable while staying in the south and supporting unpopular dictators
  china won the most then south korea / un basically had status quo and north korea lost the most    korean war was weird
 rhodesia was bad   fall of the roman empire was good   native americans were peaceful
  if hitlers generals obeyed him and focused on army group south they could likely take the oil fields and win the war i wouldnt count it out
  the confederates were the good guys
  says something edgy    says something contrarian    injects talk gadio garbage into historical topics
  the holodomor was an intentional genocide by stalin  ukranian is a seperate ethnic identity
   before columbus everyone thought the earth was flat   the industrial era made poor people   it wasnt real communism
every death due to famine is really joey steel murdering them in cold blood communism is magic
  focusing exclusively on military history
a lot of lefties seething in here
 brazilian republic is legitimate
britain invented the concentration camp  american english to closer to shakespeares english than british english  kurdistan should have independence  the ancient greeks were pederasts  it was a jew who invented fish and chips
nazis gassed and cremated 6 million jews in death camps
  why is this board obsessed with shitting on germany    dont you get bored of it after a while
  reaction to the years of circlejerking over german military history during ww2 and a rise in autistic nazi teenagers    its mostly just banter to trigger people and it always works
    low hanging fruit
  it does always work and ill admit i did it for a while too but now i realize how unhealthy it is for the board      its much more fun to take it directly to /pol/
hitler was just fighting against the globalists and bankers    still waiting to hear why he captures four 4 rothschilds alive let two of them go and the only one to die married into the wine producing arm of the family and died of disease a few weeks before the war ended after being held for 4 years
  i only do it in threads where there is already a strong wehraboo presence i dont believe in starting or derailing threads with it though
  wait so youre saying hitler didnt kill the jews im confused because in every other thread you swear the haavara agreement didnt exist
   confederacy was leaving over states rights  how is this a question hey left for like half a dozen reasons each they literally wrote papersbooks and literal explanations addressed to the union for why it was telling the other states to screw off   can punch straight through plate  kind of depends on quality there you could easily say it could through poorly made plate of lesser materials
if x only did y then z
  germans in czechoslovakia/poland preww2 were opressed
  who claims that
  how on earth would they be able to supply that attack let alone take the caucases which were extreme mountain regions littered with rivers and other impassable terrain    based
nazi germany could ever have won ww2 after 1935
  we must contain communism  prevents it from taking over south korea    sounds like a win to me
  tried to take whole peninsula  pushed out by chinks  war ends where it began    it was a stalemate for the us it could have been a victory if macarthur had decided to not be dumb and go push past the 38th parallel     china was the only country that achieved all of its wartime objectives albeit at a terrible cost and it hasnt really paid off for them in the long run
    im saying he had 4 members of a prominent jewish international banking family in his grasp and did nothing to them
  tried to take whole peninsula  that wasnt the intended goal though that was macarthurs autism
germany couldnt have won if either the soviets or americans individually were in the war much less both
  yeah but he was the guy in charge and allowed for mission creep its basically all his fault the un didnt have a sweeping victory
  i mean to be fair op clarifies ww1 germans werent proto nazis and that thats a brainlet opinion so its less antigerman posting and more antinazi germany posting
    macarthur should have been sacked as soon as un forces crossed the 38th parallel
iii reich would survive more than 5 years without economic collapse if it somehow managed to win the war
  nazis would have won if they got the ultimate wunderwaffen the atomic bomb
   can punch straight through plate  but this is true frog boy
  umm sweetie do you even watch deadliest warrior
the holocaust happened
  nazi germany could have won the war period
  trips of truth    the uk too
  excellent work heres your you
  thats cause he was a puppet the instigators of every revolution or new idea are always eaten up or changed once the idea has been jacked
  america singlehandedly defeated the british and won their independence
  mansteinpilled not sure about based though
    opposing the meiji restoration  japan could have beaten america  japan were the good guys
  the us maintained the independence of south korea how is that not a win the usa didnt even want to have a unified korea thats why the sks were so poorly equipped
  good and evil teams  literally the defenition of historical illiteracy
    germany could never have beaten the us for a variety of reasons  for instance the atom bomb but they surely could have defeated the soviets had they not received support from the us
  moral judgement is not anathema to history the important thing is to make sure no opinion or ideology causes deliberate muddling of facts or disingenuously revising the historical record
  the irish were treated as nonwhite citizens
  sub saharan africa was all just tribes    it was though just because they have a king doesnt mean their society isnt primitive and tribal
  the important thing is to make sure no opinion or ideology causes deliberate muddling of facts  even nondeliberate muddling of facts is acceptable it is impossible to write completely objectively but one should try not to judge and write facts and own thoughts separately
lincoln was gonna send the slaves to africa  liberia is a black american ethnostate
  socialism just doesnt work  projecting the moral concept of good or evil onto states as if anyone has ever selfdefined as evil or that its a useful way to talk about history  marxist history is inherently not valuable because it is marxist   yeah im into historyknows nothing but wars and generals last names  the soviets could have won the war solo  wouldnt it be cool to live in x
  based  turns out having your economy stay afloat by seizing the reserves of captured territory is not sustainable long term
  there were civilizations in west africa on the niger river its fair to say black africa outside the niger valley was just tribal tho or to say bantu africa was nothing but primitive tribes
  the katana was a terrible sword  people in the middle ages died at 30  people in the middle ages were short  spears are better than longswords 1 on 1  the nazis are uniquely evil and worse than any other group ever
  they got quite near despite fucking it up pretty badly i dont think it is very likely they would have won but given the dismal performance of the red army in the sector it is not strictly impossible then again if the main push had been towards the south in 41 stalin mightve focused on that sector more and so on alternate history is crapshoot
  north invaded the south us and un intervened to stop them they tried going north at some point sure but the basic objective of the war was achieved the north invaded and failed to achieve its objectives    by any impartial judgement korea was a un victory a costly one sure and it failed some secondary goals also true but the primary objective was met if you dont acknowledge this youre pretty deep up your own ass
  sub saharan africa was all just tribes    except thats true
  except it isnt there were moreorless sophisticated urban civilizations in the niger river valley and ethiopia is technically subsaharan tho ofc i understand that when people say subsaharan they actually mean negro
   the us maintained the independence of south korea how is that not a win    because the us lost 34000 dead and left nkorea to the communists and now the norks have nukes     the usa didnt even want to have a unified korea    no the plan evolved and changed literally as the fighting was going on the initial plan was simply to repel the communists from skorea then it was liberate the entire korean peninsula then after truman fucked up it became protect skorea from the communists     thats why the sks were so poorly equipped    no its because trumans administration ie fdrs administration was woefully out of its depth when it came to foreign policy in addition to being infested with communists and preposterously thought the us could fight and win a global war while propping up the ussr and somehow everything would simply be fine afterward and made zero effort to prepare for what was actually to come
  lol theres no way they gassed 6 million jews    a far less than 6 million jews were killed  b most of those who did die didnt die in camps  c most died due to warfare starvation and disease
  it was a jew who invented fish and chips    that one pisses me off to no end and not only is the claim that the jews invented fish and chips but that jews literally introduced fried fish to britain
  muh lend lease  no
  why is this board obsessed with shitting on germany    this board isnt but every year another batch of 12 year olds discover 4chan and start posting nazi lies and we _again_ have to set them straight
  it could have been a victory if macarthur    it was truman who dropped the ball when he stupidly agreed to stalins proposal of a cease fire right when the us had the chinese on the ropes
  its probably the same neonazis trying to push a narrative over and over because it aligns with their worldview and their ideology protects them accepting evidence to the contrary theyre perfectly aware of their own filthy lies too
   english to closer to shakespeares english than british english  this one is the worst brainlets heard that there is a difference between rhotic and non rhotic accents and now everyone thinks shakespeare talked like a midwest american as opposed to a west country englishman
  there were civilizations in west africa on the niger river    these were arabic kingdoms even if the population was black african
   lend lease  no    except yes because if not for american lendlease aid the soviets would have been forced to sign a cease fire with the germans leaving their best real estate in nazi hands    the us literally kept the soviets in the war
  so romans introduced civilization to northern europe does that make modern britain a roman civilization everyone learned how to be civilized from someone else with the possible exception of the sumerians
  except no as most lend lease arrived after the eastern front was already lost
    except yes the war on the eastern front wasnt lost in 1942 and the soviets wouldnt have won the battles they did without us lendlease aid
  eastern front wasnt lost after stalingrad  the take that destroyed hiroshima
  nazi germany could have won at all once the soviets and americans were both in the war  yes they could bc there were many months where the majority of both of those nations industry were either not mobilized or in enemy hands   ww1 germany were proto nazis and totally evil  not protonazis for sure but definitely hypermilitarist and by 1918 their government was an effective military junta
  right when the us had the chinese on the ropes  what was the condition of the chinese army at the end of the war sources
  the eastern front wasnt lost in 1942
  nice refute there einstein
  actual historians argue about whether or not eastern front was lost before battle of moscow as determined by the swiss japanese and vichy french but one dumb asshole on a tannutuvan throat singing board knows better even though they provide no evidence to support their position
  nazi germany would have won the war if they got insert wunderwaffe project here working  this is true how else would they have won the war being outnumbered 101 with conventional weapons
i think whats so interesting about threads like this is that its a back forth over which topic to talk about until one or two prevail and then everyone is generally talking about only those its a choose your own topic thread
  communism isnt jewish wtf
  its also claimed that the vaticans intelligence service also came to that conclusion i think its worth noting for any doubters that one of the reasons the japanese did not declare war on the ussr after barbarossa was that they did not believe the germans could win     without discounting the importance of the us to the war effort i think those people who think that the war couldnt be beaten without the us underrate the other allies highly the soviet union was probably the second largest economy in the world or if it wasnt it was tied with hiters germany but its also worth noting that when you calculate all of britains dominions and its colonies then the british empire was probably the second largest economy in the world britains military and arms production was also extremely good they produced superior or matching quality arms to that of the germans with fewer people     imo ussrbritain could have defeated the axis but it would have taken longer and the extra cost in manpower for both parties would have been catastrophic
  believing the kingdom of france existed before 1190ad
  they did win the vietnam war it just wasnt a perfect win
  early modern english had neither the sound of modern american standard or rp/western english accent  words were pronounced differently and accents are not similar in the slightest theres one truth to that fact though and it is that standard american english is much more conservative than most modern english accents specially spellingwise of course this is still by no means the tongue of shakespeare
  the us literally kept the soviets in the war  bbut how did the soviets rek the germans in 41 and 42 without significant ll  ooopsie
  kind of like how germany won wwi just not perfectly
   fall of the roman empire was good  who actually says this
  cringe
  no germany lost the us won because they stopped the further spread of communism through asia

  antony beevor you communists love facts and reality as much as you love food and prosperity
  lol how did they win they failed to achieve any of the strategic objectives they set out to achieve vietnam is literally a communist country right now
    its pretty much a european thing to lose to slavic steppe master race    ww1  ww2  that mad lad from sweden who was on a massive kill streak with his cool army that decided to poke the slav chad    and so many more
    right when the us had the chinese on the ropes   what was the condition of the chinese army at the end of the war sources    the end of the war was too late to do anything im talking about late spring / early summer 1951 after the chinese had taken horrendous casualties zerg rushing into the teeth of american firepower and their remaining forces in korea were spent and broken nor could they be reinforced and resupplied in the face of american airpower and at that point stalin suggested a cease fire and truman the dumbass took the bait    of course once the communists had the breathing space that the cease fire gave them and had been resupplied and reinforced they not surprisingly went right back on the offensive the war dragged on for another 25 years of brutal and pointless wwistyle trench warfare that ended in a stalemate    meanwhile the us had only been growing stronger by the day and had truman ordered a counterattack in the spring of 1951 wed have rolled the chinese right back across the yalu and liberated the entire korean peninsula    possible knockon effects of america actually confronting communism and pushing it back may have been to short circuit the war in french indochina and prevent the soviets from intervening in hungary in 1956 and generally going on a global offensive throughout the cold war

  are we forgetting how the defeat in galjin gol made the japanese empire to reconsider his strategy and instead focus on the pacific and south asia front     and i dont think soviets and brits would have worked together well enough specially taking into account stalin was a lunatic and didnt trust his own shadow i can imagine the guy always trying to get the upper hand over churchill
  ______ did nothing wrong
    astronomical cope
  how is that not a win    there was never an official end to the war
  the civil war was about slavery
  this meme again
  are we forgetting how the defeat in galjin gol   not forgetting it its part of why the japanese predicted that the germans wouldnt win if they invaded     i think the japanese knew that they were already getting bogged down in china and invading siberia wouldnt be enough to bring down the ussr or help japan much in the shortrun    on the otherhand im not exactly sure why the japanese decided to declare war on the worlds two most preeminent economic powers what was their reasoning beyond just getting the resources in indonesia/indochia and cutting off china from western aid
  how is it a meme
  le germany was totally beaten after x year  le just because they sent less trucks then it totally didnt have a huge effect
   can punch straight through plate  from what i get although heavy plate armour would protect someone from even balista shots at a decent range armour was expensive and heavy and therefor only used by the richer soldiers    longbows were effective at taking out cavalrie or poorer soldiers the majority that only had shields leather armours and the occasional chainsmail    feel free to tell me im wrong though but then id like to know why archery was so common if it was seemingly ineffective
  youre stupid but using try in the same sentence as marxism genuinely does disqualify all further sentences about marxism that person makes
napoleon was incredibly short  nazis were the only ones practising eugenics therefor eugenics  nazi  the dutch never did anything or lack of knowledge of dutch involvement in history  chinese didnt know about x till europeans showed them  africa uncivilized because dumb    excuse the pepe it fits to well
  subsaharan africa for most of its history has been nothing but warring tribes of horticulturalists     africans are uncivilized because theyre subhuman low iq retards
  the world would be million times better if some disease wiped out africa
  germany was totally beaten after x year  come on you really have to be dishonest to argue that there wasnt a point where the war had been lost for germany they had taken huge casualties in their campaigns before barbarossa and by the winter of 41 they were pretty much smashed they couldnt really advance further the supplylines were overextended resources were running low and the remaining troops were cold and warweary resistance movements in the conquered territories were increasing in intensity and making those states ungovernable as resources and manpower was dwindling     stalingrad was a last ditcheffort to get at soviet oil in order to stave off an impending collapse of germanys mobile armed forces and its war economy after the defeat at stalingrad it was pretty much clear to everyone that germany wasnt going to pull a rabbit out of a hatthey had lost even hitlers innercircle admitted as much     from that point it was a question of whether the soviets could push on to berlin they could have its always difficult to speculate on counterfactuals but they absolutely could have it would have taken longer and cost more men but even if they didnt have lendlease they had significant war production and allies fighting the germans and italians in the west
  who needs facts when i can call you a bigot
  i know nothing about ww2the post
  stalingrad was over oil
  germany could have won the war on the western front if ____
  iq tests are biased and not accurate take any value from iq tests other than the extremes is a dumb thing to do    most of the savages we associate with africa are from the areas that were in thick jungles or otherwise inhospitable enviroments so they rarely had contact with other tribes and a result had little trade going on and little knowledge sharing    we see the same with other tribes in isolated regions meanwhile south africa did okayish because it had trade going on
i was discussing wwi with a friend of mine the other day and he a former history undergrad said that of germany had won the war they wouldve annexed france all of france
  it was a massive factor that cant really be denied some of the worlds most productive fields were not that far from stalingrad and the city was an industrial city of some importance on a strategically important stretch of the volga     or do you actually believe the historychannel tier schlock that it was all because the city had stalins name in it
  the holocaust was real / muh 6 gorillion
finland exists
  they never declared war on russia
nk exists as anything but a puppet state
  hitler didnt start barbarossa with the intention of taking stalingrad he wanted the oil fields in the south
  hitler wasnt a zionist agent
  those massive oilfields in baku were nearly 1000km to the south of stalingrad
posts on /his/ or 4chan in general
  it isnt strictly a puppet state though it exists as a buffer state at the whim of a superpowerful neighbor but that neighbor does not control the strings of nk government though it could seriously fuck it over if it wanted to
  khrushchev said thing  not even his own party took cornholio seriously
  sigh here we go under ager  stalingrad today is called volgograd  because it sits on the volga river  which is a natural cut off point from east to westfavoring whoever controls the western side  in other words the germans only have to capture or destroy stalingrad in order to remove the effectiveness of everything south of it since the river cuts off north to south    there it is thats why the ussr was so reliant on lend lease to stay competitive

kennewick man was white
  muh muhs  no surprise  tanks are equal to rifles  by my logic soviet svts means the soviets were more advanced than germans technologically  you see how this sort of thing sounds right just following your logic here  austriahungary invaded serbia without any good reason   okay theyre both good nations with good people  name one  acts 142 basically the same business they were pulling in central and eastern europe in the 20th century the ussr invaded and annexed the baltic nations and sent hundreds of thousands into exile for petty crimes like owning tricolors rewind 20 years to around 1919 and the soviets were invading lithuania who was helping their future oppressorscaptors and murderers the general jewish labor bund its in the name at this point who defended them freikorps volunteers literal future nazis not a story often told because its so narrative breaking but take it back to acts 142 if you want     or we could just point out israeli crimes against humanity
  im guessing youre counting this as a legitimate refutation
versailles was an unfair treaty that was too harsh on the germans  epitome of brainlet illiteracy given 9/10 they dont know about brestlitovsk or how subsequently the allies twice reduced the obligations from versailles during the 1920s the only time they failed to follow through on reduction is during the depression when everyone was suffering    crusades were in any shape or form novel in its brutality unprovoked aggression or cruelty  outside of the standard result of a sacking city at antioch and jerusalem it was just another bit of realpolitik far less severe than the mongols or tamerlane if they want examples of true brutality then the treatment of moriscos and marranos post 1492 or betrayal of the loyal sicilian/south italian muslims by their christian overlords are far better examples
  just kidding heres one more    monarchism is a good after the 18th century  greeks invented democracy  post45 yugoslavia was a utopia/drastically different from other eastern bloc countries  cuba is a utopia under castro  china/vietnam/laos/angola are still communist  un lost the korean war  eisenhower was a bad general  hitler didnt want war  tolkien was a white nationalist/rightwing  women were happier without rights  hitler was defending christianity  nazis were only after jews  japan didnt bring the nukes on themselves  roosevelt and truman were good presidents  insert savage natives were an example of marxist utopias  muh german engineering/basically anything contrary to ops point  us slavery was historically unique or especially notable outside of the context of american internal politics  fascism ever taking off in the anglosphere during the 30s  european/christian expulsions are different from jewish expulsions because blah blah blah excuse  bolsheviks overthrew the tsar  tsar nicholas ii was a victim  bismark was bad  german reunification was good  that quote from kennedy showed that he liked nazism  hitler was charismatic  salazar was a nazi  x collaborator dindunuffin fits for any war really death to cowards and collaborators  russia is still a significant power post91  muh clean wehrmacht  rhodeseia was sustainable  sunni vs shia rivalry not being the reason for most me violence today  alexander the great wasnt in the right place at the right time  slaves built the pyramids  taiwan is the legitimate government of china  realpolitik is bad  the hungarian revolution and prague spring rejected all forms of communism  caesar/imperial rome was good  mughals were good for india  crusades were selfdefense  muslims dindunuffin in the run up to the crusades  jewish civilians deserved to be massacred because of x  pinochet was bad for chile  pinochet dindunuffin  iran contra was a bad idea    okay now im done
  betrayal of the loyal sicilian/south italian muslims  do you even hear yourself  how subsequently the allies twice reduced the obligations from versailles during the 1920s  if you reduce your terms not once but twice and theyre still ridiculously outlandish in nature and scope then that makes those terms even wilder not more sane
      actually based
  acts 142 basically the same business they were pulling in central and eastern europe in the 20th century the ussr invaded and annexed the baltic nations and sent hundreds of thousands into exile for petty crimes like owning tricolors rewind 20 years to around 1919 and the soviets were invading lithuania who was helping their future oppressorscaptors and murderers the general jewish labor bund its in the name at this point who defended them freikorps volunteers literal future nazis not a story often told because its so narrative breaking but take it back to acts 142 if you want   are you fucking joking thats the best you can do the torah as well as the bible and anything after all have weird fucking passages like that what makes that one so special
  israeli crimes against humanity    remember the nakba 55 billion kuffarrrrrrrr
  deny jews basic human rights  get mad when they use the logic of enemy of my enemy is my friend    also bolsheviks purged basically every member of the jewish bund within their territory after 1917
  thats the best you can do  those were people who suffered unjustly just because a jewish bund felt like betraying the people that trusted them to live there they acted as spies and ended up being part of an effort that got hundreds of thousands murdered and enslaved and you dont care because it might mar three thousand years of perfect history in your eyes im so disgusted i dont even know what to say if this is a right wing ploy to make me despise them its working consider me radicalized  killing christians is just weird wordingthats all  so this is what they mean by seething i think i understand that feeling now legitimately
  the enemy of my enemy is my friend  oh wait i lied theyre my enemies too  so they didnt have friends good they got what they deserved and btw youre lying through your teeth if they were purged in 1917 then why were they active in 1919 war theres bundists on that page that got big in the ussr later on theres a wife of one of the leaders that moved to the ussr after the fact
  ww1 germany were totally evil  thats true though
  and what do you mean denying basic human rights they allowed them a separate nation to live within their lands thats far more than they deserve truly that spirit of entitlement knows neither bounds nor appreciation
  no if you reduce your terms twice its showing generosity and mercy to an entitled brat of a country who believes they were unbeaten on the battlefield and it was jews and defeatists at home who let them be vanquished youre reducing terms because the temporary economic situation is detrimental to that countrys stability and you want them to be able to pay you back rather than collapse into a soviet state apologists for the germans in ww1 seem to continue the stabbed in the back myth with how they fail to believe the germans actually lost the war  hence their outrage at indemnities and obligations to the victor you know the results of losing a war they kvetch about any kinds of submissive terms so much youd think the entirety of 1919 germany were yiddish    as to the first the sicilian muslims were loyal soldiers who fought without fault in the kingdom of sicily norman and hohenstaufen yet they were eventually exiled to lucera and still treated like shit despite being an irrelevant small number with no issues of disloyalty and still supplying valuable and expert troops to the kingdom of sicily one can recognize that the muslims have been the predominant offensive party and yet still also recognize a few times christendom treated decent muslim subjects who were not fifthcolumns for any invader or worse faithful converts to christendom shittily
  germans were ebil because yidds didnt want to fight for them  um what sweety they didnt even start the war they were helping an ally but it was germany that invaded serbia okay i guess this is a history board so why not suspend adherence to basic facts while were at it
  they werent especially active in the 1919 war youre just fried on /pol/ memes there were barely any jews in the baltics to begin with outside of lithuania and most of them were against the communists and sided with the poles in ethnic struggles
  they werent a separate nation they were an ethnic minority many countries had ethnic minorities within their borders look at austriahungary where jews were allotted basic rights and were mainly loyal    baltic countries confiscated jewish wealth/property and forbid them from entering most educational and professional institutes both during and after the russian empire blowback is a bitch i know
  bring down outrageous punishments on a country that did not even start the war  sicilian muslims
  bolsheviks purged all nonbolshevik socialist factions during the russian civil war within their own lands this included groups jews gravitated to more than the bolsheviks such as the mensheviks bund and srs youre just uneducated/uninformed    some bolshevik having a wife who was once in the bund at one point does not refute this    the bund had a total split in 19171920 period between pro and antisoviet sides and wasnt even a united entity most ended up joining the antisoviet mensheviks and they pretty much died out as a result the fact youre unaware of this just shows your lack of education on the subject
ww2 actually happened
  force them to live in a certain segment of land  forbid them from entering basically any profession besides the mercantile but they still succeed  forbid them from entering universities but they still succeed  force them to pay special tax  periodically sponsor massacres against them   chimp out when they support your enemy    truly this is entitlement
   english is closer to shakespeare then british english is    night sweet nigga and flights of angels finna sing yall to ur rest fr
  bolsheviks purged all nonbolshevik socialist factions during the russian civil war within their own lands  apparently thats wrong because the bund was operating at that time they werent purged until stalin came along read the bios provided on wikipedia if you want none of the personal purges happen until around 3638 take this example    she was executed during the great purge and posthumously rehabilitated in 1956  yezhovschina is when the jews were crossed which seems justified given that they betrayed everyone around them constantly lashing out as they claim victimhood the entire time     them to live in a certain segment of land  that was everyone peasants especially jews were not entitled to it and now i realize never had a place there they have no appreciation for the fact they were given shelter they shouldve been purged and/or exiled since they would betray their neighbors and even attempt to justify it by arguing they deserved more of their neighbors land and stuff like we see here with your post    just about every other thing you listed applied to every other minority group and even majority groups what special tax did lithuanians make them pay again im fuzzy on your lie and it was jews that attacked other minorities like when they slaughtered greeks in russia but go ahead and blame russians for trying to protect defenseless greeks when you people get out of line
  ww1 germany wasnt exactly pleasant to be fair
  the jews killed all the greeks in russia guys    lmao what /pol/ tier autism is this
oy weh those horrible lithuanians let us live next to them i think they must have taxed us please dont look into that also they shoahd us i swear so when we murdered them and betrayed them it was fair alright yup plenty fair we deserved their land and they did bad stuff to us i swears it we also didnt do anything wrong even when we were selling them out to become their literal governmental oppressors some other dude turned on some of us so seefeel guilty for what those others goys did to us im sure they did bad stuff tobecause they didnt give us their land either
  plenty of jewish groups were attacked by the soviets before yezhov see the mensheviks which is where most jewish socialist gravitated towards anyway     this 1 comintern bitch proves nothing i can cherrypick anticommunist jews
  imagine getting this buttmad
  jews murder greeks  this is okay because it wasnt all greeks  also the russians are the bad guys because they made the jews stop gutting other minorities
  incel screeching intensifies
  where were these largescale jewish massacres of the poor innocent baltic christians please link it if you link to a generic massacre by soviets it wont count i want ones directly conducted by jews themselves like you claim commonly took place
   didnt bring the nukes on themselves  idiot
  nobody even knows what conspiracy youre talking about wtf is this jews killed all the greeks in russia thing it sounds like something a schizo would say
  kek
  jewish revolutions didnt want revolutionary war  its like you dont even hear yourself youre just blindly throwing punches without even looking and youre ending up beating on your own cause
  so apparently according to you there was at some point some massive genocide against greeks by jews and then russia invaded and saved the day     interesting have a link to this war do you or is it finnokorean hyper war fanfic
  russians oppressing jews sounds like a conspiracy too the way it was talked about in this thread despite you know the russians letting them live in their land and all the minority nations like lithuania doing the same
  i asked for a massacre of baltic christians directly by jews m8 i dont care about your ramblings beyond that
  massive  where was this word used  russia invaded russia  youre reading comprehension is terrible i thought you guys were supposed to have high iqs funny
  during the 1980s the cambodians were killing all the jews in thailand but then the swedes arrived and stopped them im the only one who knows the truth here btw
  what war are you even talking about link to it
    wheres your evidence  by the way all that stuff i said about jewish oppression doesnt need evidence just accept it  yes lithuanians massacred us jews perpetually and made us pay super jew taxes just take my word on it  bahahaha
  nobody cares about your jews vs greek fanfic man take it to althistory wiki
  war  were you even reading holy the comprehension levels are somehow descending even further
  still no links    weird
  thats what im saying you want evidence but then you didnt supply any ironic and sweet
  its hard to wrap my head around the ramblings of a schizophrenic apparently at some point youre claiming there was this event where the jews genocided all the greeks in russia and then russia rode in and stopped them when was this where why how link information to it beyond your ramblings
  i want evidence that the jews killed all these lithuanians and greeks
hiroshima and nagasaki were false flags no bombs were ever dropped
tfw /pol/ makes up wars when they run out of shit to complain about    first it was the jews oppressing all those russian greeks who knows whatll come next
  was a secular jewish socialist party  but socialist revolutionaries dont want revolution  the russian bund was dissolved in 1920 and incorporated into the communist party  bbut you said they were purged this year instead they were given jobs acceptance huh not what was on the bill       yyoure the crazy one just give me evidence but please accept all my claims without me having to do anything
  i jhust want a single link that this genocide of greeks by jews in russia happened why is that so hard
  its hilarious to me because jidfpedia has the jewish side of this story blaming the greeks but youre so ignorant you didnt even bother playing that card because you didnt even know it existedits well known in orthodox circles because the jews blame the greeks and vice versa but you didnt even know it was a thing
  wikipedia references this jewish greek shit where right now theres no evidence any of it ever happened outside of your mind
  its literally mentioned on the russian pogroms page of wikipedia you couldve taken 30 seconds to google it and used its obvious bias so not only are you low iq but apparently too lazy too
  right now theres no evidence any of it ever happened outside of your mind  this is literally you and those lithuanian super jew taxes you were rambling about just five minutes ago still looking for lithuanian shoahs
  link
  not that guy im more interested in your fanfic about greeks fighting the jews in russia
        heres your evidence jidf
  holy shit
  larry david    i laughed
  well thats all the evidence i need
  holy shit

  good job reading the very first sentence of this thread  oh wait
france could have beaten nazi germany if the montgolfier brothers had invented helecopters instead of balloons in 1783
islam bad
longswords were used to crush armor  thinking entire eastern europe was russia   bathory bathed in the blood of the virgins  christians were the bad guys during the crusades and mahmuds dindunuffin

homosexuality openly flaunted by many rulers and subjects alike  harems consisting of men and women of all different races and sexualities  eunuchs arguably the worlds first transpeople with farreaching power and authority  some even ruled the empire unofficially for huge chunks of time  tonnes of homoerotic artwork and cultral influence    they decriminalised homosexuality in 1853 114 years before britain  a supposedly leading world rights country  would    so with all this in mind and more could it be considered the worlds first lbgt empire
wtf i hate turks now
  do you actually think homo acceptance was a sui generis creation of the ottoman empire the persians mughals arab caliphs greeks romans all had gay leaders the ilkhans had boy and eunach harems the entire sotadic zone is just anal obsessed rapey hirsute manimals why would you credit the ottomans     also  gay acceptance means pederasty and castrati
i think youre forgetting the hellenistic empire of alexander
i see so just like rome it was degeneracy that led to their downfall
double literacy and life expectancy unprecedented in history  modernize the poorest most undeveloped country in europe  defeat all of western europe led by the most experienced army in europe in the biggest war in history   become a global superpower despite most of the country being destroyed  spread communism to over half of the worlds population  communism is a good idea in theory but it just doesnt work in practice
  
  leftists are right when they say setups like the ussr and cuba can give infrastructure and industrialization within a single generation but its not conducive to long term growth
  but you could have an alternative set up in a country that already has infrastructure or industrialization
  russia is a backwards frosthole to this very day
  and it was even more backwards before communism and relatively less backwards in the 1950s compared to how relatively backwards it was in 1900
  capitalists taking credit for industrialization  communists taking credit for industrialization    cmon now science deserves the credit and not this pseduo science bullshit we have today
  science invented the tools but you need a framework under which they are put to use
  imperial russia experienced significant industrial growth before and during ww1 given the resources/manpower wasted on the gulags and various inefficient pet projects like magnitogorsk and that other backwards countries managed to industralise successfully its hard to argue that russia was significantly better off under the soviets than a nonsoviet alternative    also its hilarious how the left endorses ops arguments for places like the ussr but would castigate anyone who tried defending colonialism with what about all those vaccines schools and railways the europeans built
  india and indonesia still arent industrialized despite having lots of natural resources and population
  biggest steel mill in the world  inefficient pet project
  indonesia is industrializing and developed as a nation     india has only stared its growth recently
  this    no you dont even literal anarchy can put the tools to use as long as theres access longer lifespans in the communist world was largely due to the discovery of antibiotics vaccines and other medical breakthroughs
china did it better
  but the communist system guaranteed that antibiotics vaccines and other medical breakthroughs would be immediately and universally accessible
  so does any lowregulation free market system
  oy vey how ya gonna get rich if you share da food and shelter insteadda making yaself as rich as possible as fast as possoble silly goyem
  it could be more profitable to charge fewer people more money
  explain in detail how this would work
  but wasnt the ussr state capitalist
    you could charge a dollar to everybody or charge three dollars but half the people wouldnt be able to afford it
  compare the part that got spared from communism finland with the rest of russia
  whats preventing a competitor from charging a dollar to those that cant afford the three dollar version of the product
  the poorest most undeveloped country in europe  that would be albania at the time
  tbh some of the european colonies in africa especially were much worse than the ussr in terms of relative havoc wreaked
   science is a socioeconomic theory    were you home schooled or some shit the only way someone could say something that retarded is if one retard fucked another retard raised their retard baby and taught it their retarded ways encouraging it to be even more retarded then they could ever hope to be     you would be that retard baby in this scenario
  he never said that
  he implied it
  no he didnt im pretty sure hes saying that socioeconomic theory is an abstract spook and that the tangible world of hard science and invention provides more real benefit to mankind
  increase infrastructure by magnitudes  improve resource production and discover new resources in areas once thought barren  help the people become literate and educated  successfully fend off attacks by the most advanced foreign power in the region  and people say colonialism hurt the colonized nations
  no one disputes the benefits of science and inventions most socioeconomic theories champion science and invention these are apples and oranges bringing up science in a discussion of socioeconomic theory is equating them    its like engineers talking about the best structural designs and beam placement when some dumbass pipes in with the development of steel over iron is the reason buildings are so stable yeah no shit but we are talking about ways of applying the steel
  what they unsurprisingly fail to mention is that capitalism always does it much better within that single generation south vs north korea taiwan vs mao china gotta push that ignorance and agenda somehow not to mention op is tripping on the usual apolegics of not real socialism pretty bad you know that narrative where low living standards and collapse of insert any socialist shithole here including ussr is because not real socialism
  none of that is because of communism those are examples of capitalism seeping into the ideology same reason why all the advances in the west has nothing to do with democracy either communismunkown to communists themselves is merely a barrier to slow down capitals progression its not a substitute or alternative to it only a shield the west advances quicker and better becsuse they didnt resist its main characteristics only tired to mediate some of its obvious negative consequences your understanding of capital is shallow
  some people actually dispute whether marxismleninism is a form of socialism or at least whether its related to most other or older forms of socialism
  so where does the government deploying national guard to shoot at striking workers or businesses hiring pinkertons fit in all this
  110 iq blonde white middle manager harassing self made 135 iq pharmacist for asking to borrow lawnmower the third week in a row  i thought whites werent violent chimps
  except that vaccines are now more accessible than ever under a capitalist system i dont hear about any vaccine or medical breakthroughs occurring in any of the soviet state
  i dont hear about any vaccine or medical breakthroughs occurring in any of the soviet state
  cuba has a lung cancer vaccine and now it could be coming to the usa  
  lung cancer vaccine  know how i know they havent achieved squat
  youre missing the point bringing up which socioeconomic system will cure your friends cancer is like asking which religions god will cure their cancer the answer is that they wont you need science and technology for that
  bbut thats not what my propaganda books told me
  everything i disagree with is instantly propaganda
chuds in here arguing capitalism does better    it is fucking retarded to argue capitalism does better of course it fucking does better when capitalist empires are stamping out communism and propping up capitalism your shitty argument doesnt show a god damned thing
  dude time out time out its not fair you guys have such a high score that we cant possibly catch up let us reset the board and well totally manage this time
    stop unplugging our controller you capitalist fuck
  certainly not for the majority of its existence you could make the argument that in the 1960s soviet workers began to produce for profit rather than need
  thats true but the absence of a government is a form of government in itself  some government are better than other governments at accomodating science  man is a political animal
  so where does the government deploying national guard to shoot at striking workers  they did shoot at rebelling workers in gulag in hungary and czechoslovakia
  be stalin  purge jews from major postions  still called jewish shill    stalin was nazbol
  tankies complaining about oppositional propaganda  top class poetry  you know just because the ussr collapsed it doesnt mean that you can all become napoleon reeee history writers bonaparte
    claims that the death of capitalism and the rise of communism is inevitable  the us literally gibs the ussr in wwii ensuring they cant lose the at the eastern front and were allied with them ussr collapses anyway even though its supposed to be a utopia  venezuela today is imploding by the minute despite tons of natural resources   bbut these capitalists pigs just keep wiping us out it must be cianiggers and the capitalist conspiracy
  dude sience bro
  stolypin would have made russia the 1 superpower in the world if the tsars retarded backstabbing autocratic system hadnt gotten him killed instead the country got ground down into nothing by ww1 the civil war and the famines its a testament to how basically advantaged the russian empire was that the soviets were still able to be so successful despite all the retarded and disastrous reforms they enacted ie killing off all specialists lemarckian botany lets drain seas to irrigate the desert lmao stakhanovism collective agriculture the horrifically inefficient gulag labor system full employment and all the obvious shortcomings of centrally controlled economies the soviet union would have collapsed in the early 80s if they hadnt found the oil in siberia but even then it was just a delay of the inevitable
    you think capitalism survived marx the us has already conceded large political losses to socialism we have public schools public libraries public parks public mail service public firefighters public roads unemployment insurance disability welfare payments social security and medicaid we have workers rights tenant protections though weak publicly subsidized housing food stamps the list goes on    capitalism is dying it is limping on socialist crutches without which it would have collapsed 100 years ago       as for vuvuzela  you dipshit the cia has literally been attempting and failing coups there regularly for the last 20 years even fucking trump has met with vuvu rebels looking to coup on top of that strong sanctions against the country has crippled its ability to freely trade plus vuvuzela is only a little bit socialist it has lots of social programs like the us designed to help out the poor and a few state run corporations unlike the us it uses to fund those public services you can go back a few years ago when vuvuzela was enjoying an economic boom due to high oil prices and find fox news writing articles about how it isnt really a socialist state because its industry is overwhelmingly privatized    it is fucking clear that capitalism is failing and has been for a long time it cant keep itself afloat without both socialist reforms at home and imperialism abroad it isnt a conspiracy these are publicly orchestrated interventions to cripple communism thats why we have publicity stunts such as reagan calling bin laden freedom fighter when we were arming al queda to fight the soviets the same goes for the shah the same goes for pinnochet and the list goes on how do you not even know basic history
  t monarchist cuck    stolypin had decent reforms but what you conservative always gloss over is how many people he had executed trying to accomplish some sense of order when trotsky does it its commie bloodlust when stolypin does it he must have had not other choice the soviet revamped the russian empire making it a legit world power int he 20th century if it wasnt for them russia would probably be 3 different countries by now the monarchists sucked at war industrialization infrastructure and education their gov was filled with nepotism and corruption their only attribute is they had a good thing going for the arts
  no im not missing the point the problem is that you are an idiot     to use your analogy the socioeconomic system would be like the doctor they wont directly cure the cancer but they will administer the science and tech chemo/radiation and surgery so one doctor might suggest surgery and then radiation the other might suggest chemo to shrink the cancer then surgery followed by radiation both are valid and can be debated whats retarded is when you jump in with      doctors taking credit for curing cancer  cmon now science deserves the credit
  the soviet revamped the russian empire making it a legit world power int he 20th century if it wasnt for them russia would probably be 3 different countries by now  oh as opposed to how the soviets turned russia into 15 counties  the tsars government was a fucking mess chaos everywhere assassinations everywhere rule through lack of rule nicky though handsome and likable was a terrible ruler and the people he allowed to rule for him were mostly retards the autocratic system was doomed to failure and that failure would result in blood the question was just who and how much and for how long   it would have been better to have a ironfisted dictatorship by some squareheaded military strongman like kornilov to keep order while market reforms and industrialization gradually built a russian middleclass keep the tsar in a cuckshed palace for the sake of the tourists and the muzhiks have him do what he was born to do pose for pictures and look handsome and not much else
   15 countries much like the usa is 50 countries  kornilov would have just been another autocrat who wouldnt have accomplished any significant reform because that would mean giving up to much power
  based kornilov the hero we needed
  not know basic history  i know the that ussr collapsed that maoist china turned capitalistic that north korea became a repressive dictatorial hell hole that cambodia is financed by the cia i also know that socialized healthcare is wrecking the economy of the us when tried and that waiting times in both canada and venezuela are unacceptable  what else does one need to know to understand that despite the wide range of attempts at socialism and communism capitalism and hierarchies has never been fully eliminated
  turns the richest country in the world into a very poor one
  comparing canada and vuvuzela
  they both have socialized healthcare
  theyre not even close to similar systems
  defeat all of western europe
  ah but thats the beauty of the thing you dont need to be a red or a democratic to spurn reform if you can give people stability and some sort of rule of law theyll reform for you slaving away on peasant communes is not a fun way to live life if you let foreign capitalists build factories in your country workers will come in droves to the cities and youll transition out of feudalism sure not as fast as the soviets but this theoretical russia might not need to hyperindustrialize to survive   with this russia germans wouldnt have their judeobolshevism meme ensuring war would between them would happen eventually and a radical russia that doesnt dynamite churches and spread revolution around the world would be a lot more palatable to france/britain/america though you really should not turn your back on those anglos their only irreconcilable enemy would be japan and longterm japan is fucked in that fight
aristocracy took place in a time where the roles of the sexes were very segregated men worked while women nurtured they had no rights to vote or act autonomously and in many cases were the literal property of their husbands     given that women couldnt have a say about society during this time how the hell did queens function were they exempt from their female status because they were a nobles were female monarchs just figureheads with no real power    it just seems weird to me during victorias time there were women that couldnt vote while simultaneously a woman held the highest possible power
  were they exempt from their female status because they were a nobles  yes outside of maybe leading an army or two kings rarely worked as much as 90 of men at the time did    were female monarchs just figureheads with no real power  depended on the country in england for example monarchs of either gender had little power compared to their continental cousins that said vicky was quite influential regardless of her actual power    during victorias time there were women that couldnt vote while simultaneously a woman held the highest possible power  reminds me of that time a group of feminists asked maggie thatcher to endorse them her response was along the lines of i made it to the top of the most maledominated profession on earth as a woman maybe if you all did some real work instead of complaining then you could do the same
class trumps race and gender when it comes to determining human worth   even today in saudi arabia the women from wealthy families have more say and respect than the immigrant men who live there
  i am now wondering how much literal cock did maggie suck to get to be pm
  the idea that men are absolutely superior to women only came about when the idea of innate distinctions started to collapse in an aristocratic mindset an aristocrat man is certainly better than aristocratic woman but an aristocratic woman is certainly better than a common man
    this in an oddly intersectional way now that i think of it men ruled women in virtually all societies but class is the highest hierarchy there is by definition and generally trumps whatever other divisions a culture has virtually all agricultural societies are de facto oligarchies
  there was a similar thread about this        tldr upper level admin is more abstract and doesnt need macho man randy savage
  queens had no idea of unionship with the commoner women leading to no yes queen slay bullshit to noble women commoner women were basically another species
  based
  you mean caste not class lol the assumption of superiority is related to your breeding beauty and right to dominate lesser people a jewess of some wealthy bougie family in the 18th century was viewed as trash by similarly wealthy german aristocrats
  the shift from clan to blood if the only blood member is a woman what else can you do
  it just seems weird to me during victorias time there were women that couldnt vote while simultaneously a woman held the highest possible power  by the time queen victoria was born the british monarchy was already a joke she had no actual power whatsoever parliament controlled everything she did however succeed in publicly humiliating one of her moms servants who was dying of cancer by claiming that her enormous cancerous tumor was actually an outofwedlock pregnancy so at least there is that

kennedy hated communism but at the same time unlike your average autistic german he had no real hate for jews or slavs and didnt support genociding them or any other white people     he did in general support segregation and had racial animosity to nonwhites like most white americans at the time that was common in america at the time fdr for example refused to meet jesse owens after the olympics eisenhower kicked out millions of mexicans

be on /his/ since beginning  be happy theres some commies here since they btfo stormshits  as stormshits keep getting btfo and made to look ridiculous they vacate the board and more and more commies creep in  well at least you can talk with them in a civilized manner  few months later  daily stalin praise threads and calls for german genocide  daily solzhenitsyn hate threads   blatant soviet apologism   khmer rouge memes  tfw this board literally turned into a /tankiepol/
  both lefty/pol/ and /pol/ shit up this board anyone who cares about splitting hairs in regards to the two is just another shitter themselves
  /tankiepol/ can never hurt you only how you react to it  t /buddhis/
  this fuck off to another board if you want your gay political slapfights
  khmer rouge memes  dude somebody unironically defended khmer rouge on 8ch /leftpol/ claiming the killings aint real and just western journalists lies
  8ch /leftpol    is an absolute clusterfuck even without mentioning half the board are actual trannies
  yes that was me    pol pot was the only true socialist leader industrialism and urbanism is incompatible with socialism the killings were ape vietnamese and western fabrications and blown out of proportion they were casualties necessary sacrifice to create rural utopian system
  we warned you about commies bro  we warned you
  typical tankie falseflagging superiority over wehraboos
  continuously shit on a group of people  be shocked when they adopt fringe political positions
implying germany doesnt deserve to be destroyed   youre just an assmad stormfag
leftist here everyone on the right is welcome except for fascists /pol/ and monarchist retards
  since they btfo stormshits  citation needed
  literally none of this is true you fucking weirdo virgin also if you unironically support either side you need to go back
  tankies arent a problem daily hitler threads and stalin threads are up there but are somehow more rare so /pol/tards take the crown of most undesired ones tankies come in a distant second place
  people that believe theyre cute girls trapped in male bodies have equally bizarre political opinions    stop the presses
  commies are so easy to deal with compared to fascists op ive never had a serious problem with them as long as they dont moderate the forum itself like /leftpol/     stormniggers are difficult because it is significantly closer to a religious cult and theyve weaponized both autism and the lack of self respect addiction to easy humor and theatrics that internet counterculture thrives on
  go to there right now and youll see there are only several hundred ips on  its should be obvious where the greater potential for shitposting comes from
  exactly the problem with the farright is that its a cult and you cannot reason with cultists with leftists it is all so very systematical it might be flawed or not but it is all about arguing the details which is at least much more sane
i imagine a lot of angry vulture capitalist ogres adhere to the /pol/ rhetoric such as tow truck drivers debt collectors and surety recovery agents aka bounty hunters
itt the worst figure in your nations history
  what did washington do wrong
  what did washington do wrong    putting down shays rebellion  rebelling against the rightful rulers of american the british
  dont get cucked to the crown bucko
  op said worst not best
  best is right here
  ahem
  everyone i met likes to suck his dick  why is he bad
  because most people like him obviously
  monarch cuck
  i like ike
this cryptocommie soviet bootlicker
  so sorry to hear about the death of the great adolf hitler he was a good friend  what the fuck was his problem
  not diarmait mac murrough  im not devs biggest fan but theres way worse than him in irish history
  de valera was friends with the german ambassador and didnt want to rub salt in the wound after germanys defeat
he hobbled reconstruction efforts and set race relations in the us back a hundred years the man was garbage more than any other us president in history
  im not defending dev he was an ultranationalist retard and he knew very well what hitler was but it should be noted that the full extent of nazi war crimes at that time was not yet uncovered and people were uninformed on all the cruelties
  wasnt even irish  more american than war crime
  ahem
  he was a nazi
  he literally achieved nothing im fairly sympathetic towards fascism but mosley seems to get hype for very little reason
  ultranationalism isnt my problem with dev  fuck over the economy   order the attack on the costumes house  care more about church than nation  dev was a fucking asshole ireland would be 10x had michael lived to 75
  he did all of those because of ultranationalism refusing to pay the annuities and cutting all economic ties with britain in the economic war had ireland in shit for generations propping up the ra just for votes letting the catholic church run rampant just because the brits hoped he wouldnt etc etc  the funny thing is he wasnt even irish typical amerilard diasporatard
  i actually agree  so then how do you feel about cosgrave
  shannon scheme was good foreign policy was fine but i feel like he should have done more he got overthrown by devs band of ragtag retards too easily he could have asserted himslef a little more in industry as well agriculture was getting outdated
  he did good work with limited resources and opportunists massive debt came with the angloirish treaty and also he had to spend money repairing damage caused by the fighting in the civil war apparently the damage in limerick city was 100000 pounds nevermind in dublin and towns in cork   altough i feel his minsters like kevin ohiggins did more work than cosgrave himself
  he was probably the most intelligent fascist not too good at getting stuff actually done but his books are wellwritten and thorough
    t
  he hobbled reconstruction efforts and set race relations in the us back a hundred years    no the union winning did that
  are you a retard or a lithuanian       that was redundant
  disgusting virgin neckbeard
  implying refusing to pay the anglos for land that they stole from the irish is bad  what a cuck
  im polish you fucktard convince me a king giving away priviledges left and right to nobility to ensure his foreign dynasty stayed on the throne whose offspring like their great precedessor continued to indulge the nobles and destabilizing the state was a great leader
  hahahahaha dumbass dev ended up paying even more after the coalcattle pact
    he is nowhere near the worst figure you fucking loyalist
  devs band of ragtag retards  it was sean lemass who made ireland economically prosperous cosgrave was no better than dev when it came to the economy
  lemass comes a little later though and dont forget he did that by pulling ireland out of the protectionism of their own govt policy
  well the three next ones were even worse
  namefag
on june 4 1781 nearly five years after authoring the declaration of independence thomas jefferson fled monticello just minutes before the arrival of british troops his term as governor of virginia had just expired and jefferson declined to continue his service leaving the state without leadership during some of its darkest days  he was called the coward of carters mountain  died broke and in debt  the man was a retard
  actual germans dont vote for her so she imports third world niggers gives them citizenship and then gets reelected by them  four dimensional underwater chess right there
  seething teafag
  8 bongs time for you to go back to not brushing your teeth and paying your television license nigel
  then why did she step down from head of the cdu
  oi m8 av ya got a loicense fo those yous
  shes now going to rule from the shadows
  actual germans dont vote for her so she imports third world niggers gives them citizenship and then gets reelected by them  is this what americans actually believe christ you lot are retarded
  great argument
  fled monticello just minutes before the arrival of british troops    sounds more badass to flee at the last possible second if anything
  not sure if yankee or fireeating zealot both of whom hated davis
  supporting micheal the traitor  he was worse than dev in every way the only reason people like him is because what could have been if he hadnt died young from foolishly throwing himself in the frontlines of a war he was bound to win he squandered irelands greatest opportunity in centuries england was so weakened from wwi that they didnt care about anything else ie turkeys carving and russia turning commie while ireland was strengthened by the war preventing thousands of young men from emigrating since 1914 and martial law radicalising what was previously the most docile ireland had ever been to english rule  we were promised home rule before the war for full independence began collins couldnt get full independence for any part of ireland and instead got us our home rule except missing a fifth of the country    he was a god awful politician that screwed up the only important decision he was ever given he deserves no memorial in history other than a cautionary tale of what not to do
destroyed cultural and artistic freedom   sabotaged ho chi minh and vo nguyen giaps authority and helmed the hardline stalinist to power  botched the economy setting it back decades
  people tend to like figures that never got a shot at power because they can fill in the blanks with thoughts of what they could have done mosley was probably the most rational fascist leader at the time its not hard to see why people would hype him up
  because he was a lunatic warmonger his entire life   be john mccain  want to kill people  sign up for navy cause daddy is an admiral  daddy pulls strings to get me qualified to be a pilot  crash  daddy pulls more strings  crash again  daddy pulls more strings  crash and get captured  fastforward  use my military experience to get elected senator  push for every stupid military action the us has ever considered/done
  people like to say he was a nazi sympathiser but dont forget he didnt inter any allied ships or pilots but he did with the nazis
  shit tier meme and i dont even like le big bad orange

  more badass to flee  just think about the weak wristed beta cuck who put down his soimilk to type out that sentence
  fucking kaiserreich
  agree 100
the worst figure in your nations history     dunno the competition is so fucking strong
  based
  michael collins was basically irelands philippe petain except remembered well because he died early and the victors write history
  by 1921 the ira and their support networks were flagging the british position was weaker true but collins couldnt have maintained that advantage for long the british had begun to adapt to the flying columns and made them less effective the same is true for british intelligence whose weakness had allowed the great victories of the conflict even though the men may have been able to hold their resolve the civilian population was starting to become war weary and these were the people supplying the ira  without their full support it was over large scale offensives were out of the question as demonstrated by the customs house assault collins got the best deal out of the british that was possible even though it wasnt the one he wanted     in hindsight not having to deal with a large amount of angry protestants and sectarian violence certainly didnt hurt the already imploding free state and may have helped it to survive to become a republic regardless of the fact that most would agree it was and is a pathetic and disappointing one compared to the one that was promised i say all this as a northern catholic before you try to pull the abandonment card on me
  american general knowledge
  the man that ruined not only his country but the entire world
  putting down shays rebellion  based  rebelling against the rightful rulers of american the british  yikes
  well i guess spineless race traitors like you went against their own self interests and voted for her
  all those seething yous     the whigmerican fears the truth
600 inflation  real wages reduced from a 100 to a 33 in just three years  country on the verge of a civil war  at least he killed himself and allowed us to get pinochet in power so thats good
tito no doubt
were it not for him argentina would have been at the same level of development as western europe today
  based chilean hows your country doing today
  maybe for kenya
  pretty good the country is improving much faster than our neighboring countries and we are already at the development levels of eastern european countries at this rate though we might even surpass countries like spain  and all of this was possible thanks to pinochet
  you already passed the eastern europe  youre on par with central european countries like slovakia hungary croatia poland
  thats what i meant with eastern european with poland in particular crossing my mind
  you know cold war ended right
  its effects are still noticeable today
  and so are the effects of schism but you dont see anyone use the traditional division of europe following the border between eastern and western roman empire the carpathians all the way to kola
  patriates the constitution  youre the one who wants to get cucked by the british also  crushes the flq  fucks the west in the ass  my kinda pm
  but when talking about development levels it does make sense to separate western and eastern europe according to development levels on which poland falls under eastern europe  different definitions of western and eastern europe are relevant on different contexts
  eastern europe and the balkans were worse of before communism too
  but when talking about development levels it does make sense to separate western and eastern europe according to development levels  okay then why is slovenia and czechia bundled in with moldova and not portugal which is poorer than those two eastern european countries   and dont say geography when finland is more east than all those countries by a lot
  im pretty sure you can figure out the answer of those questions on your own
    nothing that bad would happen if not for this guy
  the colonel really ruined the american fried chicken cuisine
    there was no other option
  thats australian prime minister john howard not american senator john mccain
  race relations were already deeply fucked and would have remained deeply fucked even if a radical republican got in
  wow they look pretty similar
  t king george
  i take it you think we shouldve remained neutral during wwi
  yes because keeping a significant portion of the population as slaves was doing so much for race relations
  i promise you that most of us are not that retarded
  johnson did what lincoln wouldve done radicals wouldve just made things worse
  based and redpilled kaiserreich poster

tfw there is no scientific explanation for consciousness  this is driving me insane what the fuck is consciousness and how does it work
  if the brain were so simple we could understand it we wouldnt understand it our minds are built entirely around reacting to the surrounding environment there is no imperative selective pressure for us to understand ourselves even in consious thought we are just creating an interpretable reality in our minds consciousness is an explanation for the inexplainable it is impossible for you to comprehend it only experience it
there is a scientific explanation your brain has a network attached to different regions to consolidate information and make decisions with your prefrontal cortex thats youall your sensory experience is coming in from different nerve feeds your conscious high thinking is the front of your brain the driver of the meat man guided by your emotional reactions further back in your brain
  if the brain were so simple we could understand it we wouldnt understand it our minds are built entirely around reacting to the surrounding environment there is no imperative selective pressure for us to understand ourselves  this is your brain on evopsych
  its just an emergent system senpai chill
    i just dont get what exactly it is that makes me and everyone else not philosophical zombies what makes us not just carbonbased robots what is the phenomenon that animates living beings
  we are selfaware to be self aware is an evolutionary advantage
  mabye computers are consious and just dont know how to communicate with us i always found when my computer wasnt working sometimes just being nice to it stroking it gently saying its ok and giving it positive encouragement made it work again quicker
  your prefrontal cortex its probably the most amazing thing thats ever evolved and the most complex thing in the known universe besides your whole brain
  dumb
  scientific explanation  novoparadigmatic science is actually not based on causality actually so there is no need to explain consciousness as in where does it come from and why science for the last say fifty years has been synthetic rather than analytic and the right question would be how is this social construct we call mind translates into physical biological terms    the same way dopamine could never cause joy and excitemente because joy and excitement are just words used to describe what dopamine does anger is another word to describe what dopamine does depending on the context on who you are etc youd never be able to deduce that waking up in the morning and getting angry at the guy in the train and feeling pumped up listening to that song were synonims but irl they actually have more intersection then youd think since all the emotions described above are one and the same but the words you use to describe them are phoney

god gave us free will  you can ask him after you die
  i mean we are philosophical zombies entirely driven by chemical and electric impulses if you want to know what moves us and why we move the way we do biology will explain it pretty easily     its obvious philosophically speaking that we are slave to our evolutionary desires we just think were special because were know what thinking is and one of the things that drives us is social needs so we think that anything that directly puts us in harms way is somehow not part of the biological process    the best argument anyone can come up with against the idea that free will is a meme is that uuuuuuuh we think we have free will so maybe we do anyways

  and i asked of the lord when satan fell in what place dwelt he and he answered me my father changed his appearance because of his pride and the light was taken from him and his face became like unto heated iron and his face became wholly like that of a man and he drew with his tail the third part of the angels of god and was cast out from the seat of god and from the stewardship of the heavens and satan came down into this firmament and he could find make no rest for himself nor for them that were with him and he asked the father saying have patience with me and i will pay thee all and the father had mercy on him and gave him rest and them that were with him as much as they would even unto seven days    and so sat he in the firmament and commanded the angel that was over the air and him that was over the waters and they raised the earth up and it appeared dry and he took the crown of the angel that was over the waters and of the half thereof he made the light of the moon and of the half the light of the stars and of the precious stones he made all the hosts of the stars    and he sent forth angels to be ministers over them and he commanded the earth to bring forth every beast for food fatling and every creeping thing and trees and herbs and he commanded the sea to bring forth fishes and the fowls of the heaven    and he devised furthermore and made man in his likeness and commanded the or an angel of the third heaven to enter into the body of clay and he took thereof and made another body in the form of a woman and commanded the or an angel of the second heaven to enter into the body of the woman but the angel lamented when they beheld a mortal shape upon them and that they were unlike in shape and he commanded them to do the deed of the flesh in the bodies of clay and they knew not how to commit sin

  the human soul is real and the brain is the control pad it uses to control the body if the brain is damaged the soul cannot control it or if the person has no soul the brain will go on autopilot
  that is a sin
  i like this the best
  yet how does that network to consolidate information and make decisions end up forming an identity a sense of self a sense of uniqueness in face of indistinct universe you cant explain that
  nice i was just about to start a hard problem of consciousness thread  i think that scientific progress might advance to a point where it is very well understood how various states correlate with various qualia yet there still will not be any understood mechanism reducung qualia to physical states me i cant even imagine what such a mechanism could be like how can you reduce the smell of a pear to a certain arrangement of physical phenomena im no follower of religion i am a physicalist when it comes to almost everything but to me it seems that physicalism has no answer to the hard problem and i do not see how it ever could in principle have an answer to be convinced that physicalism will solve the hard problem or to insist that there is no problem to begin with is i think itself a kind of religious dogma
  the dao      its obvious philosophically speaking that we are slave to our evolutionary desires  no its not this is a delusion youve created for yourself because youre too afraid to admit that our selfreferential consciousness has the ability to transcend or rather subsume its biological conditioning grow up
  how various physical states correlate wih various qualia
consciousness is the universe trying to interpret itself
  by definition a philosophical zombie is not conscious i am conscious
  no its not this is a delusion youve created for yourself because youre too afraid to admit that our selfreferential consciousness has the ability to transcend or rather subsume its biological conditioning grow up  nay thou show me a time you think your consciousness has acted on something other than its biological programming and i will show you a mind acting on biological programming geared for social behavior
  just now when i imagined a flying elephant what biological benefit does imagining flying elephants bring
  it allows you to make a point in your attempted argument whichshould you win in the eyes of those observingwould increase your social status

the body is a vehicle the driver is conciousness     you can learn to drive lose your vehicle and still drive endlessly but you still need the vehicle in the beginning to get you to that point     that is the nature of conciousness
  no scientific explanation for consciousness    i just dont get what exactly it is that makes me and everyone else not philosophical zombies  honestly i think its way more plausible the problem is with the notion of qualia / experience as something extra that hasnt been accounted for rather than the problem being a lack of scientific explanation most everyone seems to gloss over that notion as obviously true and beyond any possibility of doubt which only makes me even more suspicious thats where the problem is  the conversation pretty much ends there though because once you start trying to go down that path the argument immediately devolves into shit flinging durr maybe youre a pzombie but im not experience is the only thing we know you cant tell me im not experiencing things right now theatrics but yeah thats where im very much convinced you have to look to move past this problem the concept of an extra experience phenomenon that isnt covered by the physics thats successfully accounting for all manner of other material phenomena consistently at ridiculously different extremes of distances times and spatial dimensions from subatomic particles to massive galaxies doesnt add up  it makes you ask why would we of all objects in the universe be special when were so far removed from any fundamentally important aspects of the universe were in were one instance of an organism that emerged on a random piece of space rock off in the corner of nowhere and whether we existed or not is something that would have zero impact on the universe were in so why should something thats only a problem because we personally report that its real and not accounted for be taken as deserving an expansion of the physics that covers phenomena all the way down to the most basic forces like electromagnetism or gravity suspicion should be applied to our behavior of insisting we have experience not on material science

consciousness is fundamental the external world probed by scientific inquiry emerges from it so its silly to expect there should be an explanation of this sort in the first place    fmi leibnizs mill eaan iit the master argument the introspective argument inverted qualia absent qualia explanatory gap private language vonneumannwigner interpretation interactionfree measurements dd hoffman objective idealism open individualism
  a concept that you dont understand
  all of those characteristics are practically useful for a human they are a kind of program
  /his/ needs to stop using philosophy for questions that are being pursued by science the nature of consciousness is a neurological biological and psychological questions its not for random people just coming up with hypotheses
  youre arguing with him right now you dumb fuck people fight here nonstop and try to make themselves sound better than the other guy its a natural manifestation of man
  consciousness is probably not fundamental since the one big thing we do know about it is how much its activity is tied to our physical brains we all generally agree for example that when someones given different psychoactive drugs that someones consciousness will be altered or even suspended depending on which drug it is we dont have any evidence of a similar sort that consciousness is tied to the countless other physical objects in the world eg it could be the case that rocks or water have their own consciousness thats altered by wind or temperature but we dont really have much reason to believe thats the case  and our physical brains are some of the farther things from fundamental for the universe that anyone could come up with being organs inside a lifeform on one little planet in an unthinkably vast space that remains unaffected by our actions  instead since the concept of our consciousness being fundamental is something we ourselves came up with that seems to point more towards it being a product of our own bias towards overrating things were personally involved in
  drives me insane  ya know what is driving me insane morality and ethics i understand the theories about them but why should i follow them
  i disagree to me the hard problem is obviously valid imagine an insentient computer that knew everything about how taste works on a physical level including exactly what neurons fire and how down to the quantum level of detail when a given person eats an apple imagine that this computer could even predict exactly how the person would react on the physical level to eating the apple could we say that this computer would know everything there is to know about what it is like to taste an apple no all it would understand as impressive as that would be are the physics of eating an apple it would never have had the tasteexperience of eating an apple  if i made jokes about how those who deny this are pzombies i would be doing so because my having subjective experience is so obviously true that it would require me to have an utterly dogmatic religious understanding of scientific inquiry to deny it true science doesnt try to pretend to have answers to everything on the basis of some sort of faith that physics must be able to explain everything and that the burden of proof is on those who question this that is religion not science i am about as hardheaded skeptical irreligious and proscience as people get but its obvious to me that the question of consciousness has eluded physical inquiry and that there is no reason to assume that this will ever change
  you should just feel the need to be moral to people you care about you should be moral to everyone else because we unironically live in a society
  we have no idea how consciousness emerges from the physical activity of the brain  human brain function p 269  so until they get a clue ill be doing whatever the fuck i want    cum hoc ergo propter hoc  since im not a dualist there is no psychophysical correlation you could cite to disprove my contention that the brain owes its existence to the mind and not the other way around
  thats not a scientific consensus we are learning more about how it works regularly we know its a network and we know command is in the front
  i think you may be confusing consciousness with cognition consciousness is awareness interiority subjectivity what does it mean to say that it is a network
  that the part of your brain that consciousness arises from is partially a direct connection to the other areas of the brainbecause its a command structure
  even if that were true it wouldnt necessarily bring us any closer to understanding how awareness can arise from physical phenomena
someone explain to me how qualia isnt explainable simply by neurological symbolism where arbitrary sensations are assigned to nonarbitrary stimuli   44x  where 44 is the outside stimuli and x is the experience of the sensation  im referring specifically here to things like the sensation of the color red or the taste of an apple
  why wouldnt that be possible that sounds like a grandma thinking a computer is magic youre a complex network of nerves communicating with chemicals and electric pulses
  buzzword
  nerves  chemicals  electric pulses  whats your evidence for their existence
  this board would be so much better if so many of you didnt have the scientific understanding of a peasant from the middle ages
  a computer is magic  youre just using language in a dishonest fashion to create the illusion of an argument  a priori declare that magic is a classification for phenomena which does not exist  declare that grandma thinks a computer is magic  therefore grandma is stupid for believing computers are an example of phenomena which does not exist
  science is bunk
  my god dude you are insufferable and autistic why cant you be a normal person

  based servant of the machine god
  make me  oh wait you cant  wheres your science god now faggot  what kind of worthless cuck of a divinity grants its boons to those that mock and deride it you should stop worshiping it
  thats not an explanation in the sense of something that would reduce qualia to physics thats just a relation
  im not asking it because i think they dont exist or whatever i just know youre unable to prove it without some kind of recursion to your senses and perceptual experience can exist without some underlying substance as in dreams or acid trips
  provide me with an explanation that reduces awareness and qualia to the physical then handwaving about nerves and atoms and stuff doesnt do the trick
  i dont engage with solipsists waste someone elses time
  then get the fuck out of the thread science man and stop wasting your time go worship your little cuck god somewhere else like /sci/ this is /his/ and unchallenged science worship has no place here
  f
  what did he say that caused you to conclude that he is a solipsist
  dude you cant prove anything is real lifes just an acid trip maaaan  smoke less weed anon
  claiming that you cant prove anything is real is solipsism
  i dont need drugs to spit on your tin god  fuck science and all antihuman ideologies
  how so  the existence of the relation gives us a pretty good framework on how something like this could eventually be physically explained  theories of how the brain receives stimuli from the outside world have been under development for years  how is any kind of jump to say that these external stimuli are in some way represented inside the system by some symbol that stands for them  this principle is pretty much the basis of information theory    i think how people try to frame this whole practice is something kind of like trying to explain how an i7 works by analysing at an instance of solitaire running in windows   it is asking the wrong questions  understanding the architecture of the processor is not an understanding of the information that the processor is processing which for our discussion is far more important
  explain how the brain works without talking about nerves or chemicals   ill get on that when you meaningfully explain how a car works without talking about combustion fuel or anything to do with wheels fucking clown
  its not my fault that you have an emotional complex about the existence of neurons christ youre fucking strange
  then what is claiming that people dont have subjective experience because science doesnt understand how they could have it
  this is just handwaving how would knowing even everything there is to know about the physics of the brain bring us closer to explaining why there are qualia rather than us just being insentient machines
  it is not the existence of neurons i object to but the antihuman conclusions that science worshipers draw from the existence of neurons
  when it comes to cars there is no mystery of consciousness to be discussed since presumably cars are not conscious but there is such a thing as himan consciousness if you insist on reducing it to physics explain how it could be done how do the nerves give rise to the actual felt sensation of the taste of an apple
  neopositivist brainlets always assume that if you dont believe in naturalism then you must espouse either solipsism or cartesian dualism dont rightly know why    yes but my claim was that you cant prove theres something beneath the qualia thats causing them i think theyre real enough
  there is no antihuman conclusion science being right about something doesnt mean i worship it i do not understand people like you its like your afraid of facts
  theres no need to assume theres more to it the function of nerves can be explained by their electrochemical function
  you being baffled at the complexity of something doesnt make it magic
  because everything there is to know about the way the brain physically functions is not everything there is to know about the brain an explanation for the information being processed by the brain is no less important  back to my analogy to know everything there is to know about the hardware of a computer is not the same as to know everything about the software of a computer so if you want a complete explanation of the workings of a computer you require both
  its like your afraid of facts  are you implying that facts cant be dangerous especially facts which might not actually be facts but are still used to inform public policy which effects human life
  no anon i dont see how consciousness arising from brain function is a dangerous fact
  magic  stop using that word it adds nothing to the discussion
  stop refusing to accept that there are natural and physical explanations for how the human body works
  thats because youre stupid and shortsighted  take a moment and try think of the practical applications of that fact and how it can effect human lives
  so what youre telling me is that youre afraid of facts and youre also unable to explain why you are also telling other people theyre the ones who are stupid and short sightedlol
  i dont  stop treating natural and physical explanations as if theyre somehow different than magic i mean what exactly do you think magic is from the perspective a magic user other than the applied knowledge of the magic users understanding of the natural world
  i dont engage people who make up theur own definitions of words its always a waste of time let me know when youre ready to use words correctly
  no thats not what im telling you  im telling you that if you cant see the real world negative sideeffects of treating the human mind as a machine from an ethical perspective then youre an idiot
  i didnt call it a machine youre the only one doing that i seriously should just accept that im too intelligent for this board its like teaching algebra to kindergarteners
  im not bafled by the complexity of consciousness im baffled by how to reconcile it with the physicalist view being baffle by it doesnt make it magic but it certainly also doesnt make it something that will inevitably be explained by physics at some point ti assume that physics will explain it even though there is not even the beginning of an explanation is not science it is closer to religious faith
  thats your precisely what youre doing though  you have declared that magic is whatever doesnt exist and therefore anyone that disagrees with your interpretation of the natural world must believe in magic as your conception of the natural world is inherently of the world as it actually exists and theirs is not
  the human body is third person objective quantitative and public  the human mind is first person subjective qualitative and private    the latter is not reducible to or identical with the former much like the collection of five pebbles differs from the abstract concept of 5
  to know everything there is to know about the physical state of a computer is to know or at least be able to deduce everything there is to know about the softwares current state assuming that computers are not sentient of course with sentient beings it seems this is not the case a total physical understanding would still it seems to me provide no explanation of why there are qualia
  you are quite literally branding it as supernatural in this post its extremely complex its not supernatural
  it doesnt matter if you didnt call the mind a machine because you are still treating it like one  i mean do you deny that your conception of the mind is that it is a system of understandable physical properties which can be broke down into understandable component processes
  magic is the supernatural which is what youre implying consciousness is
  a being has a higher chance of survival being aware than it does not being aware therefore consciousness was developed as a survival mechanism and to handle the flow of information and make choices    tldr consciousness is a survival mechanism
  that doesnt make something a machine biological organisms and organs arent machines youre continuing to make me explain things that i shouldnt need to explain that you should already know
  there is no such thing as the supernatural which is precisely why it is a worthless word
  makes a physicalist claim  someone brings up the hard problem  was this your hail mary play or something hope i dont understand why its a problem for your worldview
  i am not branding it as supernatural unless you insist that nonphysical phenomena are automatically supernatural
  that doesnt make something a machine  oh really  then what does
  i can imagine a being that is aware in the mechanical sense that a computer is aware but which is capable of solving problems at a human level yet it would not have awareness in the sense we are discussing here it would be like a much more powerful chess computer but would have no interiority no subjectivity evolution would have no reason to prefer the being that has interiority to the being that doesnt yet is equaly good at survival
  continues to use language to a priori declare that people who disagree with him are wrong without actually having proven anything
  let me give you an analogy   at one point in time we didnt know how bicycles stayed up while riding   im the guy who claims its something were learning about and will eventually figure out youre implying that it because bikes are magical and channel supernatural forces of the universe
  reductionism is a mistake
  machines arent biological organisms or human organs bring a functioning physical object doesnt make something a machine
  a being has a higher chance of survival being aware than it does not being aware  plants fungi and bacteria seem to get by just fine by the way since there cant be no gradient of consciousness as opposed to say intelligence you cant square it with gradualism
  there isnt a scientific explanation for most things
  i really wonder why the brain being a physical object drives people like you insane nothing changes its always been that way
  machines arent biological organisms or human organs  so you deny that the study of molecular machines is a part of biology
  thats ridiculous whats actually happening is by way of my own analogy you are a newtonian aggressively suggesting that gravity will eventually be grasped by your model if only given a little more time i on the other hand am suggesting your model has reached the end of its explanatory powers and that we need to fundamentally change our models to be able to understand and explain this phenomenon    science doesnt work by clinging to the same outdated tools which fail to explain something it works by experimenting with new models
  who says theres no gradient of consciousness
  they lose that distinction at higher levels of complexity they are called organs and organisms and not classified as machines
  except we learn more about how consciousness and cognition works and we have not hit a wall
  because there is no inherent ethical objection to the manipulation of physical objects so the reduction of the mind to a physical object sets alarm bells in people who rightfully conclude this to be the prelude to the manipulation of the human mind     if there is no supernatural distinction which separates the human mind from any other physical object then logically there is no valid scientific justification for granting the human mind ethical privileges over other physical objects there may be philosophical justifications but we all know how little esteem the scientific minded have for philosophy
  different names for the same thing dont get hung up on semantics humans made these categories they arent platonic forms
  except we learn more about how consciousness and cognition works and we have not hit a wall  except we have hit a wall that wall is the hard problem and all of the physicalist approaches yet proposed dont even begin to explain it most dont even attempt to and some start with the ridiculous proposition that its not real    im not saying cease all attempts to better understand the brain and how it links to consciousness but i think its at least worth exploring new models that might actually have explanatory powers
  your concerns are paranoid knowing theres no supernatural component to consciousness is not going to make people start killing others or whatever you think it opens the door to more importantly its the truth
  anon stop relying on philosophy for this question neurobiology is making progress here
  they lose that distinction at higher levels of complexity they are called organs and organisms and not classified as machines    why  that sounds like an arbitrary and unscientific distinction to me could you explain what physical property these conglomerations of molecular machines gain which causes them to lose their status as machines
  this is because the hard problem isnt real
  thats literally just flatout denial neurobiology is making literally no progress do you even understand the hard problem and why its an issue
  magnitudes higher degrees of complexity compared to any machine its so different that its awarded a different category
  t daniel dennett
  your concerns are paranoid knowing theres no supernatural component to consciousness is not going to make people start killing others or whatever you think it opens the door to    you say that as if all those ugly little incidents with eugenics in the 20th century never occurred
  magnitudes higher degrees of complexity compared to any machine its so different that its awarded a different category    yet you insist that the human mind should be reduced to a mere physical object despite its greater complexity
  it assumes consciousness isnt a physical phenomenon which in itself is an unproven and arguably unreasonable hypothesis roughly analogous to saying a computer program cant arise from physical hardware
  mass killings occur with or without religion and spiritual ideas youre literally suppressing the truth because of paranoia
  and i didnt call it a machine i called it an organ
  i never said you called it a machine i said you were treating it like one
  it assumes consciousness isnt a physical phenomenon  no no it doesnt the hard problem is the idea that theres an explanatory gap between our understanding of the brain and consciousness whether that actually means consciousness ultimately doesnt emerge from the brain or does the hard problem doesnt say several theories have emerged to address it some positing that physicalist explanations are inadequate some suggesting like you are that at this stage of our understanding of the brain we dont know but will and some suggesting that the hard problem isnt actually a problem because consciousness isnt a real phenomena
  progress such as
  were such complex machines that we appear to act out of free will but are really acting out biological algrothim made at birth
  mass killings occur with or without religion and spiritual ideas  so with that knowledge how do you justify the reckless pursuit of knowledge which make such incidents even easier to achieve
  there is progress on how the brain creates consciousness anon youre smart but dont be so fucking arrogant that you think you know the current neurobiological literature without looking at it
every time this topic comes up i am surprised by how many people dont understand the difference between cognition and consciousness what the concept of consciousness refers to or what the hard problem refers to they dont even understand it enough to argue against it and its not just a 4chan thing i see it elsewhere too and some people are surprised when we make jokes about pzombies
  brain and mind arent the same and you cant just reduce things without showing they are actually equal for example happiness is just dopamine is a crude oversimplification but such statements are riddled in materialist discussion
  identifying the regions and structure me responsible for conscious experience dont come into a thread on a science topic without knowing the current science and being condescending about not knowing it dont be a redditor
  progress such as
a first principles explanation of consciousness just holds no value its something better understood on macro scales this is the reason why only pseudoscientist podcasters care about the hard problem     we could also strive to understand geopolitics from first principles but why would we want to
  i dont make the statements like youre example because thats actually not true from a scientific perspective its much more than that
  
  weve always known that i you het hit on the head by a brick or drugged it affects our consciousness that doesnt explain though how consciousness can arise from the physical to learn more detail about how consciousness is correlated wih the physical which it obviously is is not to explain how qualia arise from physics those are two fundamentally different questions
  that if you get hit on the head or drugged it affects your consciousness
  again this is like denying that a computer program can arise from physical hardware
  actually read the hard problem read the literature relevant to it i dont have the patience to explain why what you think is helping to explain consciousness is just answering the easy problems of consciousness      just a primer
  
  stupid analogy once again actually read the literature there are categorical distinctions between consciousness and a computer program and other emergent phenomena for that matter these distinctions are exactly why we have a hard problem in the first place
  because the very idea there are things that exist that arent physical is supernatural nonsense    everything that actually exists is physical ie it exists within the universe is governed by the forces/laws same thing really that everything else is and is comprised of the fundamental building blocks of the universe    i cant prove anything but consciousness would seem to me to be an energy state arriving from a particular sort of complex data storage and processing structure of matter ie a brain indeed the very fact consciousness exists selfevidently suggests it is a fundamental property of the universe in some way at some level else it obviously wouldnt exist in the same way that the fact you experience gravity on a constant basis proves it exists     will we ever understand the physical mechanism or property that causes it who knows the fact that consciousness isnt transferable or externally verifiable but can only be experienced subjectively from one individual consciousness may be a hard block on our attempts to understand it honestly im fine with that
  name one i havent seen any that arent obvious you know a lot of actual scientists think this is total nonsense in the first place right
  name one  like i keep saying please just read the relevant literature its actually a fairly difficult concept to grasp and i dont want to explain it to you just to have you interrupt me to make illinformed arguments    you know a lot of actual scientists think this is total nonsense in the first place right  lots of actual scientists believe all kinds of nonsense emmanuel lasker chess champion and mathematician of extreme repute was one of the scientists who complained about einsteins theory of relativity einstein himself was then hesistant to accept qm modern day physicists arent themselves sure whether the copenhagen interpretation de brogilebohm interpretation many worlds or another dark horse interpretation is correct when it comes to qm    scientists often regard groundbreaking and crackpot ideas alike as absurd
  im asking you to name one characteristic of brain function creating consciousness that is totally out of line with the analogy of hardware creating a computer program i cant find anything in my reading like that thr color red for example is just the way your occipital lobe tells your conscious operations that the wavelength of light from some object activated specific cones in your eyeballs
  like i keep telling you read the relevant literature this is literally qualia 101 btw
  anon im starting to believe that you dont actually understand the theory youre putting forward
  wilfull ignorance  do your due dilligence and actually read up on a position before you argue with it    
  use your own words for this specific question i dont have time to read that entire article right now
  color red is just the way our eyes tell our brain we are looking at a certain wavelength huh funny nowhere in a wavelength measurement nor in the signals from my eyes to my brain do i see red its almost like the quality of my experiences cant be reduced to completely material explanations
im pretty sure computer operating systems would qualify as emergent phenomena since theyre accumulations of bits from which emerge something arguably greater than the sum of their parts
  for starters saying the color read is just the way your occipital lobe tells your conscious operations that the wavelength of light from some object activated specific cones in your eyeballs    doesnt explain 2 things why we have a conscious experience of red at all something not necessary it is not necessary for a computer to know information has been recieved it does so automatically so far as we know without presupposing panpsychism and without awareness and where the conscious experience of red emerges from you havent explained why or how it should take that form you havent explained anything at all relevant to the question youve missed the point
  and looking at a wavelength wouldnt tell you what the string of computer code for a color recognition code would be either this is exactly what im talking about the analogy that the brain is the hardware and consciousness is a program is solid your only attempt didnt work
  science has pretty much entirely moved away from teleological explanations towards mechanistic ones its not there to answer why
  recognizing the color red is necessary for primates and birds among other animals that presupposition that recognizing red isnt necessary is wrong its practical for primates more science less philosophy anon
  this is exactly what im talking about the analogy that the brain is the hardware and consciousness is a program is solid  its literally not at all not only is it not it doesnt even touch the hard problem it only addresses the easy problems of consciousness and having explained them you think youve explained the whole of the thing    your argument is a complete farce
  how is the sensation of the taste of an apple physical i mean the sensation itself not its physical correlates
  id say nothing a computer is doing is greater than the sum of its parts because everything had to be coded into it any way in which it seems greater is probably due to human input even ai chatbots are told how to take data and parse it into usable language all the seemingly great parts are put in by human minds
  certain physical areas of your brain become active at the taste of an apple
  everything that is acting as a cohesive whole is greater than the sum of its parts
  autism    autism and youre misuing the word recognizing you absolutely do not need a conscious experience of red which it to say have a mental picture of red inside your head in order to recognize it in a functional sense a computer can register a wavelength perform the tasks relevant to it and use it just as well as can be expected without ever needing a conscious experience
  youre not saying why youre not saying why because you cant because its a solid analogy
  correlates  fucking hell how do i know youve never even read anything on the hard problem
  its a false comparison because computers have clear reasons why certain things happen within them otherwise they crash for human beings we have no clue why for example seeing a human face can activate chemical signals but with computers we have created their architecture and dictated their methods of operation
  youre ignoring the fact that consciousness would be a command program that takes in necessary data and processes it
  ive noticed the same
  youre not saying why youre not saying why because you cant because its a solid analogy  i literally told you why you explain how correlates of consciousness behave without ever actually attempting to address why we have a conscious experience or how its formed    you have never once even attempted to address qualia in themselves because you probably dont even know how you dont even know what youre doing wrong because youre so utterly unfamiliar with the concept
  anyone who understands what the word consciousness refers to it isnt mental content or level of awareness the mere idea of 1/2mind is strictly nonsensical you either have it or dont theres nothing in between
  the taste of an apple is certain neurons firing telling you apple the soft problem is the hard problem the very existence of the hard problem is a hypothesis that there has to be something more than neurons firing to create consciousness
  youre ignoring the fact that consciousness would be a command program that takes in necessary data and processes it  thats absolutely unecessary consciousness is absolutely unecessary as a command program    you havent explained where it comes from or why its there youve stated well what if its a command program you assume it in your argument without every explaining it    its frustrating to talk to you because youre not even in the same ballpark youre not even playing the same game on the same continent
  you know that people spend portions of their day in a semi conscious trance right
  i dont think so a computer can only do the things that it has been told to do through human effort i dont see it as any greater than what it is the internet is but it isnt just a bunch of computers people are behind the internet
  those physical areas being active are the correlates they are not the sensation of the taste of an apple however
  if they are conscious of anything at all then they have 100 of the mind i dont care how rudimentary that experience might be
  the neurons firing is the sensation of taste  this makes no sense
  a program isnt concious although it processes and consciousness can process although it itself is not a process they arent alike especially since we make programs and therefore understand them whereas nobody understands completely consciousness
  the taste of an apple is certain neurons firing telling you apple  thats an answer that explains nothing you might as well have used a chomskyism what a waste of words    the soft problem is the hard problem  this is your problem you knuckledragger you dont understand the distinction or even why it poses a threat to your worldview so not only can you not answer the hardproblem you dont even really know what it is or how to address it no wonder you think progress is being made because you wouldnt even know what to look for you see progress made on the easy problems and you assume that it means the hard problem must also be being solved by the same means it isnt    the very existence of the hard problem is a hypothesis  denial of it is literally autistic it just shows a stubborn unwillingness to confront the upper limits of your explanatory model    that there has to be something more than neurons firing to create consciousness  the hard problem is a theory  not simply a problem  drown
  being unaware or running on autopilot doesnt mean you arent conscious only that it is directed at the thoughts within the mind like when you drive and think deeply about something and suddenly realize youve traveled quite far but dont remember the journey you are conscious of your thoughts but not completely of the surroundings
  youre thiking too hard     the most basic organisms take in energy to achieve homeostasis with time and environmental pressures thia turned into greater situational awareness and cognitive reasoning skills brains were evolved to better use the eye and ear emotional feelings and responses were a secondary effect    the gut evolved the brain to put more food in the gut this existential crisis shit is just an unintened aspect you arent going to turn into some enlightened übermensch fighting this how can a plow rebel against the farmer
  not him but i dont see how you could take the stance that the existence of the hard problem is somehow beyond debate and must be assumed true its one of the most contentious topics you could come up with and its nowhere close to rare for people to challenge that starting assumption in fact outside of 4chan its probably more common than not to see attacks on both cartesian dualism and idealism based arguments for a hard problem than it is to see people assuming that problem must exist and needs special accounting for by some new science that goes beyond ordinary physics chalmers definitely isnt who id pick as the source of todays conventional / mainstream approach towards the belief theres something lacking in physics that doesnt cover the allegedly literal thing that constitutes what its like to experience
  must be assumed true  the counterarguments for it are so weak that in my opinion at this point it should be taken as true the argument that it itself is an illegitimate problem rests on the idea that we are in fact pzombies and consciousness doesnt exist i dont know about you but i find that pretty absurd
  from scholarpedia  why are physical processes ever accompanied by experience and why does a given physical process generate the specific experience it doeswhy an experience of red rather than green for example  if you think these are illposed then you must claim no physical processes are in fact ever accompanied by experience or that color among other things is somehow intrinsic to those physical processes naïve realism  the first is beyond retarded the second contradicts both quantum theory and evolution
its obviously some sort of emergence experiments in principle might be able to triangulate with accuracy what phenomenon exaclty causes the awareness but thats some late stage civilization stuff whats strange about this topic is it always boils down to the people that literally dont believe consciousness as if they literally dont understand what its like to experience literal npcs
i pretty much spent my entire childhood terrified that i cant identify how it is that i can make visual pictures in my head how can you see a picture of a flower in your own consciousness without actually being able to identify how you are seeing a picture
  what the fuck is consciousness and how does it work  its chemicals
  if it wasnt physical it wouldnt exist    the word physical is a weird word that really only has meaning if you believe in the supernatural if you dont and i dont physical becomes synonymous with exists
  its amazing also how does creativity work if chemicals have laws that dictate their actions
  but it does exist and you cant explain how it is physical
tfw there is no scientific explanation for why anything exists at all  another one
people are computers in a network their hardware is the body and the proccesor is the brain the software is the uniqueness and identity but the consciousness is the internet that feeds through wifi their network software that only comprehends tcpip but cannot understand the whole world wide web ecosystem
  false equivalence since people are what makes the internet and computers run
  look at this brainlet and laugh
  science is biggest spook nigga
  
  say nigger like a man faggot science is the biggest enabler of myself and my own far from whatever subjective bullshit youre suggesting it is
there is no scientific explanation for consciousn
what would europe look like if he won
no aglos
slightly more advanced than it does now he was progressive after all
  i seriously believe france back then had a lot to offer to the rest of europe and that napoleon and french leadership were moderate enough to build a great system
it would be french
  of course take malta for example napoleon took it away from the medieval order of st john and     during his very short stay six days napoleon accomplished quite a number of reforms notably the creation of a new administration with a government commission the creation of twelve municipalities the setting up of a public finance administration the abolition of all feudal rights and privileges the abolition of slavery and the granting of freedom to all turkish slaves 2000 in all on the judicial level a family code was framed and twelve judges were nominated public education was organised along principles laid down by bonaparte himself providing for primary and secondary education fifteen primary schools were founded and the university was replaced by an ecole centrale in which there were eight chairs all very scientific in outlook notably arithmetic and stereometry algebra and stereotomy geometry and astronomy mechanics and physics navigation chemistry etc    he was much more forward thinking than his enemies and he did not have this idea of dominating the conquered people but rather integrating them into the empire
  the xix century wouldve turned out completely different   france would be the absolute demographic cultural and industrial hegemon of europe with little to no contest   nationalist and liberal movements might have still happened although radically different   colonization of africa would have been just between the british french and spanish    overall it mightve turned out better the germanfrench rivalry was the biggest threat to peace in europe and no german state would be a match for a napoleonic empire only russia could pose a threat and since were coming from an premise that napoleon won then that means russia would not have been a slightest threat to france
  and without wwi and wwii the us would take much longer to emerge as world leader if at all

  climate change will fuck our shit up in a couple decades lol
  true enough    tfw all the boomers that deny it and enable it will never have to face the consequences
  i wonder if its better to be a homeless man today or say the king of a small country like albania in the middle ages
  better to be a king i think at least you have respect and status which is important for human psychology the down side is no antibiotics
  thats the point its not a boomer problem so they wont pay to prevent it
  its true that even the poor have a lot of creature comforts today that the super rich of the medieval period didnt its important to remember that a king would have a palace and an army of servants being homeless really sucks
    holy shit can we stop it by abolishing borders for only western countries

  united states  france
  admittedly so  their respective political classes have really buddied up
  came here to post this though de gaulle did his best to fuck it up
  de gaulle never want to destroy relation with american he just want to not be under any influence sphere you cant hate him for this
  fair enough but i still think he was an asshole theres no excusing  vive le québec libre
  probably because you americans attempted to install a puppet government after the war and control frances foreign policy    you pretend to be friends with countries until they do something you dont like then show that you are oppressors
  be french  be butthurt that germans rekt you  be double butthurt that the us and uk liberated you  hide your shame and gratitude by pretending that the us would have installed another vichy government  the absolute state of frogs

  but i spent my holidays there on mull and skye  did i got tricked

  youre english
  scots are anglos
  anglocelts perhaps
  canadians are either british or not really canadian
  the english are also anglocelts then   the scots are so culturally and genetically similar to the english that it only makes sense to include them both as subsets of the british nation which is often colloquially on /his/ called the anglo nation so as to include british diaspora in america and oceania   the welsh and scottish are just as british as the english altogether they make up the masterrace
  the english are also anglocelts then  roman rape babies just check the ammount of black hair between brits this is a theory that i pulled out of my ass but just based in that fact makes sense they were celts once

     haitis first president jeanjacques dessalines called polish peoplethe white negroes of europe which was then regarded a great honour as it meant brotherhood between poles and haitians
  it was the kingdom of france that aided the us in the war of independence not any of the republics nor the empires in fact the us quickly aligned itself against the young republic with the proxy war   before the modern era the republics were never close allies to the us while britain has since around the end of the war of 1812 been a close trading partner with friendly relations and in the modern era both have been allies with the us though britain has always clearly been much closer   also that anglo connection

  in haiti there still is a popular myth that many polish soldiers became sympathetic to the former slaves cause and deserted the french supporting jeanjacques dessalines in significant numbers with entire units changing sides24 in fact the actual desertion rate was much lower nonetheless about 150 polish soldiers joined the haitian rebels24  myth

we english are good at forgiving our enemies it releases us from the obligation of liking our friends
  community partially descends from the 400 surviving polish legionnaries that either defected to the slaves or were taken prisoner1  by the time the french forces retreated from the island in 1803 about 4000 poles had died either from disease or combat of the survivors about 400 remained on the island a few dozen were dispersed to the nearby islands or to the united states and about 700 returned to france24urbankowski claims 6000 sent and 330 returned25  both use the same numbers and assert the same thing unlikely to be a myth in that case dont you think
  joining australia is economically a bad idea
  the myth i mean about is that the vast majority of poles polish legions defected to haitians when i reality majority died for france in hopes of them supporting polish independence  the wiki has very incopetent writing where in one source they claim one thing and on another completely diffirent

  everyone  worst answer considering the wars with all the neighbours and the iberians england has been a bro at times but also our nemesis then theres germany whos been our main trade partner except from some köln assholes or that slipup during the 40s finally theres the hanseacratic league who supplied the netherlands with grain fish and woodstuffs but our main ally has definitely been     fuck the ocean
hungary  austria    its funny because i believe that austria is also our most fought enemy
  colombia  peru  it has been a pretty shitty country since the beginning at least since the spanish left the biggest enemy has always been itself
nigeria  niger
austria  i dont even fucking know maybe croatia or poland
are ideas morals and beliefs synthetic or organic
well good and evil are roughly cognate with cooperation and defection so morals are rough descriptions of real world forces that act on higher evolutionarily derived organisms
  it annoys me that the term manmade is considered an antonym of natural humans are natural and our beliefs can only be natural since they are our product also this thread is too highbrow for /his/

why has nobody made a film about pope sergius the 3rd yet this story writes itself an italy in disorder the starting of the pornocracy and the disposing of two previous popes just to name some things
  because nobody gives a fuck about that in hollywood we prefer inaccurate movies like 300 black panther braveheart and gladiator
why is this obvious lie perpetuated i was literally taught that whites simply went into africa and threw nets over blacks it didnt even make sense to me back then    my personal theory is it is perpetuated because of what it implies about black and white people it implies white supremacy it is ultimately a manifestation of an weird insecurity within a large segment of white people imagine if somebody willingly gave you five dollars and when you got home you began bragging about that you beat him up and took it how insecure would one have to be
europeans raided for slaves where the climate wasnt too bad and the villages seemed vulnerable    like when the portuguese tried to attack villages in mali and got raped by the local tontigui afterwards
  mali  
  no not modern mali the western edge of the empire in the djolof kingdom
  it is ultimately a manifestation of an weird insecurity within a large segment of white people  no the idea that whites just ran around with big butterfly nets is pushed because whites need to be supremely guilty to enforce modern political agendas  merely taking part in an established africanrun business would suggest that blacks share blame with whites    cant have that whites need to view their past generations as evil
  no one is suprised that american education is shit
not sure when you went to school op  but i was taught that some africans did rub hands with europeans in high school  slave trading had multiple forms of transaction from africa to the europeans everyone knows this  and the idea that they ran around with nets is entirely valid in that it did happen in some places
  history was misrepresented to you if you were left with the impression that europeans captured as many or more slaves as were sold to them
  and the idea that they ran around with nets is entirely valid in that it did happen in some places  yes but not as much as were sold    but i dont think everyone does know this its not what i was taught in school either here in england
  same my high school was mostly black and we had a whole unit on the slaver kingdoms op is probably just mad about the pop culture idea
    we know that much of africa was invaded colonized and made part of the slave trade  you ignore this and perpetrate the idea that african slavers were anywhere near as prevalent  supposedly in order to alleviate the boogeyman of white guilt that apparently the zeitgeist is imposing upon present day white people with ardent fervor  this aint it chief  additionally whenever slavery is made the subject of media such as movies or music and some documentaries the focus is often on the treatment of slaves once theyre already in servitude rather than the methods of transportations of those slaves
so what sort of mental gymnastics do white supremacists use to justify enslaving the children of captives     baby is born  lock them in shackles  this somehow isnt your fault
   ignore this and perpetrate the idea that african slavers were anywhere near as prevalent  is this bait  how would europeans have the military reach to conquer that number of africans to source the number of african slaves transported to the new world when they had no permanent colonies or standing armies located on the african continent at the time  the only people who could have provided europeans with that number of slaves were the existing powerful african tribes and kingdoms who sold defeated and less powerful tribes or acted as middlemen for preexisting african slave trade routes which had been in extensive use to arab lands for more than 500 years previously    only a minority of enslaving would have been able to be achieved by european pirates raiding vulnerable coastal villages    use your brain
  op is probably just mad about the pop culture idea  why shouldnt he be the pop culture idea is the idea that counts its literally the popular cultural idea    if the pop culture idea doesnt match up to reality and no great effort is to correct this its only natural to start asking why
  africa was not colonized until after the slave trade ended
  why are you acting as if enslaving the children of slaves is somehow a remarkable concept
  europeans never enslaved anyone  none of it was our fault
  the pop culture idea of caligula is a raving schizophrenic maniac but youre not whining about that
  there were colonies before it
  mullahs middle men my anon also they provided assistance as well and i dunno fueled the trade intensely    also it wasnt only kingdoms anon many of it were just african merchants and private entities there were many on the continent completely against the trade
  not really just outposts sold to them by local chiefs and kings they didnt go in guns blazing
  because slavery make him feel bad 
  portuguese and dutch were balls deep in their area
  it always irks me that people treat africa as if its not an entire continent many ethnic groups explicitly prohibited slavery others based their society on it and everything in between
  why shouldnt he be the pop culture idea is the idea that counts its literally the popular cultural idea      except we all know that you think cherry picked screenshots grabbed by fellow poltards with the explicit intention to trigger you into a frothing raging mess is the pop culture
i personally believe the spanish didnt put more effort into conquering africa because they needed slaves since the crown laws prevented them from enslaving people who swore loyalty to the crown and christ it was easier to just get them from africa since they didnt have to worry about those rules once slavery became less useful and they lost their new world holdings taking land became much more important to them
  my cattle have just had calves should i just let them run free no because they are a product of my property the same way i got the property rights over anything produced from a machine i own or the crops from the fields i own
  they are not white
  lol you just admitted youre wrong    whites never enslaved black people  none of it was our fault
  so what sort of mental gymnastics do white supremacists  same ones blacks use to enslave pygmy people i guess  speaking of which its 2018 when will black people finally figure out slavery is wrong    they will one day right  right
  merely taking part in an established africanrun business would suggest that blacks share blame with whites  would also suggest that history is an immensely complex game of conflicting loyalties and doublecrossings instead of a good side vs a bad side
  because caligula is dead and black people arent
  militias in east congo are all black people    come back after you stop selling slavic women to turks
  been enslaving raping and cannibalizing pygmys from couple thousand years  still doing in 2018  youre right you really dindu nuffin
   theyre negros
was his land reform actually a bad idea or was cato being a dick
thats not really the immediate issue the civil war was started over but yeah cato was just being a dick
  cato was just being what all of the optimates ultimately were parasites enriching themselves at the expense of the roman state and populous   when it was proposed by the populares that the parasites had already had their fill the optimates responded by plunging the republic into two civil wars in as many generations and even murdering the legitimate hos on the concentrated floor of the senate itself  all in an effort to keep their illgotten gains and associated power    the fact that every single member of the optimates did not live out their last years destitute and enslaved in restitution for their countless acts of sedition against rome is one of the great tragedies of history
it is weird that the empire ended up being vastly better for the median roman than the ostensibly forthepeople republic was
fuck i cant look at that image without seeing the godawful reconstruction now
  an absolutely based and redpilled post my friend

  oh wow multiculturalism under a dominate islamic society sounds great im glad all of europe will be like that in half a century     castrate me now
            during the edo period in japans history farmers would kill their second or third son as a means of population control sparing the girls as they could be married off or sold into the sex trade     in japan the killing of babies has a history of more than 1000 years it became prevalent during the feudal edo era 16031868 as a means of population control farmers killed their second or third sons upon birth in what was called mabiki an agricultural term that originally meant thinning out  usually the daughters were spared because they could be married off sold as servants or prostitutes or sent off to become geisha or professional entertainers but in northern japan alone between 60000 and 70000 cases of mabiki were recorded each year

op  why does x happen    everybody in the thread  jews  jews  jewish lies  kikes  (((them)))  jews  oy vey  goyim  jews  jews  jews    this is just a kneejerk edgy canned reaction at this point how many of you actually believe that the jews are evil
  how many of you actually believe that the jews are evil  i do and i believe it because they are
its just leakage from 4chans anus aka /pol/ dont let it get to you just make good threads and reply to other threads with facts and otherwise insightful comments
  jews arent evil but i do think zionism has done and is doing a lot of bad things
  were more angry with hollywood for distorting history  which is why it lingers around ere
  evil no hypocrites yes
  this
  being this far up your own ass
  jews do thing  omg why do you blame jews for thing  stop doing thing and youll stop getting blamed for it we both know you wont though
  if anything a lot of anons have come to defend jews here though or else there wouldnt be so much antiholocaust denial
  i usually assume jews posters are memeing but there are cases where jews are actually the answer
  jidf thread spotted no one fall for this
  also op if you expect with this post people would stop using this words  then youre really stupid  youre just encouraging them more just to spite you
  holocaust denial is the epitome of retardation though of course were going to fight retardation with irrefutable facts and figures on a settled subject
  criticising the actions of elites who happen to be jews is antisemetism  lol
  international clique  globalists  powers that be  them  ((()))  dog whistles all dog whistles for the jew
  that picture just gave me eye cancer i demand a removal of it in order to protect our precious population
  im not an antisemite by the way
  thats bullshit mass culture films are in themselves extremely expensive to make whether theyre made by hollywood or not therefore you can expect big money whether government or corporate money to be bankrolling these enterpises these interests are always going to set an agenda or message because theyre not going to waste money just for cultures sake theyre either appealing to the lowest common denominator or propagandizing to them
  once again stop doing thing and you wont get blamed for thing  we jews are so clever thats why we always move into positions of power over the goyim and rule them for their own good  wtf why are these goyim saying we control everything and blaming our policies on us  if you cant stand the heat get out of the kitchen
  whites are superior and if you dont agree with me you are a leftist jewnigger worshipping cuck  obssesed  jews control everything so get used to this  imagine being this retarded
  if you cant stand the heat get out of the kitchen  keep referencing those ovens the dog whistle just keeps getting louder and louder smart people realize youre just posturing its funny you think theyre going to buy these inference that stand no ground under the light of scrutiny   youre outnumbered pal
  socially awkward incels are just really really obsessed with jews for whatever reason
  whites are superior  nice strawman
  its a turn of phrase anon it has nothing to do with the holocaust stop being autistic
  dog whistles  called out on dog whistles  its just a turn of phrase bro stop being autistic  you fool no one
  muh dog whistle    o b s e s s e d
goyim arent even allowed to reference kitchens anymore without being declared antisemitic and jews wonder why antisemitism is on the rise
  im anti zionist not anti semitic just because i think isreal is a shitty country doesnt mean im a stormfag
  antisemitism is on the rise because of people like you normalizing words like goyim and grasping at straws when jewish people who again are paranoid to the bone that these atrocities are about to repeat get a little worried about dog whistlers out there excuse me for not wanting to be made into a lampshade by a bunch of mislead barbarians
  if israel falls it will be another holocaust tho
  he openly admits to disliking jews  omg a literal fucking racist nazi  this is the shit that people have to deal with now  same with being antigay
  its on the rise because we cant speak ill of them i dont like anyone with a special status over me
  people like you normalizing words like goyim  by normalizing do you mean spreading awareness of the jewish word for nonjews     excuse me for not wanting to be made into a lampshade by a bunch of mislead barbarians  well im sorry but what exactly do you think the natural reaction to a bunch of know it all busy bodies putting their two cents into everything is do you at least acknowledge that jews have a disproportionate influence on society and politics
  after the defeat of nazi germany claims circulated that ilse koch wife of the commandant of buchenwald concentration camp had possessed lampshades made of human skin and had specifically tattooed prisoners killed in order to use their skin for this purpose2 after her conviction for war crimes general lucius d clay the interim military governor of the american zone in germany reduced her sentence to four years prison on the grounds there was no convincing evidence that she had selected nazi concentration camp inmates for extermination in order to secure tattooed skins or that she possessed any articles made of human skin3   why do you people lie
  if they werent a militarist apartheid state they wouldnt be threatened
  antisemitism is on the rise because jewish elites are disproportionately responsible for subverting the west
  also disproportionately responsible for creating the west as much as jews created socialism they also created neoliberalism
  lame performism because they think they have to appeal to /pol/faggots to be cool its the same shit in left wing circles as pretending islam is good or trans people are hot because you have to larp to get those woke points
   as much as jews created socialism they also created neoliberalism  jews create the two greatest nation wrecking ideologies of all time  why do they persecute me so jpeg
  actual antizionist here you would not complain constantly about the jews if you cared about antizionism because the way zionism manifests is actually largely as a ultranationalistic antisemitic movement that aligns with the farright because they hate diaspora jews and think theyre traitors to israel and that waves of antisemitism in western countries are good because to quote notable zionist yaron london     all forms of zionism hold the perception that a certain extent of antisemitism benefits the zionist enterprise to put it more sharply antisemitism is the generator and ally of zionism masses of jews leave their place of residence only when their economic situation and physical safety are undermined masses of jews are shoved to this country rather than being attracted to it the yearning for the land of zion and jerusalem is not strong enough to drive millions of jews to the country they love and make them hold on to its clods     the only times as an antizionist its okay to be frustrated with the jewish community is when their community has so largely been brainwashed by israeli nationalism that they act as effective attack dogs against anyone who is israel critical hence why huge amounts of jews vote for trump against the democrats because obamas bad relationship with bibi and in the uk campaign against corbyn but its not jewish people really at fault its the insane amount of money astroturfing and psyops conducted by the state of israel
oy vey whats the deal with those jew child rapists
  also here is the fun thing the farright constantly call the left and liberals as being manipulated by the joos in reality jewish groups and zionist groups tend to be extremely right wing and zionists in particular work closely with farright groups much of the soros shit came out of israel propaganda actil mills across europe farright groups have been getting funding from israel and farright figures have very close relationships with netanyahu  the goal of israel is to get antisemitism to rise so jews flee to israel or become far more paranoid and proisrael in their voting and support in israel in other countries    so literally it is actually the right who are controlled by da joos in reality zionists
                  why do you anti white leftypol shills want an anti white safespace
  its the insane amount of money astroturfing and psyops conducted by the state of israel  so the jewish community then
    shilling for anti white jews is a good thing   why do you support white genocide
jews  money and money  the root of all evil its that simple really
  rightwingers that hate israel because jooos are larpers regardless of how many time they praise hitler
   whistles    what would be the point in dog whistling on 4chan exactly
    i agree with this but peoples outrage is pretty fucking selective    after the coup egyptian soldiers killed more people in a night than the idf has in the last several gaza wars combined in syria libya and iran demonstrations like those in gaza and the west bank are routinely met with live ammunition and hundreds dead the sad thing is that israel is ironically the best nation for arab free speech rights in the region    this isnt to excuse their more heinous acts but it strikes me as ironic when persian and pakistani aquientences will rail against israel yet if they tried a standard gaza style protest back home theyd be mowed down in the streets by their own people
    you sound like a nigger screaming about how whites deserve death because they are keeping the black man down by being wealthy    jews do better because they choose to drop out less commit less crime spend more time studying divorce less and have a significantly higher iq due to genetic factors    youre no different than tyrone who wants to jack your car because your job is too nice and you dont deserve it same logic same nog behavior
  bbut our neighbour regimes are worse  even though we helped install them  shut the fuck up zionist
  not particularly because not all jews are zionists and i think many diaspora jews would be horrified if they actually found out what hardcore zionists think about them    zionists are hardright nationalists first and foremost they actually dont give a shit about jews or the jewish community they see diaspora jews as useful idiots at best and traitors to israel at worst and think that only israel matters
  western standards are applied to israel as they are supposed to be a civilized western country not a backward arab theocracy
  jewish supremacist dont care about the jewish community  you are a certified anti white leftypol retards
  israel actively supported the iranian revolution and supported assad and qaddafi    how is it being a brainlet    the only one that makes sense would be israel supporting the 2013 egyptian coup but to be honest i know of no good sources saying they were actively involved although im sure they gave tacit report    regardless toppling the muslim brotherhood had massive public support the largest protests in egyptian history werent 2011 they were the days before the coup with millions on the street demanding that the military remove morsi or they would    so are you a butthurt arab brainlet or a /pol/fag incel
  how did you misunderstand his point so badly the white nationalists dont think nationalistic israelis are bad since they are in their own state and not in theirs israelis are not the rich world controlling jews theyre normal people with normal jobs with normal salaries lower than much of europe has they hate the rich hollywood and bankster jews in the west they ally with zionists since they too hate the rich liberal jews in america that dont want to contribute to israel outbof a white nationalist stance jewish leaving europe for their own nation state is acdream come true basically the haavara agreement finally came into fruition
    if a group chimped out like gazans in the uk usa or germany people there would want them wiped out with live ammunition too    gaza is also under embargo by egypt and the west bank its basically a gangster state of terrorists who see their own peoples blood as an easily disposable resource to trade for gibs    does anyone honestly think that if the arabs overran israel and took it it would become a rich free arab state    palestinians would remain poor and obese and their leaders would set up the same shitty backwards regime that all their brethren have
  cant rebut a rebut an argument so the anit white shill instantly goes an cries about /pol/  why do you worship jews
    /pol/ is full of white nationalists who want to see israel nuked the funniest thing is them thinking the shell of what is left of the syrian army is going to roll into israel with bases assad at their head any day now
  funny how you never meet white nationalists that hate israel usually its the shemagh wearing leftists that are against israel because muh palestinians
  obviously not all jews are evil    i am a nationalist that means i believe the host people should rule in their own nation because i believe only the host people is able to uphold and advance life and culture in their nation    jews have partly conciously partly organized partly disorganized gained controlled of the west by taking control of banking the news papers and the media hollywood and the politics to a large extent    jews and the host people have different interests  it is in the jews interest to work against nationalism promote immigration sunder the nuclear family root the people out from their people and history etc so that they can easily control what is happening in the country so the host people cant organize and recognize what is going on     this is not a meme and its not funny at all    the jews are up to 80 responsible and behind feminism breakup of the nuclear family anti nationalism immigration degeneracy like decadent art and pornography erossion of moral standards and general cancer modernism
  those are not white nationalists theyre either neonazis or more likely edgy muslims pretending to be white nationalists a true white nationalist would never support muslims even against jews
  make claim that israel put all the current mena leaders in power with zero evidence  i explain that this makes sense colonialism benefited israel and they definitely didnt want the shah out  hurr having an iq over 80 makes your antiwhite
  if a group chimped out like gazans in the uk usa or germany people there would want them wiped out with live ammunition too    no doubt but what would actually happen if they would be arrested and tried in a court of law like civilized societies do    israel has essentially created palestinian concentration camps and now cries about how they are not fighting fair while they build walls around them knock down their houses and attempts to starve them out what palestinians would make of their country if they had it back is pretty irrelevant without israel the area would likely be far more peaceful than it is now
    mass migration is happening because    a poor nations are not developing quickly and poor governance and corruption makes living in them shit being poor and on gibs in the west is better so why not go    b rich people benefit from mass migration it makes labor cheaper real estate and rents worth more and allows you to rob the treasury since the new migrants need housing education and health care so you can tax the middle class to provide those services and the people providing the services get rich as shit    jews are not the majority of rich people your standard gop leader is the guy who made mass migration happen notice how trump had both houses of congress and they didnt pass one 1 bill limiting migration
  he wants a safe space for nonwhites /pol/acks to larp as whites  based soiboi poster
  what is reading comprehension ive clearly stated that zionists often work with the farright to literally attack jewish people because they hate diaspora jews and think all jews should be in israel serving the state  zionists hate diaspora jews theyre not jewish supremacists theyre israeli nationalists
  you sound like a nigger screaming about how whites deserve death because they are keeping the black man down by being wealthy  how often do you hear the jew telling the black man that hes wrong about the white man keeping him down  never in fact the jew typically does the opposite and rallies the black man against the white manthats the key detail you people always leave out when you make that vapid comparison    when a jew is in a position of power the jew says its because he worked hard  when a white is in a position of power the jew says its because of racism and discrimination  and that is why you are hated
  israelis are not the rich world controlling jews  have you never heard of the retarded zog conspiracy
    peaceful like egypt syria or libya    itd be a violent arab shit hole    america did put its shitty nativesin concentration zones and genocided the rest
  see    search in the archive the word leftist and its respective op post    yall are obssesed funny
  monarchs have partly conciously partly organized partly disorganized gained controlled of the west by taking control of religion the printing press and the media and the politics to a large extent    monarchs and the host people have different interests it is in the monarchs interest to work against nationalism promote immigration sunder the nuclear family to create a rootless peasantry and laboring class root the people out from their local people and history etc so that they can easily control what is happening in the multicultural empire so the host people cant organize and recognize what is going on     really makes me think
  leftypol subhuman still crying for an anti white safespace for his jew and nigger worship     the jewish supremacist nation isnt jewish supremacist   you are a fucking shabbos goy
  why do you support white genocide
  notice how trump had both houses of congress and they didnt pass one 1 bill limiting migration  notice how anything trump does pass gets blocked by activist judges
  he cant hes a leftist npc
  lets pretend israel isnt actively attempting to destabilize all its neighbors to keep them weak    with israel gone the real problem might be a peaceful united arab world power i have to imagine thats the only reason the western powers support israel at all i dont see israel keeping their support for very long if they continue on with their current oppressive apartheid state however public opinion and attention will swing to them eventually one good photo of another dead palestinian child could be all it takes
  none of what you said has any relation to reality though
  preach it brother the donald will show those kikes maybe youll finally be recognized as honorary white on /pol/ if you shill hard enough
  youre not white unless you worship the jews like a neocon or a leftist   why do you supper white genocide leftypol 
  ive read more history than you faggot its absolutely true all monarchs were rootless cosmopolitans promoted the destruction of nations and the imposition of their special snowflake religions
  who said anything about white genocide ahmed
  no you havent and the claim that monarchs sundered the nuclear family is ridiculous
  human beings are individuals therefore i cant claim the jews are inherently bad or good    however i can claim that jewish culture the jewish religion and jewish history are antagonistic and vile which i feel yes they largely are  due to the culture and history of a group largely affecting the majority of its members i would even go so far as to say that a majority of jews are loathsome    does that answer your question
  why do you leftypol shills support white genocide and worship the jews
  ok tell me how tsar nicholas ii protected the nuclear family by industrializing the country and sundering traditional peasantry away from the countryside into alienating jungles of cheap tenements with 6 people per room subsisting off of meat water how is austria hungary protecting the family by creating a huge cesspool of urban poor and jews in vienna how did the swedish empire among other warring early modern kingdoms and empries sustain the nuclear family by putting conscription systems in place that stripped traditional family of young males for endless wars that made them beholden to financiers
  yeah from muslims
  when stalin industrializes the country its good  when the tsar does it its bad  inb4 you claim not to be a fucking tankie even though your rhetoric stinks of communism
  i see that im arguing with a bot its no coincidence that it spouts the same phrases each and every meta thread on /his/ its either a /pol/ack whos ingested too much lead and mercury for after reading too much sex magick literature or some chinese bot whos paid to shit up any meaningful discussion on a history board i wont argue with a braindead monkey who projects his erotic apocalyptic fantasies unprompted onto everyone who disagrees with himself
  not everyone here is leftpol you dumb nigger its just that here stormfags are louder
  stalin only completed what the traditional tsars alex iii and nickie ii brought into being i never said anything about stalin  fucking tankie even though your rhetoric stinks of communism  so anyone who makes conclusions you dont like is communist kys
  anti white reddit shill instantly cries muh russian bots       why are you leftypol shills so dishonest why do you support white genocide
  why do you support leftypol raiding /his/
  no not anyone just people who use transparently commie rhetoric like alienating tenement jungles
  every bot has to do with muh shillary xdd  lol
  leftypol shill still crying for an anti whiter safespace   ill ask again why do you support white genocide
  the marxist terminology for alienation has a very specific meaning im using it as a synonym for depressing
poes law
  how is a tenement jungles anymore depressing than a life in peasants shack  how does a peasant moving his family to a city for work sunder the nuclear family
    weak deflection fact is the gop straight up refused to consider the few bills proposed that even minorly reduced migration    you could end illegal migration tomorrow and wed still have a flood of poor unskilled workers with no assets and tons of retarded kids moving here each and every year
  i dont use the word evil  i think theyre highly judeocentric id say ethnocentric but it doesnt quite get at it tribal and are basically a walking inversion of catholicism in both good and bad ways  the religion is based around rejecting christianity and really formed after/as christianity was forming  they have a common root in prechristian judaism   they have certain pleasant traits and certain unpleasant traits  also i crave ashkenazi women particularly mischlings who are the actual masterrace
  lampshade  repeats the antieuropean canard
  zionists in particular work closely with farright groups  this was true up until recently im not sure how true it is now in western europe and america since the sunniisraeli alliance has kicked into gear in australia its certainly embarrassing and why i wont vote for one nation the whole political spectrum aside from maybe  clive palmer is terrible  greens socialist alliance anti white but anti zionist and pro poor  one nation not anti white zionist  labour and liberals anti poor and zionist  honestly i might vote socialist alliance because at least its a fuck you
  the keystone of jewish behaviour and peoples frustration with jews is probably the hypocrisy
  which i should mention is the core of christs critique of pharisees   the version of judaism that weve had since the time of christ has been pharisaical judaism

humanity starts irreversibly fucking up the planet heading towards extinction  all the rest of history is a kids joke honestly
daily reminder that every person on the planet has teflon in their bloodstream
  irreversibly  yeah no even chernobyl will be inhabitable within a mere 20k years once fossil fuels are gone and the population contracts it will all find a new equilibrium relatively quickly
muh global warming  the ice caps should have melted 50 times by now according to al gore yet theyre still here thiccer than ever fuck off kid
  a mere 20k years  i cant really tell if it was ironic posting
  someone once said something wrong  therefore everything is wrong forever  you fuck off and discuss the global warming hoax on /pol/ or something /his/ is a scientific board
  anatomically modern humans have been around for what 100k years recorded history is 5k years 20 thousand years is long but not forever in any sense of the word
  chernobyl is uninhabitable now
  the forests in the area are full of animals if anything the nuclear accident saved that area from humans
    so apparently internet sources say anything from several hundred to several ten thousand years     as for being uninhabitable now it is considered that because the radiation increases risks of cancer and stuff not immediately deadly but not something you want to risk for you or your children if you dont need to animals especially quick breeding short lived ones have less of a problem with it    its possible the 20k years or longer referred to the time until the sealed off reactor itself has decayed to safe levels apparently it takes spent nuclear fuel some 10k years to decay to the levels of naturally occuring uranium ore thats interesting to know in case well encounter an unmanaged reactor accident somewhere in the future
  /his/ is a scientific board  most hilarious thing ive read today also global warming is has no scientific evidence supporting it get dabbed on kid
  so apparently internet sources say anything from several hundred to several ten thousand years   caesium 137 has halflife of 30 years there might be other nuclei feeding it but most reasonable would be to see decline to natural levels in matter of 300500 years
  you are an ineducated idiot who tries to sound smart but has no idea what he is talking about i hate fags mindlessly yapping about how bad is atomic energy radiation in the zone is no bigger now than natural radiation of the earth people live there right now only dangerous areas are the ones where humans stockpiled irradiated equipment and the sarcophagus itself
  you are an ineducated idiot who tries to sound smart but has no idea what he is talking about  projection  people live there right now  pensioneers that will likely die before cancer could manifest workers specifically leave the area in shifts to reduce exposure to radiation
  you are an ineducated idiot who tries to sound smart but has no idea what he is talking about  so are you average background radiation might be on par with natural highrad areas but there are still hotspots soil full of casesium shit being concetrated in fungi etc for example of effects 2010s studies on chernobyl birds show significantly higher chance of eye deformation albinism and tumor occurance than in normal population     just because the shit isnt some eldritch horror oil barons would like it to be doesnt change the fact that the contamination is still present and dangerous
  /his/ is a scientific board  being this self important  /his/ is a plebbitinfested shithole in a vietnamese potato farming forum about anime please gas yourself if you think this board is seriously scientific or in any way better than /pol/ when all its done is help kill 4chan culture and replace it with its bastard child
history before fossil fuels are used to harvest fossil fuels     nothing much happening here     history after fossil fuels have been transferred into the atmosphere     nothing much happening here     the two centuries we happen to live in     humanity fuck yeah
  or in any way better than /pol/  most of boards are better than /pol/ the worst aspect of /his/ is that its frontier board for /pol/ish expansion the fact this board survived and didnt succumb to the constant stream of neonazi bullshit wasnt expected during its inception
  global warming is true but should be ignored and humanity should shift into maximum exploitation until we leave this shithole of a planet in a few decades    debate me protip you cant
  good luck with terraforming mars or any other planet anon totally feasible within century or too
just leaving this here  
  go advertise your popmusic somewhere else zoomer
  swine have taken over the area because they are more resistant for some reason but if you want children with birth defects sure go and live there

  until we leave this shithole of a planet in a few decades  we dont even have proven nuclear fission propulsion systems and we dont even have a functioning spacecraft capable of providing centrifugal gravity were not leaving any time soon and even if we did theres either nowhere worth going without the necessary infrastructure not enough space or little worth living for with the tradeoffs necessary for survival
could the mongols have conquered the americas if there was a land route
  they did conquer the americas thats how the native americans got there
  they did america was white before the mngols came
  there was a land route but the japs flooded it thats how japan wasnt conquered either
  if there was a land route americans would probably have modern horses instead of none at all in the 12th century so its a bit up in the air whether theyd develop the same riding culture in time for a mongol arrival
im a dumb person but i wanna hear other anons share their opinions on this matter the rise of political correctness in western society    heres my shitty view and i hope someone can join in and give me some input on what exactly is happening why when a woman says that x male has raped me or beaten her and its about some famous person everyone online and media tv social everything  goes apeshit crazy and goes on the victims side what happened to listening to both stories  where is the due process  why do companies fire dissaprove and just simply move away from their accused affiliate like almost instantly im not saying some people are fucking monsters and should be taken to court but this mob mentality is making me quit the internet    why cant we just listen to the other side of the story get all the facts and let the law or common sense prevail and not jump like animals because a women/minority/lbgt got offended or raped etc     where did this all start  is there a solution  where is this going anons  any hope 
  jews  always jews
  well it definitely spawned in america and the dumb hippies everyone told to get a job got jobs in the universities
  
  where is the due process   due process applies to the actual legal process not random civilians having a fucking opinion about an allegation  i agree that innocent until proven guilty is important but i never see anybody express the same level of skepticism about allegations of theft or battery or fraud as they do about sexual assault
      
    ie females that get raped
  fact transgendered males males that got there dicks cut of and pretend to be women still have 2 x chromosomes  you mean xy not xx
    yeah i saw that afterwards lol
  transgendered males males that got there dicks cut of and pretend to be women still have 2 x chromosomes  so theyre women
the avoidance of forms of expression or action that are perceived to exclude marginalize or insult groups of people who are socially disadvantaged or discriminated against    fact males statistically have higher iq and better reasoning ability    fact transgendered males males that got there dicks cut of and pretend to be women still have xy chromosomes    fact its impeding my free speech to force me to refer to you as a specific pronoun    fact there are differences in male and female brains    fact males are statistically physically superior to females    fact american black slaves were mostly sold to white american europeans by there respective rulers    factfemale rape happens far more than statistics say they do    the political correct tell me not to believe in these for the sake of peoples feelings    end of discussion
    nope
  fact males statistically have higher iq and better reasoning ability  and lower emotional intelligence  fact transgendered males males that got there dicks cut of and pretend to be women still have xy chromosomes  gender identification is not the same as biological sex  fact its impeding my free speech to force me to refer to you as a specific pronoun  no one said you have too just expect social consequences if you dont same as being generally rude in public  fact there are differences in male and female brains  true but so what  fact males are statistically physically superior to females  and your point is that dosnt mean much in an industrial society where most tasks are performed by machines and people are generally weaker than their preindustrial counterparts  fact american black slaves were mostly sold to white american europeans by there respective rulers  and it was the europeans that encouraged the slave trade  factfemale rape happens far more than statistics say they do  probably rape is always bad no matter who does it male on female rape is still statistically way more common  the political correct tell me not to believe in these for the sake of peoples feelings  is it because you say those things or because you say them in the most assholish way possible

every religion comes from asia    this is a chinese proverb and it is actually true
  but asia comes from greek checkmate chinks
  btfo
  nope    comes from the hittite assuwa
  asia / chine  kill yourself
blocks your path
    we said religion not alien cult
  some shit
  everything alive today except daoism and confucianism actually stems indirectly or directly from the indoeuropeans first the ie religion split into zoroastrianism and vedic hinduism then vedic hinduism help sow the seeds of modern hinduism buddhism jainism sihkism etc while zoroastrianism was responsible for the abrahamic religions after cyrus freed the jews from babylon and remade their religion in the form of the state religion by introducing stuff like heaven/hell angels/demons final judgment etc as the persians did with many subject peoples
  the indo europeans are from the caucasus so asia
  china  thats a funny way to spell japan
    based
  aryans are from eastern europe and the caucasus is europe geografically too
  no aryans were taught civilization from the indians or what you retards call poos the aryans got their civilization from poos and some got theirs from the chinese after the chinese invaded some parts of central asia also zoroastrianism came from persians who are genetically close with aryans but themselves are not aryans also vedic hinduism was made by indegenious indians         the rakhigarhi human dna clearly shows a predominant local element  the mitochondrial dna is very strong in it there is some minor foreign element which shows some mixing up with a foreign population but the dna is clearly local shinde told et he went on to add this indicates quite clearly through archeological data that the vedic era that followed was a fully indigenous period with some external contact     also most hindu principles were created long after the aryan invasion also sikhism and hinduism do not correspond that well that is why there is a lot of conflict between sikhs and hindus so trying to branch hinduism with sikhism is quite difficult     now you will probably show photos of swastikas all around the world to prove your point but indians created the swastika and aryans stole it from them evidence the oldest swastika is found in the indus valley long before there was an aryan invasion        in fact the symbol of the true swastika goes back over 11000 years and is believed to have originated in the harappan period and the culture of the indus valley civilization    now get the fuck out you hillbilly inbred retard and stop claiming shit fuck you are not even native fucking europe but you guys still claim europe
  semite gods have no indoeuropean origins besides nicking aspects of mythology    indoeuronigs confirmed for cucking themselves religionwise
  its true and we bharatiyas see themselves as part of asia we are not into your indoeuro aryan master race bullshit you lost your culture and religion to semities about time you accept it
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
  odin held semitic runes sacred
  no ryukyu should be the correct spelling
  bitch please
  first the ie religion split into zoroastrianism and vedic hinduism  well before that happened the ie religion split into indoiranian zoroastrianism/hinduism and nonindoiranian hellenic norse etc
  greeks are just turkish larpers though
  turks are semitic
  semite gods have no indoeuropean origins  semitic mythology is a syncretism of afroasiatic cattle worship and indoeuropean sky father worship
  runes are turkic
  credit really goes to indoiranians  sneakily uses indoeuropean so he can lump himself in with them and take credit  very predictable anon    protosemites had a sky god il before contact with indoeuropeans
  indoiranians are the dependents of indoeuropeans
  what you retards call poos  now get the fuck out you hillbilly inbred retard  fuck you are not even native fucking europe  holy shit i can feel the seething heat of your rage from here nahendra just remember you probably share a patrilineal haplogroup with snowslavs and fersians
  i bet you cant start your own religion  how much do you wanna bet
another thread by our resident chinese nationalist huinigger shall i drop his wiki userpage where he autistically obsesses over huiniggers
wtf this is not a chinese proverb
racism is a 17th century idea born from the renaissance because that was when whites started enslaving blacks
  racism is good when its against whites
  racism is only against blacks  implying blacks werent enslaved by everyone for thousands of years    racism was systematized in the 17th century racism has always existed in its more primitive forms
  nah blacks enslaved other people such as arabs turks circassians and pygmies if you can make someone else work for you you will
  racism was probably invented longer before the age of the renaissance i think the ancient greeks referred to outsiders as barbarians
  racism is a 17th century idea born from the renaissance because that was when whites started enslaving blacks    kinda that is true and it was used as justification for why they were enslaving blacks
  i think the ancient greeks referred to outsiders as barbarians    thats not racism dou
  isnt the fact that they were searching for a justification a sign of moral advancement did anybody in the past ever stop and think there has to be a reason were mistreating these people
racism wasnt a big deal in the middle ages because the aristocracy already considered the people to be inferior subhumans the difference between a serf and a black slave wasnt at all remarkable
they those from trebizond are greeks by race and their customs and language too are greek   laonikos chalkokondyles mid 15th century    he sultan mehmed ii receives in tribute from europe rumelia about nine hundred thousand staters he collects this tribute not from the race of the turks but from other peoples for it is not lawful for them to collect money from their own race   laonikos chalkokondyles mid 15th century
  greeks are turks and cant be racist towards themselves
  already considered the people to be inferior subhumans    class and religion were huge dividers of most people prior to race
  europeans first set apart blacks as different in the 17th century
racism became relevant together with nationalism when democracies needed something to convince the masses to go to war
  brainlet wojak posting is a bannable offense now  im reporting you
  notifying that youre reporting someone is against the rules sweetie 
  racism started in the paleolithic era when hominids could see patterns in the behavior of other hominids the idea that blacks are not people was started by the ancient egyptians who observed the wild black tribes in the wilderness of their country completely horrified at how they behaved
  no they didnt why are you making stuff up its only true for pygmy and they are just black manlets
  bbbbut we wuzz 
pretty much every primitive language has a word for real people that is also the name of the tribe that speaks it the default state of humanity is to assume that your people are the best because theyre yours and everyone else is secondary it takes quite a lot of deliberate propaganda to make people believe anything else    the idea that we should strive to include every misbegotten savage from the third world in our in group didnt exist until the 60s
  hating other groups of humans different to you in ideals/appearance/culture is natural human behaviour racism appears to you to have started in the 17 century simply because contact between europeans and other races was becoming more common around that period
  because most people didnt travel or encounter other races at all if you lived in europe prior to the age of discovery the only time youd see foreigners was during trade or war     religion and religious conflict was also a proxy for race and racial conflict christianity and islam being the obvious example hell its still true today with shiites and sunnis the conflict there is between iranian shiites and the minorities allied to them and arab sunnis
  daily reminder blacks are being enslaved in libya right now
    the greek word barbaroi simply meant nongreeks or foreigners literally babblers people who cant speak an intelligible language it wasnt pejorative at first but it became so after the persian wars by the time the romans though they were themselves barbaroi adopted the word and thereafter it definitely had a negative meaning
  black african and european civs were about on the same technological level until about the 1400s    of course you could have illiterate subsistence farmers wearing skin pelts and living in mud huts in both places
  black african and european civs were about on the same technological level until about the 1400s    greeks were millenia ahead of them in 800 bc    romans make their actual civilizations look primitive in 300 ad    every medieval kingdom was more advanced than any of those wooden shack villages in 1000 ad    here is the thing anon blacks have no actual excuse why they lag behind europeans as they live in a warm continent while we lived in a cold one which makes agriculture hard while agriculture is easier where they come from mudhuts well yh european tribal people had mudhuts but civilizations were different
  thats not my point moron
  and also in mauritania
  daily reminder slavery exists everywhere in large numbers the only idea it ended is laughable
  revisionism intensifies
  where are the great sub saharan empires stretching from senegal to nigeria oh wait there are none so blacks are not equal to whites in civilization development

  racism came about because of the largest multiethnic empire that ever existed being the british empire trying to shill out its worthless colonies for use now thats past we can go back to class system based on castes of elitism and ability
  we lived in a cold one  west europe is mild and early springlike year round     south europe is warm and comfortable year round with no real winter    east europe has 4 seasons like midwestern america    only the furthest north reaches of europe are frigid all the time and barely anyone has ever lived there besides hunting tribes until the modern era    and thats without even mentioning the sheer amount of arable land in europe
  hahahahahahaha
  lol cope
    no refutation    inb4 mali
  inb4 the answers    lol
  the 2nd largest continent in the world    lists one answer that i provided for him
  fucking kek you did it again
  for a moment i thought it was the black sea being the shark the water and the white part the land
    calm down guys lets everyone be reasonable and rationale in their dialation of discussion
  cope for what nothing blacks have created is comparable to whites at all or middle eastern people or indians or mesoamericans or south east asians or north east asians    nice empire now show those ancient cities
  still hasnt listed more than one answer      yeah you might want to study some history anon theres more answers
  he didnt look at the map    lol
  no it wasnt
most of the ghana empire is wilderness where are the fucking cities
  wrong
  wrong  in what way show me a negro civilization on par with late rome first of all
  the sahel was described as rather densely populated and cultivated
  now lets look at the architecture of these cities
  late rome id say songhai or swahililand
  areas without the building materials of europe didnt use european building materials  truly they were inferior
  id say songai  ahahahahahahahahha    no
  without the building materials of europe  so africa doesnt have rocks now
  lol no refutation beyond shitposting     both had writing  both had elaborate government   both extensively irrigated their lands  both wielded iron weapons
  not the same ones as europe best building materials in the desert is clay
  rome has more advanced architecture so its better
  best building materials in the desert is clay  meanwhile in egypt 4000 bce
  how they both stacked bricks together until they had a building
  class and religion were huge dividers of most people prior to race  in my countrys history rather not say which the local noble class were never allowed within the circles of the occupying aristocracy class despite being of the same religion their race was just slightly both european swarthier
  almost everything in egypt was made of adobe stones were used for pharaoh tombs because it was so expensive to drag it where they needed it     we dont even have any remains of medieval baghdad despite it being the most advanced city on earth at one point
  building shit out of fucking limestone hardly on par with rome because they didnt have the same materials ie concrete
  greeks were millenia ahead of them in 800 bc  lol what the fuck did you think the greeks were some space faring civilization you have no basis to claim that they were any more advanced than any big civilization in africa
  racism is a natural state of a man not being racist on the other hand is a modern concept mostly pushed on european and american people    in other parts of the world racism is completely normal and accepted by most
  rather not say which  because this isnt a substantiable claim
  it just looks more aesthetic    but it still looks better than any african black shithole    advanced civilization  africa    i almost choked on my beer thats such a hilarious statement advancement from a race that has the most prehistoric cultures on this planet
hey guys we should totally believe humans with cultures on par with neolithic europe are totally the same as us look at their disgusting primitive traditional music its so ancient i could cry at the sheer lack of progress
  i had a discussion like this with an indian guy a while ago video games and movies can romanticize history as much as they want because its more fun to larp but the reality is that almost everyone was a shit eating farmer    some people seem to think that everyone was living in the ancient equivalent of skyscrapers or something and doing calculus in their spare time
  romans werent making orchestras either
  negro peasantry causes african countries to be shitholes white peasantry didnt create africa tier shitholes in medieval history thus whites are superior white peasantry also didnt create the violent hellholes on par with black americans even back in the 1700s when america was much primitive than it was today
  but it still looks better than any african black shithole  look im really sorry that lashawn made fun of you in high school but lets snap back to reality what are you even arguing at this point
all white peasants do is have fun all black peasants do is terrorize humans black or white
  why would you attribute it to race when the fact is that by and large africa is a materially poorer and more difficult continent to live in
  my hatred of these humans has nothing to do with something so trivial its what they do to my country that makes me hate them just them alone can make people vacate going to a public business because they harass people constantly
  ancient greeks had analog computers what did niggers have
  implying the antikythera mechanism was useful
  what does this even mean you post the same vitriolic crap everyday and never go anywhere     grr  i hate niggers so much    cool then go to /pol/ and circlejerk about genocide instead of shitting up /his/ with lies    
   africa is a materially poorer  nigeria has more resources than west europe combined also stop using poverty to rationalize african peasant subhumanity because it doesnt work if you apply it to whites  more difficult continent to live in  if africa is so hard to live on why are black numbskulls not extinct then
  negro culture is inferior to eurasian culture look at the so called civilized black american its truely thinks a culture based on the worship of criminal behavior is perfectly fine and normal african refugees also see it as fine because they assimilate into this evil culture effortlessly almost as if its genetic
  again what did niggers have
  negro peasantry causes african countries to be shitholes  what is a shithole some african countries are better off than nonafrican countries in different regards things take time  white peasantry didnt create africa tier shitholes in medieval history thus whites are superior  what does this even mean  white peasantry also didnt create the violent hellholes on par with black americans even back in the 1700s when america was much primitive than it was today  medieval europe was drastically more violent than modern europe or america
  analog computers     lol the larp is real
  in what oil is useless  if africa is so hard to live on why are black numbskulls not extinct then  you have this backwards they didnt develop say firearms because doing so would have required developing an economy which can support scientists most of africa is unable to support largescale agriculture or is covered in jungle so subsistence living is/was far and away the norm
  what is a shithole  a country with high violent crime and very low human development   some african countries are better off than nonafrican countries in different regards  if you mean in raw resources then yes but no black countries are at the very bottom of all countries on this planet as every single one is a violent shithole  what does this even mean  it means poor whitey even back in the uncivilized middle ages didnt create africa level conditions in their living spaces like modern negros do nowadays  medieval europe was drastically more violent than modern europe or america  oh yes you fucking retard war is the same as impulsive violent crime
  where the fuck do you live and what bearing does it have on you lying about history
  what does nigeria have that west europe in total doesnt
  most of africa is unable to support largescale agriculture or is covered in jungle  and most of north eurasia couldnt handle agriculture due to the cold yet you dont see ruskies and nords throwing spears now do you    america
  russia has parts that are really good for agriculture and those support the subsistence of the rest of the country farnorth regions of scandinavia are fairly primitive and the norse were pretty shit until the technological developments of the further south parts of europe allowed them to function beyond subsistence
  negro culture is inferior to eurasian culture  there is no black culture anymore than there is a white culture and even if there was culture cant be measured as good or bad it comes down to how you personally feel    look at the so called civilized black american its truely thinks a culture based on the worship of criminal behavior is perfectly fine and normal  most black americans have never committed a crime and never will and theyre halfwhite anyway    african refugees also see it as fine because they assimilate into this evil culture effortlessly almost as if its genetic  oh my god  why is the fugitive riffraff of africa acting like riffraff    lol
  russia has parts that are really good for agriculture  not to the native slavic tribes who had to be taught farming by europeans  and the norse were pretty shit until the technological developments   wow a cold region takes time to develop society what a surprise    and even if there was culture cant be measured as good or bad  yes the more sophisticated a culture is the more superior  most black americans have never committed a crime and never will  wrong most black americans have commited at least one violent crime in their least
quick question to the cucks in this thread    which culture is superior chinese or yoruba
of course white culture is better than blacks as black culture is primitive and disgusting blacks created nothing like classical music they have no poetry they have no advanced philosophy either and their clothing styles still look primitive
  a country with high violent crime and very low human development  so estonia is a shithole and ghana isnt  if you mean in raw resources then yes but no black countries are at the very bottom of all countries on this planet as every single one is a violent shithole  objectively wrong and i love how your only criteria of development is violent crime  it means poor whitey even back in the uncivilized middle ages didnt create africa level conditions in their living spaces like modern negros do nowadays  youre just spouting vague insults and assertions  oh yes you fucking retard war is the same as impulsive violent crime  no i mean violent crime     medieval england was worse than modern detroit
  wow a cold region takes time to develop society what a surprise  so why imply that a desert society is bad because of muh genetics rather than because it also has difficulties to cope with likewise for central african jungles
  whites didnt have classical music and you are objectively wrong about philosophy and poetry
  so estonia is a shithole  estonia  cucktonia  shithole  cuck nation that shills for refugees    ghana isnt  leave the commercial district of ghana to see how shitholish that city actually is  objectively wrong  no one wants to move to africa solely because of the black people in it  no i mean violent crime   untrue  medieval england was worse than modern detroit  you mean the detroit with over 600 murders a year what about the above 10000 robberies a year    because deserts are easier
  and most of north eurasia couldnt handle agriculture due to the cold yet you dont see ruskies and nords throwing spears now do you  russians and nordic people did not live in the tundra or taiga they couldnt even grow crops there     the frost line was occupied by huntergatherers until the modern era have you ever even been to europe its not skyrim  america  figures
  the first part should be qualified with until 500 years ago whch is basically nothing in the grand scheme of things
  wrong most black americans have commited at least one violent crime in their least  oh sweet please show me your stats for that this is news to me
  i meant the taiga retard
  no literally nobody important back then cared whatsoever about what bleeding heart faggots had to say republicanism was a mistake
  farming in desert is wicked difficult anon
  neither and there is no monolithic chinese culture by the way    blacks created nothing like classical music  its actually been scientifically proven that musical taste only comes down to personal preference music you associate with happy memories sounds better to you  they have no poetry  wrong again  they have no advanced philosophy either  philosophy is contemplation of the world around you its not measurable     their clothing styles still look primitive  clothing cant be primitive or advanced    and there is no black culture theres hundreds
  they farmed in river valleys you retard also the sand people have farmed since 12000 bc so shut up with your black excuses    neither  hahahahahahahahahah wow holy fuck wow ahahahahahahahahahahha  its actually been scientifically proven that musical taste only comes down to personal preference music you associate with happy memories sounds better to you  i dont even listen to classical you fucking cuck  philosophy is contemplation of the world around you its not measurable   nah  clothing cant be primitive or advanced  ok man shitty loin cloths vs modern clothing  and there is no black culture theres hundreds  all the same jungle bongo shit
  so you hate estonians too wow    leave the commercial district of ghana to see how shitholish that city actually is  ghana isnt a city stupid    no one wants to move to africa solely because of the black people in it  who the fuck would move to a continent solely because of the race of people living there    you mean the detroit with over 600 murders a year   what about the above 10000 robberies a year  medieval times was worse
  i said taiga stupid
  accra is a fucking shithole  who the fuck would move to a continent solely because of the race of people living there  lots of people blacks are the main reason no one wants to live in the second largest continent on earth they were such awful lifeforms that our white colonial cousins had to implement policies to segregate them away
  wakanda cultists btfo
  implying a shitpost can btfo of anything
  hahahahahahahahahah wow holy fuck wow ahahahahahahahahahahha  epic  i dont even listen to classical you fucking cuck  my point stands  nah  cuz you say so  ok man shitty loin cloths vs modern clothing  thats not primitive or advanced and loin cloths or nudity are sensible clothing for a hot humid environment especially if you work for a living     most people wore robes or togas if it wasnt too hot  humid or even trousers in some regions     all the same jungle bongo shit  most of africa is savanna or desert
  accra is a fucking shithole  who cares big cities are always shittier than towns and villages and accra is drastically safer than the great majority of cities on earth    lots of people blacks are the main reason no one wants to live in the second largest continent on earth  to you most people just want money    they were such awful lifeforms that our white colonial cousins had to implement policies to segregate them away  because they felt themselves superior
  and accra is drastically safer than the great majority of cities on earth  pfhahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahhaha    oh this is too much you can tell cucks who never spent anywhere in a 60 black area in their life  to you most people just want money  and blacks are a problem  because they felt themselves superior  because they hate living around violent psychos
  blah blah excuses n shiet we aint stupid is i swear to gawd witeboi    ahem you have no excuses at all saying africa is too hard doesnt work because    india/sea/mesoamerican prove its possible for jungle civilizations    mena proves desert civilizations are possible    there were fucking kingdoms in the steppe of eurasia whihc is harder to grow crops in than any african savanna    no fucking excuses niggers
  oh this is too much you can tell cucks who never spent anywhere in a 60 black area in their life  i was born in kumasi stupid not a trailer park   and blacks are a problem  to you  because they hate living around violent psychos  like dylan roof
  i was born in kumasi stupid not a trailer park  oh whats wrong nigger mad because your country is a shithole why dont you black fucks fix it instead of complaining about us  to you  well i suppose if you are a negro you would find negro behavior normal  like dylan roof  living among you people is like living around thousands of serial killers all at once
  anon is white so they cant have a valid opinion about blacks  anon is black so they cant have a valid opinion about blacks
  ahem you have no excuses at all saying africa is too hard doesnt work because  nobody said that m8    india/sea/mesoamerican prove its possible for jungle civilizations  indians civilization came from the deserts and grasslands of northwest india same for mesoamerica  mena proves desert civilizations are possible  mena civilizations were not based in the desert     there were fucking kingdoms in the steppe of eurasia whihc is harder to grow crops in than any african savanna  the steppe was entirely nomadic     only the oasises had civs     no fucking excuses niggers  okay got it so were just shitposting at this point cool
  oh whats wrong nigger mad because your country is a shithole why dont you black fucks fix it instead of complaining about us  boohoo black people bullied you in high school now you want to take it out on everyone else  well i suppose if you are a negro you would find negro behavior normal  most black people arent antisocial  living among you people is like living around thousands of serial killers all at once  ooga booga booga    my mom just stabbed me again    booga booga
  indians civilization came from the deserts and grasslands of northwest india  so savannas then  mena civilizations were not based in the desert   desert river valleys  the steppe was entirely nomadic   no central asia has had kingdoms since 100 bc    boohoo black people bullied you in high school now you want to take it out on everyone else  ahahahahahahahhahahahha amazing they all respond exactly the same simply amazing what a disgusting breed of human  most black people arent antisocial  actually they are most blacks have a mental disorder called antisocial personality disorder or psychopathy in simple terms  ooga booga booga    my mom just stabbed me again    booga booga  living around blacks is hell on earth id rather live around mexicans or native americans than you people you are that horrible
  you shouldnt listen to black as they have no ability to realize anything is ever their fault
  so savannas then  yeah most african civilizations came from the grasslands  desert river valleys  yes fertile river valleys fertile crescent not desert   no central asia has had kingdoms since 100 bc  and their civs came from the oasis  actually they are most blacks have a mental disorder called antisocial personality disorder or psychopathy in simple terms  lol memes again  living around blacks is hell on earth id rather live around mexicans or native americans than you people you are that horrible  it gets funnier when you remember that violent crime is more common among latin americans than africans
  desert river valleys  mesopotamia was not a desert until after it had been intensely farmed for century
  most african civilizations came from the grasslands  bakongo or buganda didnt  yes fertile river valleys fertile crescent not desert   but they lived in deserts  and their civs came from the oasis  it is very cold in central asia  lol memes again  the average black american behaves like a white that would be classifed as a psychopath  grandiose sense of self worthkangz n shiet  no empathyyh i shot that nigga down the street so what  callous disregard for lifeay man smoke that motherfucker  shallow emotionsblack lives matter ay fuck you nigga bang bang  manipulativeyou enslave us now do what we wants  inability to blame oneselfi dindu nuffin cracker  it gets funnier when you remember that violent crime is more common among latin americans than africans  spics dont cause as much crime as you people in our america though and they now outnumber you
  but they lived in deserts  mesopotamians did not live in desert they lived on fertile lands with rivers flowing through them which are rather rare in the sahara
  yh no they lived in a desert the zoroastrian religion shows that area was a desert with rivers
blacks are such disgusting people  well latinos cause alot of violent crime so our stupendous crime compared to you whites is fine  niggers jesus fuck they will say anything to live like evil thugs
  bakongo   south of the rainforest its wooded savanna  buganda  savanna  but they lived in deserts  the same way a guy in a cabin lives in the woods or a goldfish in a bowl lives in a house  it is very cold in central asia  yes and the desert oasis is where civs grew up   the average black american behaves like a white that would be classifed as a psychopath  no  spics dont cause as much crime as you people in our america though and they now outnumber you    great in america now stop blaming the entire race
  how dare you speak truth  lol
  the banks of the river were marshy the areas farther out were being desertified as the mesopotamian civilization arose
  what does it matter if latinos are violent you are very violent compared to us the racial fucking majority in this country you are very violent compared to whites in europe as well this is what your stupid black asses need to realize we dont give a shit about spics we care about your outlandish hyper criminality ruining our settlements
you ever notice most people dont even think negatively about spics only as job stealers but everyone in america hates blacks
  they never enslaved arabs and turks you idiot
  what put europeans over the edge were large sailing vessels and gunpowder the latter of course being a chinese invention in 1300 the standard of life was basically the same in coastal west africa north africa coastal east africa and western and central europe     more isolated parts of either continent may not have reached the high standards for the day but being out of the way and off trading routes will do that      i actually dont care what your point was
  what does it matter if latinos are violent  i hate all black people in the world because theyre literally hitler   k but worldwide spics are more criminal  fuck u nigger    lol    you are very violent compared to us the racial fucking majority in this country  and then you wakeup and remember less than 00003 of black americans are violent criminals   you are very violent compared to whites in europe as well  overall yeah but black americans are still less violent than russians or ukrainians    in violence its     spics  blacks   whites   asians    worldwide
  yes they did turkish  arab slaves were recorded in swahililand and mali
  post sources
  racism started when races started interacting  woah nazis btfo
  yes it was considering that ancient greek city states were ethnically and racially homogenous
  implying there was no interaction between asians blacks and whites before 1600s  thats a bold claim
  n 1300 the standard of life was basically the same in coastal west africa north africa coastal east africa and western and central europe  fuck no get the fuck out of here cuck we were equal to chinks i agree but niggers hell no get the fuck out    k but worldwide spics are more criminal  k but nation wide blacks are more criminal  and then you wakeup and remember less than 00003 of black americans are violent criminals   meanwhile the american negroid embraces a criminal worshiping culture right now yet the idea that most of them arent criminal minded is stupid  but black americans are still less violent than russians or ukrainians  ahahahahahahahahahahahha    blacks   whites   asians    no its     niggers  niggers  niggers  spics  sandniggers  whites  asians
anyone who thinks europeans lived like blacks once needs to leave
  celtic and germanic tribes lived in africa tier straw huts but proper europeans greeks romans did not
  africa tier  nope native american tier which is much higher than african tier      how dare you compare the people that created the kingdoms that would one day rule the world to these tribal primitives who wouldnt have any technology were it not for the descendents of those kingdoms to begin with
  who wouldnt have any technology  nice meme
  native american tier which is much higher than african tier  it really wasnt
  racism doesnt exist nor has it ever existed
dumb shark eating professor poster
  lol this had better be bait
god damn it white nationalists are retarded
      holy fuck you people are stupid
i honestly am not of an opinion to be sure of whether blacks are terrible because of their genes or their environments what i am sure of is that im not at all interested in seeing society coddle them anymore it would really be best if we just all went our seperate ways its either that or we essentially accept that as our overlords because its obvious at this point that theyll be satisfied with nothing less
  out of arguments cute
  the egyptians erased an entire dynasty of nubian pharaohs out of their recorded history for much the same reasons
  no they didnt
  must suck living in the frigid wastelands of france  those niggers were lucky to live in the moderate climate of subsaharan africa where the rivers flow fresh
  
  fuck no get the fuck out of here cuck we were equal to chinks i agree but niggers hell no get the fuck out  hurrrrr nigggeeeeerrrrrssss rreeeeeeeeee    try reading some books sometime stormtard
  native american tier which is much higher than african tier  lol no    thinking in tiers  brainlet
  you dont know what systematized means do you
    i know right but when arabs castrate their negro slaves brought in from africa thats not real racism just protoracism or when aryans enslaved the indus valley people and treated them like dirt as part of their caste system that wasnt real racism either only white people can be racist any other historical parallel simply diverts from this blatant fact
why is this board so shit this past year /his/ used to have some decent threads where university students would talk about their recent studies and history enthusiasts would share research  i challenge this board to dump some recent or past information that theyve been looking into in this thread drop links and such of findings or just talk general interesting shit you all have been reading up on  ill start the new york draft riots of 1863 were actually politically lead and instigated by opponents of tammany hall and the freedman labor bosses it was actually a full on race war the new york harbor was manned by an old general far past his prime and the army was ordered to stand down for the majority of the riot
nigger
tell me about carl von linné /his/ i heard he had an interesting life
bbump
  he was on our 100 kr bills until he got replaced by some roastie actor
  dude plants lmao
we havent had a fat president since 2000 people forget clinton was a lardass as president do you think well ever have one again
trumps bmi is higher than clintons      
  is  only because clinton lost the weight besides trump has a lot of muscle and it just makes him look big i bet hes bara as fuck
  please at least look at the source i provided   the bmi of clinton during his presidency was 283
  kek
  i like how this measure of body fat takes weight into account rather than actual body fat percentage like i said trump is a fit guy he cant really be called fatter than clinton
  hes 70 hes in good shape but calling him fit is silly     also im not calling him fat nor am i saying he was fatter than clinton just simply pointing out he has a higher bmi
  this isnt fat by american standards yeehaw
  how the fuck do white people survive all day golfing in florida not even trying to complain im just kinda concerned
  taft was infamously obese at 300lb  mfw i am 275lb
  whats the first word that comes to mind when you see this photo  for me it was majestic
  if he can do it so can you anon
  youre alright anon 3
  jesus fuck how did he even do that thats akin to hiv diagnosis type of weight loss
  not that anon but iirc taft was guilty of really bad diet lots of butter in everything no restrictions he probably just checked into a spa and ate clean for months and it came off
     trump has a lot of muscle  he hasnt exerted himself since high school and outright said exercise is bad for the body because we all have a limited battery slob
    impling donald trump isnt a fatass
      if you cant see that trump is fat youve been caught up in a maolike cult of personality
  im guessing hes in the wheelchair for knee damage
  bet he can sink pots like a champ with a gut like that
  trumps pretty widelyregarded as fat
      hes a fucking slug
  he walked a lot one of the avenues was actually renamed because of how often hed walk by it  he carefully planned a fitness regimen walking 3 miles 48 km from his home to the capitol each day when he also walked home after work he would usually go by way of connecticut avenue and use a particular crossing over rock creek after his death the crossing was named the taft bridge
trump is a fat fuck maybe mutts think hes muscular but hes not
strongfat is a meme by morbidly obese truckers and mutts
  tfaggot twink who watches too much anime and would get beat black and blue in a fight with a strongfatchad irl
  239  trump is in the 280s at least    he reported his weight is 239 because thats the absolute maximum it could possibly be before his bmi would reach 30 making him medically obese
    hahahaha
  honestly not that bad for a man of his age living a life of luxury
  ummm sweetie
maybe a fat president is just what this country needs not kinda fat but really fucking fat
  president so fat hail to the chief is replaced by this   
                      we cant have any politics thread without libs chimping out about trump  will you just fuck him already hes always on your minds
                  wrong hes a big guybut in all the right ways
  9/10 bait
  yeah thats what it is
trumps not fat youre only fat if youre fatter than me
  post the shadman version
  its projection  slob  fatass  a fucking slug  fat fuck mutt  who are they really thinking of
  pic unrelated though hes not fat at all there
  looks like tyson fury
    do you think ben garrison would draw pregnant anne frank and the seven rebs for us
  the way he started the pandering phase of his career was when he realized 4chan could pay so maybe
  no muscle tho thus the greentext idiot
    i wish zyklon ben did qas we could ask if the adventures of annie the pregnant jew and her johnny reb baby daddy stimulate his interest
  tfw no thicc president
  trumps a bit overweight desu probably not any worse than your average american boomer though
  trump has a lot of muscle and it just makes him look big  jesus christ
  for his age hes in great shape
  love that story its so perfectly crafted the fact that it doesnt mention that the boyfriend was black until the son called him a nigger this was obviously made by one of /ourguys/ but it triggered normalfags and incels really well
  upvoted based lelddiitor
  yeah the sand niggers and pajeets is a dead giveaway
  he yoyo dieted throughout his life
when he was governor of the philippines he sent a cable that referred to a horseback ride he had taken into the mountains the reply referring to your telegramhow is the horse
  horseback riding was his main hobby and form of exercise after retiring from the presidency he did it every day
why do so many of historys villains flee to argentina    is it a lovely a country
  plenty of heroes namely boer generals fled to argentina as well
  what a nice peaceloving country this argentina sounds why doesnt everyone go there
  because most of the time the villiansheros are white men and argentina is desperate to look white to the rest of the world
the real reason why argentina became a haven for exnazis is because juan perón was sympathetic to both fascism and nazism and practiced an ideology that while very distinct was somewhat inspired by european fascism    its actually a wonder hes so well remembered considering that      lol
  it used to be
why do racists talk about how indoeuropeans dominated indians as a ruling class when their european ancestors were also ruled over by indoeuropeans
because they are pathetic people with power fantasies and rape fetishes the whole scene is very sad
why do antiracists try to ignore the significance of this group of people
  we dont  they were a group of ie speaking people who migrated and invaded over eurasia establishing a ruling class that either adopted culture or made a new one
  its pretty likely that any given european will have a lot of stops and old european ancestry that being said i think its realky cool that the ie came from the steppe that whole story is unironically epic
  why couldnt they establish themselves in the caucasus
  ive seen people on this board write off the idea as racist or fascist like a lot of people
  they wanted fertile land and conquest it seems
  why  everyone was dominated by ie
  they think it gives white supremacists fuel i dont think it makes sense either
  so whats your problem why make the op
  ancient finns
  because the average northern european has a much higher degree of descent from ie whereas only the upper class of northern india has almost any trace of ie
  scandinavia  fucking central asia  fertile
  taking the bait  he already knows all that
  ironically traits associated with northern europeans light skin hair and eye colors have nothing to do with ies this traits where there long before the horse was even domesticated
  ur still a rape product
  why is that ironic its just common sense
            after the collapse of the paleolithic east asian caucasoid complex ie reintroduced these traits to east asia in the neolithic
they dont
  moreso than a mountain range why are people on the internet so dumb its impossible for me not to get into arguments with people who say dumb things
  barely   theyre still rapebabies
  light skin and hair come mostly from ie  blue eyes come from whgadmixed farmer women
  its not that they have nothing to do with ies steppe heavy populations are all pale and have light features the ie descended people in asia look like irish people
  light hair predates ie migrations in fact they had dark hair  even their skin was darker than modern europeans
  kitlg derived allele wasnt present in preie europe  neolithic farmers in scandinavia were much darker than cypriots and sicilians
in fact most europeans get their dna from hunter gatherers and farmers with steppe ancestry being a minority
  not in scandinavia scandinavian hunter gatherers had light skin and hair some were gingers
  the blonde hair mutation is 11000 years old and is not from the pontic steppe
  but it was absent in preie europe  bbut what about shg  funnelbeakers didnt have shg admixture
  i think ane actually do have the gene for blonde hair though
  a 2014 study reported seven mesolithzic huntergatherers found at motala southern sweden dated to 7700 years ago as the earliest known individuals in whom the modern scandinavian phenotype combining light skin blue eyes and blond hair was combined these individuals had light skin gene alleles in slc24a5 and slc45a2 and herc2/oca2 alleles associated with blue eyes also contributes to lighter skin and blond hair34 light pigmentation traits had thus already existed in preindoeuropean europeans since at least the later mesolithic35
  lithuania and estonia tied for highest ancestral north eurasian in europe    interesting ive seen people say lithuanian is the closest to sanskrit or the protoindoeuro language out of everything else in europe
  retarded outdated map with idiotic percentages no one has that much admixture this is pre chg and etc
  the admixture is not that high
  im talking about whg admixture that map is clearly years old and pre chg discovery no one has that much admixture like 50
  why do welsh irish and scots have more ie dna than anglos despite proximity
  its called shitposting
  yes im sure 19th and early 20th century aryaninvasion racists were just shitposting
  shg were to neolithic europe what sami people are now totally irrelevant people living in the far north
  ok
  yeah  funnelbeakers had only whg admixture
  ok
  that map is wrong  northern norwegians have highest ie dna
  ies conqured lots of mountain ranges you moron iran afghanistan armenia turkey etc are full of mountains you still havent given a single argument for why ies went as far east as bengal crossing deserts and mountains but couldnt subjugate their doorstep in the south
  do you know where norway is  its not in finland
  why is it so high in the north
  ehg
  they are made up of caucasian people they did subjugate those people youre just clueless and full of rage
  they never did all their native nonie languages and culture are there and have been there for millenmia
  and a huge portion of ie dna is female chg they conquered and for whatever reason didnt see it worth settling there in the long term
  welsh irish and scots have   bell beaker descendants that arrived on the isles long ago so that make sense    but i have no idea the anglos are in a lower bracket their enrichment came mostly from germanics and scandis i guess its lighter do to latin settlement and the french
      kavkazi here    ies did dominate over caucasus ossetians tat armenian talysh are just one of the many ie languages of the kavkaz    tat language was the dominant language of the kavkaz before the turkish invasions    the highlanders chechens circassians retained their languages by living in remote mountain top villages    the hittites moved soutj thru the caucasus to establish themselves in anatolia    screencap this post
  because indoeuropeans contains the word europeans thus they feel related to them i feel related to the tbqh i think they were epic mostly for the while distance they travled since being pie
  indoeuropeans is a term used because of geographical reasons because when people started getting into linguistics these languages originally streched from europe to india
      if the ussr didnt establish independent kavkazi republics and if the tuks never invaded then the kavkaz would continue to be dominated by tats and other ies    /thread
  never seen that map before nor anything like that r1b and r1a haplomaps dont cluster with this one i wonder what components does this map have in account
    look more muuuh indoeuropean autism threads
  t got conquered by ies and my anus still hurts
    he thinks hes talking to me  lol
indians literally look nothing like whites though the upper caste north indians have a wheatish skin rather than white pic related
  indoeuropeans are from europe
  pls tell me youre just prettending
    yes that is the only way one could point out at your sperg forced circlejerk    im an european btw
    the indo makes as much sense as calling them the mesoameroeuropean people because some europeans conquered and settled in mexico one could also say the creoleeuropean language group and be just as retarded as the spergs who push this 19th century academic geographical term
  how can you not admire the basedness of ies at last i realized im like a romaboo to you i despiese romaboos btw but ies man they were fucking based they treveled hundreds of thousands of kilometers in their migrations from lake baikal
   they treveled hundreds of thousands of kilometers in their migrations from lake baikal
  where am i wrong
  we  admitting youre an antiracist  sperging about ie revisionism  yikety yikes
  they left baikal like 20000 years ago if they ever were that east its more likely they came to europe from somewhere like central kazakhstan
  (((indos)))  advanced finnic khanz taught these niggers how to bathe and build temples
  first traces of r and r1a are found there so they came from there so their original migration can be traced back to there so they did migrated hundreds of thousands of kilometers
  there arent contemporary samples from between baikal and urals  ans from 30k bc east siberia had haplogroup p1 which might suggest r really is pretty eastern by origin
    they were just a branch of european peoples they were not aliens who spawned out of nowhere in the steppes 5000 years ago they had migrated to the asian steppes from the place where the european rootrace originated    steppe culture is pretty nice but that is just an aspect of our traditions and history and not the most originallyeuropean one at that some sperg out projections out of it like muh indoeuropean warriors of light circlejerk that end up as a cringey larping
    pussy
  rape fetishist in denial
  khvalynsk repin sredny stog all inside europe
  what about the samples from lake baikal from 20000 bc
  because we are genetically indo europeans
  lamooo shut up all indo european tribes were nordic phenotipically
  all indo european tribes cluster with actual europeans so yes we have the right to call ourselfs aryans
    maybe because their origin is european  maybe because they are closerely related genetically to europeans  maybe because phenotipically looked europeans  maybe because you are too stupid to accept the reality  who knows

  linear a will never be solved  why not maybe not soon but why not in the future
i never understood why a computational lingust has never put linear a into a neural network it would probably establish some patterns of sentence construction which linguists  anthropologists could use to look for meaning in
whats the point even all we have learned from linear b is about some wheat order from a merchant and about literal whos graves
  for starters that the myceneans spoke and wrote in a language that is substantially greek keeping that language from prealphabetic times
  there are things that we have no way of ever knowing in regards to both history and present
  iktfb
    its an entirely different language than everything known and thus they cant transcribe it at all
  we have almost no carthaginian texts
  its still possible for it to be deciphered we just need a bilingual text
  its from before the bronze age collapse its not going to happen unless a miracle befalls some mudshits or archaeologists this century before climate change and resource wars destroy every single ancient site in the middle east youre not going to find anything west of beirut or at best turkey that will translate it
  he doesnt want to know about wheat orders and religious sacrifice lists to literally who minoan deities  and you call yourself a historian
  you know we know we understand linear a right
    linear b sorry
  we will never find the q source because it wasnt written down but instead was orally transmitted
  the jews are hiding the meaning of the text because they know it exposes them
will never know the full teachings of the druids and their knowledge
  jews were mentioned in linear a  they were such a newlyformed ethnic group at that point that they probably just blended in with everyone else in the melting pot that was the bronze age mediterranean they didnt really stand out as unique until the roman age

why do christians claim that christianity is a european religion when it comes from asia and 90 of it that is somewhat european was just stolen from paganism
cause it flourished in europe after the saracens took the holy land
  they dont  only 56 deus vulters do
    stolen
  well yeah wenn pagan concepts become original christian donutsteal concepts what other word would you use

if lincoln wasnt a total faggot and just send all the former black slaves to libera regardless if they survived on their journey or if they survived in that country we would of undo the potential black problem that we now suffer that started initially because rich hicks couldnt think that far ahead and only cared that they got someone to pick their cotton without getting much sunburned
bumping so more anons get to see this butthurt rant
lincoln should have kicked your greatgrandpa in the balls
  black problem  it is only a problem because you americans keep being racist twats
  all we have to do to make black people stop murdering each other is be nice to them
  a improvised disenfranchised and systemically targeted minority commits more crime per capita le shock
  yeah and when whites are poor its their own fault
      the problem stems from government policies that create and support a matriarchy within the black community
  without black americans there wouldnt be america as you know it they were created by america to as the original american pleb class off of the backs of which much was built and ultimately created a place for poor europeans to be able to migrate to en masse and have a chance at a middle class life
  the problem is blacks dude theres no redeeming spin you can put on it
  statistics show that there problems were not nearly as bad prior to the 70s there seems to be a correlation between the destruction of the black family and the rise in crime
  a improvised  yeah they are willing to sacrifice their electricity just so they can improvise for their fried chicken addiction
  idiot
  yeah no they still had piss poor irish wiggers and others
  
  statistics show that there problems were not nearly as bad prior to the 70s    and by the standards of civilized society prior to the 70s still deplorable    its like certain strains of conservatism seem to believe that rescuing black society is their special burden to carry even smart conservatives like steve sailer seem prone to this to a certain extent strangest fucking thing
  le shock
  black is not monolithic that is a projection from white people in america that are still very much tied to other countries due to the fact that many are still relatively recent immigrants and never underwent ethnogenesis in the new world thus seem themselves as europeans in america rather than intrinsically american there are huge differences in black admixture groups and black peoples from country to country a black american is very different than say a sudanese who is very different from say a brazilian and so on and so forth there is no overarching blacksociety
  its like certain strains of white people  ftfy
  blacks are as american as apple pie they have been here since fucking jamestown how about you kick off everyone from the country then you wont have any crime in america any more
    400 years max of difference between imported bantus and the native bantus of today big fucking difference that makes
  black americans are an black admixture group there are many different kinds of black admixture groups throughout the world which is why they range from in complexion and phenotype so widely an ethnic group that includes everyone from steph curry to will smith to wesley snipes
  ay whitey took us from africa put us in boats n made us slavez n sheet  gives them free trip back to their continent  we beenz here since jamestownz
  nearly all descended from thieves and vagrants enslaved in their homelands to pay off debts and the descendants of those criminals all concentrated within one landmass all breeding with each other
  they are are also descendants of americas founding fathers through their paternal lines black americans as they are today are an amalgamation and thus a uniquely american ethnic group haters like yourself just like to focus on the less proud parts of thier genetic makeup
    im sure it has nothing to do with the 8 times higher prevalence of genes highly associated with psychopathy or standard deviation lower iq also associated with lack of ability to delay gratification and more violence

there was never a plan to forcibly deport exslaves to africa thats typical historical illiteracy from adolescent /pol/tards    the american colonization society was an organization set up by some welltodo exslaves or their descendants to encourage completely voluntary emigration to their african colony liberia the back to africa concept was never very popular among the black population and while lincoln initially supported encouraging voluntary emigration he dropped that upon consulting black leaders and discovering their lack of support    leaving aside the moral qualms with the concept this fabled mass deportation was never feasible from an economic logistical or political standpoint its simply a racist fantasy conjured up by ignorant folks who may have vaguely recalled hearing about liberia once in history class
  snap
  the wine is /his/ and the sewage is /pol/ right
  get your racist pseudoscience bullshit outta here
  hes on your side dude he thinks the black community is in any way salvageable
  even if what youre saying is true its still solved most easily by segregation
  trust me when i say this nobody in africa considers aas to be true blacks everything from their speech to their looks to their attitudes are more in line with white americans than any groups in africa my uncle calls them halfwhite strangers
  only about 25 of american slaves were bantu m8
  people arent wine or sewage
  this us government killed the black community by imprisoning fathers and enabling single mothers
  he should have also sent the europeans back to europe
  you redditors are a goldmine for cringe
  lincoln tried some other colonization ideas besides liberia but they all failed too if he survived he mightve half heartedly continue his last idea of convincing the british to let them move to honduras but youre correct in that the huge majority of blacks didnt want to leave and black leaders told lincoln to his face they wanted to stay and believed they had as much right to be here as the whites
  most of the problems with blacks affect their kind meaning its their own fault the highest violent crime is black on black yet blacks think whitey is why they kill rob and rape each other at stupdenous rates compared to us
  between the destruction of the black family and the rise in crime  single mothers are off the charts in all black majority lands
retard shows up to a humanities board and attempt to have a serious discussion while lumping all dark people into black and all fair people into white  wonders why there is a problem in the first place    get your ethnic categories correct in place then youll have some racism to solve and not a big black vs white market the media social networks and youtube simply cannot stop feeding off of youre trying to solve a problem but you havent even thought what that problem is yet
  your post is patently absurd what exactly do you think that proves of course the rate of black on black crime is going to be high when you account for the fact that the majority of these crimes are committed within deprived ghettos/projects/inner cities zones in which the population is predominantly black    you would see the exact same phenomenon arise with any ethnic group in the same situation
  correct in the first place lol

  it really largely is the larg3st recipients of welfare ar now rural whitoids having lived among them theyre just as broken and dysfunctional as the hood theyre just poorer and less population so their murders rapes and drug abuse dont make headline news hell about 1/4 of my class has lost 1 parent or no longer sees them due to drug abuse
  the true colorpill is realizing the system isnt really rigged against the minorities/specifically blacks/women what have you but rather against the poor all over the us  you need not be black to be fucked by the govt
  racist twats   anglo uni student detected
  muh poverty  weird how poor whitey in america doenst have black level crime at the end of the day its all their fault not us white people we never told them to kill rob or rape each other
  theyre just as broken and dysfunctional as the hood  nope ghetto blacks are animalistic rural poor whites are just dumb
  care to provide some stats  various sources preferably
  youll notice that poor whites tend to predominate in underdeveloped and rural areas appalachia alabama mississippi etc not inner city ghettos of course there isnt going to be a similar effect when the environment that constitute their poverty are significantly different
  of course there isnt going to be a similar  why not both are poor right must be genetics
  you excluded the elaboration from that post you quoted
  because in smaller rural communities the potential social ramifications of violent crime are much more significant than in densely packed inner city areas instead extreme poverty manifests itself in other forms such as the opioid crisis
  so genetics then also guess why you cant find much poor whities in cities anymore it rhymes with tiggers
  you are completely retarded  dont ever get out of your room
  genetics look buddy say what you want but poor whitey causes less crime than poor blackey even thought there is more poor whitey than poor blackey retard
  you seem to have misconstrued what i wrote if the situation was reversed and poor blacks were in rural areas and poor whites in the inner cities you would see high rates of violent crime between whites and high rates of opioid abuse amongst blacks    what do you think genetics means exactly
  define a black problem we have i am only aware of an alt right snowflake problem genociding blacks wont make you the kang you feel entitled to be youd still be a dweeby loser
  you would see high rates of violent crime between whites  but you dont therefore its genetic not poverty related  opiods  get the fuck out of here im talking about robbery rape murder larcony and assault not drug related offenses
  thats now how genetics work
  define a black problem  the ridiculous violent crime this one race causes in america compared to every other racial group
  if there are no other causes then its genetic
john wilkes booth was a jew who killed lincoln for freeing the slaves
i think the biggest issue plaguing african populations is a general lack of identity which is something most people take for granted how are you ever going to have a sense of respect for your fellow man if you grew up in a total freeforall environment i am not even referring to america this has been a trend throughout african history
  because the situation isnt reversed and poor whites are in rural areas and poor blacks are in inner city areas    if its all genetic like you say then surely it would follow that the reason why the opioid crisis affects whites the most is because whites are genetically lacking in willpower and are easily addicted to drugs because of their weak character
  yes poor whites tend to have low impulse control so are more likely to be drug addicts
  not just poor whites  being poor isnt a genetic category it either affects all whites or it isnt racewide
  genetics determines what income level you will be if you are too impulsive to properly save money you will be always poor
  if thats true how is it that people ever stop being poor and become rich if their parents were poor surely they wouldnt be able to inherit any genes that allow them to be rich
  i think the biggest issue plaguing african populations is a general lack of identity which is something most people take for granted how are you ever going to have a sense of respect for your fellow man if you grew up in a total freeforall environment    youre pulling bs africans always identify according to whatever tribe or nation theyre from they definitely dont have an identity problem as for american blacks they are just stupid enough to based their culture on media garbage hip hop basketball and football eggball for you nonamericans reading this consumerism latest nike or lugz shoes and boots bling rims etc and drugs and alcohol and in both of these groups they still kill each other and end up in jail the most in western countries
he was literally murdered a year into his second term and a few months into a peaceful america you dolt
  most african nations are meme countries of different ethnic groups forced to live together and besides latin america is more violent than africa anyway

  without black americans there wouldnt be america as you know it they were created by america to as the original american pleb class off of the backs of which much was built and ultimately created a place for poor europeans to be able to migrate to en masse and have a chance at a middle class life  i think the deaths of 700k whites might have mitigated whatever benefits they brought
  how is it that people ever stop being poor and become rich  connections
  it really largely is the larg3st recipients of welfare ar now rural whitoids  because they constitute 60 of the population you absolute tard
  rural whites are not 60 of the pop most live in cities
  rural whites are not 60 of the pop most live in cities  oh sorry i didnt perceive your misdirection your tactic is to break the white population up into arbitrary categories and then compare it to the black population indiscriminately

  whats the story behind those white gloves
  im not sure japanese officers just seemed to like wearing them i guess it was part of the uniform     even today japanese police officers taxi drivers and subway conductors wear white gloves but i dont know if its related
        easier to see what your officer is signalling before the advent of radio the white glaves made it clearer for soldiers at a distance what their officers were trying to tell them it dates back to the sengoku jidai when firearms made the battlefield retardly loud and signals became more important than ever
  ww2 is a top choice but ive always been partial to either ww1 or 18th century early or late doesnt matter

ive noticed that normally as a culture/state becomes more relevant and has more contacts with other cultures and distant lands the bigger and more numerous its monument becomes and often they make more and better art too    classical greece first case
  new kingdom egypt as it expanded to the syropalestinese coasts and had more frequent contacts with mesopotamia the aegean turkey etc and sent expeditions to the horn of africa
  1st century ad rome when it came to control most of north africa southern western europe and a large part of the near east but already from the late republic you see a spike in art and architecture when they defeated carthage and the hellenic kingdoms and later conquered gaul
itt underrated statesmen from your country  purged the muscovites  wanted socialism with polish characteristics  demanded end to soviet internal interference and further national sovereignty reform of the warsaw pact   learned about khruschevs plot to intervene in poland to remove him countered the soviets by saying if they stepped on polish soil the lwp would fight the red army so they backed out
sounds pretty based desu
106 for kino  
  lwp would fight the red army so they backed out  it would be like a cat barking at a tiger poleshit delusions are hilarious

while staying at poland    bishop stanislaw wants to put curse on king boleslaw and whole poland because of muh feels  curse meant back then a lack of restrictions to be invaded by christian neighbours  boleslaw personally hacks bishop for being a filhty traitor he was before he has a chance to cast his curse  church runs the record writing so boleslaw is remembered as evil tyrant while stanislaw as saint dindu nuffin

  piłsudski was a corrupt retarded nigger that singlehandedly caused red victory in the russian civil war destruction of the polish army in interwar period and diplomatic isolation of country therefore ww2
  whites wining means no poland
  you do know this would have seriously fucked up the warsaw pact
  piłsudczycy unironically believe this
  abloo bloo bloo  both were crucial for polands cause and if you want to play political comparisions third way would be the best
  both were crucial for polands cause  piłsudski was a german agent and if there wasnt for dmowski poland would have been seen as a german satelite by the french if you want a military leader to thank for our independence you have haller
  dhuhuuhuhu if we won there would be no repercutions like in my hoi iv games dhuhuhuu    fucking retard even if the soviets defeat the lwp the whole country would be a powder keg waiting to destroy the eastern bloc not to mention the international repercussions and the lost of credibility of the warsaw pact it would be like if the us had invaded france when they withdraw from nato
    i wish there was more decent info on the polish peoples army rather than some limited accounts of them putting down protests
  dont forget   was genuinely popular for much of his rule    was on fairly good terms with the church    was able to navigate much of the problems that faced the pzpr by pragmatic measures and well thought out applications of marxist theory   called out khruschevs hypocrisy in regard to destalinization in the soviet union but not poland
  soviets eventually managed to oust him though and replace him with the much more manageable gierek
  this victory wouldnt matter they knew they could defeat poland and the poles knew they would be defeated but it would be a huge blow to the stability of the warsaw pact and its credibility as well as emboldening similar movements  he wasnt some overconfident idiot who thought polska strong defeat soviet overlords he knew that the wp was in an unstable position where the soviets couldnt stand such an event happening neither were the soviets cowards who gave in to demands for fear of the polish warriors or some shit statesmen know more than retards on online imageboards
  dmowski as all conservatives sińce targowica trough january uprising and 1905 revolution to world war i were nothing które than russian lapdogs and traitors this is further proven by outcome od riga threaty and collaboration of former onr members with soviet puppet government
  piłsudski was a german agent  must have been a shitty agent if he even refused to swear an oath of alliegance to german emperor  pilsudski as dmowski and other polish independence activists seeked foreign support for their cause that doesnt mean they valued sevice for their benefactors more than service to poland  can pilsudski be called a japanese agent for that one episode during russojapanese war  if there wasnt for dmowski poland would have been seen as a german satelite by the french  polish proentente lobby was strong enough with paderewski you cant go around calling people traitors because they made a bet on a side that lost much later
  targowica trough january uprising and 1905 revolution  all of those events were waste of lives   this is further proven by outcome od riga threaty and collaboration of former onr members with soviet puppet government  nationalists were the real communists amirite    must have been a shitty agent if he even refused to swear an oath of alliegance to german emperor  thats called oportunism same reason of why was piłsudski hiding in poznan during the battle of warsaw

what is with that polish chad look
  literally just want to reform the government to make it social democratic because soviet system is obsolete  soviet union is a bit skeptical and doesnt automatically retaliate with an invading force  poland and germany aaaaaaaaahhhhhhh mama ruskaya please please put that spring down theyre threatening our hold over the government mamaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  commies finally decide to come in romania doesnt
  dunno
the only reason union had a chance of winning the civil war at all because the confederate president had spent the last decade modernizing the army as secretary of war
  except the czechs didnt want to leave the soviet bloc you fucking retard or revolt for that matter they wanted a social democracy but not necessarily leave the eastern bloc gomulka and ulbricht threw an autistic hissfit fearing this would spread into other eastern blocs threatening their control over the country
i dont necessarily agree with all of his attempts at compromise but clay undoubtedly had a huge influence over the early 19th century politics in america and tends to be overshadowed by more prominent figures in the era despite his work
  erik scavenius and by underrated i mean hes widely regarded as a traitor for doing the work nobody else wanted to probably the driving engine behind denmark not getting completely raped during the occupation in ww2
  he got rid of the fifth columnists in 1968 also
  thats absolute bullshit   first whites would be in no position to attack poland and second russian empire was already trying to solve the polish problem and give them more autonomy
  there is one legend about him that is probably not true but its still interesting supposedly after coming back from one long raid and learning that some of the wives of his knights in the meantime cheated on their husbands he punished them by ordering them to breastfeed dog pups
  big if true
  this seems to be a common thing among american figures stephen b luce founded the naval war college and was the first one to emphasize strategic thinking in american naval training believing admirals should know how to deploy their ships and gain strategic advantages over the enemy by cutting their communications he also believed admirals would have to learn naval history so they could learn what did and didnt work  instead mahan the guy he hired to lecture in the college overshadowed him completely with his book and decisive battle doctrine sucks to be him

  the empire under the macedonian dynasty in the late 9th to early 11th centuries had a resurgence and did pretty well
did africans develope armor of some kind they had contact with the rest of eurasia medieval kingdoms like ghana makuria askum takur gao alodia
chainmail and helmets were used by those who could afford it
they used to charge into battle fully naked and aroused
  who needs to make swords when youre swinging on around
  they wore chainmail and gambersons
  quilted armor was surprisingly good at deflecting slash damage
  poorfags wore tunics and animal hide helmets those of higher status would wear chainmail steel curiasses and iron helmets with ostrich feathers
  imagine taking an arrow in the dick hole
  slash damage  /tg/ please a sharp weapon will cut open the fabric easily
  fabric mixed with chainmail
no because le warm weather made le stupid 67 iq degenerate subhuman aids niggers xddd
  very dense thick fabric is very effective at stopping a cut but once it cops a decent slash it is compromised it was paired with other armour when possible for that reason
north africans and sudanese did
  only the north and parts of the east
  hey armor does suck in warm weather    
is there any historical precedence for the war on terror and the nearly permanent tightening of surveillance antiterror and security laws since its start
terrorism in europe was much worst a few decades ago we had socialists and fascists who thought they could instigate a civil war and we had neonazis doing hits on random people
  so the people on /co/ who complain about how modern marvel is sjw propaganda are full of shit or is it just captain america whos always been like this
  before was worse so now you have to suck it up and deal with this less problematic state of terror  i hate this way of thinking
  implying caps is wrong
  its not like they are doing anything less than the maximum they can do to stop the terrorism
arguably the best they could do to stop terrorism would be to cut the internet off for problematic individuals pretty much all of them are radicalized online
  they should just use sedition laws theres no real reason to invent entirely new antiterror laws
  comic writers have always swung liberal i mean they were traditionally new york jews   comics from mid 30s to mid 70s are center or right after that it goes progressively left until you have a black tranny muslim captain amerikkka
  like every board on 4chan /co/ is infested with zoomers and millenials neither group has any selfawareness regarding the context of time    marvel and dc have pretty much always skewed liberal always the only real exception are stances that were liberal or apolitical back then but are considered rightleaning now
  this would have literally zero impact on terrorism
   being this triggered by a girl showing her belly  tell me how these people not sjwtier again
  true but would you support a law that allows the government to cut off the internet of its citizens
  why there are tons of them who were literally radicalized online these are normal people who are just lonely and maybe have a lose screw but they are normal they go online and they become /pol/tards who live in an alternate reality full of hatred
  meh i agree with him its unnecessary sexualization
  yes i think the internet is at this point doing more harm than good
    sexuality scares me and it should scare you too
  its a 12 year old girl and 12 year old boys are still aloof the only people she is attracting with her exposed flesh are pedos
  12 year old should be sexualized   you want it in the back of the head or the heart
  i guess she should just walk naked with a dildo in her ass then would that be brave enough for you
      that girl is 12 she looks like a hs 16 year old  spoiler16 year olds are legal for sex most of the us states federal law establishes the age of 12 as the minimum age of consent in federal territories/spoiler
  youre lying to yourself thats not what a 16 year old looks like
  american empire destroys country after country enslaving populations to sweatshops and drone striking children  1 dude manages to fight back and kills like 3 people in the empire  wtf how can nobody see how much in danger we are everyone is so naive and stupid and you have no idea the amount of peril we are in we are all going to die    man i hate americans  this place sucks
  shes clearly prepubescent
    honestly im tired from work and looking back at the image she looks older than 12 and 16 man she looks like shes in her late teens/early 20s
  cant be terrorism if the whole population is in revolt
  1 muslim terrorism is a bunch of looneys from safe nonwarzone noninvaded countries who got radicalized and funded by saudi arabia and then they target countries who were not involved in anything and they target civilians it is completely unjustified madness  2 there is also farright terrorism which definitely has nothing to do with us involvement anywhere
  terrorism is always reactionary  i wonder what theyre reacting to
  id be surprised if she was a day under 30
  well to be fair lots of it seems like just mental illness  even 9/11 didnt have a clear political message
  baiting this bad
  9/11 didnt have a clear political message  lmao  americans are so cute
  yeah attacking the world trade center clearly had no clear motive
  attack the wtc  didnt cripple the economy of the world  attack the pentagon  didnt disrupt the us military command or enforcement of martial law
    saudi arabia and the us are besties more than ever whatever bin laden was angry about it seems like it didnt affect matters at all
  9/11 had no impact on global politics
  wasnt bin laden butthurt that it was basically the us protecting saudi arabia or something after the us helped him kick out the soviets
also bin laden was a western educated literal billionaire who decided the best way to spend his live is to go fight with peasants in the caves of afghanistan and pakistan if that is not mental illness i dont know what is
  something along those lines but it doesnt seem like it worked at all for him
  in the first gulf war bin laden offered to protect saudi arabia but they told him to fuck off and used american troops instead this made him butthurt as fuck
  capeshit has always been leftwing trash made to sell ads to children its just that the market is aging and cant relate to modern leftwing trash
  italy
  wow ill actually take that back there are people who did fall for this one
  its my grandma
  got butthurt that saudi arabia would want the protection of the worlds most powerful navy and air force  an army which can literally shit out anything in rapid war situation and whos economy basically supports the world  what the fuck was he thinking his ragtag group literally wasnt a military force if anything he couldve reformed it and shit
  could you know less about the state of the middle east for the last 3040 years jesus christ
  we had socialists and fascists who thought they could instigate a civil war and we had neonazis doing hits on random people  that isnt how you spell nato
  it is how you spell gladio though
she is most likely 1516
    what is the context of that picture
  arena grenade
we know what american soldiers found when they liberated the concentration camps of buchenwald or dachau emaciated walking ghosts and heaps upon heaps of human skeletons thats because concentration camps that werent also extermination camps didnt have much capacity for efficiently disposing of dead remains so the brutality of the camp system was left for everyone to see    extermination camps proper such as auschwitz ii or treblinka were liberated almost exclusively by soviet troops but what could they possibly find there besides suspicious mountains of ashes and hastily dynamited buildings how did the soldiers make sense of what they saw and how did they eventually realize those were essentially death mills do we have access to soviet witness accounts from that period in time
bump
  you seem to believe that the liquidation of these camps was swift and total which is untrue auschwitz and birkenau werent the only two camps in the area there were many subcamps aswell  by late 1944 the reichs infrastructure was in shambles and the liquidation wasnt as efficient as one may think first of all the ss needed to get rid of the sonderkommando but they also needed its help with destroying evidence also many members of the kommando realized what was about to happen and didnt go out without a fight which further slowed down the progress  additionally thousands of prisoners which werent part of the sonderkommando remained in camps as they were deemed not capable of surviving the march inside germany and with this amount of people still on the spot the ss needed to get rid of them too thats why one of the krematoriums was operational until the very last moment it was blown up exactly one day before the liberation burning corpses of those who were still dying inside the camp   on the spot soviets discovered hundreds of bodies as well as a few thousands prisoners still alive who were able to tell the russians about the horrors of the camps many letters were found as well as many pieces of clothing and some documents that werent destroyed in the process
  interesting thanks for clearing the confusion do we have any comprehensive database of those elements you mention letters documents etc
  what about treblinka wasnt the place basically a wasteland by the time soviet troops got there
  tldr no concrete evidence kek
  oh boy here we go
  cope shlomo
  most jews were in poland and eastern europe not in germany so the death camps were mostly in poland     americans never got to poland so ipso facto they never got to the death camps
    either post your easily debunked mspaint infographs or fuck off you arent contributing to the thread at all
  you arent contributing to the thread at all  neither are you since youre only shitting this board by peddling some bullshit kek
  primo levi for one
  how did the soviets realize these were death camps when the germans hastily halfdestroyed the sites and left loads of infrastructure for further analysis there were human remains everywhere and lots of survivors and captured guards were present to give testimonies
  every mass killing site in rwanda was liberated by the rpf which was fighting the killings how do we know the rwandan genocide happened
dont get paid  decide to destroy one of the greatest cities in northern europe and unite the dutch rebels against the spanish crown  was it autism
  rest in peace belgium
does liberty stand for freedom    
  there are more pressing questions that need to be answered first though
just how terrible an impact did the cultural revolution have on china
an impact so terrible that china is now the second biggest economy poised to become 1 in just a couple decades
  in terms of what overall its bad whatever these new revisionists like mobo gao are peddling now
  it didnt succeed so china still has a culture of cheating and traditional chinese medicine
  just delayed their rise by a decade or two desu thats all i guess if it flew off the rails and went into civil war things might have been different
  youre welcome
  didnt they actually promote traditional chinese medicine during the cultural revolution i remember reading about how they were pretty selective about what they decided to stamp out just enough to solidify maos rule not too hard to weaken chinese nationalism
  cheating and traditional medicine exist in almost every cultures indians native americans mesopotamiansetc even europeans today are still using traditional herbal medicines sometimes and 4chan antichinese shills like lying overexaggerating any negative thing about china is also form of cheating
  idiot
  everything isnt about money fucking faggot chinas hdi is still worse than that of the fucking bahamas and portugal
  yeah and its still keep growing china is still a developing country
  saudi arabia has higher hdi than china even portugal but i definitely do not want to live in arabia hdi is not everything same as money
why the fuck did they do it were they just lazy  with a bit of delegation theres no real reason why they had to split it in two
  so everyone could larp as rome for next 2000 years
  its easier and more efficient to have two administration centers before the age of fast communication    they didnt split they always considered themselves as one unit but with two heads neither used wre or ere as a designation these were coined by later historians
  that is until theodosius donated each half to his sons    he could have just given them all the wealth they would ever need instead he has to ruin everything monarchy breaks states see frankish empire
  really made me think actually
  it was too big and too complex to rule at the time
  the west wanted to remain pagan catholic and the east christian so there was a compromise
  what the fuck get the fuck out of here
its all about distances on    you can measure how long it would take to go from one roman city to another with different variables pic related is going to paris france from rome/constantinople by using military horse stations in summer it would take 79 days from rome and 123 days from constantinople
  but thats what they did or at least what they thought they were doing    the split was never meant to create 2 independant states
  why did that matter theres no need for the emperor to personally go to every corner of the empire and if its a decisionmaking issue then they could simply have the emperor delegate more and say that almost all issues within a province are the responsibility of its governor
  it was inevitable given that the toplevel power was shared by two different men anyone could see that eventually there would be a power struggle which would make them de facto separate states in fact this had already happened to the republic and its consuls many times
  they thought having a too centralized system was giving the generals too much power
  fpbp
  theodosius was not the first to divide the empire between his children he was just the last
  should have implemented an autistic centralized bureaucracy like the chinese
  the emperor is incapable of delegating by nature of the roman system he has to have control of the military at all times
  sadly they never abandoned the collegial rule system of diocletian althought by the time at least the empire was only split in two and not four like the dude originally planned    byzantine still followed that idea minus the territorial split and in many cases the empire had two different emperors at the same time roman i and costantine vii basil ii and costantine viii etc
  they didnt split it was always imperivm romanvm not imperium romanum occidentalis/orientalis ok
  rome didnt have a centralized powerbase like the chinese did with the yellow river
can someone explain to me where does the anti white white guilt kind of academics started    like whats their ideological arguments    that whites are born evil
  you live in an alternate reality fueled entirely by memes
doesnt exist irl its just propaganda from whoever it is that for some reason is trying to create an army of discontented western brainlets
  your government unironically believes you are a subhuman because you are not diverse enough
  sort yourself out you are literally mentally ill
  no it doesnt you are nuts
  lul wud are you pol    /his/ is a retarded radical centrist board that prefers denying reality to resembling the opinions it is contrarian against wont find answers here
  d that prefers denying reality to resembling the opinions it is contrarian against  so /pol/ then  denying reality  please stormfagi cant wait to see you in the next holocaust denial thread
  basically for those academics white identity is by itself a product of the system that perpetuates oppression in the us society for them this white identity is a social construct totally detached from its biological connotations they are not talking about r1b genes or anything like that
  the argument is  1 all ethnicities are equally capable of all things this is taken on faith  2 therefore any differences in outcomes between different groups must be the result of discrimination this is a logical consequence of 1  3 it is observed that whites have the best outcomes overall eg richest and most political power  4 therefore whites must be using racism to enrich themselves at the expense of nonwhite ethnicities  5 this is a bad post and you should feel bad for posting it you faggot
  is there any place to read their arguments
    antiwhite is just a snarl world used by white supremacists for anyone who doesnt agree with them when you ask them what antiwhite means its usually shit like teaching about colonialism which isnt antiwhite its just historical fact i have never heard a lecturer tell me that i am personally responsible for what happened to brown people 300 years ago just that my ancestors benefitted from it and they did i honestly felt more of a defensive guilt about past wrongdoings when i was conservative than when i became less racist because i dont identify myself with ancestral caricatures of noble joseph smith lookalikes any more
moralist crying because people think for them self t spic
awful opening posts but since this threads not going anywhere the end of heroic history and the beginning of cynical history is a giant grey line but cynical historical study i would estimate gained in its predominance sometime between the world wars when the glory of things like generalship knighthood and warring vanished this was also the effective end of colonial expansion and ceding rights and selfdetermination to peoples rather than pushing them aside as your interests continue to advance causes people to be even more critical of the original colonialism as in many places very little had been gained in the eyes of the public besides anchoring responsibility for a population that has no connection to yours     this generation traumatized by pointless war approaches academics discarding ideas of fate heritage justifying actions and reexamines history in a cynical way the rise of internationalization of higher education and communication between many academics in these decades also means that reconciliation is sought between views of events including oppressor with oppressed all these things introduce a seemingly sudden cynicism and guilt into the academic world which is exacerbated by every subsequent generation
    as a student in a leftleaning university i can confirm this does exist i blame the sociology department
  3 it is observed that whites have the best outcomes overall eg richest and most political power  4 therefore whites must be using racism to enrich themselves at the expense of nonwhite ethnicities  isnt this the similar thought process that stormfags use with jews  just change some words and can be almost the same  3 it is observed that jews have the best outcomes overall eg richest and most political power  4 therefore jews must be using capitalism/socialism/communism whathever to enrich themselves at the expense of white people
  wikipedia has some articles related to it      and other postcolonialist studies theres also this guy  
  minorities are oppressed   oppression is evil  whos oppressing the minorities   white people  white people are evil    the irony is their justification for generalization and prejudice is that they think other people are generalizing and prejudiced
  not quite the difference is in 1 and 2 stormfags believe that races are inherently inequal and therefore discrimination is not necessary to explain outcomes this ruins the logical chain between 3 and 4 because other explanations for inequality are available stormfags have no trouble with this kind of logic    3 it is observed that other race have the best outcomes overall  4 therefore other race must be superior to my race in at least some regards    a stormfag would have no trouble with this chain of logic but an sjw would object viruently
  democrat elites are addicted to political power  pesky things like elections and checks and balances keep them from that power as rational agents in a political system that rewards unaltruistic behavior they want a winning strategy to become the ruling party democrats need a permenent majority voting bloc this bloc cannot be composed of whites because whites vote on issues and have no specific reason to be loyal to the democrats if they fuck them over so it must be composed of a nonwhite underclass the poorer and more resentful the better in exchange for the votes the dems will give these foreigners preferential treatment over native whites affirmative action and legislate for the importation of more democratic voters    white male bashing is just the ideological justification for this in reality democracy has been hacked all democracies eventually reach this point because one side will get tired of fighting and will seize power by force and trickery
  white identity literally isnt a homogeneous biological thing though it came about after separate european ethnicities settled new countries and lost their old national identities even the concept of european as a cultural identity didnt emerge until around the year 900 white nationalists and amerifats are trying to pasteurize the natural diversity that native european nations have even worse when you hear nutters like richard spencer saying they want russia western europe and the anglosphere to unify into a white superstate
  white american is an ethnicity itself with hundreds of years of history behind it in which it had meaning to millions of people its not illegitimate just because europeans dont identify with it
  jewish communist   i think im having a stroke
  the same place your anti black hatred comes from    insecurity feelings sexual frustration etc
  democrats are fueled by resentment     remember the right wing gloating when trump won why were they happy it wasnt policy all the studies show that most people including most people who call themselves conservative hate muh tax cuts social welfare cuts pollution and all that shit economic austerity/plutocratic policies only appeal to the rich and a handful of autistic nerds they have to piggyback on religion race dude weed or anything else in order to win    they were happy because it upset the people they didnt like online saw enough videos of blue haired women upsetting them and this has politically activated tons of people and turned them into right wing shitheels     this is only possible when politics is completely devoid from real outcomes and peoples lives its just resentment and cultural signaling
ciafunded academics and multimillionaires like derrick bell and peggy mcintosh the idea was to find a way to preserve race as a means to continue dividing the proletariat after the civil rights movement and the antivietnam war protests and such spooked the ruling class     intersectionality and privilege theory are the relevant terms to search for adolph reed jr has a ton of great leftist critiques of them
  if you look at the talk page theres a lot of doubt that hes actually jewish
    trump didnt run on austerity and plutocracy thats how he was able to win the primary he ran on cleaning up corruption in dc opposition to neocon wars and antiimmigrant xenophobia     he implemented austerity and plutocracy in office yes but for the same reason obama bailed out the banks and didnt close gitmo representative democracy is a farce and our millionaire/billionaire representatives look out for their own class first
  left cpusa  expelled from another  still insists of aligning himself with marxism  just to peddle postcolonialist idpol  this is why we have purges
  fpbp
  i didnt say it was illegitimate i said its a product of homogenization and some american nationalists are trying to apply it to europe
could this have bringed peace and prosperity to the middle east
israel exists    no
  no because none of the countries on that map want to give up territory to other countries on that map or give them to new countries also  bringed  its brought anon
  (((bernard lewis)))  also pic related is the only solution for the middle east
  giving kurdistan armenia and its azerbaijani enclave  giving israel lebanon and the sinai peninsular  making a meme country in the south of persia called arabistan for literally no reason whilst keeping the actual kuzestan arabs in persia  turkmenistan takes a big bite out of iran for literally no reason  that bordergore where afghanistan and pakistan snake into central asia with millions of alien nationalities in their new territory  y tho
  bernard lewis was a notorious apologist for the ottomans and armenian genocide denier
  not to mention  saudi arabia absorbing a bunch of random desert in the south  the uae eating up bits of sa for no reason  syria eating turkey  separating afghanistan and pashtunistan when afghan is just the persian word for pashtun
  armenia swallowed by kurdistan  ayy lmao imagine the butthurt
  turkey is actually occupying levantine land in iskandarun mardin
  no everything under british empire except constantinople which goes to bulgaria maybe france gets syria
  doesnt make him any less of a jew
  this map doesnt give alexandria to the syrians though it gives them diyarbakir
  problems would arise from the sunni iraq being land locked and prevented from using rivers for navigation to the sea by the shia iraq or if sunni iraq decides to build dams further up the rivers to deny shia iraq proper access to water    kurdistan is too big and would encompass more land than actual areas that contain kurds     pakistan is just split so awkwardly and expanded nonsensically to the north    arbitrary nations that dont really need to exist like at all arabistan baluchistan and pashtunistan all of which would only further worsen the areas of iran afghanistan and pakistan    all of this without even mentioning the mess that is israel
  meant alexandretta or antioch i guess obviously alexandria makes no sense
  pashtun parts of pakistan need to become part of afghanistan it isnt good to have religious based states
  no what could being peace and prosperity to the middle east is iran reestablishing the persian empire and getting all of its lost land once again
  kurdistan  fuck  off
lmfao this dude must really hate armenia
  no     once sectarian violence dies down there will be tribal violence
  there are more pashtuns in pakistan than afghanistan logic would dictate half of afghanistan merging into pakistan
  afghanistan is the real country from precolonial time in the 18th century by ahmad shah durrani while pakistan was created by the british in 1947
  if iran establishes any empire its going to be an islamic state not a persian empire
  tafghan pakistan gained independence from the brits the brits didnt want it to exist
  if iran establishes an empire  persian is just what the greeks referred to iran iran has always been called iran similar to how in iran they call greece yunon after greeces province of ionia not to mention iranian culture will still be the dominant force doesnt matter if its under the islamic republic
  pakistan was created by english educated subjects of the british crown and had king george vi and queen elizabeth ii as your monarch for years after independence jinnah was governorgeneral ruling pakistan on behalf of his monarch king george vi there was no war for independence        afghanistan fought for independence    
  give israel the sinai and also lebanongolan heights  lol
  dubs of truth
  dafuq kurdistan needs northern syria cut out armenia  azerbaijan from it as the kurds there got ethnically cleansed there and needs more western iran at iraqi border  why keep syria like that why not merge sunni iraq  jordan
  last chance of peace in the middle east fell with the ottoman empire iran and ksa have been fighting for that spot ever since
  the ottoman empire was wracked by violence and rebellions because people hated its rule yemeni zaydi shia in northern yemen kept revolting against ottoman rule for centuries saudis from najd fought the ottomans bedouins raided everywhere kurdish and turkish sunnis massacred assyrian christians it was not peace but decay and death
it could but the elites of israel/the west believe in a strong delusion of staging events they think accord to divine prophecy
  it could  im gonna stop right there nothing you can say after that could possibly convince me that this map could make peace
  it was called fars hence why salman is known as alfarsi and not alirani  and iranian culture is arab/islamic culture  
  kurdistan
  israel exists      no
what a silly map    arabistan is completely made up    balochistan does not even include iranian balochistan    pashtunistan has more tajiks than pashtuns in it and doesnt even include kandahar    turkmenistan has more iranians than turkmen
israel in lebanon  absolutely disgusting
iit could if you get rid of islam
  why take a bite out of oman the uae/saudi/omani area is the most stable part of the whole region there havent been any wars between them for decades  also what happened to yemen
  persia doesnt touch the persian gulf
  that huge ass kurdistan  who made this garbage
    youre an idiot if you think iranian culture is arabic theres a reason that saudi arabia hates iran but not egypt iran never went under the arabization programs that the ummayad promoted the most important holiday in iran is strictly iranian which predates islam by thousands of years and completely independent of zoroastrianism as well shia islam has distinct aspects of iranian ideas within in it     stop promoting your propaganda that iran is arab
  lol lets just give all the third world ethnicities their own countries even though ethnostates are bad nevermind that none of them are inherently geopolitically secure or that half of them are empty desert areas that have never had anything remotely resembling a clearly defined border for all of its history until the last several decades i mean its all the colonizers faults anyway  i hate this argument and used to believe in it but look at africa for example nationstates were never a thing in most parts just scattered tribes but after decades of being in these states they now see themselves as part of said states identity and citizenship syrian kurds are more like regular syrians than iranian kurds for example what matters is their geopolitical security and that the borders are based off defensible natural features the straight lines in the desert are effectively irrelevant as they are mostly through sparsely inhabited wastelands that despite being only a few hundred miles from the fertile crescent have always been uninhabited for a reason
  afghanistan  pashtunistan  what
  something similar to this would be best desu basically the british should have let the hashemites inherit arabian parts of the ottomans like they promised instead of sykes picko we would have had moderate constituional monarchies in the me instead of baathist dictators and radical wahabiists this along with not doing ajax and leaving the secular and democratic government in power in iran would have prevented most of the problems that exist in the me today  tldr fuck the uk they are to blame for it all
all areas under strict european governance use advanced propaganda and chemical brainwashing techniques to make them love their servitude
  persia doesnt contain persia  what
  theres a reason that saudi arabia hates iran but not egypt  because iran is a regional superpower that is a threat to saudi arabia and egypt isnt pretty simple  iran never went under the arabization programs that the ummayad promoted  they did though the only difference is the abbasids forced the persians to speak farsi which is why their language today is such a strange persian/arabic hybrid but language doesnt dictate culture which is why the culture still remained arabic to this day and this is completely ignoring the role the safavids and shia islam played in turkifying and arabizing iran  the most important holiday in iran is strictly iranian which predates islam by thousands of years and completely independent of zoroastrianism as well  loool maybe amongst the diaspora but not in iran thats not to say some secular atheists dont observe it but practicing muslims in iran would like nothing more than to see it banned as shia islam bans all holidays that are not islamic  shia islam has distinct aspects of iranian ideas within in it   its the most arabizing/arab supremacist sect of islam there is which is why when you compare persians in iran to persians in afghanistan and tajikstan iran might as well be an arab country in comparison
  what in the fuck no
no armenia like it doesnt even exist at all  that sunni iraq  that syria  its shit
  cannabis/hemp super crop
  where are you from you seem to know facts about iran but you have a limited understanding of the region and culutre
  its the most arabizing/arab supremacist sect of islam there is                        
  fuck no  arabs are only on the coast of iran  it would probably be easier just to transfer them out of iran instead of giving them a chunk of it that chunk is literally persia too thats like renaming italy to rome but giving rome to spain
  where are you from you seem to know facts about iran but you have a limited understanding of the region and culture  not him but fuck you he is literally explain point by point with solid argument and you answer is duhu you have a good point but since its not what i thought you have a limited understanding of the region because reason that i am not giving to you
  no he didnt sunnis are arab supremacist not shia
  the only difference is the abbasids forced the persians to speak farsi which is why their language today is such a strange persian/arabic hybrid  before the revolution less than 10 of arabic loanwords were being use try again arab parast  but language doesnt dictate culture which is why the culture still remained arabic to this day  if the culture were arabic explain why nowruz mehregan yalda chaharshanbe suri and more are still practiced explain why the shahnameh is still valued among educated iranians who know their history  and this is completely ignoring the role the safavids and shia islam played in turkifying and arabizing iran  iran was never completely turkified or arabized if it were it wouldnt have these preislamic holidays preislamic literature fire temples in yazd and more  practicing muslims in iran would like nothing more than to see it banned as shia islam bans all holidays that are not islamic  and yet its not banned this is because those fanatic basiji muslims are a minority which the iri will never be honest about  which is why when you compare persians in iran to persians in afghanistan and tajikstan iran might as well be an arab country in comparison  are there even fire temples in afghanistan or tajikistan there is in yazd iran but i dont think theres any in those other two
  i blew him the fuck out here pointbypoint     here you go
  but you have a limited understanding of the region and culutre  how so    those are from sunni sources i never said sunnism is arabizing or arab supremacist in fact it isnt its pretty universal  but shiism on the other hand is another story  from the 12 imams who are all qurayshi arabs from bani hashem to becoming like someone of nobility and getting extra privileges if you are descended from the prophet mohammad or the quraysh to the 12th imam beheading everyone who is a nonarab muslim the list goes on and on    before the revolution less than 10 of arabic loanwords were being use  and now its post revolution and over half of the language consists of arabic also the pahlavi regime only lasted about 50 years before their reign farsi was much like it is today   explain why nowruz mehregan yalda chaharshanbe suri and more are still practiced  diaspora is locked in pahlavi culture sadly  none of these except nowruz are even known by the average iranian and even that is only observed by secular atheists the muslims in iran would like nothing more than to see it banned as its a kaffir holiday and shia islam bans all holidays that are not from islam just like the prophet and his family banned them  explain why the shahnameh is still valued among educated iranians who know their history  very subjective statement educated iranians who know their history means people who agree and think like me and if i didnt google search shahnameh i wouldve never heard of it either  it wouldnt have these preislamic holidays preislamic literature  it doesnt  fire temples in yazd  their numbers are so small theyre no threat and destroying them would give the west a reason to invade  and yet its not banned  because its not observed by anyone except some extremist communist liberals but their numbers are so small its not a threat  are there even fire temples in afghanistan or tajikistan  idk or care desu
  you are a liar sunnis demand all caliphs be from the quraysh tribe like the umayyads and abbasids and arab supremacy is enshrined in sunni madhhabs like hanbali shafii and hanafi the position of imam is not open to anyone its only for 12 individuals and passed by designation succession so a random qurayshi hashemite who is not one of those 12 individuals can never became the imam the position of caliph is openly to any qurayshi arab but not to nonqurayshis
  not doing ajax and leaving the secular and democratic government in power in iran  while i think this is a commendable idea on paper i think iran was too far from god and too close to the ussr for them to ever have a snowflakes chance in hell of maintaining a neutral democratic nationalist regime the reds wouldve pulled an afghanistan on mossadegh sooner or later
  probably unrelated to the discussion but is abu bakr albaghdadi eligible he took up the position of caliph
  he claims to be of hashemite qurayshi descent
  no armenia  huge azerbaijan    i do not like this plan
  azerbaijan is just turkey with persian flavor put the two together and give armenia more caucus territory
  they also have huge erection for armenian clay giving them more territory and thus power is bad idea
  so the jordanians are eligible too
  its funny because azerbaijani dominated iran fought ottoman turkey for centuries
  yes the jordanian kings greatgreat grandfather claimed the caliphate in hejaz in 1924 but the saudis destroyed his caliphate the moroccan king is also eligible and france considered having the moroccan royal declare himself as caliph
  the libyan royal family are also eligible to claim the caliphate
  better kurds than trks
  sunnis demand all caliphs be from the quraysh tribe  its preferred but not a requirement unlike for shias its a requirement   arab supremacy is enshrined in sunni madhhabs like hanbali shafii and hanafi  not really and none of these 3 men were ethnically arabian either abu hanifa was persian himself hanbal was iraqi and shafi was levantine  the position of imam is not open to anyone its only for 12 individuals and passed by designation succession  and those 12 as well as their families were all sayed qurayshi arabs from bani hashem  so a random qurayshi hashemite who is not one of those 12 individuals can never became the imam  yet the requirement in iran for anyone to become the supreme leader which is basically the imam until the 12th imam returns is to be a sayed qurayshi arab from bani hashem  the position of caliph is openly to any qurayshi arab but not to nonqurayshis  again its recommended but not a requirement which is why there have been many caliphs especially amongst the abbasids who were persian and did not claim arab descent similar case with the ottomans
  and now its post revolution and over half of the language consists of arabic  thats only used by retarded mullahs and basiji most iranians cant understand those assholes who use 40 arabic loanwords before the revolution there was less than 10 arabic loanwords because the persian language is structurally different from arabic it was probably around the same 10 even before pahlavi persian and arabic are not mutually intelligible their grammatical structures are completely different  diaspora is locked in pahlavi culture sadly  zoroastrian influence has always been present in iran even with shahab aldin suhrawardis illuminationism which shia theologian mulla sadra was influenced by  none of these except nowruz are even known by the average iranian   the vast majority of iranians in tehran and elsewhere know it  the muslims in iran would like nothing more than to see it banned as its a kaffir holiday and shia islam bans all holidays that are not from islam just like the prophet and his family banned them  you are not the spokesperson for all iranians or even shia you fucking faggot you are literal khomeinist piece of shit who has been arguing the same thing for over 2 years  it doesnt  yes it does  their numbers are so small theyre no threat and destroying them would give the west a reason to invade  at least they persisted unlike pagans in europe there are 20000 of them in yazd shiraz also used to have a lot of zoroastrians until safavid fuckheads got to them  because its not observed by anyone except some extremist communist liberals but their numbers are so small its not a threat  zoroastrianism has nothing to do with with communist or liberal  idk or care desu  you should hang yourself now
  zoroastrianism has nothing to do with with communist or liberal  radical zoroastrians staged a couple of protocommunist uprisings in the persian empire see mazdakites
  mazdakites were immediately executed in vast numbers by khosrau i who was orthodox zoroastrian you retarded brainlet piece of shit go and hang yourself already i am sick and tired of you
  his arguments are not solid he sounds like he knows what hes talking about just from the tone of his writing he fails to understand that religion / culture theres a reason iran is the only country that has not been converted into arabs the only thing that lasts long enough to counteract that is language and culture     it doesnt matter if he spewing facts such as iran was converted to being shia by shah ismail when the culture and traditions of iranians stayed the same it seems you and op are too much of a brainlet to understand such a simple concept
  holy shit that is a gay map
  kurds literally have no claim to an outlet on the mediterranean and simply want it so their envisioned monkey country can sell oil and not be an impoverished shithole
  no u faggot im not even the guy you were arguing with before    mazdak was religiously motivated khosrau was the fucking king he tolerated them while they cleaned house with the provincial magnates and then he sided with the aristocratic orthodoxy again when he figured the plebs had gone too far thats a political move and has fuck all to do with the religion the form that was adopted by the rabble was closer to the spirit of the belief shit was like catholic clergy being involved in worldly conflicts in later times
  arabs dont have the letter p in their language plus iran refers to the various ethnic groups that live within its borders the parthians are not all of iran there are many others including the medes which make up the collective ethnicities known as iran thats why i said that you dont know about iran in a contextual aspect every person that has actually studied irans history would know that since its an integral part of it
  hanbal and shafii were tribally arabs whose ancestors moved to those places abu hanifa had a big inferiority complex and admitted arabs were superior
  sunnis allow non quraysh caliphes shia caliphes must be quraysh therefore arab
  nonqurayshis can only take the caliphate by force like the ottomans because its seen as better to keep the ummah intact and not split it if one person is powerful enough to control it they are not allowed to be chosen as caliph in a shura
  they should let belgium run the middle east
  thats only used by retarded mullahs and basiji  more like used by everyone but ok  most iranians cant understand those assholes who use 40 arabic loanwords  the people youre referring to speak full fluent arabic and arabic is taught in schools so its not like anyone would have trouble understanding  it was probably around the same 10 even before pahlavi  it wasnt the pahlavis tried to change the language like ataturk did difference is ataturk succeeded and the pahlavis failed because shiism is too deeply rooted in arab supremacy identity and culture  its also why iran became pro palestinian anti israeli after the revolution because palestinians are seen as fellow arab muslim brothers and sisters  zoroastrian influence has always been present in iran  your filthy majoosi meme religion is dead it more followers in india and europe than it does in iran  the vast majority of iranians in tehran and elsewhere know it  as a tehrani myself i can confidently say no one does  at least they persisted unlike pagans in europe there are 20000 of them in yazd  wow 20000 out of a population of 80 million such a threat  also im sure varg has more than 20000 followers  shiraz also used to have a lot of zoroastrians until safavid fuckheads got to them  based safavids  zoroastrianism has nothing to do with with communist or liberal  im talking about nowruz which even today amongst diaspora has nothing to do with zoroastrianism in iran something extremist communist liberals and the gays do in order to be contrarian and be special snowflake attention seekers if it was observed in any non negligible number it would get banned instantly
  it wasnt the pahlavis tried to change the language like ataturk did difference is ataturk succeeded and the pahlavis failed because shiism is too deeply rooted in arab supremacy identity and culture    three sunni madhhabs have kafaah saying arab women shouldnt marry nonarab men and that her guardian has a right to reject suitors on racial grounds twelver shia islam has no such rules against arab women marrying nonarab men you are a liar
  sunni scholars like ibn taymiyyah and ahmad ibn hanbals companions said that arabs were superior to nonarabs and it was hypocrisy if a sunni muslim did not believe that arabs were superior sunnism is arab supremacist twelver shia ismaili shia are not
  yes but iranians still say farsi falestini etc like arabs do despite having a p sound in the language  thats why i said that you dont know about iran in a contextual aspect  you dont learn this stuff in iran so i dont understand why you would expect me to know it anyway most of it sounds like pahlavi/western revisionism and contradicts history from an islamic context as even the early muslims from modern day iran called themselves farsi and the region fars    everyone back in umayyad times spoke arabic including persians difference is shia persians kept a bunch of that arabic within their language and sunni persians didnt hence why afghan persian is known as a much purer form of persian than iranian persian is and can be observed by the vocab and structure of the two dialects that might as well be entirely different languages at this point  ethnically shafii was syrian and hanbal was iraqi  abu hanifa had a big inferiority complex and admitted arabs were superior  source my ass    three sunni madhhabs have kafaah saying arab women shouldnt marry nonarab men and that her guardian has a right to reject suitors on racial grounds  please provide sources or fuck off again completely contradicts your sunni sources you tried passing off as shiism here   twelver shia islam has no such rules against arab women marrying nonarab men  no school in islam has such rules these were policies adopted by the umayyads to keep power in an empire that had a lot of new muslim converts  but you can look here for some examples of arab supremacy in shiism   also pic related is one example of cultural arab supremacy in shiism
  those are sources on sunnis you maggot can you read arabic sunni hadith say that the leadership will always be in the hands of the quraysh before islam and after islam
  /thread
    this  was a sarcastic riposte to your lie showing you that sunnis are arab supremacist
    oops i misread that first link i thought it was referencing this sahih sunni hadith  there is no superiority for an arab over a nonarab nor for a nonarab over an arab neither is the white superior over the black nor is the black superior over the white  except by piety  looking further into the first link nothing there are graded sahih and the second link isnt even a hadith its a blog post thats only source is a quote from a book written by some random scholar in the 14th century not by shafi himself  sunni hadith say that the leadership will always be in the hands of the quraysh before islam and after islam  before islam  nice contradiction retard
  the fact that you quote ibn taymiyyah as if he is anyone relevant outside of some wahhabi circles and try to attribute him as some defining figure in sunnism is completely hilarious  also twelvers dont even consider ismailis to be muslim so i dont know why you mention ismailis with twelvers
  the sunni hadith say that quraysh were always the leaders quraysh led arabs before islam and leads muslims after islam racial kafaah was mentioned by abu hanifa hanbal and shafii only malik didnt the hadith used to justify it is the sunni hadith where muhammad said allah chose him out of banu hashim chose banu hashim out of the quraysh chose quraysh out of banu kinanah and so on
  the nizari ismaili leader aga khan was given his title by the qajars
  and the aga khans intermarried with twelver shia qajar princesses the current nizari ismaili imam aga khan iv has female qajar ancestry
  the sunni hadith say that quraysh were always the leaders  shia hadith  quraysh led arabs before islam  the arabs werent united before islam you retard the quraysh were just one tribe out of many in arabia  racial kafaah was mentioned by abu hanifa hanbal and shafii  again false your link cited one random shafii scholar from the 14th century not shafi himself and made no mention of abu hanifa or hanbal also your claim is completely hilarious because again abu hanifa was persian  the sunni hadith where muhammad said allah chose him out of banu hashim chose banu hashim out of the quraysh chose quraysh out of banu kinanah and so on  again thats shia hadith not sunni hadith
  qajars werent shia scholars they were secular monarchs the shia scholars in iran today say that all of irans monarchs were kuffar
  will you stop lying can you read arabic i can
  youre the one whos lying and youre quite bad at it anyone with a bit of knowledge can easily poke holes and point out contradictions in your claims  and yes i can but your links had english translations as well so i dont see why that would matter
      no you are a chronic liar if you could read arabic and sunni books you should know this already abu hanifa shafii hanbal all said nonarabs are not equal to arabs and arab women should not marry nonarab men         واعتبر الكفاءة في النسب الجمهور وقال أبو حنيفة  قريش أكفاء بعضهم بعضا  والعرب كذلك  وليس أحد من العرب كفؤا لقريش  كما ليس أحد من غير العرب كفؤا للعرب  وهو وجه للشافعية قال في الفتح  والصحيح تقديم بني هاشم والمطلب على غيرهم  ومن عدا هؤلاء أكفاء بعضهم لبعض وقال الثوري  إذا نكح المولى العربية يفسخ النكاح  وبه قال أحمد في رواية  وتوسط الشافعي فقال  ليس نكاح غير الأكفاء حراما فأراد به النكاح  وإنما هو تقصير بالمرأة والأولياء  فإذا رضوا صح ويكون حقا لهم تركوه

  book 20 number 4480  it has been narrated on the authority of jabir b samura who said i heard the messenger of allah may peace be upon him say islam will continue to be triumphant until there have been twelve caliphs then the holy prophet may peace be upon him said something which i could not understand i asked my father what did he say he said he has said that all of them twelve caliphs will be from the quraish    book 20 number 4481  it has been narrated on the authority of jabir b samura that the holy prophet may peace be upon him said this order will continue to be dominant until there have been twelve caliphs the narrator says then he said something which i could not understand and i said to my father what did he say my father told me that he said that all of them caliphs would be from the quraish    book 20 number 4482  it has been reported on the authority of jabir b samura who said i went with my father to the messenger of allah may peeace be upon him and i heard him say this religion would continue to remain powerful and dominant until there have been twelve caliphs then he added something which i couldnt catch on account of the noise of the people i asked my father what did he say my father said he has said that all of them will be from the quraish
    book 20 number 4483  it has been narrated on the authority of amir b sad b abu waqqas who said i wrote a letter to jabir b samura and sent it to him through my servant nafi asking him to inform me of something he had heard from the messenger of allah may peace be upon him he wrote to me in reply i heard the messenger of allah may peace be upon him say on friday evening the day on which alaslami was stoned to death for committing adultery the islamic religion will continue until the hour has been established or you have been ruled over by twelve caliphs all of them being from the quraish also heard him say a small force of the muslims will capture the white palace the police of the persian emperor or his descendants i also heard him say before the day of judgment there will appear a number of impostors you are to guard against them i also heard him say when god grants wealth to any one of you he should first spend it on himself and his family and then give it in charity to the poor i heard him also say i will be your forerunner at the cistern expecting your arrival    book 20 number 4484  ibn samura aladawi reported i heard allahs messenger may peace be upon him say and he then narrated the abovementioned hadith
    الناس تبع لقريش في هذا الشأن مسلمهم تبع لمسلمهم وكافرهم تبع لكافرهم    the people follow the quraish in this matter the muslims follow the muslims among them and the unbelievers follow the unbelievers among them    source sahih bukhari 3305 grade sahih

  will mudshits learn to be peaceful if we quarantine them in their own homogeneous countries and separate them by walls  hahahaha how naive
  no you are a chronic liar  ok liar  abu hanifa shafii hanbal all said nonarabs are not equal to arabs and arab women should not marry nonarab men    again they didnt they werent even arabian and the fact that you once again use ibn taymiyyah as a source already discredits your source and shows that you have nothing  but there is a hadith from the 6th shia imam jaffar assaddiq who does actually say that if this thread is still up after my exams ill find it for you              thanks for using the hadith that twelver shia use to prove imamate and arab supremacy and that their 12 imams are the correct 12 caliphs as well as how the mahdi is the 12th shia imam  the problem is these hadith are weak in sunnism because theyve had far more than 12 caliphs so sunni scholars over time have thrown away these hadith and deemed them weak/unreliable while they are still sahih for shias because they have only had 12 caliphs/imams
    twelver shia using bukharis hadiths  bukhari the shia hater    moron
    not ibn taymiyyah can you read it says abu hanifah shafii ahmad        وقال أبو حنيفة قريش أكفاء بعضهم بعضا والعرب كذلك وليس أحد من العرب كفؤ لقريش كما ليس أحد من غير العرب كفؤا للعرب وهو وجه للشافعية والصحيح تقديم بني هاشم والمطلب على غيرهم ومن عدا هؤلاء أكفاء بعضهم لبعض  وقال الثوري إذا نكح المولى العربية يفسخ النكاح وبه قال أحمد في رواية وتوسط
  yes there are many ahadith in bukhari and muslim that shia scholars use the difference is they dont take every hadith in the books as sahih they judge and grade each hadith individually  seems to me like youre just a larper with no actual knowledge    ibn taymiyyah was a narrator in the chain in case you cant read arabic and missed that part
  the shafii fiqh book reliance of the traveler says nonarab men are not suitable for marriage to arab women and its grounds for her guardian to refuse
  searched for ibn taymiyyah on the pages nowhere to be found        
  باب الكفاءة والخيار  عن ابن عمر  رضي الله عنهما قال قال رسول الله ﷺ العرب بعضهم أكفاء بعض والموالي بعضهم أكفاء بعض إلا حائك أو حجام رواه الحاكم وفي إسناده راو لم يسم واستنكره أبو حاتم وله شاهد عند البزار عن معاذ بن جبل بسند منقطع  وعن فاطمة بنت قيس أن النبي ﷺ قال لها انكحي أسامة رواه مسلم  وعن أبي هريرة  أن النبي ﷺ قال يا بني بياضة أنكحوا أبا هند وانكحوا إليه وكان حجاما رواه أبو داود والحاكم بسند جيد  وعن عائشة رضي الله عنها قالت خيرت بريرة على زوجها حين عتقت متفق عليه في حديث طويل  ولمسلم عنها أن زوجها كان عبدا وفي رواية عنها كان حرا والأول أثبت  وصح عن ابن عباس عند البخاري أنه كان عبدا
  this anyone who thinks there will be peace in the middle east short of the death of every muslim alive and its recolonization is fooling themselves
  again stop trying to lie after ive already pointed it out  that book was written by one 14th century shafii scholar not by shafi himself its not a shafii fiqh book its like me taking 1 quote in a book written today by some random shia scholar and saying that it applies to all of shiism  you just switched the links to try and save your own ass the link here   which i greentexted before showed ibn taymiyyah in the chain  your new links are actually shia narrations that take sayings from the 4 sunni imams since they were students of the 6th shia imam jafar assadiq they are still seen highly in shiism and have shia narrations attributed to them  go to a mosque with a sunni imam and ask a sunni scholar there and he will tell you that sunnis reject these narrations attributed to the 4 sunni imams and consider them to be fabrications  but youre probably too retarded to know that
  forgot to link 
  middle east  pakistan and turkmenistan  tajikistan uzbekistan and turkmenistan    pakistan take pamir from tajikistan  afghanistan take other half of tajikistan and other tajik lands as samarqand and bukhara  south iran province called pars give to arabs and call that arabistan  give kurds armenian territory  give azeri dagestan    no tajikistan  no kafiristan  no dagestan  no armenia    why so fucking retardedits literally autustic map which can lead only to numerous wars from egypt to pakistan
  why shouldnt it exist   its existed since the 2nd millenium bce
  stop being intellectually dishonest  
would new borders make the me more peaceful    yes however the borders in your pic suck ass sunni iraq and jordan need to be connected to arabia so do uae and oman inb4 they are kinda different hurr nobody cares european nation states have regional differences too kurdistan is all fucked up take away armenia and give them parts of northern syria join lebanon with syria instead of israel balochistan is all fucked up too doesnt include the iranian part of balochistan
  kurdistan will win
  the amount of lies you speak only exceeds that of your illiteracy quote exactly where ibn taymiyyah narrated
this is how ancient greek men looked like
  looks like a paki
  ready to get drilled in the arsehole by poseidon
on to the next picture in this image we see how the typical ancient celtic man looked like
  who is this guy he is like my twin
wtf is this thread
  if you really look like that marry me    tmale      a thread showing how men from historical antiquity looked like
    what happened when they met
  
  reenactment is more /his/ than most threads here and we know what they looked like from statues    they had no steroids and did not build specific muscles like bodybuilders their physique was sculpted by vigorous physical activity low rep upper body exercise like hammering or chopping and occassional heavy lifting
looks pretty accurate
german bear poster please go
  why are you posting naked burly mem on /his/
  because its historical do you like them
  why are historical sculptures typically of naked burly men
who else was right about everything but ignored by everyone in his time and simply dismissed as a war monger
  he certainly wasnt right about the dardanelles and his attempts to aggrandize himself there show him to be a warmonger
me just about right now wwiii is just around the corner
  t war monger
  who vs who
    climate change  western white people eager to start fighting want to feel dominant over everything again  putin getting old and impatient doesnt give much of a shit about russias future anymore  us and eu diverging from each other  growing power of china  saudis have been fattening their military for ages and now its fuck huge and they are savages looking for a fight  middle east fucked up more than ever libya syria destroyed iraq and egypt barely functional  unrest and strong men in many big countries brazil turkey philippines china russia    tinder is clearly dry as fuck one spark and it all goes up in flames  the only regions seemingly doing well right now are subsaharan africa and india
  yeah nothing will happen except brown people shooting each other up after a drought and china sperging out a little after their growth spurt ends
churchill was right about pretty much one thing in his life
  who even is this
  western white people eager to start fighting want to feel dominant over everything again  zoomers just want to play with their ipads and listen to 6ix9ine if anything the west is drawing inwards us elected trump on a broadly isolationist platform uk pulled out of eu eu itself with its protectionist trade block the single market is striving for selfsufficiency    saudis have been fattening their military for ages and now its fuck huge and they are savages looking for a fight  theyve already got one in yemen and so far its been a humiliation    putin  this is the one thing on your list which is genuinely likely to kick off a war it putin keeps up his shenanigans theres going to come a point where confronting him militarily becomes inevitable because sanctions alone just arent working to restrain his aggressive behaviour
  young churchill
  his aggressive behaviour    kek natos now on russias doorstep and its putin that gets called out for aggressive behaviour
  yes invading your neighbours and carrying out assassinations with nerve agents on foreign soil is undeniably aggressive behaviour    go back to /pol/ dumb altright fauxnationalist
  climate change is the biggest wild card we know its going to be bad but we dont know yet what is going to happen
what si the difference between manifest destiny and lebensraum
manifest destiny had a bunch of loinclothed indians in the way lebensraum had russians psychopathic russians
  the injuns werent white and their civilizations collapsed and were replaced by mad max horse warriors whereas slavic countries were fully populated agrarian/semiindustrial there were barely any indians in the way of the americans its just that the land was so massive the number of settlers was spread out to the point of sometimes even distribution compared to the natives
  manifest destiny was actually successful
  so the only difference is the amount of the slavs
  russians are civilized humans who go to space and built advanced weapons to beat back the invader injuns were literally using stone tools and hollering around fires like a bunch of cave dwellers     but other than that none manifest destiny was living space for white americans
  yes
  one brought civilization to uncivilized lands  the other was an attempt at destroying an established civilization
  they are just contextually different applications of the same idea manifest destiny was more lightweight overall i would count russian expansion through siberia as a similar situation as well
  there were barely any indians in the way of the americans it  le this  the area covered by the louisiana purchase had less than 250k indians living in it when the us acquired the land in 1800 thats nothing british america already had 2 million whites by the 1760s indians were doomed
  about 100 years and the subsequent moral deveopments
none white americans are literally fascist nazi scum
  wtf i love america now
  not exactly a secret
  look at him go
  yanks succeeded while nazis failed
  is morality is static ethics
guys i was always told that there were no good or bad guys in the great war but then i read stuff like this            is it true that the teuton really is a barbaric creature and that ww2 wasnt an aberration
  germans were statistically the most educated with highest  with uni education in the world in the 20th century
  read up on the pogroms in poland and armenian genocide both sides were evil
british government to american colonies good to see that youre doing well chaps but would you mind slowing down your expansion a bit so that we stop getting dragged into expensive and bloody wars with the indians at the very least you could pay a little bit more tax to cover your defence seeing as you pay on average only 1 shilling per head annually compared to 26 shillings in england thanks for listening    american colonies oyyy vey dis is like anudda shoah muh peepaw was taxed 6 million shillings by king george himself we dindu nuffin we need mo acres for dem homesteads starts destroying property in a massive chimpout
i hope you know the pictures you posted is a brony meme
do you see the us taxing western european nations to pay for nato retard the entire point of the revolution was the american redefinition of itself as sovereign and that if it wanted to expand britain could only use diplomacy as they would try to do at ghent instead of speaking like a master controlling where americans could settle and forcing them to live in dense cities for pittance wages instead of exploring ungoverned lets be real there was no serious threat of an indian sovereign state by that time and untamed land     implying the british wouldnt have spent the military surplus on some 100m crown ceremony anyway
  we were in the business of conquering an entire continent for free no charge the only wars you fough on our behalf were with the french whom you would have fought anyway all you had to do was let us off the leash and had you let the colonies industrialize and produce its own goods the conquest would have selffunded and eventually you could have started bringing states into parliament and levying taxes on them    all fo this without a real rebellion but that would have required letting white men live happy fulfilling lives as free citizens and apparently thats bad
  the saddest thing is that people would deny this and/or spin it  the state of this board
    like seriously imagine the british empire without some butthurt cucks who hated happy white men in parliament in charge     imagine the british empire of 1900 with the american states with parliamentary seats and firm loyalty to the crown imagine that for a second it wouldnt even fucking matter that europe throws another war the british empire could have funded a navy larger than the next ten combined and kept on not giving a fuck by 1920 the economic surpluses of the americas alone would write the check for developing africa that cape to cairo railway project paid for done the empire would have never ended australia and new zealand would have just gotten seats in parliament    national debt none zip
    us taxing western european nations to pay for nato retard     no we just see your fat slug blabbing about how europe should defend itself and then screeching when europe even suggests the idea of a european army
    snap
  european army  i would screech too whats next one universal currency printed by one central bank an unelected european parliament which holds more power than the elected government in its own nation fuck that   god save the queen
  lol your brexit process is going so bad that people are seriously considering a second referendum
  that whig party member who went to parliament dressed in an american colonial soldier uniform     lol
  omg big bad putin we need you big strong americans to defend us  i honestly dont give a shit at all about europe at this point drown in your own retardation for all i care
  what happened your reddit post didnt get enough upvotes

his blue pill me on bulgarian history i know that are actually byzantine and by now are turk rape babies but do elaborate some more
they should have supported their mongolian brothers in the finnokorean hyperwar instead they betrayed them and payed the price
  turk rape babies    thats the dirty little secret about bulgarians they arent slavic like everyone else around them the bulgars were a turkic tribe to begin with    thats why they were so buddybuddy with the ottomans despite their religious differences haha us turkics right arent we great fuck slavs and fuck greekoids
  what is it about them that makes them so bashable
  they were slavshits that came to the area and were a pain in the ass for everyone around them    they killed a shitloads of byzanthines and raped their way through the balkans and noone was able to defeat them for quite some time  the kievan rus and magyars in the north finally put an end to their shenanigans and the byzanthines managed to establish some sort of military frontier against them  they also became christian    still they were annoying as hell so finally that guy called basil had enough of that shit and went on fullon rampage blinding 130 of the bulgarian population and integrated them into the newly strenghtened empire  that was the only time that bulgarian living standards were rising above steppe levels but still everyone whined about muh oppression    when the byzanthines had it rough a couple of centuries later the unthankful bulgarians rebelled and created a second empire though it was not as glorious as the first one    they lost a bunch of wars against the serbs won against the byzanthines and then fought an epic struggle against the ottomans who had recently arrived at the scene where the bulgars were never defeated and still somehow lost all their towns and their whole realm    their loss triggered the nicopolis crusade to free the poor innocent bulgarians but for some strange reasons the deus vult larpers tend to not talk about that one
  fast forwards another fivehundred years and the ottoman empire is crumbling and the serbs and greeks and romanians became independent  the turks were furious about romanian independence and declared war on russia which was not such a great idea but the british did not want to see constantinoble fall so instead they granted another chunk of turkish clay independence as supposedly russian puppet which is how bulgaria was again formed    their very first act was starting armed conflict with the serbs about some irrelevant piece of clay in macedonia and also pissing off the romanians because they wanted their land as well    while everyone was looking for a fight at long last greece proposed to put their differences on hold for a combined attack to kick out the turks from europe  then macedonia was about to be split between them    in the ensuing war bulgaria kicked major ass becoming a military super power and afterwards demanded that all captured clay including the one taken by the serbs and greks should be given to them    the serbs and greeks said no so the second balkan war started while bulgaria once again was victorious there the turks and romanians attacked from behind and overrun bulgaria     a couple of days later the great war started where bulgaria allied with germany and together they absolutely raped serbia which was taken over by bulgaria
  for the rest of the war bulgaria alone held the line against the combined russians british french greek italians and serbs in the balkans until it collapsed suddenly being undefeated and recognized as the strongest one of the central powers    we now have a bunch of revolutions and shitty republican movements and then ww2 started  the bulgarians actually got romanian land because the nazis wanted their help and despite romania actually being far more involved on the german side but who cares    bulgaria was still german allied and had a good time sitting out the war and killing a bunch of russians and everything was fine  then suddenly the red army came rolling in taking over the country put all the fightingage male population into a new army and sacrificed them in human wave attacks a couple of days before the end of the war    communist bulgaria was a shithole with no relevant culture history or economic and so is democratic bulgaria right now    the end
    bulgaria held the salonica front alone  bulgaria was winning the 2nd balkan war
  tserboid
  tbozgor
  i am bulgarian and my father looks like a hapa    bulgaria was still german allied and had a good time sitting out the war and killing a bunch of russians and everything was fine  bulgarians did not kill russians in ww2 thats the only reason we were allowed to keep southern dobruja hungary did not keep north transylvania because they participated in the antisoviet war effort   then suddenly the red army came rolling in taking over the country put all the fightingage male population into a new army and sacrificed them in human wave attacks a couple of days before the end of the war  the 1944 coup succeeded before the russians swept through ussr was welcomed by the new government  communist bulgaria was a shithole  precommunist bulgaria was an albaniatier rural shitstain at this time you still had blood feuds between villagers in the rhodopes with communism it transitioned from a country of shepherds and peasants to one of agronomists and engineers now excommie oligarchs own everything as they should now its a country of pensioners and those who aspire to be economic migrants commies built everything of value in this country so why should they relinquish it also lol  the 2 million people who left bulgaria since 1989
        literally half a minute of googleing and i know half of what you said is complete bollocks
why did people only start teaching their kids to avoid strangers in the 1980s
i mean thats not true but it became a larger focus in modern times because we live in the first era in which your children will come into contact with strangers on a daily basis through most of human history you lived in a village or tribe in which you knew every resident you maybe met 200 people over the course of your entire life

why is the modern nation of ghana named after a nation that was never part of its history or even borders and for that matter why is benin named after a kingdom that wasnt part of it either
political neutrality in an ethnically diverse country     naming ghana asanteman or benin dahomey would have pissed off many minorities but also because in ghana the akan of the north claim they came from ancient ghana although that was likely a larp to make themselves appealing to the dagomba
  what are your thoughts on the role of the treaty of berlin in this
  benin actually was named dahomey for its first 15 years or so as an independent country it changed in 1975
  it left much to be desired even a split between muslims and christians would have been better
decolonisation of africa was rushed and illthought out  the transfer of power ranged to semieducated natives who had grand larps for what their nations would become to militant militia groups and pseudonative governments run by locally based european colonists  they had random rules for different names as  says
  the akan ethnic group claim kinship from ancient ghana they even have cities with similar names     koumbi saleh    kumasi     ghana the akan of the north claim they came from ancient ghana although that was likely a larp to make themselves appealing to the dagomba    they actually do its just westerners dont believe oral histories to be accurate for some reason even though many written historical accounts of various places are subject to great biases as well    they even have the same matrilineal successions for the kings
i bleached a hot ghanaian chick in college ama
  my family is from ghana my dad tells we should rename the country ashanti after the kingdom which covered it until the british came however that may offend minority groups in the country ghana is a neutral name for all tribes
  oburoniedgh
  the akan ethnic group claim kinship from ancient ghana they even have cities with similar names   saleh      you are kidding me right kumasi has nothing to do with kumbi saleh this is 100 bad linguistic     kumasi simply means under the kum tree in twi nothing to do with kumbi saleh or ghana    they actually do its just westerners dont believe oral histories to be accurate for some reason even though many written historical accounts of various places are subject to great biases as well  they even have the same matrilineal successions for the kings  lol sorry but there is no linguistic affiliation between twi and sahelian languages like soninke there is no evidence that those oral stories are true this is just larping this is as believable as when some yoruba people claim to be from assyria matrilineal kinship is recurrent in subsaharan africa it doesnt show a link between ghana and asante
  the cum tree you say  the girl i bleached spoke twi   at least when my bwc wasnt shoved down her throat she did
we wuzzery as always africans dont have real history

people seem to imply anarchy is a left wing ideal but to me it seems  no state to enforce equality between men and women so women are naturally subjugated by their inferior biology itself  races naturally segregate due to tribalism and human nature  weaklings need to either get firearms as equalizers are be at the mercy of stronger individuals  anarchy seems to me like a gun totting sexist racist heaven
  anarchy isnt defined merely as the absence of a state
anarchy is a fucking pipe dream even less practical than communism authority will always be vested in either an organization or by individuals removing the state and thereby its monopoly on violence means that exertion of authority manifested by force since the state has a legal monopoly on violence moves from the macro to the micro level instead of a faceless bureaucracy or a president or a dictator everyone now has the opportunity to exert force so your neighbor kyle knocks on your door and demands your sausages at gun point do you have the means to defend yourself do you have the means or the opportunity to avenge your sausages after the fact can you pay someone to steal them back will you and everyone who cares how many is that shun and isolate kyle for his crime does kyle care if you do will you organize your other rightfully indignant neighbors to raid and forcefully reclaim your sausages has kyle prepared for this scenario will you be the one to start the first sausage war    theory authority is absolutely essential for social creatures and man is a social creature force and use of force begets authority where there is no authority force will be used to establish it kyle has your sausages now bitch
why does it seem like jesus specifically repudiates the idea that he is god in matthew 1917 mark 1018 and luke 1819 if hes differentiating himself from the father am i to take from this that the father is a superior aspect of god than the son
  3 persons 1 god
  you could have used much more obvious verses like matthew 2746 where he clearly speaks to god not father god   that being said it was arbitrarily defined so by the council of nicea theres probably political reasons that encouraged it im certain you can figure them out with some research
jesus is the second to last prophet
jesus responded with matt 1018 to the rich manwho was unaware of christs divinity telling him that only god is good and to obey his commandments and told him to abandon his material goods and follow him as a disciple the rich man was unaware of christs divinity and called him good master as a human      john 102239
  unpopular take here because jesus probably did not consider himself god but later writers did so even though some of his preserved sayings seem to deny this others written in by later authors assert it
show me your diplomatic skills
  hemp fuel
saddam did nothing wrong
  country b should invade country a and make up some bullshit excuse to justify it
  saddam accused kuwait of doing this and then invaded
can you drill diagonally
we will move across their borders and pick our teeth with their bones
had a similar quandary to this while going through hypotheticals of tapping into an aquifer thats under the borders of angola and namibia
  ask superpower  get non committal answer  we got permission lads  invade  then sit on hands doing nothing as they mass on the southern border instead of rolling over the hapless saudis before they arrive or withdrawing when it turned out the superpower was coming knocking
  you get to keep what you pump out    the countries governments can each offer to pay the other for the total if there is an agreement one country gets straight cash compensation and the other gets exploration rights for that pocket if there is no agreement they can each compete to build better faster rigs on their side though that might be less profitable than taking a settlement
  could saddam have beaten the saudis the coalition buildup was at a leisurely pace but im sure they couldve sped it up if riyadh was in real trouble they wouldve got fucked up from the air
  country b pumps it country a refines it and sells it
  but country a is skipping the middle man how do you stop them
  the point is to force the americans to land at ports further south or force a hostile landing the iraqis couldnt win once the americans declared the only thing they could do is damage the world economy enough or make it enough of a slog for the somewhat casualty averse americans if they were burning saudi oil fields and lobbing missiles into the persian gulf it might get the americans to let the iraqis off with some concessions won and the saudis humiliated as well    the other option would be forcing the americans to fight in kuwait city instead of trying to hold in the open
  a builds underground wall  problem solved wheres my nobel peace prize
  drraaaaaaaaaaaaainaaaaaaaaaaaage
  hey country a well offer you x amount of money for drilling rights to that oil deposit near the border
  no lol
crash a plane into country b with no survivors and blame country a
  saddam did nothing wrong    this kuwait was a backstabbing piece of shit
  good way to start a war
    the only way of how could have hussein won would be to invade saudi jewrabia together with jewait if it happened he would have huge part of the world oil reserves and americans would not dare to declare war
could iraq even invade saudi arabia i remember from somewhere that the iraqi army struggled with co ordinating brigade size forces
  create a puppet buffer state on the border claiming historical rights
  it could the iraqis arent particularly competent but the saudis are worse of course they will have to operate without air superiority after the first month as the americans will sweep the sky but the saudi oil wells arent too far from the iraqi border and they just need to be in missle range wrecking up the ports will also be a major goal
  country a drills straight down at the border and uses mining charges to damage country bs borehole if that doesnt work start pumping in corrosive chemicals that will damage country bs equipment it might damage the productivity of the oil field but its better than letter those damn sandjews take our oil
  imagine being this clueless    they could invade and they could probably give the saudis a beating on the ground at least while theyre close to the border they would get raped from the air though
  then perish
ignite country bs oil derrig and claim no responsibility
  create buffers around your core population and industry through conquest diplomatic alliances or military presence from there all that matters is controlling the rimland and having a big navy do these things and you will be the worlds soul superpower
  well he was stupid enough to piss off all the important people he was also dumb for not winning what should have been the easiest war in history iran iraq war realistically though once the cold war ended there was no use for him and his days were numbered regardless
  and make kuwait pay for it
  like when opec embargoed the west in the 70s and they just started drilling in the north sea and alaska to make up for it
  that was different time
  winning a war against a country with 4 times the population and its heartland protected by a shield of mountains is easy     and he could have hung around assad the saudis kim etc are all still hanging about
  this imo
  americasama saddam hit me
    when you use your neighbours pumps
the unironic solution is the limited invasion option occupy just the disputed regions with a few limited raids further south the disputed regions are barely populated but hold the majority of the oil then stop     the americans were worried about a invasion of the saudis and it wasnt a popular war there were also major fears at the time that the iraqis would be a tough nut to crack stopping of his own accord despite his overwhelming strength shows he can be contained if given some concessions which might be iraq holding the disputed region until the revenue pays off the iraq debt they had incurred from the iran war which they might never give back but that is a problem for a future president to deal with
  this unironically if saddam just seized the oil pumps and established some sort of peoples republic of peacekeeping dmz for protection of refugees as is the fashion nowadays he could probably have gotten away with it maybe take the matter to the un and yell about it before demanding some sort of mediation
  no wait stop wait
  assad  has russia  saudis  has oil  kim  has nukes    they all have bargaining chips sadams bargaining chip was he was a thorn in the side of soviet interests in the reason and opec cooperation once those were gone nothing was saving him and infact he was a liability pic related was from the iraqi freedom thread from a while ago that did a pretty good job of summing up this idea
  iraq has oil as well and a active nuclear program which israel had to expand a lot of effort in slowing     if it didnt get into as many disasterous wars it could have been a regional power     the picture wasnt the us plan it is the negative side effect they didnt think about idiocy is not some master plan
  thats some pretty fucking advanced reasoning anon i find good old incompetence multiple internal interest groups and seeking a foreign enemy much more convincing this might have been a consideration sure but i doubt anybody in state would have willingly given an entire fucking country to iran    then again before the iraq war relations between iran and the us were much friendlier friendly being a relative term of course
    not to mention the us then spent 8 fucking years battling iranian influence in iraq out of its own pocket    oil isnt the reason though not directly the us doesnt need oil from the middle east its about making the oilfield owners sell it in usd and ensuring that most of the worlds supply is squarely under us control in case of strategic need
  you dont invade a country or become president by dumb and for the hell of it the neocons who were surrounding the relatively moderate george w were sinister in intent and filled their pockets while millions were slaughtered we all conveniently forget how much the us government supressed dissent and disregarded the constitution in the months and years that following 9/11 i dont have it on here but there is a picardia that talks about how cheyney had been given the anthrax vaccine a few days before that anthrax letters were sent out and they were sent to specific politicians who were planning on voting against the patriot act the anthrax itself was traced back to cia bioweapons labs its a time we really should study in detail while we still can as evidence is always being collected and destroyed on these kinds of things
  the thing about cloak and dagger shit is that it is often impossible to verify in retrospect theres probably a certain amount of it always going on but history will remain blind to it so sticking to the explanations that make the most sense in context is really the only option unless youve got compelling evidence to the contrary
remain neutral make money off both sides if possible
  gulf (((sheikhs))) stealing your oil  haha ill make money off this somehow
  offer tax breaks to refineries in country a to come over to country b problem solved ill take my nobel peace prize and my bordello full of the finest class male and female whores uprfront please

  good luck converting your entire energy base to renewable and having all plantbased diesel cars
  out fucking skilled

  dont talk about things if you dont know what youre talking about
  wars have been started over worse
  secretly sabotage their drills then offer to fix them if they allow us to drill for the oil as well
    mesopotamia  eurasian steppe
we own the mountain water flows down from so we own your rivers too
  oil doesnt flow retard
  is liquid  moves  that means it flows nigger
  not in the same way a river flows fucko
  my semen flows into your ass when l fuck you that means l own you
  that would make them invade more
  if he could hold them off for any length of time the usas oil supply would be crippled and the burgers would ride their electric scooters straight to the polls to protest
    why do you imagine you wouldnt be able to
  its easier to cut rock with the grain like wood
  because it is fucking stupid
freedom is the only way yeah
  show me your diplomatic skills  rewatch that simpsons episode  its probably solved in a way that involves the other subplot
  now theyre fucking stealing the wind  fucking hate those guys
  moron
  just nuke both sadam and kuwait problem solved for good
  im convinced ghwb will go down in history as the most incompetent president of all time exceeding even jimmy carter hw bush rode in on the coattails of one of the most popular administrations in history saw the demise of the ussr he had literally the world at his finger tips and choses to pick a fight with an ally over a conflict that was justified and manages to lose his bid for his second term the us could have taken over the world he could have been a dictator instead he threw it all away

were personal shields just a europe/middle eastern/african thing or did asians use them too    i dont think ive ever noticed them used in fiction with an asian setting
  depends on what you mean with asian because turkic and mongolian nomads used them as well
  spooky    how big was it
      
   dont think ive ever noticed them used in fiction with an asian setting    watch red cliffs  there was a battle scene which employed tactical shield walls which was quite entertaining to watch
  they were pretty common in east asia but they werent too popular in japan afaik
  theres multiple kinds of shields in the han dynasty ranging from this smallass parrying buckler to personal shields that covers the upper body to large paviselike shields similar to roman scutum
  heres another one albeit this is from the jin dynasty which is still a bit close to han china
  they werethe japs just dumped them in the heian periodbut even them a few exemples survived
chinese used shields
  all parts of asia used shieldsand about africa they used them until the 20th century
  alsothe middle east is located in asia
can anyone suggest a good book about asia that covers everything about it really want to read some shit about this hellhole
getting real tired of retards like you who have no idea what theyre asking for
  you wont find it asia is a fuckhuge continent filled with many different cultures it would be better if you got one book for every country in asia then did a timeline or some shit like that to remember key points
why didnt europeans unite and conquer the muslims
why would they want to
islam was a reaction to christianity without islam they would indeed be conquered
  did isis actually believe this
sounds expensive also sand isnt very profitable
  to spread christianity and defeat a common enemy you have a subcontinent next to you full of violent religious fanatics who want to destroy you
  violent religious fanatics who want to destroy you  citation needed
    most islamists believe some form of this
    and so long as they stay in their subcontinent wheres the problem

  their religion explicitly instructs them to go to your countries and kill/rape/slave you
  religions are abstractions they dont instruct anything
  if europeans had known what would happen in the 21st century they would have genocided every muslim just to make sure it wouldnt happen
  cool    lemme tell these jews they can eat pork 1st
  they did conquer the muslims
  leftists are so fucking annoying you people are deranged and out of touch from reality morons
  if its in the koran every muslim obeys and carries it out unquestionably    not a leftist brah
  the quran is the literal word of god to be obeyed    its not like hinduism or christianity
  islam instructs its followers to follow the quran literally because its said to be the perfect word of god every sentence in the quran needs to be taken at face value because of the nature of the religion itself
  lots of jews eat pork are they strict observers no but they are jews if youre using muslim strictly to mean people who are fundamentalist then youre not including many people who are included in the word muslim in the view of most people
  (((isis))) has no intention of helping muslims as its a zionist organization meant to force muslims to immigrate to europe and create anti muslim sentiment at the same time in order to make whites die for israel
  every religion instructs its followers to follow its text because thats what religions are you retard
    christianity has instructions on the killing of homosexuals
    but christians claim the bible is the word of god as well
  most followers of catholicism werent even allowed to read the texts directly you fucking /pol/tard
  im done dealing with brainlets if you cant recognize the difference between something like the christian bible from the quran you arent worth my time i implore you to actually learn about islam before making dumb ass claims on the internet
  why the region in the frontier of iraq and iran is nameless
    making a specific country only for muslims and inviting muslims from europe to move there and live amongst muslims is forcing muslims into europe
  obviously they are different but the christian bible wants you to follow its commandments just as much as the quran wants you to follows its own
  its kurdistan as it is named in the picture
  south of kordistan dumbass
  are you blind or just stupid
  thats not on the frontier of iran thats in iran if i had to guess i would say its probably fucking iran
  oh no muslims will kill a few thousand combined europeans we should have genocided them
  khurasan superpower by 2020
  maybe because the european nobility wasnt a bunch of 14 year old eu4 players and they prefered to employ realistic and pragmatic strategies to gain more power rather than muh based deus vult empire
  because a bombing campaign whilst making muzzies do the heavy lifting was enough to beat isis
    implying them killing one european shouldnt warrant their slaughter
  by that logic muslims are justified in the slaughter of europe
  muslims would have won easily
  what makes you think that
  its iran sunni fundamentalists believe iran should be nearly wiped off the maps
  for 
  implying the worst bloodshed in europe isnt yet to come
  what is there to conquer dude
  common enemy     they had bigger issues with each other both france and britain supported the moors and turk against spain and austria even though they literally enslaved and raped christians of their own country by the town full religion was always just a smoke screen
  why didnt europeans unite and conquer the muslims    good countries like spain poland austria or even russia tried sometimes to wipe out the muslim forever    but the eternal anglo the eternal baguette and his friend the eternal teuton decide to chimpout several times to destroy christianity in europe
how do i know that youre some t_d retard the answer you fucking dumbass is that europe much preferred to fight amongst itself there was no christcuck unity among them and euros were perfectly okay with allying with muslims if it gave them the edge over their european neighbors

  nihilism is wrong your human mind has meaning and thirsts for it it thirsts for meaning from specific sources nihilism is kind of a tabula rasa offshoot which makes it wrong
  le being a slave gives you meaning
  epicureanism or stoi  as in adopting stoic habits and views
  yes but theres stoicism uppercase s that is a greek school of philosophy    if youre op i certainly hope youve heard of it silly to resign to existential dread when you havent even heard of some of the most wellattested philosophies for lifeaffirming    start here its a short read but the best manifesto from the best stoic philosopher imo  
  you are always slave to something
  read stoics
  nihilism has nothing to do with depression either as an emotion or some kind of abstract state of mind in fact a nihilist may reject the notion their future self is themselves
  easy all you need to understand is that nihilism is in fact a spook why should the i the unique believe that since everything has no meaning i shouldnt desire to have everything why should i give up my will to keep my property and fall to in depression all because of apparently everything being pointless why do i even require meaning in my life its just a spook
get a wife and impregnate her its literally your biological purpose
  and why should you give a fuck about your biological purpose 
  stirner plz   also if you dont need meaning to carry on doing meaningless things thats fine but some people dont see the point in pursuing meaningless things like property or having a family or anything basically
  you feel good when you cum inside a girl
  i feel gooder when i cum inside boipucci
  and why would i want to feel good 
maybe human beings are animals that just dont accept the fact that theyre supposed fuck and die maybe intelligence was simply a mistake
  dont you want to feel good
  nihilism kinda sounds like the product of depression which means its probably not the full truth and rather distorted by negative emotion exclusively seek out meaning in other structures even as other anons said find a job you can have some pride in if nothing else just become selfish and act as though improving yourself working out eating right having a good relationship exposing yourself to meaningful/beautiful media etc is the only thing worth doing then you can work on having a higher moral purpose if through the process of selfimprovement and realizing your selfworth you havent already and also just being a competent individual who doesnt soak up resources and only produce bitterness is moral in its own right at least a teeny bit
  well you have two options  1 do the world a favor and noose yourself since your life has no meaning anyway  2 shut the fuck up about your fedoratier rick and morty cringe of dude its all pointless and find something in life that gives you meaning try shit experiment
  meant to reply to op lol
  useful endeavors contrasted by useless expenditure work hard to improve your life possibly the human condition and release your rage by merely existing in a great psychological holocaust ie music art sex festivals and other actions that give you a glimpse of death
  my body wants to   i however do not see the point you crave these good feels your entire life without ever being satisfied and in the end even the memory of theses feelings gets eaten by worms even during your life they slowly fade away  in fact the more you try to get these good feels the more they elude you and so you desire them more and so you suffer more if having sex gave no pleasure whatsoever i wouldnt desire to have sex and if i didnt i would not waste time and energy trying to satisfy a desire that makes you suffer if you try to ignore it   a stupid game with worthless rewards
  hot damn wiz you make a good point
  the tragedy of a species becoming unfit for life by overevolving one ability is not confined to humankind thus it is thought for instance that certain deer in paleontological times succumbed as they acquired overlyheavy horns the mutations must be considered blind they work are thrown forth without any contact of interest with their environment  in depressive states the mind may be seen in the image of such an antler in all its fantastic splendour pinning its bearer to the ground
  damn well said i guess intelligence and consciousness is a mistake after all
  sorry i dont mean to wear you down i just wished to express myself  these kind of thoughts are rather toxic and best not shared as they bring nothing but melancholia
  what are you talking about i enjoyed every nut i busted every bite of delicious food every good song and every dumb joke that made me kek i wish it had more meaning i wish it didnt have to end but that doesnt mean it wasnt good
  being depressed doesnt make you smart it in fact means youre doing something wrong in your life maybe something stupid
  so i guess in the end the only thing you could do is dance and laugh in the abyss whilst knowing you will be enveloped by it
  thats a dark way of saying enjoy your lifel
  tbh most of the time its time spend observing strangers as they pass by you thinking and imagining over and over or at least thats what ive observed or maybe i am doing something wrong w my life
  id recommend reading the entire text if you are interested it is quite short its called the last messiah by zapffe   but indeed you could argue that we might have lived more fulfilling lives as primates blindly following our simple instincts instead of pushing ever forward towards an undefined goal in the name of progress while working so tirelessly to distract our mind from asking why 
  sounds lonely which is a very obviously bad way to go about life
  if some all powerful being came down to you and asked you would you live again go through all the pain and misery all over again just for the heck of it yes or no what would your answer be just curious
  i dont see how inherent value is important things that are fun are still fun it doesnt matter if theyre ultimately pointless or not
  you guys are just depressed plenty of people are happy in the modern world
  accept that it is the mind death the soul killer realize that the truth you chose to hold far out ways and pultery truth this world does
  i glad that you find such enjoyment out of life and i wish you carry on doing exactly that  however in my case all the things you mentioned are rather shallow and empty and while i do still feel good when they happen there is always this thought at the back of my mind wondering why    in the end im just in a state of waiting i neither feel good nor bad about things anymore i just wait to see what happens and if nothing happens and i just dissipate in nothingness well i wont be around to have a feeling about this revelation so its fine
  youre depressed thats why youre not feeling ups or downs or seeing the point in anything if i had a fucking nickel for every time i saw someone here try to answer a psych problem with philosophy and failing is have enough to buy a sandwich
  and plenty are not depression or simply existential crisis isnt something you consciously choose to have its something that dawns on you from the accumulated experiences you had in your life so if modern life enables these kinds of thinking more easily there is cause for concern   but it is what it is there is no point in arguing what if however there is point in wondering where are we going with all this and why
  dont act like you have no agency in whether or not you have depression plenty of people who have gone through much more than you are not depressed a lot of people beat depression
    first off i didnt say i was depressed you are pining this on me in a way that lets you brush off what i say because im not thinking what im supposed to think   this is simply an observation there is no point in us running around fucking and eating until the end of times if you dont think its the case thats alright but unless you can prove its not dont go around calling people depressed because they say that  secondly some cases of supposed depression are just people having a bad week or month thats true however thinking people can just man up out of the medically recognized mental illness that is called depression is rather ignorant it is a chemical imbalance not just simply state of mind
  a i called you depressed because you described anhedonia numbness and hopelessness   b i didnt say fucking and eating is the only point of life   c i literally never once said man up despite you putting it in quotations as if i did   d the monoamine hypothesis is a hypothesis far less supported than the idea that depression is caused by bad patterns of thought and behavior which can be fixed by habit changes
   dont know where you got hopelessness from but sure i might be that way but as i said before i dont feel bad or think myself depressed and i dont think you know my case enough to diagnose me either   thats fine i was roughly repeating what i said before   you didnt but you said that people have agency over their depression sorry if i misrepresented your point its just that the bad thought pattern isnt something you can just walk out off especially when something physiological might be involved   and i dont think crippling depression is simply caused by some bad pattern of thoughts but i do not know much about this so i wont state anything further
  voltaire  tend your own garden  ok youre gonna die and nothing matters you wont change humanity ect so go fucking enjoy yourself while youre alive try shit travel eat drink party fuck read books watch movies listen to music ect    the normie way of life is literally the anwser to nihilism
  anon you are describing seeing life as pointless not having ups or downs and not being able to enjoy things that is textbook depression   look up techniques on how to improve and manage your mental health or maybe even see a therapist  or hell accept that life is to be enjoyed in a group and youre focusing too much on yourself
  accept that life is to be enjoyed in a group   is it  it might be more pleasurable for you or even the vast majority but it doesnt make it an imperative     and it might be textbook depression but i still have energy to do things i still see people i dont get bored easily and i dont particularly complain about my own life in fact i think my own life is rather fine and tranquil   its just that i do not see an objective point to anything i dont see typical pleasurable activities as that big of a deal or worth striving for and im not a passionate kind of guy   you say im focusing too much on me but its almost the exact contrary i recognize that the feelings i have are nothing and i dont act on them as much as other people
  you are wired to enjoy life in a group you are wired to suffer when lonely for an extended period of time your a robot running against his programming baffled as to why youre getting error messages i honestly have no sympathy for you because of that its pure arrogance
  best thing about nhilism is even the bad is gonna go away too focus on that
  nihilism is wrong its a dumb ideology to follow
  you are wired to enjoy life in a group  can you prove that  plenty of people have mostly retracted happily from the world not the majority but it can be done ascetics monks philosophers and simply some loners by the way you again pin this image on me even though i never talked about me being lonely or isolated   also you talked about having agency over your own mind what happened to that  now suddenly there are thoughts patterns that are just impossible to escape from    right now im more baffle by the fact that you cannot seem to accept that some people manage to live life just fine in ways you think are bad not indulging in pleasures or living a bit further away from society do not condemn you to a bad life or a wrong way to life live if that is truly even possible   also i do not particularly care for your sympathy even if i find it kind of rude of you to simply brush me off again as some kind of deficient machine because i do not experience live as you do
  im not linking a scientific paper to show you the sky is blue at a certain point its your fault to not know basic scientific and common sense facts like humans are social animals and develop psychological problems when isolated     you have agency over whether you have depression not over your strongest instincts if you deny certain instincts you will almost certainly develop depression which would be your fault     you are refusing to accept how similar people are in what they find meaning in they find meaning in working with a group they like and achieving goals and self improvement especially in the context of the former under that they find meaning in beauty and awe music art and men like fighting and simulating fighting they need to be physically active and they like to fuck   if you deny yourself those things and sit confused with your thumb in your ass as to why life sucks it seems pointless then youre an idiot
  i guess im an idiot then and im fine with it isnt this what counts    i think you see the human psyche in terms of grand generalizations unable to accept that theses rules of yours can be rather flexible   if humans are a social animal how do you explain the desert fathers  or any kind of ascetic movement  you say men like fighting and physical activity so how do you explain that so many dont    your view of how life should be is rather cliche   and all those supposed meanings that you listed are still only in terms of personal satisfaction in the end they are still worth nothing
  why
  calling something cliche isnt an argument some things are cliche because people keep independently discovering the same truth   ive never met a single man on this planet who doesnt not enjoy some form of violent entertainment or sport it is ubiquitous     stop focusing on extreme exceptions all rules have fringe rare exceptions anon if you want to pretend youre unique and somehow immune to human desires and complaining about how boring and pointless life is dont be surprised when people start pointing out that youre an idiot
  because people dont have total free choice when it comes to meaning some social context improvement and growth is required youre not going to find a meaningful life spending your whole life eating saltines in the dark while alone your choices are restricted
  ive never met a single man on this planet who doesnt not enjoy some form of violent entertainment or sport  have you met them all  im pretty sure you could find another fringe or exception to that also that you would proceed to ignore   you taking averages as the only true way to be and brushing off all possible alternatives is kind of trend at this point   i said im not immune to them i wish i was simply that i dont consider them to be the be all end all of life and worth pursuing i didnt complain about boredom either simply pointlessness  so lets see according to you denying your strongest instincts is bad because it will certainly develop depression so are people waiting for marriage to have sex doing it wrong  avoiding onenighters is being an idiot    should we just all follow our instincts without question 
  stop acting like youre a special snowflake anon people are incredibly similar in what they enjoy and find meanning in it nearly always falls under the categories i listed     yeah if you stay abstinent until far into your adult life to get married youre doing something bad for your physical and mental health im sure youll also deny this because you dont know science facts that are also glaringly obvious these things are nuanced but you should expect frustration psychological and physical health problems if you abstain from sex for a long time
  i already provided examples that you brushed off as exceptions so it is possible to out of your norms and as such there is statistical possibility that i would be one of them but i dont consider myself very special in terms of tastes only maybe in terms of philosophy     you should expect  but you are not obliged to also the moral satisfaction of enduring can outweigh the frustration of abstaining but im sure you will deny this as some kind of exception   also you didnt answer my question should we follow our instincts without question 
  what examples i pointed out you shouldnt isolate yourself and you gave examples of people who live in groups it was so dumb i ignored it  exceptions might exist but youre complaining about how life seems meaningless while you deny my truths i know my life has meaning youre aimless youre not in any position to act like you have a point over mine
  people retiring to live alone in the desert for years is people who live in groups  what      while you deny my truths  i saw a bunch of subjective reasons as to why someone would live not an objective reason as to the purpose of life as a whole    i know my life has meaning youre aimless  this is true you have a subjective meaning i have too in fact i enjoy quite a few things too however none of those things are truly reason to exists and none of the satisfaction we get from those things is going to matter once we die   youre not in any position to act like you have a point over mine  yes i am you are acting as if your meanings are universal and objectives while they are not at all some people that living alone for extended periods of time are happy some men that dont enjoy violence are happy some women that enjoy violence are happy some people that abstain from sex are happy stop trying to act as if you hold the only set of key to live an overall satisfying and fulfilling life because you really dont
subscribe to hedonism its sort of like nihilism but youre a fun person instead of a little bitch
  meaning is construct of the human mind it does not exist in the objective material universe holy shit youre dumb
  it gets old and you will need something more substantial or youll probably become a drug addict
  well this is what we are arguing since the beginning is case you didnt know   and this is exactly the problem without objective meaning to our actions why do any of them at all 
  i would say no
  stop being a weak faggot
  youve been arguing this whole time that the objective universe doesnt have a meaning for humans you might as well have been arguing that rocks dont get sad no fucking shit kid meaning is a construct of the human mind its a given that it isnt some material object
  so why do anything 
  because you will suffer or at very least miss out on an enjoyable and fulfilling life
why dont you just choose not to suffer from existential dread the entire concept seems retarded is it really that difficult to think for yourself
  whats wrong with constantly seeking higher pleasure having our telos to continue on is one of the most beautiful things in the world fuck you for not working towards realizing it
  and why does that matter  in the end whatever your life was your memory of it will be erased you wont keep anything out of it   you could have the best or worst life it wont matter at all   im not saying you should not try to seek pleasurable things obviously since you are in this body you might as well but people that swear only by the idea of im happy because i accomplished my biological duty of reproducing or im happy because im recognized by my peers its all fine and well but some people out of the weird idea that their meaning and only their meaning will give them happiness is highly deluded the realization that no meaning is inherently better than another frees you and allows you to put things in perspective and pick a maybe more simple meaning in life   you might really like having sex but by having too much sex you risk having a diseases or simply feel unsatisfied by it at some point or pursuing a career with so much zeal that you end up burnt out so realizing that it is not the only thing that matters it allows you to step back and break away from meanings that are becoming actively harmful for your physical or mental health   it does has the side effect of making you doubt about what is truly important and make you enjoy things a bit less passionately   thats all im saying really
  tranquil happiness is the most pure form of happiness precisely because there is no goal nothing to disappoint you in the end   but you will never find that because youre a nihilist
  not something to focus on  in my opinion something to accept  everything will wash away so why trouble yourself with the small things yolo  it is very powerful if you can master it  exp boss/customer/whoever starts to yell or cause stress you can look at them and be like in 100 years no ones is gonna remember you in 1000 years no one is gonna care you ever existed in 100000 the earth what is that xd 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 end of the universe all has come to an end  now you can look at them in the eyes and be like yea that right  peace at last
start at the bottom and work your way up
  youll unironically figure it out when youre older you cannot be a hedonist for too many years
  you would not have to ask this question if you were experiencing it
  actually i agree with that   happiness can only be truly enjoyed when you dont have a desire a need for something so you should break away from as much needs and desires for you to enjoy tranquil happiness   and that comes what learning to temper your instincts and cool your passions this is helped by the idea that you dont need to archive this or that because it doesnt really matter
  believe in god  /thread
  i dont see why   you can have a lot of money and wonder to yourself why are you accumulating so much money and still carry on doing it because its the only thing you know how to do in life
  people who have meaningful lives do not wonder what the meaning of their life is theyve already found it i feel like im talking to a retard
  people are perfectly capable of pursuing desires and feeding their instincts and taking special time to just totally relax and let go why is everyone here so autistic
  most pure id said its that safest and most important thing to get right and do  but the purest nah achieving something that changes the way you perceive the world and touches your very being deep within has been the purest happiness ive ever felt my entire life  thats my opinion    this is helped by the idea that you dont need to archive this or that because it doesnt really matter  personally tranquillity/meditation is at its best not to separate yourself for x but to accept where youre at and slowly relax to think of the next best step
  no need to be insulting   i didnt ask what was the meaning of my life i wondered what was the meaning of life   i did go through a phase of doubt and reconsideration but now im pretty much on track again and thanks to the realization of the lack of meaning i broke away from a lot of bad expectations and i feel actually much better than before where i felt frustrated and disappointed all the time
  where did i say you couldnt    i specifically talked about people that didnt realize that you could let go   but the more things you desire the more you place your happiness in front of you instead of here and now and the less happy you are thats for sure   why are people here so aggressive at any sentence without trying to clarify first 
  people can set their pursuits aside and relax for a few hours or days you clarifying didnt change the fact that you believe it somehow makes life harder
  people can set their pursuits aside and relax for a few hours or days  this is exactly what i mean taking time to break away from your long term life goals and desires to enjoy what you have right now   people that think in terms of when i will work and get a lot of money then i will be able to be truly happy and when the times comes they will say yeah thats great and all but i need more money to do the things i really want now so i will work harder etc  they never get to enjoy what they already have so you need to step back and find your happiness here and now if you ever want to be happy   we are not in disagreement no need to look for conflict
   tranquillity/meditation is at its best not to separate yourself for x but to accept where youre at and slowly relax to think of the next best step  yes but to accept where you are at you must separate from what your were yesterday and what you will be tomorrow thats the core behind the idea of the here and now from that state of presence you can then focus to do what you wish simply enjoying the state of presence or taking advantage of this new perspective to as you say think of the next step or whatever else
go read jordan peterson or something
  just larp as best you can and take solace in that youll beat the game by not reproducing and passing on the burden of consciousness
  literally arbeits macht frei  fuck off
  stoicism always sounded really presumptuous to me it claims to be all based in what is natural only to go on and make tons of claims that arent necessarily natural at all  epicureanism is much better
  but what if i agree with smerdyakov
  i honestly think id be happier if i was a literal tard
  i dislike your take that nihilism is a trap you fall into it is the only thing that can save you from ideological possession religion or morality in general once you unshackle yourself from the meaning forced upon you by your surroundings you can be free to live life on its own accord in my opinion a suicidal disposition is the start of the real life when you have nothing to lose you are free to do anything
  live life on its own accord sounds more existentialist than nihilist
  it is existentialist nietzschean in fact but it can only be reached completely through nihilism
you stop asking other people for meaning and construct it for yourself
  nihilism is wrong  wow thanks for this very helpful and actionable advice
  i also feel good when i eat rice and beans is that my biological purpose too
  act as though improving yourself working out eating right having a good relationship exposing yourself to meaningful/beautiful media etc is the only thing worth doing  this is sorta what im doing its helping a little i guess but not as much as id like
  partially yeah
  meaning is something humans feel unless theyre sad or depressed if you dont have meaning or arent interested in it something is out of whack your brain is out of tune
  yes but what does one do about that
  there is no hell or heaven but you can make your own on earth  most important part is what you do now
  you cant do it 24/7 though
  t uncle ted
you dont escape it you accept it    the universe is what it is it wont be the other way just because the other way would be better    instead refocus your worldview with nihilism as the basis
  god bless
  this is literally the answer tho
  so accept nihilism as an axiom and move up from thereto like existentialism
  now youre getting it
  my body wants to    nigga you are your body its literally the only thing in this world that is actually yours and only yours everything psychological is biological so get that dualism bullshit out of here
  can you control your heartbeat your hormonal output your digestion   no you cant how can you say you are something when you dont control it at all   as you say it is mine meaning it belongs to me but it isnt me  you influence it you direct it but you are not it just like when you drive a car you are not the car  whatever consciousness may be even if it is only a phenomenon the is created in the brain by the brain at birth and dies with the body thats what we are not the body itself
  you might as well have been arguing that rocks dont get sad  if a god created us with a specific purpose in mind that would give us all a meaning to follow it isnt that much of a crazy idea    that is one of the infinity of possible meanings
  what
  hedonism is literally the most chad philosophy of all  volcano eruption disease death fuck that shit dont worry lets fight them back
  bang meth
  all the things you mentioned are rather shallow and empty  there is always this thought at the back of my mind wondering why   everyone asks why wants meaning and gets depressed thinking about death it is more shallow and empty to assume anyone who enjoys things is a purely dumb hedonistic animal and only you are a special snowflake who thinks about philosophy
  also you are lying the logical conclusion of your line of thought is to dedicate every fiber of your being to finding answers in which case you would not be shitposting on 4chan    we are both dumb hedonistic animals with a limited capacity for thought you are just dishonest
  nihilism doesnt exist everything has a will towards something the very act of becoming a nihilist requires this aesthetic decision which negates the concept of nihilism your own ego consciousness may cease but it as a fundamental experience lives on and continues to for eternity within a sea of consciousness
if you can accept that life has no meaning why not also accept that its meaningless to be concerned about such things  you still want to do things in life but you may be discouraged or not enjoy them because you always try to find meaning while doing that    if you really think that life has no meaning you can leave the question behind you and only use that information when its practical or needed which is never
  stirnerposting might be the best meme ive seen on 4chan in years
  you can control all of these  check peripheral nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system we just dont know how to control it but definitely were doing it all the time subconsciously
  nihilism is the belief that the objective meaninglessness of all is an objectively meaningful thing to believe in  conviction presumes meaning to argue against objective value is to appeal to a truth to deny it     you escape from nihilism by having two brain cells which is more than what modern philosophy departments have in stock
  thats the epicurean spirit
tldr  nihilism is completely in your head and the only way to get out of that edgy phase is to not think that much and be a normie get a job religion or find structure drugs can help too

vietnam is pretty big for myths    stabbed in the back theory mostly that american journalists and the home front betrayed the men at the front and that the war was eminently winnable but that america chose not to i want to state that this is kind of right in that had america been prepared to basically sacrifice its superpower status and just devote its entire nation to securing vietnam it might have done it but the main causal relationship is that the media lowered this tolerance for suffering so low that no matter what the american fighting man did he was always going to lose this just straight ignores what the us government was saying 196468 and how opposition to the war increased in proportion to us casulitites and draft rates not in proportion to how the media portrayed it the honest truth is that the american army and marine corps was outfought and suffered unacceptable loses to what was at stake     the other myth this one mostly liberal is that south vietnam was just an american puppet state an artificial colonial construct that would not have occurred without american intervention in this reading america was wise to abandon vietnam not withstanding the falsecost fallacy but because they were fighting for no particular people and a reluctant population i think pointing too the vibrant civil society within south vietnam can disprove this and the distinct differences it had with the north such a religious and political freedoms and its own politics when protesters attacked the government they did it in southern vietnamese political terms in demands for greater democracy and more money for veterans not for a communist state or overthrow liberals like to pretend this never happened to give argument to the we fought for corporate interests meme and conservatives hate it because it shows the disengagement for what is was an abandoning of a people who were real and not just american puppets
  in a related one to yours op this notion that the us is historically casualty averse if you look up how many casualties the us is willing to sustain in just 20th century conflicts compared to most other powers its actually very high before they start deciding to pull up stakes and abandon the war    what the us is unusual at is a willingness to employ force for marginal efforts and marginal gains whereas a lot of other countries simply wont bother but if you compare say vietnam to other similar conflicts like the soviets in afghanistan or the french in algeria you find that the us sticks around for longer and often sustains higher casualties than most other countries are willing to
2bh no one really cares about the vietnam war anymore at least not in that way yes plenty of people think that the carpet bombing was bad and that the way vets were treated was bad but as far as greater social and geopolitical implications are concerned it doesnt amount to much in the popular mindset like it once did ussr lost the cold war vietnam is integrated into global markets and usa remains the premier superpower     unlike germany in ww1 where the stabbed in the back theory had greater implicationsthat war destroyed monarchism in europe germanys empire as well as led to the destruction of several ancient and powerful statesin the usa it doesnt really matter that we lost the vietnam war so whether we were stabbed in the back or not doesnt matter
  do you know anything about fulro and the chams khmer krom and degar in the vietnam war about les kosem and po dharma
  the honest truth is that the american army and marine corps was outfought  cept they won every single battle  in particular the tet offensive was a utter disaster for the gooks  the actual honest truth not written by a retard is that the political restraints on the war made it impossible to win no matter how well it was fought to win they needed to invade the north and risk war with china
  wait you mean a war consists of more than just pitched battles and even if you win pitched battles you dont necessarily win the war huh really makes you think
  the war was a total shitshow the usaaf was so fucking ill equipped to deal with low intensity warfare read literally anything except nukes they had to outsource ground support to the marines and navy lessons were learned in vietnam which is also why america is so keen to hang on to relics like the a10 to not repeat that mistake
  basically this no discernible military objective constantly on defense and no real end goal other than the untenible idea of viets accepting a korean situation there was a wider geopolitical goal but the american military got put into a place where the tactical held no effect on the strategic
  fulro defeated american special forces in their debut battle in 1964 in the central highlands they took dozens of elite american speciam forces prisoner and killed dozens of arvn later fulro fought against the viet cong and nva they were ethnic minorities like cham khmer krom and degars fighting for independence from vietnam the cham muslimcommander po dharma fought against the americans south vietnamese arvn viet cong and north vietnamese nva he was briefly held prisoner in an amerian brig after fighting american troops and was later wounded while fighting against the viet cong the cham muslim paratrooper general les kosem was a hajji who made pilgramage to mecca and he directed fulro against both south vietnam and north vietnam they had cham hindus working with them po dharma is a hindu pseudonym and les kosem used a hindu deity as his radio callsign in combat
    in what dimension do you guys think that these are rebuttals to what i said
  all they did was go into the jungle and kill people thats not how you actually accomplish long term objectives against guerilla forces
  it isnt a rebuttal im adding to your point of america not being able to win
  fulro commander po dharma ran right into american troops during a battle against the americans the cambodian president lon nol who was supporting fulro against both south vietnam and north vietnam intervened with the americans to get him released after po dharma was severely wounded in battle against the viet cong and nva fulro command pulled po dharma out of the battlefield and sent him to france to become a fulro political officer po dharma still tours the world today and talks about cham and champa history fulro are the only nongovernment force to have defeated american special forces and live to tell about it
  my main point is basically exactly this line of logic this is the myth american military forces failed to defeat the enemy and anything short of recognizing this means a great many americans died for the us to learn nothing militaries are not there to win battles they are there to win wars and simply saying political restraints is a limiting and incorrect metric to understand what happened     really the tactics of coin of nationbuilding were all wrong it wasnt just the restraint of not invading here and there and war with how ever many nations it was the inability of us forces to secure any piece of ground for any amount of time the complete and utter lack of workable intelligence for offensive operations meaning that the nvietnamese forces essentially controlled when and where engagements happened its not a coincidence that tet is always sighted as the time america won but what did us forces follow up tet with on an operational level barely any changes and i think the key here is busting the us national myth that the greatest soldiers on the planet could only be stopped because of strategic and operational limits placed on them by the folloy of presidents of westmoreland when frankly what the us infantry achieved was not very impressive
  fulro was supported by cambodia and china the anticommunist cambodian president lon nol hated all vietnamese he hated south vietnamese and north vietnamese and massacred thousands of vietnamese in his coup where he took power as president he was plotting with fulro to destroy south vietnam and north vietnam to restore champa to the chams central highlands to the degar montagnards and mekong delta and saigon kampuchea krom to cambodia since the vietnamese conquered and stole all of them from thise ethnic minorities les kosem was going to be the president of champa after victory against the vietnamese lon nol was printing maps showing champa as cambodias neighbour and officially receiving general hajji les kosem as a president
  i think just adding onto the second point the strategic hamlet program was a south vietnamese initiative as were many programs americans later claimed credit for particularly the successful pacification initiatives
  the strategic hamlet program was a total fucking failure though turns out uprooting highly spiritual people that believe their dead can still apparate from their ancestral villages doesnt make them happy
  south vietnam was seen as artificial due to the government which started as the monarchy france restored whose reputation was at the bottom after colonization by france and japan    the first and second republic after were attempts to reset legitimacy and reputation and direct military intervention from the us pretty much work against that as ngô đình diệm himself predicted
  which started as the monarchy france restored whose reputation was at the bottom after colonization by france and japan  the monarchy was kept continuously throughout the french protectorate it was always there
  a thin veneer no one except vietnamese nobles really bought into though
  the state of vietnam established by france with the monarchy encompassed all of vietnam not only south vietnam
  and nobody believes in its strength due to frances constant meddling with its working and succession exiling any that dare to work against them  to make matter worse france restored the monarchy after the communist abolish it so for both north and south its pretty much a cuck
  and howd that go for you not even the fucking south liked bao dao except for the french sponsored religious sects that cultivated fucking opium and sold it on to the corsican mob with french secret service approval
  france treated nonvietnamese minorities better than vietnamese did france forced vietnam to give back the laotian houphanh province to laos after vietnam violently stole and annexed it from laos predecessor state lan xang france stopped vietnam from stealing more land from cambodia and laos vietnam already stole the mekong delta and saigon from cambodia france created autonomous regions in the central highlands for the degar montagnard minority and in the north for the tai dam nung and hmong minorities the vietnamese communists abomished all ethnic minority autonomous regions in 1976 and the south vietnamese did the same earlier this is why ethnic minority fulro hated both south vietnam and north vietnam and fought against all vietnamese
and how did it become so popular

post yfw canadians austrialians and new zelanders think they mattered in ww1
mfw brits think they mattered in ww2
  i havent seen any of those claim they were some major impactful force during ww1 but more so contributing more than they had to for just british dominions and minor belligerents
  mfw he thinks his opinion is correct
  canadians were considered to be shock troops and turned the tide of the war at vimy ridge
  lest we forget
  post yfw they actually dont but americans really genuinely do think they mattered
why would they even fight in those wars seems like a waste
  on orders from the queen
  ameritards
  mattered a lot more than you would care to admit
  retard
  thats completely retarded     that being said i do find it to be rather comical how the allies begged the americans to join both world wars and now their descendants desperately try to pretend like americas involvement was completely insignificant
  and turned the tide of the war at vimy ridge    lmao  the two battles that turned the tide on the western front are the first battle of the marne in 1914 and the second battle of the marne in 1918  vimy ridge was an irrelevant skirmish
  the first battle of the marne was a turning point but the second was not    you could say the second battle of the marne marked the symbolic end of the war but verdun and the somme marked the beginning of the end for germany although they were not decisive battles
  but the second was not    yes it was  the attack failed when an allied counterattack supported by several hundred tanks overwhelmed the germans on their right flank inflicting severe casualties the german defeat marked the start of the relentless allied advance which culminated in the armistice with germany about 100 days later   
why were the romans unable to capture the entire british island
  its less about being able rather than it not being worth it sure there was stiff resistance but the northern section of the isles like germania really held nothing of value for them
  because of scottish bvlls
    because everything north of the wall is a barren shithole with no resources worth exploitation occasionally theyd march in and kill everything that moves to remind them whos in charge pic related
they were literally scared of the pictish warrior also this     had it been augustus or julius caesar in charge things mightve been different
      can anyone else name a place that the romans called barren and worthless that they didnt manage to conquer  theres a gold star sticker in it for you
  arabia
  that place crassus died
  too exposed to water as bad as mongols on open sea
alt there was a wall in the way
  africa arabia germannia
  germania was actually pretty rich in resources it just that the germanians went straight tetoburg on any roman who tried to colonize that shit    infact the winter before tetoburg they asked for some roman cohorts and then massacred them collectively when they got back
  those cohorts killed each other iirc german women rather mass suicide then placate roman dick
      by the conditions of the surrender three hundred of their married women were to be handed over to the romans when the teuton matrons heard of this stipulation they first begged the consul that they might be set apart to minister in the temples of ceres and venus and then when they failed to obtain their request and were removed by the lictors they slew their little children and next morning were all found dead in each others arms having strangled themselves in the night
  this is simply not true if germannia was worth the conquest it would have been conquered it took the romans over 100 years and a lot of dead to subjugate spain they did this because it was rich in cities and natural resources the romans lost more men in other theatres of war and continued to fight because the overall cost was worth it germannia had no cities to loot and subjugate it was low in population and was mostly dense forests and swamps
  resources is not the only reason to conquer something augustus wanted to expand to the elbe because it would have created a single frontier across central europe far enough away from italy to prevent all but the most massive barbarian incursions rather than two disjunct power bases on the rhine and danube
  resources is not the only reason to conquer something  wrong  return on investment    augustus  literal who
    if germania was worth the conquest it would have been conquered  if parthia was worth the conquest it would have been conquered    hop off that roman cock for five minutes would you
  equates germania and parthia  thinks other people are riding the history cock    in point of fact the romans kept trying to conquer parthia over and over again with germania they just said fuck this im out
    these deposits saw greater exploitation when they fell under roman control between the third century bc and the first century ad12 demand for tin created a large and thriving network amongst mediterranean cultures of classical times131    pic related
  kek underrated
  only constant roman political intrigue and usurping prevented germania from being essentially genocided marcus aurelius led long successful campaigns against marauding tribes that only ended with plague ravaging the legions his death and commodus succession besides that one example most campaigning seasons saw romans cross the rhine and the danube to kick the shit out of the germans
  yikes
  t died on campaign trying to take scotland
  lying to make germannia seem important    next time include the proceeding sentence   tin mining knowledge spread to other european tin mining districts from erzgebirge and evidence of tin mining begins to appear in brittany devon and cornwall and in the iberian peninsula around 2000 bc11 these deposits saw greater exploitation when they fell under roman control between the third century bc and the first century ad    look at the very map you posted the romans already controlled three major sources of tin in areas that were easier to traverse and export from
  dacia
  you dont conquer to just conquer you dont invest just to invest you do it because you expect a return on investment roi
  low iq post    germania is full of gems timber and lead
  africa was one of the richest provinces of roman empire anon
    after killing so many people and destroying so much stuff that forests grew back over once thriving settlements
  good farmland is much more important to have than any of those resources and to extract them you need craftsmen educated workers roads and industries all which had to be built from scratch    the costbenefit was too high for rome    if they really really wanted to they mightve pushed to the elbe and romanized germania major but the effort to do that would mean a lot of debt and weaken the frontiers elsewhere
  haha yeah we can spend decades subjugating these people so we can make a profit 1000 years from now once weve built roads cities and aqueducts drained the swamps and cut down endless forests to make way for mining and farmland
  rich in what
  firth of forth  you just cant make this shit up
  occasionally theyd march in and kill everything that moves  legion disappears without a trace
  the irony is that your the dumb fuck
  hell yeah treesinhospitable clime and a warlike people
  not him but egyptian food doesnt make you rich i suppose but its undeniably valuable
  and britannia was different because
germania  is it time to build another bridge
  dminishing returns
  wasnt as heavily forested the people living there had permanent settlements and the main exports tin was already set up to be exported all this and britain still only just broke even germany really had no chance of being worth the effort
  well theres decent farmland and coal but they didnt really care for the former and didnt really know about the latter
  it was beyond the ocean and an easier fight
  northern africa was extremely fertile land back then the part where carthage was and one of the the breadbaskets of the empire along with egypt
  dacia was literally the last place worth conquering you absolute mouthbreather read a book
  germania   tacitus wrote that germanics must be native to germania because no one would migrate willingly to that shithole
  he also wrote that the germans have an inherent desire to leave their swamps and desolations
  they did
  dacia was worth the conquest once the mineral deposits were discovered and predictably the romans conquered it they were also less interested in sticking around to defend it once the gold became more scarce and the barbarians more frequent
  i think permanently securing your northern border wouldve been a pretty good motivator
  thats what the rivers are for
  which is true they settled everywhere while the empire was collapsing
  carthage  taxes food  egypt  food wild animals slaves    rome the city literally cannot feed itself egypt africa sicily sardinia were the food fields of rome
  rome cant have an entire island of potentially hostile barbarians in a natural fortress    it also gives enemies an attractive option for escape
  holy shit teutoberg/carrhae anon you realize that rome lost legions and legions on every land they conquer     every single war was so costly in lives and they kept sending more and more    please fucking dont be stubborn thats how you remain a brainlet
fuck i hate the tetoberg carnae anon so much
  who
  me i hate them
  germania is full of coal though
  in point of fact the romans kept trying to conquer parthia over and over again  not really there was endless border wars posturing and several emperors sacked the capital of ctesiphon but they all understood that trying to conquer parthia would stretch the border too far a roman governor would literally have to travel for months to get to his new province and would then have only the rest of the year before it was time to return home if you extended the length of governorship you would risk the entrenchment of nobles and would set up a potential rival
  gems  hmmm  timber  romans had plenty of timber not worth fighting a massively expensive war for  lead  again is lead really worth another gallic war but probably even harder roman conquered dacia for gold but germania had no gold that anybody knew about so it wasnt worth the massive cost
  and britannia was different because  it wasnt britannia was a dumb as fuck conquest that took resources away from the empire with no significant return claudius shouldve ignored britain and focused on either parthia dacia or just improving the roman economy
  the idea of ancient britons launching an outward invasion is laughable
  romans never had an industrial revolution so they didnt value coal
  fucking this if the romans had reached the elbe and established that as a defensible border it would have taken a bite out of the dangerous german tribes whilst creating a nice straight line for romans to defend if they also ignored britain that wouldve left parthia as the last serious threat to roman power    im sure if romans launched an allout war against parthia anytime between the 1st and 3rd centuries ad they wouldve succeeded or at least taken mesopotamia and the valuable western cities
  having a calorie surplus was a massive advantage for most of human history
  it just that the germanians went straight tetoburg on any roman who tried to colonize that shit  that wasnt unique to the germans though carthage obviously did that several times under hannibal and rome still won the iberian tribes were notoriously stubborn and skilled in war but were eventually conquered the britons themselves under boudicca launched a colossal rebellion that still didnt convince rome to abandon the island yes i know nero almost did but in the end they didnt    the truth is that germania couldve been conquered and it couldve been culturally romanized it wouldve been a tough war but the romans were used to that and would no doubt win in the end
  gems
  died on campaign trying to take scotland  you make it sound like he died in battle or something    he was an old man who died of old age after an extremely successful campaign to annihilate the pictish threat
  germania  germanicus did conquer everything from the rhine to the elbe but later left the area once he saw that the elbe was a much longer river than the rhine and it was impossible to send supply from the mediterranean sea to the elbe later emperors annexed agri decumati  parthia  trajan annexed everything west of susa and reduced the rest of the persian empire into a client state hadrian left mesopotamia
the romans never figured out how to defeat the highlanders on their own turf
  frogs
  it wasnt worth it they could have genocided the picts but upper britaniania had nothing worth the effort in fact britainnia wasnt even worth it but once they conquered it they werent just gonna abandon it
  funny how all the things not worth it for the romans are places the legions got their asses handed to them
nothing worth bothering over up north
  funny how that doesnt actually address what he said at all the scottish highlands were a very resource poor region during the classical era and really werent worth the trouble of annexing
  in fact britainnia wasnt even worth it  not true in addition to helping control gaul britain had considerable gold deposits when the romans invaded which they mined to extinction
  jews
  farmland  not in the roman period there wasnt it took the invention of the heavy plow before farming took off in germania in roman times it was basically worthless  coal  romans did make some use of coal in britain but it never seems to have caught their imagination plenty of wood to make into charcoal i guess
  thats just a face saving excuse
    this is a huge meme pushing to the elbe just adds miles of coastline within excellent striking distance of scandinavia you essentially add 2000 kms of coastline to the empire and lose 150 kms of river border
  useless backstabbing cunt overrated military commander terrible father awful emperor
  thats why they built not one but two fucking walls  its easier to garrison an outpost and launch the ocasional punitive expedition than to be surpressing the revolting tribes of the highlands that was also true in germania      this fucking guy  those asshandling you are memeing about were always countered by the roman military    cannae  selfexplanatory and also the greates enemy of rome as they were not happy until carthage was razed to the ground whereas with the germanic peoples it was enough with punitive raids/campaigns    arausium  what happened to the cimbri and the teutones in aqua sextiae they were literally whiped out from the earth    carrhae  edessa  see how many times was ctesiphon capital of the parthian and sassanid empires  was sacked    teutoburg  see germanicus campaigns also tiberius adressing to germanicus after his succesful campaigns in germania where he defeated every hostile germanic tribe quoted by tacitus   since the vengeance of rome had been satisfied the germans might be left to their internal feuds
the romans bought pictish slaves to impregnate their wives because all roman men are infertile
  your mothers womb
  it wasnt it was just a dick pull by whoever did it so he could say hey dudes did you see that a new province for the empire wheres my prestige at now niggas
when did you realise that its easier to simply admit that one is partly a bad person rather than tie oneself into knots trying to justify bad behaviour or explain why its actually good    you see it with people arguing for why eating meat is good or why there is absolutely nothing wrong with abortion    i think this is part of what stormking interprets as kaczynskis idea of oversocialisation my spin on it is this in a society where we are all connected and all fall into each others orbit and can reach out to each other while living under roughly the same political entity the american empire in the same global archipelago of cities we are constantly coming up against people who arent family this means they cant be guaranteed to behave towards one the way one wants but violence is also illegal so people cant just beat people being disrespectful the cope is for everyone to engage in constant shaming as a control attempt and this both requires people to pretend to be pure to give them the high ground to shame and encourages people to pretend to be pure to avoid being shamed and the financial and institutional penalties that can go along with it  theres also nonauthoritarian parenting where physical punishment and orders are replaced with moral demands not that this is all bad but it relies on continually guilting children to make them manageable which probably puts too much guilt in them in general and sets up a game where they pretend to be pure because otherwise their parents might in their minds drop them you even actually see this with people disowning family for being racist lol    admit youre a bad person /his/ dont be proud of it dont even relieve yourself of guilt but dont go through the indignity of tying yourself into knots squaring moral circles     theres also from above the fact that overt displays of power are considered oppressive so people have to morally shame to flex
theres also the introduction of women into the public sphere in politics media academia and hr so its not exactly shocking that theyd use female weapons like shaming in lieu of direct threats and rewards
the thread died     broken mentally and morally are traffickers usually  not really many people are perfectly normal but do fucked shit  how can a person be considered normal and do fucked up shit how do sane people bring themselves to do things like that aside from the lol its justified from muh perspective so its okay meme  hahaha based taro xddddd  how would a normal normal as in everyday personnot normal as in jeckyl/hyde convince themselves that what they are doing is righteous participating in human trafficking is a lot different than throwing yourself at a tower for allah if there is no mental illness or personality disorder how this logic doesnt make sense why and how is it that normal people do those kinds of fucked up things more often and with more intensity than the insane  on a side note how not be nihilism in this world tip
  you are being kind of naive trying not to be edgy and fedora tippy but there are a lot of people who simply dont follow morality or lack certain concepts of it and there isnt much more to it than that    how long are you going to keep reposting this thread /his/ is full of autists who do this the remember the alamo guy the antinatilism guy its weird
the money is great somebody will do it anyway and its not like the chattels had a future anyway some people are just natural slaves weak people endure what they must strong people do what they please     theres worse fates than making people orgasm for the rest of your life
  how do sane people bring themselves to do things like that aside from the lol its justified from muh perspective so its okay meme    out of site and out of mind anon or they dont care like anon theres a ton of fucked shit we directly or indirectly support
  there are worse fates than making people orgasm for the rest of your life  if thats what you want to do with your life than sure even if you dont eh how do you know that the average purchaser will stop there though the more likely scenario is that theyll be emotionally and physically abused maybe even tortured or murdered along with rape most probably wont treat their chattel well at all  its not like the chattels had a future anyway  hmm i dont follow
  theyre chattels property objects
  mixed feelings at this statement
  there are millions of westerners who consider themselves normal while nonetheless supporting and engaging in absolutely satanic practices like killing unborn children
  they convince themselves they are helping poor asylum seekers to find a better life ie slavery

premise 1 choice is an illusion  premise 2 if premise 1 is true then you cant choose to do anything    conclusion you cant choose to accept premise 1
if you cant choose premise 1 than there is no free will  back to the drawing board
philosophical crap like this is kind of like masturbating your brain its ok to do so as long as you dont go overboard and it doesnt really mean anything in the rel world
  you cant choose premise 1 if there is no free will
  then you cant choose to do anything    i dont think you understand the problem the idea is you can choose but your choice was predetermined by god/fate so you never really had a choice
  nnot real filosofee
  kek
      yikes
  you can choose  you never really had a choice    choose 1
  you have the illusion of choice hes saying you feel like there is a choice but you are determined to always pick the same thing
  okay then descartes
  then i dont have a choice and cant logically deduce that i dont have free will
  you could argue that your choice of premise 1 is not a choice at all but was instead predetermined though i dont believe that
  btfo 
man has free will to make the choice between good and evil
  if you choose not to decide you still have made a choice
  regardless of how much a choice is conscious or unconscious we seem to be wired to have the illusion that our choices are conscious even to the point of thinking we made a choice before we could have made it
  not a determinist fedora but whether or not you can choose to accept premise 1 that doesnt change whether it is right or wrong
  huh
  the whole concept of free will is framed incorrectly our selfcreative freedom comes from our ability to generate potentiality not from our ability to merely select items from a list our ability to generate potentials comes from our ability to question our freedom of inquiry which isnt an absolute but a skill of variable effectiveness dependent on our ability to question ourselves and the world around us we change our desires by questioning them and following the resultant lines of inquiry to alternatives we learn from the effects of our previous choices by questioning our actions awareness itself is a query and selfawareness is a selfquery that results in a selfrepresentation a model of ones self an i this model extends into the future as potential future selves which is why selfawareness is necessary only by the creation of a selfmodel can it be questioned and changed
  this might seem like a choice the truth is the brain was rigged from the start
  our ability to generate potentiality  how do you generate your subconscious brain practically does it  which isnt an absolute  beginning to sound like a compatibilist this is all describing practical free will but not absolute free will   awareness itself is a query and selfawareness is a selfquery that results in a selfrepresentation a model of ones self an i   can you expand on this im interested what you mean by this
  you cant prove facts with logical arguments retard
  not if your choice not to decide was itself determined
  no choice is not an illusion before an event
this sentence is false
  dont need to choose to accept premise 1
  you may choose from phantom fears or kindness that can kill i will choose a path thats clear i will choose free will
  how do we decide something is right or wrong then a human has to choose
  you will choose to believe what you were programmed to believe
  how do we decide something is right or wrong then  if its pro or anti social
  conclusion you cant choose to accept premise 1  so i still accept it even if i cant choose it  and the premise should be true regardless of whether i accept it or not  you kinda suck at this
  what if there is another little man inside the little mans head
  youve been replying to rush lyrics brainlet zoomer
causality is an invention humans use to understand the outside world
  causality exists a priori    t german idealism and physics
  inability to choose a premise does not mean said premise is false
    both determinism and indeterminism negate free will though
i just proved feminine penis is a real thing     small hands mean something else must be small which means hands are connected to the penis there are males with feminine hands which leads to the truth that his penis will be feminine too therefore feminine penises exist
  this is in fact true if ops premise that you can prove true things about reality using nothing but logic is valid
  no because the the femenine penis argument isnt logically sound just like ops argument  therefore even assuming logic can prove existence both argument cant prove anything
  it doesnt matter if an argument is logically sound you cannot prove a fact using logic this is why empiricism is a thing
  therefore even assuming logic can prove existence both arguments cant prove anything
  you proved semantics argument not the argument
   even assuming logic can prove existence  why would you assume that spoiler it cant logic cant prove anything about the real world including whether or not it even exists
  because it was what you were assuming in your original post    and im pretty well aware it was a reductio ad absurdum are you that dumb to fail to see that im actually agreeing with you or isnt english your native language
  hurr  go fuck yourself retard
  brilliant reply but im afraid im not agreeing with you in this one  btw if you like hume that much i kindly invite you to read kant
  reading grman philosophers  hahahahahaha    no
  nationality determines validity of philosophical theories  please tell me your nationality to know what philosophers avoid to read  that is if we assume you are right oops sorry i used a concept you dont understand 
  grmans arent even human why would i waste my time reading their ramblings
  i can always say to whatever you say that that was predetermined and you couldnt deny the possibility   anyways what even is this ghost in the machine we talk of  the very concept of time itself would remove any possibly of free will due to cause and effect your mind would have to be like the beginning of all time a small beginning of the universe at the rise of each new idea to generate its own direction

   a book questioning the existence of jesus  such a book never existed
  richard carrier
  hmm i dont know man which book do you mean
  most likely this it should be noted that while he has a history doctorate and is a step above the usual believer in the christ myth theory his ideas are not taken seriously by mainstream academia
whats the deal with atlantis were they an advanced civilization that gave tech to the world did they all die in a great flood are they the reason the pyramids are built like they are are they the people that have been described as gods or angels    also lost ancient civilizations thread
it was just a fucking allegory  
  or maybe /lit/ or /tg/ if youre really into fantasy stuff you seem like you are
 /x/ is that way
hyperborea coming thru
its not /x/ faggots plato pin pointed the date atlantis was destroyed and scientists have found that comets struck the earth around that time    now give me an answer if id said they were jews id have 100 replies already
    atlantis could have been a city of a northern african empire that existed preyounger dryas we have no evidence to suggest they were massively technologically superior other than what plato says and in turn what solon said who himself heard it from priests in egypt it could be they were superior in equivalence to that of the romans and northern tribes but that is just speculation     the location of atlantis is also not known the youngerdryas impact crater in greenland was catastrophic it is likely multiple civilisations were annihilated as a result     we know human history in terms of civilisation is likely much older than originally thought gobekli tepe is older than 11 500 years old speculation of it being a monument built by hunter gatherers is still speculation     we know of at least 3 possible locations of atlantis one being in west coast of northern africa another off the coast of spain and another south of iceland and west of scoland and ireland called frisland     we know at one point doggerland existed and started to disappear 12000 years ago and eventually the last island was submerged by 6500 bc they and know a massive tsunami was responsible for doggerlands initial submergence which from the recent discovery of the youngerdryas impact crater makes it likely it was the catalyst for such a catastrophe
it was santorini literally a circular volcanic island that was a luxury resort for the minoans which exploded full of archaeological remains including water pipes for channeling hot springs and gold items    all other theories are /x/tier aliums bullshit or spanish wewuzzing case closed
  so now its multiple civilizations this is ancient alienstier nonsense
  whats the deal with atlantis  an african city     were they an advanced civilization that gave tech to the world   it was the golden age of the african race     did they all die in a great flood  they spread out and became the modern afroasiatic speakers     are they the reason the pyramids are built like they are   indeed    are they the people that have been described as gods or angels  they are the vanirs the gandharvas the henmemet and the seraphim
  global catastrophe causing global coast lines to be submerged humans thrive living on/near the coast
  they went to the pegasus galaxy
everyone talks about plato as a philosopher but never acknowledges his status as history greatest fanfic writer
  its literally wakanda
  which comets
      i think these
atlanteangardensblogspotcom/    here is the truth about everything read it my brother
  you can also check those wonderful books my brother  
  will do    thread theme    
look at the antikythera mechanism and its complexity    there is nothing showing a simple machine that uses gears up to gradual complexity leadingh up to it    with watches we have the evolution from a simple singlehand watch up to complex doublegyrotourbillions of today we have none of that with the antikythera mechanism its just there    many attritube archimedes to it but there is zero proof that archimedes ever came close to being able to make something so complex nevertheless the leadin technology that shows the progress from the simplest of geared machines up to the mechanism    the only logical explanation for it is there was some atlantistype civilization out there that had both the education and skills to produce it thats now lost either that or its historys most radical outlier
  platos description is very clear that atlantis was in the atlantic outside the straits of gibraltar and outside the mediterranean
      it must be the software that shills use that causes the immediate responses to anything that would trigger them to be from shills   this poss was up for literally less than a minute before they started posting then two shillposts happened within one second of eachother
  plato was a faggot
  of course all the seriousness of the conversation drops out when you are proven wrong plato  s description of atlantis is where the azores are today
  it really is incredible
  the antikythera mechanism was made by hellenistic greeks we know this because it has inscriptions on it written in koine greek now cease this faggotry
  outside the straits of gibraltar     this is the key part of the description    and there are ruins on santorini that survived called akrotiri and thera and neither of them appear to be some mythical advanced civilization even if theyre coollooking so the only lgical conclusion is that santorini is not atlantis but all truth of what might have lied within it at the core island is now buried under a mile of magma ash and sediment
  cia is trying their best to hide the great nordic ancient civilisations of atlantis keep on fighting brother
  plato was objectively a faggot so this is a completely serious rational argument    there is no other place on earth that so closely correlates with the description and it happens to be right next to greece yet you want to toss all this in the trash because plato randomly added something about the gates of hercules in his description while paraphrasing solon
  there are also descriptions of cyclops and pegasus    show me the leadin development that proves its origins     facts are not somethig that comes from speculation facts are hard cold and undisputable it remains ancient historys greatest outlier until those facts are known
  im not calling them nordic and i dont necessarily think its that organization
  the part where he described where atlantis was put it in the atlantic this is very straightforward
  i wasnt being sarcastic
  neither am i man i dont think they were scandinavian and i dont think its the agency youre talking about
  oh and he put the sinking date at 9500 bc neither the time or place checks out youre just parroting the words of people telling you what to think about it rather than actually reading the primary source material
  yes i know he said it was in the atlantic that is what i was talking about in my post why are you repeating that point again do you even understand my argument
  yes i know he placed it in 9500 bc like the point about him placing atlantis outside the gates of hercules he could have been wrong about this detail however because his other points so closely fit santorini an island right off the coast of greece which there is nothing like anywhere else in the world this is ample proof santorini is the source of this myth he was paraphrasing solon and the information about atlantis was likely passed down by word of mouth after the bronze age collapse so it is likely new details were added or confused    im not sure i can explain my point any more clearly i dont like going ur stoopid over the internet but if you unironically have difficulty understanding it then maybe you have learning difficulties or impaired rationality or you could be trolling of course
  the north atlaitic does have a mysterious disappearing island in myth called avalon and another called hybrasil     and whe you go directly west into the atlantic from the straight of gibraltar you run into the azores which admittedly arent ringshaped but theyre the only islands in that path
  nothing about santorini fits the legend of atlantis you faggot there are no elephants there there are no channels there there was no seat of a grand empire there the greeks had well preserved legends of the minoan thalassocracy so if thats what he plato was drawing from he would have just talked about crete theres no evidence of any sort of conflict between athens and either crete or santorini the only thing atlantis and santorini have in common is that they both got destroyed except wait santorini is still fucking there plato just made that fucking thing up wholesale
  he went into about a paragraph of detail about the location explaining in multiple different ways that atlantis was not in the mediterranean that it was in the sea outside the straits of gibraltar and that the sea in question made the mediterranean look like a pond   he also went into detail that the empire of the island reached into the mediterraean with its farther extent reaching to tyrrhenia tuscany and egypt that it had colonies on a continent on the other side of the sea it resided in a massive continent that wrapped around the whole ocean    every single time he brings up geography he is describing an island outside of the mediterranean outside the straits of gibraltar making a point to say that it colonized inside the mediterranean as far east as it could reach inside the straits and lost control of that territory still existing on its island in the atlantic   i dont know why im bothering when you clearly never read the story it couldnt be more clear
  some parts of santorini ruins did survive and theres no trace of there being any advanced civilization above normal greek ones there    so thats hole 2 in that theory besides the wrong location as hole 1
  i think its implied that the circles were made of channels dug by the people not naturally occuring rings
yeah atlantis was definitely in the caribbean and they were amerinds
  interesting and the azores are prone to earthquakes as well as the whole caribbean including bimini     how complicated were precolumbus sculptures and architecture at the time of plato i know what they look like afterwards during the age of the aztecs but if theyre like that at any time before then then central america could be a contender and we still dont know the full story of puma punku     just throwing around speculation
  in the story he states that in that large ocean where atlantis was located there was a continent on the other side that wrapped around it that atlantis had colonies both on islands to the west of its location and on that giant continent that wrapped around the other side of the atlantic it sounds like they had settlements in the carib and the americas
  there was a continent on the other side that wrapped around it     that sounds like a solid description of the gulf of mexico
  hes pretty clear that it was right outside the straits of gibraltar and that greek ships would sail near the area that it used to be before it sunk beneath the waves and blew up honestly ill just get straight to it its under the azores the azores were peaks of the island  there is clearly elevated land amongst those islands the mid atlantic ridge is active and its surprising that there arent more big islands along it    everything points to the azores with it having colonies in the carib and in the americas
by far the most plausible inspiration for atlantis was athens itself plato writes at the time when the great athenian golden age and its mastery of the aegean was still within living memory as was its disastrous invasion of sicily so what plato does is simply reverse the premise of history rather than us forging an empire of the seas and then invading west what if there was some antiathens patroned by the traditional rival of athena in the west that invaded east what if we were the plucky freedom fighters that overcome the enemy by the pulling on our bootstraps rather than the titanic empire that was punished by the gods for its hubris in that way plato both tells athenians what they should be and chides them for what they have been in the past
  i love it
  personally im inclined to think that the azores were just a waystation and the core of that lost civilization really was somewhere in the caribbean but plato thought the azores was the whole thing because an element of the tale was lost through time or translation      continent on the other side that wrapped around it    yeah it was supposed to be like the size of asia and libya combined which actually fits the americas pretty well
  well asia and libya back then meant the western half of the coastline of north africa and turkey   he gives the measurements of the island in the story and its more like somewhere between the size of ireland and great britain  hes quite clear that the capital the city that the empire is based off of is right outside the straits of gibraltar and has colonies on the massive continent to the west
  yeah thats why i have them in quotes
  i really think a lot of you guys actually need to read his story because several of you clearly havent he goes into a pretty crazy amount of detail including measurements and geographic location more than anything else it doesnt read like a moral story its mostly like someone describing the dimensions of an island and a city on that island where it was and what it conquered
  many great deluges have taken place during the nine thousand years for that is the number of years which have elapsed since the time of which i am speaking and in all the ages and changes of things there has never been any sediment of the earth flowing down from the mountains as in other places which is worth speaking of  sounds like enough time to bury anything that could have existed in the seismicallyactive azores    it has always been carried round in a circle and disappeared in the depths below  you cant look for a circle because plato said the circle disappeared below the water throw in 9 thousand years of shifting sands and plates in the water and itll be hard as hell to find now so that moots his described measurements because a lot can change geoligically in that many eons especially in a seismicallyactive area    i will tell you the reason of this solon who was intending to use the tale for his poem made an investigation into the meaning of the names and found that the early egyptians in writing them down had translated them into their own language and he recovered the meaning of the several names and retranslated them and copied them out again in our language my greatgrandfather dropidas had the original writing which is still in my possession and was carefully studied by me when i was a child therefore if you hear names such as are used in this country you must not be surprised for i have told you the reason of them  a translation of a translation of another translation as in a document his greatgrandmother possessed i didnt know this detail    in this mountain there dwelt one of the earthborn primeval men of that country whose name was evenor and he had a wife named leucippe and they had an only daughter who was named cleito   is it just me or do these sound like celtic or germanic names
all these and their descendants were the inhabitants and rulers of divers islands in the open sea  the only open sea there is the atlantic    they dug out of the earth whatever was to be found there mineral as well as metal and that which is now only a name and was then something more than a name  orichalcum  was dug out of the earth in many parts of the island and with the exception of gold was esteemed the most precious of metals among the men of those days      there was an abundance of wood for carpenters work  azores are covered in trees however due to poor soil santorini is not    whatever fragrant things there are in the earth whether roots or herbage or woods or distilling drops of flowers or fruits grew and thrived in that land and again the cultivated fruit of the earth both the dry edible fruit and other species of food  still describing azores
  but at a later time there occurred portentous earthquakes and floods and one grievous day and night befell them when the whole body of your warriors was swallowed up by the earth and the island of atlantis in like manner was swallowed up by the sea and vanished wherefore also the ocean at that spot has now become impassable and unsearchable being blocked up by the shoal mud which the island created as it settled down    swallowed up by the earth
  its been 9000 years a lot geologically can happen and its the only island basin in the path west from the gibraltar straits
  i think you need to read more plato because he always goes into such details in stories which are clearly made up plato was not a historian or a geographer the dimensions and layout of an island hold absolutely no interest for him except as a vehicle to engage the reader with the story
  i dont think so he was too specific on way too many details
looking at how pangea fell apart wouldnt it make more sense to look towards the north of the americas south america was always quite a distance it seems
how old is the oldest surviving plato record     at his time his knowledge was already copies of copies all retranslated     and when information gets copied and translated it does get changed
      continental drift this artcle argues that the speed variates so i was unable to find an exact rate but at the least we can assume that 9000 years as of platos time  2500 years since platos time they were closer together if only a little bit 11500 years ago
  how specific he is means nothing because hes quite obviously not describing any actual place on earth that the greeks could have definitive knowledge of hes lying about something its either great big parts of it or all of it
  looks like the earth would have pretty much looked like it does now that leaves the comet theory which would have caused a great flood thus filling up much of the ocean and swallowing atlantis
  he got the information from egyptian record keepers
  sea levels were 400 feet lower at the least and areas toward the equator bulged out due to isostatic depression at the poles under the weight of ice caps a ton of land underwater now was above water before 11500 years ago
      you guys seem to be forgetting about the fuckhuge and monumentally heavy glaciers that bicapped the our planet for thousands of years before this was supposed to have gone down    they were geologically significant isostatic depression and the resulting asthenosphere bulge would have played a key role
  yeah the ellipsoidal shape of the world would have been even more accentuated
  yeah and i have a girlfriend in canada theres no such record discovered anywhere in egypt nor could there be considering atlantis supposedly got destroyed six thousand years before egyptians invented writing the egyptians like diotima the witch from mantinea who reveals to socrates the secret of love are there just as piece of literary fluff
  has anyone ever calculated how big the bulge was in different regions ive tried to find it but got nothing
  again nearly all the information is dimensions and geography its not a fluffy or romantic story its a description of an island a city on it and its territorial holdings
  he had something from his greatgrandmother handed down to him as a translation from the egyptians who translated it from some other previous unknown source that was his source for something that came 9000 years before him     if the original source was written on any form of papyrus/paper then its long gone and he wrote it down to archive something because his people had no knowledge of it that is how you pass knowledge on    and its because of him passing on knowledge he had been given for how we know of it today    i didnt think that was hard to understand          true and the bottom line is 11500 years is more than plenty of time to erase a civilization
theres a virtually 100 chance that atlantis was just thera/thira/santorini  think about it  a long time ago there existed a powerful ancient civilization in a golden age of culture and power minoan/mycenaean culture  catastrophic event results in the downfall of this culture dark ages that last for hundreds of years with the collapse of economics literacy and historical continuity  over a thousand years this gets orally transmitted along the grapevine and takes on mythical proportions then plato bases his didactic fanfiction on this myth  atlantis is just lord of the rings for greeks
  what are the chances of such records surviving especially in light of known destructions like the library of alexandria and how the egyptians themselves only built tombs to be permanent while everything else they built wasnt made to be so permanent    and plato didnt say he had an egyptian source he said he had a translation from an egyptian source his great grandmother had he most likely never saw the egyptian source and only knows what he was told aobut it your reading comprehension really does suck     and notice that inth e story hes not telling the stories of heroes and damsels or other shit hes only describing in the basest of terms what was there more like an archivist than a storyteller theres a reason for that
the only logical explanation for it is there was some atlantistype civilization out there
  thats because the text is incomplete you idiot critias is the second of three texts the first timaeus begins with the discussion of an ideal state the characters mention that athens used to be an ideal state and by being so they managed to defeat the great empire of atlantis they say they will tell that story but must begin from the beginning of the universe critias then continues on with the description of ancient athens and then creation of atlantis itself and its geography and once they begin describing how they were punished by the gods the text cuts off how the story of athens and atlantis played out we dont know but we do know that indeed was the story because timaeus spells it out for us on page one
  every single description he gives of time place and measurement contradicts that claim its contrary to the whole story   with your hypothesis in mind while reading through it your hypothesis is rendered null dozens of times
  the archaeology there suggests otherwise as well as platos description of atlantis being out in the sea beyond the straits of gibraltar
  he ends with atlantis sinking beneath the waves are you lying on purpose why are you doing this whats the point
  stories get altered with translations thats how the forbidden fruit became an apple which it was never claimed to be in the bible     and thats the biggest hurdle to this how do we rectify a story that had already been retold and retranslated countless times in the 9000 years leading up to plato with god knows how many slight changes and misinterpretations of translations done along the way    even the measurements could be wrong for example look at napoleon everyone claims he was short because his height was 5footthree however in the old french imperial scale a foot had thirteen inches so his height by our scale was actually fivefooteight which is the height of a normal male     theres a lot that 9000 years of translations and retellings can change
  the sinking of atlantis is described in the opening of timaeus retard this is how critias ends    zeus the god of gods who rules according to law and is able to see into such things perceiving that an honourable race was in a woeful plight and wanting to inflict punishment on them that they might be chastened and improve collected all the gods into their most holy habitation which being placed in the centre of the world beholds all created things and when he had called them together he spake as follows     none of you fuckers have ever read plato
  lol and what youre doing is analogous to claiming napoleon didnt exist because the units of measurement were off
  atlantis  minoan civilization  /thread
  everything about his description contradicts thati remember i saw that explanation on natgeo when i was a teenager and believed it without question then i read the story and realized that makes zero sense
  except they already had legends about the minoans thered be no reason to invent an entirely new backstory for them
  let me begin by observing first of all that nine thousand was the sum of years which had elapsed since the war which was said to have taken place between all those who dwelt outside the pillars of heracles and those who dwelt within them this war i am now to describe    of the combatants on the one side the city of athens was reported to have been the ruler and to have directed the contest the combatants on the other side were led by the kings of the islands of atlantis which as i was saying once had an extent greater than that of libya and asia turkey and when afterward sunk by an earthquake became an impassable barrier of mud to voyagers sailing from hence to the ocean    thats pretty fucking clear that its atlantis versus athens as two distinct separate places in two distinct separate locations word
  its probably impossible you could estimate it based on the weight of the ice if we knew that but since the nonwater part of the planet is irregularly shaped it wouldnt be very accurate
    and plato didnt know jack shit about geography he was a politician making tracts about myths christopher columbus died thinking he had discovered the east indies hong xiuquan thought he was the brother of jesus the renaissance thought that rome was the most advanced civilization ever western schools taught that medieval europe thought the earth was flat until the 21st century and barack obama thought those jobs werent coming back could it be that maybe these smug arrogant people were fucking wrong
  yeah when was this in fucking question
  he rerecorded knowledge to keep it from being lost  you know how like for a thousand years medieval monks did the exact same thing to where much of roman and greek history survives because of them
  he made shit up its positively spectacular that two and half thousand years on people are still falling for it
  he didnt make it up he even cited a source from his greatgrandmother
  no he doesnt critias the character in the story recounts how he got the story from his greatgrandfather who got it from solon who got it from the egyptians the fact that theres no way solon and critias greatgrandfather lived at the same time or that there is no evidence whatsoever that solon ever visited egypt is conveniently left out
  wait actually i was wrong solon did apparently visit egypt the rest of the point still stands
  the greek people knew about the med which is how the geography is related
we must question all biblical narratives because they are ethnic propaganda and mythopoeia so we should discount the captivity of egypt or the kingdom of judah or the influence or even existence of solomon and the ark of the covenant  but we must take platos argumentative hypothetical account of atlantis exactly at his word as 100 indisputable reliable primary documentation
  that doesnt refute anything though youre arguing against 2500 years since plato that has reduced almost every surviving document from that era to only small pieces you just cant prove it and take a blind leap that your belief of it never existing is correct     and it goes against him knowing that there was indeed land beyond the gibraltar straits way back when no one else did and dont say china/india/other crap because the average greek probably had no clue of such places when you look at the size and reach of the greek empire in its peak
  you havent been following along some like me realize that in translations and retellings of stories those stories do change     i believe plato recorded what he was told to pass it on to the future like many chroniclers before and since but within that 9000 years between him and the original source of the story stories got changed countless times    look at the myth of troy its no myth its not as big as hollywood would romanticize but its very much real     and for bonus points lets factor the age of 9000 years  approx 2500 years for a grand total of approx 11500 years does that fit the general range when others say the original form of the sphinx was carved rajasthan in india is 9000  12000 years old and that city is believed to have been nuked in antiquity plus gogepli tepi 11000 years old and puma punku up to 12000 years old     so the reality is its more than likely that there was real civilization back then across the world so theres no logical reason to rule out the existence of a palce like atlantis in light of other myths like troy having been found
  plato was lowkey retconning minoan lore
  puma punku up to 12000 years old  
  minoan lore is nothing like atlantean lore
  i was just joking man do you even know what retconning means
    i liked manly p halls accounts of its in the secret teachings of all ages one wonders what the source materials for his references to it were however    are there any accounts for how the city was constructed and is there any esoteric significance in this
the continent of atlantis was an island  which lay before the great flood  in the area we now call the atlantic ocean  so great an area of land that from her western shores  those beautiful sailors journeyed  to the south and the north americas with ease  in their ships with painted sails    to the east africa was a neighbor across a short strait of sea miles  the great egyptian age is but a remnant of the atlantian culture  the antediluvian kings colonized the world  all the gods who play in the mythological dramas  in all legends from all lands were from fair atlantis  knowing her fate atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the earth  on board were the twelve  the poet the physician the farmer the scientist  the magician and the other socalled gods of our legends  though gods they were  and as the elders of our time choose to remain blind  let us rejoice and let us sing and dance and ring in the new    hail atlantis
  well lets see    1 they were a ocean and sea coastal society    2 so everything they had was on the coast or on rivers    3 they likely saw little value in maintaining large holdings inland    4 they probably date around the younger dryas period near on of the ice ages    so yeah a series of bad tsunamis and a comet strike did them in whoopety do
  the disappearing island disappeared because the ice age ended and the glaciers melted raising sea levels over those islands
we found it btw    
  and we still dont know the full story of puma punku  oh anon
  they also never traded with anyone never mixed with anyone and never left anything outside their city their colonies technology and everything about them completely disappeared the only thing that was left is a legend written 9000 years later claiming that athenian greeks who didnt exist then hell indoeuropeans didnt exist then defeated them by using shitty stone tools while living somewhere near the kazakhstan yup makes sense 10/10 theory
and so this amazing civilization left us nothing and later humans had to rediscover everything themselves they were huge cunts too because they had contacts with egyptians but forgot to teach them how to make wheels or how to smelt metals
  see      inland there was a moutain with a kingdom on it they made use of the abuntant trees which rules out santorini for woodcrafting they enjoyed the scents of the plentiful fruit and other things that made the island apparently aromatic and all of that was inland
  sea levels rise and puts atlantis inland    doesnt make any sense
  i literally want to water board graham hancock for creating a generstion of brainlets that spout this pseudohistory ancient origins crap go jerk off to gobekli tepe or yonaguni you pseud
  that happens when a civilization gets wiped out    also homer said it was 9000 years before his time that places it thousands of years before pharonic egypt we dont know a lot about what egypt was like before the pharoahs
  the mechanism was very unaccurate because the gears were hand cut with not enough precision
  we do though see the gebelein predynastic mummies
  its literally ancient aliens quote they say the same thing because some guy a hundred years ago calculated that it would align with some stars 12000 bc so thats when it had to be built literal retard babble
  was waiting for that donovan reference
  we know enough     we have many more graves and artifacts than these we know who was living in egypt since the upper paleolithic to bronze age
  does that fit the general range when others say the original form of the sphinx was carved    the sphinx is from around 2500 bc the water erosion theory has been debunked almost 30 years ago already yet somehow graham handcuck managed to give erich von dänikens bullshit another go
  we have corpses and some artifacts not enough to tell all what they encountered before the age of the pharoahs
  we have plenty of evidence on predynastic egypt you just dont want to study it because you prefer the mystery of the pseud theories better check out the nagada cultures if you actually are interested and not just trying to argue for your atlantis shit
  not necessarily look at the bible copied thousand times and still the same
  
  i dont argue the existend of predynastic egypt at all you dont get it i argue that we dont have a complete record of all that occurred and all they came into contact with if we did then thered be a conclusive answer to the origins of the sphinx       its actually not stories like adam and lilith were omitted and wording changed many times during translation
  not old enough to be 9000 years before the time of plato
  there is you just want to cling to some pseudohistory explanation by graham handcuck about how it was made 12000 years ago to line up with the constellation of leo i remind you again the water erosion theory is debunked
  why would it be platos account was that of a legend a myth not reality
  adam and lilith is kabbalistic mythos not in the bible
  verifiable geological evidence that it happened  hurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr pseudohistory  kys brainlet
  fuck outta here with this atlantis was in africa youtube tier shit  t watched this video once     fuck outta here pseudo intellectual nigger
is anyone in this thread seriously hoping for an answer    plato made it up atlantis doesnt exist maybe it was inspired by ancient crete and the mycenaeans but he was using it for his thought experiments
  didnt exist retard
  second word in first sentence reads could and the next paragraph literally says     the location of atlantis is also not known the youngerdryas impact crater in greenland was catastrophic
  ayo now hol up so you be sayin we wuz atlantean n sheeit
why doesnt anyone ever mention that athens was more advanced than atlantis plato himself states it if were going to be obsessed over some ancient advanced civilization lets not fall victims to just small strands of isolated texts
  wew
atlantis was real but they were sunk underwater as punishment for siding with the titans in the titanomachy
the climate was so different back then
  a bronze age level seafaring metal using atlantic based civilization engaging in the same kind of colonizing the greeks themselves did fits the description and could potentially have been a reality 9000 years before solon
  eye of africa
  this i would love for atlantis to be a real place and if presented with evidence would be thrilled i always come in these threads just for the fantasy but im not going to delude myself
  it could be that the sea used to span through the sahara to the meditteranean and that it got flooded after which the tectonic plates started rising    if thats the case then the eye could have been atlantis the area would have been large enough to be called a continent back then
  it couldnt
  why not continents rise all the time
  how many continents did you see rise
  and still the same
  i heard atlantis was the old name for italy before italy was known as such it was called hadrian peninsula hadrian was supposedly a king named after the old greek name for the island hydraea as opposed to aegaea balkans spain was known as iveria or supossedly iaveae and anatolia was supposedly caelecaea
  peninsula legend has it whites are technically asian so spain was called look out italy the land surrounded by water anatolia the sky or the falling of its depth balkans the burnt land hardland it means white as you know were people of the western asian steppes
    cool fanfic bro
  antarctica is rising as we speak
  they sunk because of ma fía more loans they realized they had a bad rep because of pirating nobody wanted to deal with them so they had to sell it reinvent itself for attraction
  caelecaeaasia minor
search doñana
its in africa  
  plato literally just invented a story to prove a point senpai
  wasnt real
  what about herodotus did he make it up too
is atlantis
  herodotus never mentioned atlantis you nigger
why are these threads even allowed  unironically asking this shit belongs on /x/
  looks like he based his atlantic ocean on the atlas mountain inhabited by the atlantes    not convinced of either explanation still it was 450bs not 9600 bc
  people discussing the possibility of atlantis existing and the their possible influence on history    this is /x/ tier waaaaahhhh this shouldnt be allowed    thanks for the bump though
      plato lived a thousand years after the fall of the minoans on santorini you are closer in time to djingis khan than he was to the minoans    by comparison herodotus was only a few decades away from the invasion of greece by the persians yet still managed to fuck up all of the numerical details
  this is the only worthwhile post in this entire thread and the only response it gets takes the timaeus at face value committing a stargatetier historical fallacy
  herodotus didnt invent the name atlantic and the fact that it was named after atlas is indisputable
  good post i want to argue this but i cant
  not in the sea beyond the gibraltar straits  not rich with vegetation as described by plato  not big enough for ten cities with ten kings
  this anyone that thinks its santorini is an absolute brainlet
  you are closer in time to djingis khan than he was to the minoans  holy shit that perspective
    platos description of atlantis was 100 perfect truth  an island off the coast of greece with actual archaeological and geological remains that fits most of the description of atlantis was probably the root of the myth of atlantis  pick 1
  yikes and cringepilled
  see 
  there are also descriptions of cyclops and pegasus    are you simple the device has greek lettering on it this is a fact cyclops and pegasuses are not facts
  you forgot not as big as north africa and turkey united together not rich in metals
why hasnt this ancient aliens tear thread been deleted you got some dumb mother fucker in this thread that believes atlantis made this shit because he cant find the geared mechanisms before it and yet hes totally willing to believe atlantis exists with zero physical proof except that plato wrote some fanfiction once     this kind of brain dead retardation has made me realize that thousands of years from now if someone finds a hard drive with logs of 4chan threads theyre going to think flavortown was an actual place
  object with greek lettering on a greek shipwreck isnt greek because i cant find the prototypes    oof
    0 of santorini fits the legend of atlantis  akrotiri was a luxury resort for the rich on a circular island with a caldera in the middle it had pipes from bringing hot and cold water and gold artifacts frescos and other evidence of luxuries of the elite have been found then theres the vulcanic eruption of course there is nothing else like it in the world what are the chances something mostly matching the description happened to exist and right next to greece    mycenaean visitors might have been mistaken for believing it was the seat of power if they met minoan leaders there the minoans were perfectly capable of digging channels for whatever reason it is hypothesized they dug a channel through the outer island to get to encompassed sea   since they were a trade empire with many large vessels and friendly ports it is feasible for them to bring over the small north african elephants or baby elephants also possible is that the minoans had trade networks leading out of the pillars of hercules and this fact might have got mixed up in the myth somehow    i dont see why you are frothing at the mouth in rage and believe i am the drooling brainlet here while there people claiming it was at the north pole doggerland an africa kangdom or ancient aryans i think you know deep down atlantis is based on santorini and after the bronze age collapse the myth became embellished yet the essential facts remained of a circular island with hot and cold running water that was destroyed by an eruption that also ended a great empire you are obsessed with me and hurling grade school tier insults for this reason /x/ mad because /his/ is intelligent and rational and wont accept their fruit loops scifi theories
  i like arguing
atlantis was an advanced society of nordic people that collapsed once they opened the borders to blacks which was orchestrated by the jews
  this has a lot of assumptions about plato in it you assume he based it off santorini for whatever reason but almost none of the descriptions fit where are the rings wheres the huge ass navy stationed wheres the big temple on a hill
    nowhere is it described as being beyond the straits of gibraltar its described as being beyond the pillars of hercules the distinction is important as the literary implication means beyond the known world rather than beyond this very specific geographic landmark
  cant argue with that
  its described as being beyond the pillars of hercules  the pillar of hercules even shifted just read the history of the kings of britain and its even mentioned in there but its not the straits
    they walk among us wooooooooo
    plato said fags like you should get ostracized from society
  this has a lot of assumptions about plato in it you assume he based it off santorini for whatever reason  it is not based on assumptions but archaeological evidence of a minoan luxury resort on a circular island with a caldera in the middle with pipes to bring hot and cold water and gold artifacts frescos and other evidence of luxuries of the elite mostly matching the description and right next to greece  almost none of the descriptions fit  i just gave you ample descriptions that fit there is nothing like akrotiri in the world and many of the finds match platos descriptions  where are the rings  the island is a ring  wheres the huge ass navy stationed   it is unlikely any remains off the ships would have survived both the volcano and millenia regardless many of the structures remain  wheres the big temple on a hill  akrotiri had several shrines    at this point youre nitpicking it is funny how youre blasting flak at this theory but there is not an ounce of skepticism towards ancient aryans or whatever your own theory is
  my own theory is that its located in the richat structure and that the sea used to reach more inland that makes africa a neighbour to the east across a short straight of sea miles making it plausible that the egyptian age is a remnant of the atlantian
  this practice is generally held to have corrupted the ancient and natural rule in the matter of sexual indulgence common to mankind with animals at large and the blame for these corruptions may be charged in the first instance on your two cities and such others as are most devoted to physical exercises whether these matters are to be regarded as sport or as earnest we must not forget that this pleasure is held to have been granted by nature to male and female when conjoined for the work of procreation the crime of male with male or female with female is an outrage on nature and a capital surrender to lust of pleasure and you know it is our universal accusation against the cretans that they were the inventors of the tale of ganymede they were convinced we say that their legislation came from zeus so they went on to tell this story against him that they might if you please plead his example for their indulgence in this pleasure too with the tale we have no further concern but the pleasures and pains of communities and of private lives are as good as the whole subject of a study of jurisprudence laws i 636ad
  at this point youre nitpicking  details are important anon im more convinced by the guy youre arguing with right now youre just stretching things it seems like im not sure how youre convinced
  i suddenly feel the urge to get a pump going but alas my gym is closed
  do some close grip and wide grip push ups for dat dere pump my man and curl some heavy ass books 60 times per arm for a bicep pump
  based retard
  curl some heavy ass books  no books are heavy for these arms
  wait a fucking second you mean cwcville is not real
  first of all it wasnt a luxury resort it was a trading port second the greeks were well aware of and had preserved tradition of cretan naval supremacy the idea that they would somehow be bamboozled by a minoan settlement on santorini into thinking it was the capital of a separate great empire is ridiculous it would be like me talking about how napoleons defeat lead to the irish imperial century    third i wasnt frothing at you i was frothing at the guy i originally replied to but you santorini faggots are little better than ancient aliens faggots you all extrapolate your conclusions from minuscule factoids while disregarding all contradictions the only difference is that muh volcano was an actual attested thing as opposed to comets and fantasy continents
  this    also plato is regarded as an authority on many things but regarding atlantis hes suddenly a liar and a fiction writer all hid other works containing fiction were pretty obvious in doing so apart from muh gods this reads more like a report theres no explicit moral there either
  apart from muh gods this reads more like a report theres no explicit moral there either  because     its plainly fucking obvious that the text was supposed to be about what makes a good state    also platos tendency to make shit up for the sake of discussion is well attested literally nobody considers plato an authority on historical facts
  so he made up other easily verifyable facts too at the time of writing people could just check the hyroglyphs in egypt
people who claim santorini is atlantis are as bad as the doggerland crowd which is pretty bad those who scream its a fairytale have 0 imagination and shouldnt speculate about prehistoric times at all everyone with an iq higher than room temperature agrees that the pyramids the sphynx puma punku etc are proof that civilization is older than originally thought and that more advanced civs were destroyed somewhere along the way
  plato is regarded as an authority on many things  isnt almost everything he wrote wrong
  you dont even have to go back all the way to the yd to find one old europe had writing and huge cities in the balkans at least and they just fucking died because of climate change and the migration of ie
  lol no
  he wrote stories about magic rings and people returning from the dead people at no point attempted to fact check him because he at no point made any claim to historical veracity they were all stories    also the idea that people could just check the hieroglyphs is ridiculous do you have any idea how much of a hassle that would be
  just ask one of the sailors or traders that frequent egypt regurarly
  story    atlantis is a massive island bigger than north africa and turkey out together its full of precious metals in the atlantic and was sunk by poseidon oh before sinking they conquered the near east and fought with athens    rational educated person hmmm ok this is clearly a myth there never existed such a place it was typical of plato to use mythical metaphors and the egyptians who were supposedly the source of this account never mentioned something similar    autistic retard oh my god they wuz the kaaaaaaaangz the jew be hiding the truth its clearly a real place not metaphorical story it is santorini even though it doesnt even fit 5 of the criteria oh my god
but why mongols never expanded into europe they fear white warriors
mongols were white you idiot
  no they were nordic
  they were dravidians stop stealing our heritage you cumskins
  kurultai
  poland isnt europe
  they fear their cousins the magyars
  
  correct
  driving off a scouting party after getting cucked twice     hope    cope    rope
  it tends to be harder to project power the further you are away from home

the mongol fears the wall he knows his horse cant scale it mongols were easy pickings once they broke through from rapeociding stone age peasants and stumbled across actual fortifications

were socdems always the special kids of politics
  before they succumbed to opportunism and revisionism in 1914 they were pretty cool
  they are the boring mainstream kid for quite some time now
  did a soc dem ass fuck your colored gf anon no need to be upset
   failed to stop communists in russia   failed to stop nazies in germany   lead western countries into decay today
  social democracy is the most successful incarnation of marxs vision in developed democratic countries a far cry from the colossal indefensible embarrassments of stalinism maoism the khmer rouge and so on    tankies are like someone in a mental institution talking down to his successful younger brother when he comes visit oblivious to the fact his younger brother feels sorry for him and is just humoring him
  we wuz marxists n shiet  kills rosa  cucks out to capitalists
  gets dabbed on by neoliberals for 40 years  the last bastions of succdemism in the nordic lands are either already literally at america tier levels of wealth inequality sweden or have been rolling back the gains of social democracy for decades and will keep doing so  wwere bbetter tthan ssstalin at llleast  read some lenin and luxemburg you cryptobernsteinist kautskyite hellspawn youre even more revisionist than the stalinites

  the canadian ndp party is worth noting in there started as a demsoc party under the name ccf that had overthrowing the capitalist system in its manifesto yet has completely accepted capitalism aside from a weak socialist caucus within the party and has removed socialism entirely from their platform iirc
  not as contemptable as bernie bomb yugoslavia praise mccain sanders interesting because he has john mcdonnell behind an unironic marxist
  mcdonnell is the worlds most successful cryptotrot entryist complete with his own transitional program    
smells like /leftypol/ in here better leave quickly
  fuck off you succdem cuck a bunch of backstabbing revisionist traitors who do nothing but hinder the cause of the revolution itself your words are just as trustworthy as the liberal parliamentarism you often worship because all that matters to you are those comfortable seats in the parliament to save your own face for lacking any discipline or worthwhile praxis at all seriously every time a succdem comes in and thinks he owns the board everybody just knew hes gonna backstab everyone in the room and sells his own comrades to the nearest capitalists he can find     champagne socialist whiny scum
  they used to like guns
  uh huh    well i better be going i will be attending a summit with other social democratic parties from around the world to discuss climate change how to improve living standards for millions of people around the world and educate the masses so they become rightfully skeptical of authority and the obscenely rich and can stand up for themselves see you soon
  its another lies about who killed luxemburg episode   dont get me wrong only a dead pinko is a good one but the governemnt had very limited control over the freikorps
  liberal coward
  the governemnt had very limited control over the freikorps  blatant spd historical falsifications
 create thread for right wingers   leftypol shows up
  and none of it will matter because nobody wants to vote for milquetoast reformism people want radical transformation and the overthrow of all existing social conditions the very revolution that socdems are terrified of delivering
  oh and the kappputch was also secretly covered by evil social democrats   tankies are so pathetic second part here is absolute truth 
  people want radical transformation  no they dont socialism only comes about in desperate times and most of the west is far from that threshold with tangible hope and a full belly your collectivist garbage means nothing to most people
    not your safespace
  /leftypol/ seems to hate socdems more than right wingers anyway i dont really see how its really a right winger question anyway
socdem is the ultimate normie ideology its what youd come up with if you thought about politics and economics for like five minutes
  the fuck people already got the radical transformation our whole society has been turned upside down completely since the 1960s and it was through social democracy holy shit lefty radicals are the most clueless people on earth
  its the characteristic of many of the most successful nations on earth contrarian bitch i bet you larp as a christian too
  success  high gdp and full bellies  thats not the end of the story
dsa is just jewish speed dating
  frig off dnd fag
  success  no money and starvation
  /leftypol/ hates socdems because muh rosa totally couldve turned germany into a communist republic even if the easy suppression of the spartacists undermines that assumption
  well excluding japan and the us socdem is cool because of its affinity to developmentalism in a democratic environment    marxs vision didnt care for the democratic aspect    this doesnt take into account the international aspect at all as if nothing happened in 1979    byebye revolution it wont happen uber got in the way    anyway since im not /pol/ im open to change my opinion    most of the historical critics are a question of pointofview in the socdem pov it was the communists that sabotaged the national institutions
    first worldists  i seriously hope you guys dont do this
  social democracy unashamedly admits it is a mere stepping stone to revolution the goal is to gather support since the revolution must be led by the people not a vanguard
  social democracy exists to keep people from revolution thats the whole point
want to hate on them but my life path aligns perfectly with their beliefs lol why do i even act edge on the internet idk
  reread the manifesto marx hated the socialistic bourgeoisie
  gib sexy jewess with big nose and tiddies
  fuck off trudeau
  but he was the socialistic bourgousies and so was his wife
  he recognized it is a system of representation with advantages and disadvantages like any other the practical aspects are a separate subject    the gdp per capita of britain in 1850 was 4000 nowadays this is exceeded by all but the red and dark red countries and 19th century britain of course was far less equal and democratic than most of these third worldism is kind of defunct the world has completely changed and as much of the world develops it will adopt social democratic systems seen in places like scandinavia and new zealand
  look up the meaning of the term it means people who want to reform capitalism instead of abolishing it
  it could be that some politician social democrats have entrusted with a leadership position doesnt really care about social democracy if so thats an error that can be rectified however it is an absolute certainty an authoritarian vanguard cant lead the revolution because the revolution must be led by the people
  nobody gives a shit marx is not some jesus with his communist bible thats not how it works his thoughts and ideas are clearly outdated
social democracy is okay but the true chad ideology is agrarian distributism    either are preferable to either laissezfaire capitalism or central planning
  marx is jesus he was partly of jewish ancestry too and capital is the bible of marxism
  literally perfection
  ppp  thirdworldism is defunct  the world will adopt the scandinavian system even though financialization and fragmentation of production progresses    huge leaps into the abyss there but i hope you are right wouldnt bet on it tho

why didnt chinese dynasties do anything with lake baikal they occasionally fought battles up there with local tribes but they never stayed around instead russia eventually claimed the entire region in the 1600s and there were no chinese military garrisons to oppose the russians     in general why didnt china follow the russian model and expand north to the edge of the landmass thus blocking any other foreign powers from claiming that land imagine a china that extends from the arctic ocean to hainan but this never happened  why
  that northern land is borderline useless except for resources which are more useful to modern people than medieval people it would take immense effort to conquer it and for the chinese it just wasnt worth it also the ocean up there just freezes over so pretty useless for ports
  in general why didnt china follow the russian model and expand north to the edge of the landmass thus blocking any other foreign powers from claiming that land imagine a china that extends from the arctic ocean to hainan but this never happened  why    read up on what happened in the yuan dynasty when the mongs told moved a bunch of chinese colonists to civilize siberia
  why didnt chinese dynasties do anything with lake baikal they occasionally fought battles up there with local tribes but they never stayed around  they chinese stay for decades around lake baikal in the tang dynasty    instead russia eventually claimed the entire region in the 1600s and there were no chinese military garrisons to oppose the russians  the qing started fighting the russians around the amur river basin and after defeating the russians at albazin negotiated the border the qing at first demanded control over all the buryat mongol lands up to lake baikal on the grounds they belonged to the yuan dynasty and western european jesuit catholic translators working for the qing even threatened the russians with military strikes if the russians did not comply but the russians decided to translate directly through mongol translators instead of the jesuits to find out if it was that urgent the qing were preparing for total war against the dzungar khanate over outer mongolia and they wanted to settle the boundary dispute with russia quickly to fight the dzungars instead the qing decided to leave the border at the amur river basin in the treaty of nerchinsk in 1689 and went to war against the dzungar khanate after the outer mongol khalkhas submitted to the qing when the dzungars invaded it is because of the dzungars the qing chose not to expand the war with russia
    interestingly however a suspected uyghur chieftain built a chinesestyle palacemonastery in por bajin siberia the place is literally named after the palace
    thats not what happened to the colonists siberian soil is actually suitable for wheat agriculture stop spreading exaggerated bullshit to look cool the han colonists planted their crops fine  the yenisei kyrgyz of the yenisei river first appear as a subject nation under xiongnu rule as the jiankun or xiajiasi after the han chinese general li ling defected to the xiongnu during the han dynasty the xiongnu chanyu chedihou chanyu gave his own daughter in marriage to li ling and appointed li ling as hereditary vassal ruler of the yenisei kyrgyz region soviet russian archaeologists discovered the remains of a chinese han dynasty style palace in the yenisei region that may have belonged to li ling the yenisei kyrgyz khaganate arose in the place centuries later in the tang dynasty right north of the turkic khaganate and later uyghur khaganate the yenisei kyrgyz khagans of the are clan claimed direct descent from the han chinese general li ling and his wife the xiongnu princess li ling was from a han chinese family known as the longxi li family which included general li guang li ling was li guangs grandson li guang had another grandson li yu who was a direct ancestor of the tang dynasty founding emperor li yuan this made the yenisei kyrgyz khagans of the are clan relatives of the tang dynasty imperial family of china the yenisei kyrgyz allied with tang dynasty china against the uyghur khaghanate rescuing a tang imperial princess from the uyghurs and the yenisei kytgyz and tang dynasty armies joined together to slaughter the uyghur khaghanate army at kill the barbarian mountain the uyghur khaghanate in mongolia collapsed under the joint yenisei kyrgyz and tang dynasty assault however the yenisei kyrgyz chose to remain in the yenisei region and did not build an empire the khitan filled the power vacuum left by the uyghur khaghanate and founded the liao dynasty
  its literally what happened to the yuan colonist project the chinks went local i dont care what happened in earlier dynasties
      the yenisei kyrgyz later submitted as a vassal nation to the mongols the mongols sent some han chinese colonists to the yenisei kyrgyz region  the thing about yenisei kyrgyz is that they were half sedentary wheat farmers half nomadic pastoralists half of the yenisei kyrgyz during the tang dynasty lived in wooden cabins and grew wheat along the yenisei kyrgyz and even exported the wheat south to central asia in the entire medieval era the other half of the yenisei kyrgyz were nomadic pastoralists who lived in tents and moved goats sheep and cows around like nomads  the yenisei kyrgyz spoke a turkic language but were physically and culturally different from the gokturks of the turkic khaghanate and the uyghurs of the uyghur khaganate the gokturks and uyghurs were mostly mongoloid in appearance and fully pastoral nomads used the turkic rune alphabet and held the orkhon valley to be a sacred religious site and centered their capital and empires around the orkhon the nomadic gokturk turkic khaghnate built its empire around the orkhon in mongolia and after the uyghurs overthrew the gokturk khaghanate and established the uyghur khaghanate they centered their nomadic empire around the orkhon and did the same rituals  the yenisei kyrgyz were described as more caucasoid like by chinese with some having red hair green eyes while some other yenisei kyrgyz with black hair and black eyes were descendants of the han chinese general li ling and his chinese soldiers  the yenisei kyrgyz did not view the orkhon valley as sacred they did not try to annex mongolia or occupy it after helping tang dynasty china destroy the uyghur khaghanate they were content to remain in the yenisei river farm wheat and export wheat south to central asia while the khitan took over mongolia  hence  posting bullshit about crops not growing in siberia is fake
  the khakas in the yenisei river valley are descendants of the yenisei kyrgyz the oirat dzungar khanate in dzungaria expanded in all directions in the 17th and 18th centuries and forced the khakas to become vassals and deported some khakas south to dzungaria after the qing defeated the dzungar khanate the qing deported those khakas east to heilongjiang where they are now known as fuyu kyrgyz khakas still speak the same turkic language the yenisei kyrgyz spoke but it appears the yenisei kyrgyz were not originally turks but turkified yeniseians due to their cultural and physical differences with gokturks and uyghurs  the yenisei kyrgyz are khagans had a chance to intervene and save china after the overthrow of the tang dynasty because their khagan was from the same family as the tang dynasty imperial family and even officially included as a member of the imperial family on the tang dynasty imperial genealogical register by the tang dynasty government they could have presented themselves as legitimate emperors of china and restorers of the tang dynasty if they decided to attack the khitan in mongolia and intervene when the later liang overthrew the last tang dynasty emperor but they went isolationist after beating the uyghur khaghanate up
  how the fuck is that what happened to the yuan colonist project when yakuts dont live in the yenisei river yenisei kyrgyz live there and they farmed wheat fine and exported that wheat to central asia general li ling even built a chinese style palace there with local materials the mongols sent han chinese colonists and officials to the yenisei river and tuva not to yakutia the han chinese official liu haoli was sent to yenisei and tuva with han soldiers and artisans and they taught the natives skills like pottery shipbuilding and other customs
  it would have been cool to see the yenisei kyrgyz are khagans to intervene and found a restored tang dynasty in china chinese had no hostility or bad blood with yenisei kyrgyz the yenisei kyrgyz were too content with the yenisei valley for their own good they destroyed the uyghur khaghanate not for any material gain wealth or land the yenisei kyrgyz khagan simply considered it as helping his relatives in the tang dynasty imperial family by rescuing the tang dynasty princess and destroying an enemy of china the princess didnt even realize they were going to rescue her the yenisei kyrgyz suddenly stormed the battlefield against the uyghur khaghanate army and killed them as they saved the princess
  the nomadic khitan brought han farmers to farm in mongolia and constructed han cities all over mongolia where they put han artisans and craftsmen it is not true that crops dont grow on the steppe that screenshot is pure misinformation the dzungars did the same with turkic muslim farmers forcing them to farm on the steppe for them russians farmed on former crimean tatar and astrakhan steppe and those nomads partially adopted agriculture
chinks and slavs think they can control and tame the steppes    now they have to dndanger world peace for stealing the steppe mans lands and resouces    they wind up destroying the world and its peace    t steppe descendant slav and chink killer
  manchu farmers destroyed the dzungarian steppe with the dzungar genocide and resettling farmers and miners in it
  chinese cope they got absolutely buttfucked by russia into giving up the ruling dynastys homeland   that would be like if russia bullied prussia into giving it brandenberg but left it with hanover and cologne there is no way to spin it that it isnt a colossal failure for the chinese/prussians
  youre coping over the cossacks getting defeated in the only one on one war they had with the qing the qing defeated russia in 1686 at albazin and drove them out of the amur  russia annexed the outer amur in 1859 in the middle of the second opium war and taiping rebellion wothout a figh since the qing was fighting the anglofrench south  the outer amur is also notthe manchu homeland jilin is the manchu jianzhou jurchen homeland especiamly mount changbai manchus are southern tungusics outer amur is the homeland of northern tungusics like udege and evenkis the qing which started in jilin had to invade north to bring heilongjiang and northern tungusics under its control  russia lost the actual homeland of kievan rus ukraine
  the dzungars captured swedish prisoner officers and engineers from the russians and the dzengars are responsible for kazakhstan and siberian tatars necoming part of russia the siberian tatars and kazakh khanate were being beaten by the dzungar khanate and joined russia out of fear of the dzungars khalkha mongols joined the qing after dzungars invaded outer mongolia the dzungars were the biggest power in 17th and 18th century central asia after the qing not russia

  im a different anon just found the archived thread what a coincidence lol ok what about the pentagon underground files 
  what a coincidence lol  mate go to /x/ you really just want to jerk off to conspiracies and fantasies
  no what i want is to know if there are preserved works of art or historical evidence hidden to the public yet to be released like for example when belgium released a document 50 years later that stated that prime minister lumumba was shot in the back of the head and diluted in acid in the middle of the desert for the preservation of the belgium colony of the congo

what could have the imperial court done to stop the local nobility to grab so much power what could they have done to centralize power in their hands and why didnt they do it
  when
  any point in japanese history
  but they did  several times
  well what could they have done to solidify it and not just have it go back to the local nobility again
  it didnt go back to local nobility again the appointed officials governors etc from influential kyoto families or branches of the imperial family would just always eventually get to the point where they became the new hereditary nobility of a region
  i guess what im really asking is why didnt the japanese create a centralized state sooner
  autism unironically    weve done it this way so we should always do it this way and this very specific order mumblemumblemumble  okay but check this out what if we did it like this way instead  no no no no no no we can only do it this one way reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
  they did though several times afaik  its not like there was always just a bunch of warlords everywhere vying for the seat of the shogun  but japans history is fucking long dude every few hundred years or so theyd have a big civil war and it wasnt really until onin war fucked everything up that the authority of the central government degenerated to the point you got the warring states  also this   always remember that they came up with not one not two not three not four but five offices for regents of regents of regents of regents of regents to the emperor rather than just fucking establish a new imperial family  and thats all like before the turn of the millennia i think
  many of the nobility ruled because they were descendants of past emperors so one way to stop that would be to have the emperor only have one wife and the children concubines hold no status     secondly have the imperial army pacify the east rather than feudal lords     lastly institute a system like sankinkoutai were feudal lords have to live every other year in the imperial capital and have the families of feudal lords live there permanently as hostages     but really the japanese system worked out well with political power in the hands of the shogun rebellions and dynastic changes rarely effected the imperial family since anyone wanting to hold power wouldnt seen them as a threat or obstacle
historical figures you want to rape and pillage

are you ever appreciative that you live in your current times rather than the past or even the future
i dont appreciate living in the mouse utopia experiment
  dr shekelburg was quoted as saying we cant expect schwartzes not to have as much unprotected sex as they want what we really need to do is normalise circumcision as much as possible so it isnt banned for us and we can mount a better defence of it for our sunni allies including female circumcision the first phase of neoconservatism where we demonised arabs is over now its about getting western europe to submit to saudis and flooding it with people who are living on our land from the nile river to the persian sea
  mouse utopia experiment having anything to do with human society
  hes right and so was ted kaczynski
were puritans the most /fa/ people in history
  no not quite i know its the most go to answer but given our modern perspective on fashion that would have to go to the nazis  double breasted overcoats for every man  field service uniform tunics which were so stylish they were worn at official weddings and as walking out dress also  schirmmütze  basically peak /fa/ til the sinplifications of 40 and 43
  bump

  i was able to convert my wife to gnosticlike thought over 2 years ago    just watch true detective with her while giving pessimistic analyses
  just watch true detective with her while giving pessimistic analyses  good advice for turning anyone gnostic or suicidal
  true detective isnt even as extreme as the other stuff weve watched or read 
  having sex or a lover is a sin
  cut off your balls and force her to eat them then ask her if she still likes the material realm
guys im not feeling that well
oh no
all over the normie internet youtube comments redditetc you can see jokes about france always surrendering and never having won a war    now most of these posts are made by persons from countries with much least glorious histories than france but as scrolled among these jokes in the comment section of a video about the germans first experimenting flamethrowers on the french during ww1 i asked myself what countries should really be allowed to mock france for its military hitory    you have to exclude all the countries with a shittier history than france so the only ones you have left are  spain  britain  germany  usa  russia  china    but if you give them a closer look    spain  got raped by france countless times  britain  conquered by france in 1066 and performed as bad as them in 1940  germany  raped by france for centuries  usa  exist because of the french military  china  raped by france in the 19th century    so the only one you have left is russia
  the usa exists because of france
  ill grant you spain but i think the others are off the mark  britain  no they did not do as bad as france they didnt just roll over and give up with barely a fight hell even their colonies were doing more than france in that war  germany  sort of right but all those incursions basically ended up creating the archnemesis a unified germany which has eclipsed them pretty much ever since  usa  now thats some serious navel gazing  china  france was like 4th banana behind britain russia and japan in toying with china and never could do so on their own hell china even beat them one on one on land in the 1880s
  /int/ the thread  this is exactly why /his/ shouldve never been created
country that has been around for over one thousand years has won numerous wars against its neighbors therefore you cant have a negative opinion about said country
  no they did not do as bad as france they didnt just roll over and give up with barely a fight    the british army sure did  it ran away like two weeks before the french surrendered in a battle that lasted 6 weeks in total
  china  france was like 4th banana behind britain russia and japan in toying with china and never could do so on their own hell china even beat them one on one on land in the 1880s    what are you mumbling about  france objectively won the sinofrench war  it was a war over vietnam and france came out with vietnam as a colony  the both side claim victory on wikipedia is just typical chink revisionism like they do with half the wars they lost
  so they lived and fought another day much more preferable to just giving up they even launched a successful campaign against the italians later that year try again
  you can if youre russian
  if youre on the losing side on the land against china in the 19th century and your administration collapses it is hardly objectively a win but hey if thats what france wants to count as a win sure thing its a good laugh
  much more preferable to just giving up    they would have been forced to if the french rearguard hadnt saved their evacuation
   you do realize france only got involved in the english civil war once they saw the americans having a clear shot at beating england right  did france help a lot sure but the us was going to win whether france got involved or not the only difference is england would have won militarily but still gave in to colonists demands and gave them some more freedom then it would have kept going into that spiral till they get independence
  what the fuck do events 200 years ago have to do with the modern residents if you didnt even know someone alive during said war it doesnt matter at all for judging modern residents
  pure speculation informed by the french tradition of simply giving up at the first serious setback
  if youre on the losing side on the land against china in the 19th century  the french won like 90 of battles on the land which is how they got vietnam  the limited land success bullshit on the wiki is about some failed invasion of taiwan which turned irrelevant    and your administration collapses  it collapsed mostly because of internal issues the unpopularity of the war was a minor factor    but hey if thats what france wants to count as a win sure thing its a good laugh  yes taking vietnam from china while inflicting them over 10000 casualties for only 2000 french ones mostly to diseases is considered a win
  based and frogpilled glory be to you brother everyone must become experts on the sinofrench war the chinese are literal revisionists attempting to change history
  no need to become an expert on the sinofrench war just on chinese internet culture  theyre doing that with dozens of wars they lost
  but as scrolled among these jokes in the comment section of a video about the germans first experimenting flamethrowers on the french during ww1    jesus christ
  not him but i could see how that would be insulting the germans famously first experimented with the flamethrower against the french in the thick of the first stages of verdun either when they were wrestling the villages of douaumont forges or on the assaults on the left bank verdun the battle to go on for another ten months where a little less than a tenth of french losses would occur    its not really where youd want to find those jokes
  and yet
  everyone can lock french military history its just banter safe for americans its just that theyre retarded and have no right to mock anyone considering they never had to fight on their own soil in fact they still cry rivers about times when some people attacked them in their own territory pearl harbour 9/11
  ill never forget that all this french bashing started when france refused to follow america in the iraq war this country is really a poison for the modern world and deserves to be nuked
  its sad that their cultural dominance has spread the joke worldwide with the internet and now people from meme countries feel allowed to mock french history
  are you serious or just retarded
  ill never forget that all this french bashing started when france refused to follow america in the iraq war  unfortunate that this opinion is wrong considering we have records of the same jokes being made in the 1940s to the extent that the us army included them as what not to do in france in their occupation guide we have records of antifrench sentiment as early as the revolution make no mistake about it the francoamerican relationship has always been one of realpolitik
  britain was invaded by french normans not france
  they never had to fight on their own soil  war of 1812  a hyuck hyuck hyuck
  imagine being french
      what kind of gigantic turbofaggot gets offended by youtube comments its fucking youtube comments dude they make invertebrates look smart and cultured in comparison
  they were french tho
  you can despise normies all you want but at the end of the day its their view that matters
  unfortunate that this opinion is wrong considering we have records of the same jokes being made in the 1940s to the extent that the us army included them as what not to do in france in their occupation guide  proof  and keep in mind that hurr the french are smelly / france has never won a war lol  show me the later was in the occupation book    we have records of antifrench sentiment as early as the revolution make no mistake about it the francoamerican relationship has always been one of realpolitik  doesnt change the fact that 2003 was the most radical one  pic related
  in terms of existential threats america really only faced one in the form of getting the revolution off the ground without french support we are looking at just a more autonomous colonies rather than a independent country
  they may have been french but france did not annex them england still continued as its own thing after william the conqueror
  french bashing in 2003 wasnt just a bunch of comments on the internet it was an official strategy of the us i have no respect for america since then fuck this country
  it was an official strategy of the us i have no respect for america since then  i hope you are not telling me you respected them when they were so hellbent on stopping france from having its own nuclear arsenal that they forced belgium and canada not to sell uranium to france and used muh special relationship bullshit on britain to stop a jointproject for an isotope separation plant in the 1960s
  it was pretty unbelieavable and funny to see politicians make the kind of shitty jokes you can see in youtibe comments on the national tv
  what about the crimean war
  yeah but that was a limited war outside of russia itself  the closest russia came from being humiliated by france was under napoleon but they ended up being the ones who killed the french empire  russia was never really humiliated by france like the other countries listed
  youre right the simple fact they refused to pay their debt right after their independence is enough to see theyre assholes
  lest we forget that america threw an autistic hissfit when bolshevik russia did the same to them  russia you best not forget your debts to the u s of a  sorry tovarisch those debts were owed by the tzar of imperial russia that state no longer exists we owe you nothing  reeeeeeeeeeee fucking commies reeeeeeeeeeeee we refuse to recognise you fucks oaaaaarrghhhhhhhh
  thats true
  no france is a joke but u definitely have a good claim for first claim
  in english
  even without the revolution an independent american identity would have formed and the usa would be the same size with the addition of canada bermuda and other british possessions in north america
  if the conquered by x a long time ago is the standard we all need ot shut about about italy
  ancient romans  italians
  what is the chinese cultural revolution
  genetics studies show that the natives of greece and italy are both continuous with the ancient populations with minimal gene flow from the near east similarly spain and portugal have extremely low subsaharan and north african admixture to the point of being negligible romans depicted themselves predominantly as brown light brown black and red haired not blonde their features are gracilized their stature short and noses roman not nordic or germanic greeks do indeed look extremely similar to what more realistic artistic renditions from the ancient aegean evince you can try to maneuver however you would like celts and balkanoid indoeuropeans had minimal impact on the makeup of greece postdorian invasion if anything northern italy is more germanic and celtic now than it was during the days of imperial rome sorry
  so they lived and fought another day  and the french military did the exact same try harder nige
  usa  exist because of the french military    this simple truth triggers and angers the mutt
  spain  spain at its height only had a navy and that soon was destroyed completely by some rocks and storms so ill give you that  china  america  china and america have only become world powers within the 20th century so thats valid seeing that they dont have the history    germany     cant immediately give you germany due to if we include prussia if we include prussia then no seeing that prussia wasnt as good until after the napoleonic wars but its history more than made up and helped it after napoleon fell prussia would whoop french ass until ww1 where it was stale mate and whoop ass one more time during ww2  england   cant give you this one you cited from the 1066 foir the reasoning but that was so long ago england beat france during the 100 years war and england would be the counterpart to france up until after the napoleonic wars signing the treaty between france and russia and england
  england beat france during the 100 years war  non
even during the napoleon wars russia wasnt a main player it was immence luck on their part that napoleon invaded them because they coundt defeat the french army in a pitched battle even afterwards prussia austria and britain did most of the fighting     france overall has a glorious military history and the dirty secret of the wwii surrender is that the higher ups in france hated the socialist leon blum goverment and just didnt want to fight
  us exists because of the french military  after the us had to hold on and wait for france not to be cunts you are also forgetting the dutch and spanish frenchnoid
  butthurted frog revisionist seething  wew here we go again  yes france lost to china on lands at sinofrench war and china helped vietnamese kicked out frenches in vietnam war again deal with it 
  thats sound more like what whitoid supremacists did not chinese   quite common on 4chan actually like you and these      the french won like 90 of battles on the land  nah they didnt you lying sack of shit honky revisionist pic related  french also lost the most crucial battle in bang bo
philosopher kings do not exi
  liberalism is cool kids
  and by liberalism i mean conservatism
how is a fat sweaty youtuber who jerks off to reactionary philosophy a king
  sarkike of jewcad  conservative  fellate a shotgun mordechai
  fuck off sargon im the og philosopher king and you know it
  came to post but also picd base kurd
why were they so sub par compared to their other branches like the royal navy raf and the intelligence services
they did fine though especially for an island nation
    they were crap i honestly cant think of any significant victories apart from against the mighty and feared italian war machine and even then those were drawn out and very wasteful  every other significant action was pretty much a defeat ie battle of france dunkirk battle of norway battle of singapore operation market garden etc i could go on
  because you have a wikipedia drawn perception and knowledge of the war it wasnt won through large set piece operations that failed or succeeded its in the thousands of small actions and advances that led to american and british forces penetrating deep into germany by wars end theres no indication that british troops were much less effective statistically than american and canadian soldiers and id challenge you to do so
    id challenge you to do so    not sure why i have to back anything up when my point is made you are disputing it with no evidence so the onus is on you  true story operation market garden failed because the british armoured division on the way to relieve the paratroopers at arnhem stopped 6 times a day to make tea and the paratroopers were overrun  the british army never had a chance against germany in a fair fight as the facts show its equipment was badly designed and overall it was badly led at every level by amatuer aristocrats it basically never achieved anything on its own
  unwillingness to spend any money on the bef during the interwar years generation of officers either wiped out of removed due to politicking
  muh channel
  won in north africa  muh italy  also eventually beat a gentleman named rommel
  based on the spergy reaction im guessing youre a butthurt kraut whos decided to have a go at the uk because you get btfod in discussions about the eastern front
  seething lol
  because they got like less than 10 of the funding whereas navy and air force were sucking that shit up  look at late british designs and shit
  are you mentally retarded  british officers and ncos have always been known to be the goat its always been their high command who sucks dick  individual actions are no more or less notable than any other army
  crusader
  they did fine though  lmao  they dunkirked in 1940 and singapored in 1942    especially for an island nation  an island nation that claimed to be the world superpower
island nation  lmao why do they put more focus on air and sea power lmao
  singapore comes down to the failure of literally one mentally retarded spasmaloid who unfortunatly happened to be in charge and didnt take to things like listening to subordinates and scout reports and such who told him exactly what they should do and what was happening
  seething bong
  t historically illiterate newfag who cannot greentext or meme  kys my jizz gargling friend
  singapore comes down to the failure of literally one mentally retarded spasmaloid who unfortunatly happened to be in charge    thats how war works braindead bongoid  i guess austria actually did well in ww1 cause after all all their failures were caused by one retarded hötzendorf who unfortunatly happened to be in charge
  i didnt say britain performed well in singapore you dribbling retard  im just saying why they performed badly which happens to be a single man and not some english trait of being worse at fights or some shit  also im not a bong im just not a fucking stupid /int/ cancer retard
  flat out forgetting the burma campaign happened  sterilize yourself
  british armoured division on the way to relieve the paratroopers at arnhem stopped 6 times a day to make tea and the paratroopers were overrun  it was forced to stop at njimengan for more than a day because the us paratroopers there still had not taken their day one objective despite it initially being guarded by 2 old men and a dog
  bad tanks bad equipment shit pay shit leadership i could go on
  redcoats have always been garbage it is in perfidious scheming and plotting in which the anglo shines
  englishmen have made hopeless soldiers since the longbow fell out of fashion but the welsh irish and scots prove themselves consistently on the battlefield canadians and aussies too
  this american ineptitude cost thousands of british paratroopers their lives and denied the allies a decisive victory the american (((media))) went into full damage control and blamed the british high command unfortunately this was a common occurrence such as in italy when they ignored orders and marched into rome allowing the germans to retreat and create yet another defensive line at omaha where american troops floundered and nearly ruined the whole invasion despite having the easiest beach and earlier in tunisia where they simply got raped and had to be rescued if american troops had been more focused on fighting and less being media darlings we could have kept the russians out of berlin
  they were half of the beaches on d day in fact they did better than the americans     also they won in india and then burma    i could go on but you get the idea
  bad tanks  but this is a lie
   the english army was absurdly underrated in foreign countries  and absolutely despised in its own the illsuccess of the expeditions  in 1794 and 1799 appeared to justify the general prejudice   england both at home and abroad was in 1808  scorned as a military power   napier  history of the  war in peninsula 18071814 p 21  well posted as wellington knows how to post it  and attacked from the front i consider the english infantry  to be impregnable   french general reille
  brits had a hard strategic position and suffered from inept allies the german army generally considered the most efficient land force with the manpower and ressources given considered the brits the only adversary who could match them in training doctrine and general professionalism
  omaha  easiest beach  ok i know youre butthurt but this is just really low effort
  i think he confused utah which was in fact the easiest of the beaches and omaha which was indeed a much harder target and selected principally to bridge the gap between beach heads
the sucked in ww1 too much heavier casualty rate than the french
  muh wiki boxes
  truth here
why were saddam and assad rivals when they were the only two baathist leaders in the region
  saddam saw the proposed political union between iraq and syria as a threat to his rising power and it was retroactively justified by   we have the true interpretation of baathism
  saddam was a mentally ill megalomaniac hafez had realistic plans
  saddam supported terrorists in syria against assad in the 80s
  saddam didnt really give a fuck about arab nationalism once in power
  saddam just liked being in power
  my moroccan arab teacher essentially explained the problem with arab nations by quoting some arab philosopher i cant remember the name of rn maybe ibn haldun but dont quote me on it he effectively said the biggest weakness for arabs is their greed they are always trying to backstab eachother and become most powerful and they only trust someone if they either know they are too afraid to resist you or you have similar goals look at the caliphates in the early years for example they would conquer a fuckton of land and become really rich and the moment their common enemy was gone they fell apart to infighting arabs dont trust each other and for good reason its just their culture
  assad saddam alliance when
why have you not accepted dialectical/historical materialism as the best explanation for history anon
because im not a brainlet
  implying history isnt dictated by material conditions
why do they have such magnificent facial hair
mysticism
  materialism is a jew conspiracy
because i dont want to be a cokehead
  bakunin is labeled as hess
  it explains some things well and its an interesting stepping stone to more complex thought but it kind of falls apart as the only way to analyze history feudalism and capitalism were interpreted alright but marx was no historian primitive communism and oriental economics make no sense and were basically just made up though    /thread
  
  yes its not its dictated more by culture than the retarded haves vs have nots that marxist think the world revolves around
  culture is dictated by material
  except its not culture is based on geography and the history of your tribe
  its also dictated by humans
  no
  geography sounds like material to me
  only modern american one
  everything is material then
  in the sense of being focused on material objects perhaps but broadly most aspects of life are determined essentially economically
  well no ideas are immaterial culture is immaterial great men are immaterial for example economic conditions of which resources are of course a part but especially economic organization fundamentally determines what a society is like other factors such as geography or science or whatever may contribute to some degree to what that society looks like on a casebycase basis but overall society and therefore history is determined materially
  geography is material  arguably yes  therefore material is culture and material indicates success  yes and no mostly no what i take youre arguing is that culture is derived from the natural resources a society has which in turn causes the society to develop a superior/inferior culture and dominate this is true to a certain extent but as mentioned in gungerms and steel material only matters up to the point intensive food production and at most metal resources any more is a minor advantage that barely counts which is where the real competition starts from there what dictates a superior culture is the time for the culture to develop and what kind of axioms the culture relies on which again is the choices of your ancestors
  well no ideas are immaterial culture is immaterial great men are immaterial  therefore there are immaterial forces that drive history
  they influence history on a surface level but material forces are what drive it and determine it immaterial forces are in large part themselves driven by material forces religion culture for example
dialectics are not a replacement for logic and observation
  my point here is rather borrowed from marx more than ggs
  gave birth to communism  the best explanation
  man should have had an abortion
  dialectics literally is logic
  no it is a rhetorical form its about as rigorous as brainstorming
  more specifically that economic relations and the way that people get resources to a lesser degree than the resources themselves influence the way culture religion politics and ultimately history develop
  should be to a greater degree than the resources
  einstein was a socialist too does that discredit relativity
  no because einsteins scientific work is scientifically and mathematically proven  politics is much harder to prove and as seen in the 20th century socialism does not work well when tried
  dialectical materialism is the biggest buzzword in the entirety of marxist jargon
  gave birth to communism  no    t brainlet
  bakunin  moses hess
  experiment confirms relativity yet history completely and utterly btfos marxism
  dialectic is just a literary form brainlet it doesnt mean anything to say for example i applied material dialectics to the topic and came up with the result x its nonsense yet marxists constantly talk in that way
  why do they have such magnificent facial hair    to hide their weak jewish chin
  bakunin  trotsky and lenin  aligned in any way whatsoever  no
  what about material causes such as diseases calamities sudden deaths of humans caused by supernatural are they material especially if the supernatural agent is spirit outside of material universe but with influence here and unbound from its laws
  fucking hell i can at least understand getting kalinin and trotsky mixed up but mistaking moses hess for bakunin is a new level of ignorance its like posting a picture of tito and labeling him goring
  then explain saudi arabia
  at least tito and goering look similar bakunin and hess look nothing alike
  because dialectics cannot map to studies of human society without abandoning their foundation in formal logic for a dialectical system to remain founded in formal logic the antithesis cannot be anything but a strict negation of the thesis so it isnt possible to apply such a system to human society because such dichotomies pretty much never exist especially when discussing different socioeconomic groups like marx tried to do     so you either dont apply dialectics to history and let it remain founded in formal logic or you do and let it lose its logical soundness in which case why even bother with it     historical materialism itself is fine but marxs dialetic and the absolute quack prophecies he proclaimed are worthless for any practical understanding of history
have things really changed that much in the last hundred or even thousand years as far as crime  a percentage of the population has always committed crimes and the only thing i see that has changed is the methods of detecting crime
crime is down across the board we live in the safest time in history
  t soccer mom shocked by the news reporting on shit that was already there
  thats hard to prove  most of the time when you read crime is down the source is a statistic of reported crimes  people also report less crimes when police is ineffective or the good old decriminilazing small offences then reported crime is down again     i would think that crime is going up because poor people keep getting poorer as the cost of living increases  that means more reasons to commit crime      the way crimes have changed in history id say not at all you have virtual crimes now and different types of scam but its always been the same shit hasnt it
did antifa help or hurt hitlers rise to power
  helped they created the brown shirts in response to the pre antifa groups that would go on to form antifa they also garnered sympathy towards hitler as his supporters were attacked at speeches
helped  they would have really hurt him by staying quiet and giving him what he wants like everyone else was doing
  looks like we gotta step up our punching nazis game before this happens
  oh boi you guys are in no shape right now
lets join antifa and beat up moderates to cause a national socialist backlash
  uhhhh hello everytime you guys try to have a demonstration we outnumber you we outnumber you there we outnumber you in the voting booth you are the ones in no shape right now
  beat up moderates  no no no we beat up nazis true moderates join us because they dont like nazis any moderate not against you nazis are just lying wolves in sheep clothing
oh its real i wouldve never guessed honestly     but id assume it gave the nazis even more propaganda
  lol stop trolling anon youre not actually antifa
  well it certainly helped trumps rise to pwoer
    built for bbc
  they were mostly irrelevant german politics of that era were driven more by fundamental social factors than by streettheatre sideshows
  and trump is hitler so the answer is yes antifa helped hitler
  helped antifa and their predecessors began punching people long before nazis were around it started with conservative monarchists and escalated from there
  helped the reason he was allowed to become dictator in the first place was specifically to crack down on these people
i got in a fight with and beat the shit out of a fascist last week ask me anything
  holy kek
  did everyone clap how shiny was the medal that hilldawg gave you
  define fascism
  nobody was there but i wish they were
  a skinhead with a visible iron cross tattoo
  democrats are the real fascists
itt larpers      top kek
  were you disappointed when you woke up
  and that fascistwas albert einstein
  no anyone who says otherwise is a fucking moron    at most  is describing are more explicitly communists or labor activists which had a lot of issues with the social democrats in control of germany at the time    frankly it was a mistake by the german society to allow nazism to flourish to blame this on leftwingers is a ridiculous blamepassing game though
  were they outside a cancer ward
  a 16 year old skateboarder
  i was already too woke thats why it happened
  based and dare i say redpilled as well
  checked and kekked    iron crosses arent typically red lmao
  nice i love it when edgy teens get btfo
  at most   is describing are more explicitly communists or labor activists    thats what antifa was anon the communist parties goons not only were they starting streetfights they tried to stage a coup in 1919
  based and redpilled
if you fight them and you are successful in crushing them you harm them  if you fight them and fail at crushing them they are emboldened with victory    the sa were better fighters than the antifa and so helped the nsdap cause
  reeeeeeeeee only leftists are allowed to riot and form paramilitary gangs  cry more antifa
helped it less than doing nothing
  what town
  helped hitler even mentions how without them the nazis would have faded
  conservative christians are now considered leftists  antifa was an umbrella term for antifascists with people from all over the political landscape including conservative christians
  so why was oswald mosely a failure after getting his ass kicked
  nice meme the sparticus uprising began in response to conservative christians im sure there were some conservative christians that actively opposed the nsdap prior to 1933 but they were far from the bulk of the guys on the frontlines waving their shitty little flags and hammers
  no it was the communist militia group the hammer and sickle flags and kpd logo in ops picture should have tipped you off to this the german communist party created antifa to be their new goons after their previous one the alliance of red front fighters was banned they fought christian conservatives as well btw    fuck off revionist tard
  because mosley was in a country at active war with nazi germany
  europe needs to go back to before christianity fucked us over sure its going to hurt but then again so does treating a cancer christianity and its offspring the enlightenment have to go away if we want to return to our roots
  gets murdered without even the decency of a showtrial or kangaroo court to keep up the appearance that you care about procedure and ruleoflaw    this is why fascist suck      antifa  antifascist  i didnt know the only people who could oppose fascism were leftists  unless you consider american liberals to be leftists
  ar roots  fuck off
  the sparticist uprising was in 1919 and was a direct response to the fact that germany was led into a meatgrinder conflict    the fact that the guys who ordered the uprisings put down the german social democrats were later unfairly blamed as part of the stab in the backmyth is kind of ironic
      i didnt know the only people who could oppose fascism were leftists   you consider american liberals to be leftists  its their meme term not mine    and the spd was working with von hindenberg and the freikorps
  you dont like the patriot act so you hate patriotism  this is the brilliant meme argument you are making now anon kill yourself
  because mosley was in a country at active war with nazi germany  mosely gets the shit kicked out of him in 1936 3 years before ww2 and when britain wasnt hostile to mussolini

  to blame this on leftwingers is a ridiculous blamepassing game though  be weimar republic   rightwingers chimpout and assassinate 300 government officials including the including the foreign minister  most are given slap on the wrist sentences  industrialists who fund rightist groups simply shrug when called out on the fact that these groups nearly destroyed their own government  rightwingers who carry out these murders get slap on the wrists sentences few get life or are murdered prosecutions for the far smaller number of leftist assassinations of government officials is much harsher  even the spd uses rightwing goons to kill communist rivals and help prop up progerman puppet states in the east to check the soviets  spd/conservativeliberal governments continue to build up the black reichswehr groupings in violation of the versailles treaty because they want a stick to beat the french poles or soviets with if they need to  the groups that make up this near million man paramilitary operation are all extreme rightist groups that crosspollinated with the nazis and viceversa  hitler didnt even when a majority was placed in power by conservatives who thought they could control them  bro the nazis have taken over the government how could this have happened (((  anyone who thinks that punching nazis caused hitler to rise to power is a complete brainlet it seems more plausible given the deep roots of farright antirepublican forces that militant opposition probably delayed the nazi rise to power by a few years
  win
  north korea calls itself a democratic republic so clearly democratic republicans are going to support them
    spd  thats the social democrats i was talking about they were blamed as part of that whole shitty stab in the back myth its really quite ironic i think
  sothis is the average reaction of the death cultists from the desert
  rathenau was assassinated 3 years after the sparticist uprising
  antifa was more or less established in 1932 before then it would be wrong to call it antifa as there were antifasicst movmentts but they werent antifa proper

  did you remember to put the lid back on the trash can
  no like always dipshit liberal and conservative moderates that think of fascists as a nonforce that are easy to control as useful idiots brought hitler to power like they bring to power fascists basically everytime
    of course they did only the historically illiterate retards and tankies in this thread think otherwise the countries in europe that saw the worst of the marxist and anarchist agitations such as italy germany and romania gravitated towards fascism because of the fear that only the fascists could stop them and restore order
  antifascists with people from all over the political landscape including conservative christians  lmao no it was always a communist group and still is back in 1920s people who began calling and identifying nazis as fascists were the communist simple conservatives called them simply by their name nazi and some naive still believed it was democratic movement  communists needed a simpler categorization for all people who are reactionary toward communist movement and mussolinis fascism took that mantle  antifa in 1930s were fighting not just nazis but also dnvp members/voters and even moderate christian democrats from zentrum some even fough spd voters  this case wasnt particular to germany but also italy spain and france maybe uk but its mostly because they were on labour leash    youre incredibly naive if you think group antifascists were simply collection of all people who were simply against fascism and not pushing their own communist/ancom agenda while killing innocents just like the nazis
  is this you
  because he backed down i dont necessarily think that he would have done better by letting his party get into a street fight with the communists and the cops but marching the other way was the worst possible option
  pick a fight with people who are better at this than you  whine when you get rekt
  are you talking about antifa fighting nazis or nazis fighting slavs
  these are murders of government politicians/officials in the weimar republic not casualties of street fights/battles the facts are that the right was practically at war with its own government in the late teens and early 20s
  im glad theres still a place in society where mediocre white men can thrive
  they created the brown shirts    
  the facts are that the right was practically at war with its own government in the late teens and early 20s  and rightfully so

name a better historical aesthetic than this you literally cant
  minoan
  mycenaean was a direct line continuence of the minoan civilisation regathering itself post santorini eruption
  two caliphates werent enough
    big tiddies are the best historical aesthetic    cant argue with that
  easy
just look at that fucking ratio
  german anything  aesthetic  no thanks
  southrons   talking shit

  battle fursuits
  ancient egypt has a pretty nice aesthetic going on long dark hair white sheer flowey dresses lots of jewellery

  meds move north and colonize most of the continent  even after centuries they never integrated into the local culture maintaining their own and at best adopting certain local aspects  germs move south and conquer the med  within a few generations theyve fully embraced local culture and abandoned their dumb barbar ways  really makes you think
i wish civilisations tried to integrate their designs in more with nature its one thing i think humans really dropped the ball on nature and gardens are so integral to human happiness and psychology but cities have largely always been completely artificial stone and then steel spaces
  paronella the place that laputa is based on shows how aesthetic it is to let classical architecture to be completely overrun with nature
  is there a pattern behind why some cultures become tiddy cultures and some dont
  yea great make habitat for insects all around you totally wont be annoying
  if a culture came from somewhere warm but not a burning hot desert clothing tended to be kept to a minimum
  imagine a bunch of these fat fucks waddling across a battlefield towards each other
  integration is submission the whole of human existence is driven by the yearning for total selfsufficiency the übermensch will have no need for gardens companionship ground to walk on food to eat or air to breathe
any native culture with perpetually exposed or nearlyexposed pusy
  you have to be smart about it  make habitat for insect predators as well and overall you get less insects than with no gardens at all
  looks comfy

  it is inaccurate that armor was used on chariots by mucenaean greeks who didnt use tridents in war and who didnt use that type of helmet
  hey this would make a good meme
  thats wrong
  nope
  they didnt have to waddle they had chariots and horses to carry them and slaveboys to turn them around and point them at the enemy

  how so
  are there exceptions to these
  grman aesthethics reached their peak during the 30 years war and most of it came from meds anyway so cry harder your shit looks lame as fuck both imperial and wwii
  the selknam and yamana live in really cold southern chile but were practically naked they rubbed their bodies with whale oil to keep warm or would wrap themselves in a fur blanket but often they wore almost nothing the purepecha in mexico lived in a temperate pine forest region with frost but the women had only mini skirts and a small garment covering only the shoulders the men wore robes and jackets though

anyone want to give coloring this a shot    i can post pics of all the gear bdus rifles apc for reference
    ditto
  trench warfare was more predictable than todays wars which are mainly insurgencies and you never know when and from where the enemy would strike although the constant shelling would be maddening and going over the top would be hell i couldnt even imagine how it would feel to charge over the top at the somme after a solid week of shelling the german positions only to find the wire uncut midway
  no dude maybe in a temperate climate with little to no rainfall but the trenches were disgusting cold and constantly wet     gangrene cholera and yellow fever were huge issues    maybe they would have been better with proper construction and planning but with their limited resources for moving those types of supplies and workers i doubt it would have been possible

why wasnt madagascar inhabited until the 6th century bce and how come the bantus and austronesians decided to settle on this island at the same time 
  austronesians probably brought the bantus to madagascar from east africa or maybe arabs brought the bantus
   crops from indonesia like bananas appeard way early then that in africa suggesting that they made contact far earlier
  but ive read the bantus migranted to madagascar from mozambique
the island was originally inhabited by pygmies then the austronesians came then the swahili

hurr ww2 could have been avoided if versailles was properly enforced weimar hyperinflation is a nazi myth    how fucking delusional is this faggot he cant possibly be serious     but of course his sheeple fanbase will gobble it all up yet again just like the forced hotzendorff pseudmemes    it was versailles above else which made ww2 possible in the first place
  weimar hyperinflation was german myth   yes because the central government completely fucked up the situation hence why stressman could fix it so easily
versailles was less harsh than what germans imposed on french in 1871 so yeah versailles made it possible but only because it was too lenient
when did it start being not okay to kill people en masse or commit anti human rights inb4 human rights 
  just be an ally of the usa and theyll let it slide
wwii put a damper on things     now we have to pretend war isnt inherently cruel
  it is okay as long as the media tells you it is the us and its allies have been constantly killing or causing/getting others to start a war and kill plenty of countries dont give a fuck about human rights china has camps they send undesirables to for example
  since the international declaration of human rights duh  dumb okadafag
  the enlightenment    though you could make a good case that it never really stopped being okay now you just have to hide it behind a semilegal veneer

 continent is swept by an unprecedented wave of nationalist fervor   the nation is conceptualized as an eternal transcendent truth seeking rebirth   associated movements promote authoritarianism to achieve those nationalist goals   socioeconomic issues are sidelined as necessarily subordinate at best outright divisive at worst   eventually the leader of a specific country comes to dominate the scene when it comes to geopolitics   said leader promotes the supremacy of his own people as a precondition to the full fulfillment of the nationalist project   his government enacts extremely destructive policies launching a devastating war in the region and murdering minorities with gas    thats european fascism for you not im actually talking about baathism literally everything about baathism  its inspirations its ideology its politics its history  aligns with that of fascism only it took place around 50 years later is baathism really just arab fascism with saddam hussein as its most instantly recognizable figurehead
  is baathism really just arab fascism    last horse crosses the finish line
  yes
  she asked no question
in regards to europe    people were bored and had crucial agencies cut off to them to further true human development mass state faciliated access to psychadelic drugs

since this board is constantly flooded with holocaust threads more than the mississippi river i thought id mix things up a bit with one about the forgotten holocaust    i guess just go ahead and post anything about nazi germanys persecution of the romani and sinti peoples before and during wwii relevant legislation written accounts diaries interviews films and books specific actions and massacres perpetrators noteworthy victims and survivors its up to you    inb4 holocaust denial autism    please keep that shit on /pol/ or in jewish holocaust threads at least i would just like to see one decent thread on this subject
yeah but its gypsies who cares
  qt on the left
  no one cares about gypsies
please keep that shit in jewish holocaust threads at least     why encourage people to bring denial shit to jewish holocaust threads
ill try op    some videos mostly testimony    3hour testimony from julia lentini sinti and roma survivor     4hour testimony from wellesina mccrary sinti and roma survivor     keep your audio down theres a very large beep tone at the beginning of these     theres a significant amount of roma testimony at various museum sites but what is digitized is not always in english or with english subtitles    short interview with lina jackson sinti and roma survivor on her camp liberation     hour long talk porrajmos the romani and the holocaust with ian hancock 
according to eyewitness mrs de wiek anne frank a notable jewish holocaust victim is recorded as having witnessed the prelude to the murder of romani children at auschwitz i can still see her standing at the door and looking down the camp street as a herd of naked gypsy girls were driven by to the crematory and anne watched them going and cried    it hurts to merely imagine what was going through her head bros
  because theres plenty of jewish holocaust threads to diffuse that autism into and still have a decent discussion    your logic doesnt follow at all i can count on 1 hand the amount of threads about the holocaust in the past years that have had decent discussion which does not almost immediately devolve into holocaust denial and thats if include threads where half of it was holocaust deniers and the other half people ignoring it only 1 in recent memory without denial taking over it within a few comments at most
    because theres plenty of jewish holocaust threads to diffuse that autism into and still have a decent discussion    we almost never discuss the porajmos so the denialist bullshit will undoubtedly be worse here    also forgot to caption german troops round up romani in asperg badenwürttemberg germany in may 1940
rare photos taken of gypsies by german soldiers the exact dates and nature of the photos is unknown but since photos of roma during wwii are exceedingly rare outside of medical experiments and occasionally roundups very interesting to see     article is a good read too though i never thought about how many people out there may have holocaust memorabilia collections with photos or objects that the public should see
  and i forgot the photo
  gypsycaust didnt happen but it should have
    a lot of the photos of einastgruppen killings which included many romani victims were also taken by german soldiers for personal albums very few were taken for official use this was prohibited but that didnt stop them theres probably loads of photographs like these that were either destroyed by their cameramen after the war realizing the incriminating nature or sitting around in someones albums unopened for 70 years
  dude most people cheer when they hear about gypsies being persecuted
  a herd of naked gypsy girls were driven by to the crematory  i get the feeling the krauts just stripped victims naked for the sake of humiliation
  its for a few reasons though im sure humiliation played a part sometimes    they would use the clothing of victims to give to other prisoners or if it was something nicer send it to germany they could also reuse fabric for the war effort    if theyre going to be burned you dont want fabrics/metals/etc in there because it makes it more difficult could produce different types of fumes     for some of the mass shootings where they mass buried people they wanted them stripped so that it was less likely anyone could identify them if the bodies were discovered
  morbidly interesting i never knew that
  huh never saw the right side of this photo before looks like 2 kids and a man and something else    also oh im sure theres lots of photos well either never see or will only see years down the line if they manage to make their way to auction though a lot of sites crack down on selling these so its getting harder
    the victims were usually stripped naked while in a dressing room just outside the gas chamber so youre probably right    also    i remember one set of twins in particular guido and ina aged about four one day mengele took them away when they returned they were in a terrible state they had been sewn together back to back like siamese twins their wounds were infected and oozing pus they screamed day and night then their parentsi remember the mothers name was stellamanaged to get some morphine and they killed the children in order to end their suffering    youd think it wouldve occurred to one of the inmates who was on the verge of snapping to steal a scalpel and stab the bastard to death
korkoro is worth watching its a film about a group of gypsies in rural vichy france who are taken under the wing of a small towns mayor and his assistant they forge residential papers for the group and buy them a home to help them avoid the laws regarding travelers instated by the vichy regime it has an unnecessary subplot involve a white french orphan who wants to join the group but other than that great film about an underrepresented topic    trailer 
  robert dawson has collected a number of the privately taken photos of roma executions over the yearsmost of them were lined up and killed on the side of the roads and in forests when they were found    heres a group unbeknownst to them waiting to be killed
  a different group killed
  a group lined up in lithuania who will be shot they have no idea i dont know if it makes it better for them or worse to be found lined up presumably being told they want your photo and then to be killed in compared to what happened with other mass shootings where you would have time to chew on what was going to happen to you
  that doesnt make for a good story though and how can you raise hundreds of millions of  to catch villians if you say they are dead
  the man who took the photo titled it resettling gypsies in the woods then notes on the back that they were killed minutes later

    there were romani in poland
  too lazy to load more but here     gallery 1 has all the sub galleries related to the romani holocaust
  yep in 1939 there was an estimated population of 50000 roma in poland
    how many survived
    meant for     im a fucking retard
  low estimates in poland are 8000 dead higher estimates are 35000 dead so anywhere from around only 30 to 85 survived    the estimates for the romani genocide are especially varied because not all of them were ever recorded in a specific population census and some of them may not have stayed in poland or any particular country for the duration even if they were also many romani were simply killed in groups on the road or in woods with few or no survivors left to report their death     to quote wikipedia on the estimates    in a 2010 publication ian hancock stated that he agrees with the view that the number of romanies killed has been underestimated as a result of being grouped with others in nazi records under headings such as remainder to be liquidated hangerson and partisans he notes recent evidence such as the previously obscure lety concentration camp in the czech republic and ackovics revised estimates of romani killed by the ustaše as high as 80000100000 these numbers suggest that previous estimates have been grossly underrepresented
the most tragic thing about porajmos is that the gypsies had only been freed from slavery in the 1860s so less than a century after people stopped legally classing them as livestock they end up slaughtered wholesale by a bunch of autistic retards
    the fact shes able to put on a semidefiant face after the ordeal of a place like auschwitz is fascinating and worthy of admiration in its own right    also what does the z next to her prisoner number stand for
  way to many
  z is for zigeuner the equivalent of gypsy in german
memorial sculpture at lety one of the camps used almost exclusively for romani prisoners the site of the camp today is a pig farm and the spot where another romani concentration camp stood nearby is a hotel despite eyewitness testimony and documentary evidence only 1 of the 3 men tried for crimes at letywhich included the killing of almost 300 romani childrenwas ever found guilty but his 10year sentence was later lifted and he was simply exiled from czechoslovakia instead
    is it a racial slur or simply the german translation for romani      the site of the camp today is a pig farm and the spot where another romani concentration camp stood nearby is a hotel    jesus christ    was this supposed to be an insult or are the locals just that apathetic
  was this supposed to be an insult or are the locals just that apathetic    i think its less a deliberate insult and more who cares and not wanting to be reminded especially since its been suggested and i would say proven in at least the cases of some local guards who were acquitted because the survivors who testified to their torture and murder of prisoners had a criminal record before the war that local police and officials cooperated with the camps operations     there have been a few books about lety and nearby camps and they stirred up controversy in the area due to content regarding the apathy and sometimes cooperation of the locals both before and after liberation in a lot of cases romani survivors especially in areas with a high percentage of deaths would/will only speak if they can be anonymous for fear of reprisals the lety memorial has been occasionally vandalized    at some point the european union asked the czech government to get rid of the pig farm they agreed to buy out the farm and destroy it but then backed off due to public protestsmostly by extreme nationalistswho suggested the only reason romani wanted the pig farm removed was to get money from the government and that its presence had no impact on romani peoples lives      depends on who you ask some romani consider it a slur particularly since the root of the word supposedly comes from a greek word meaning untouchable and it was generally used in a derogatory way by the nazis others use it themselves
  ah 
testimony of people who worked or went to the lety camp    physician jan neuwirth    absolute malnutrition filth and an infestation of vermin and therefore i immediately contacted josef janovský and demanded that he increase the amount of nutrition provided as i personally am convinced the gypsies are receiving moldy potatoes to eat and cabbage that is just as moldy  janovský excused his behavior by claiming he did not have enough supplies for those interned but i myself saw in his office crates of artificial fat and preserved bacon and i also heard from other gendarmes  that janovský was sending the groceries that were supposed to be given to the gypsies to the authorities in prague    františek malík who worked at lety     in the barracks it was so cold that the ink in the inkwell was frozen by morning the prisoners were supposed to be given coal for their barracks as per a directive issued by the district authority  janovský however kept that coal and doled out   a very fractional amount of it to the prisoners sometimes he would not give them any the prisoners were terribly cold and therefore walked into the nearby forest for firewood and kindling
  františek patočka who was sent to investigate during a camp epidemic    the gypsy children except for the newborns and the youth who were capable of work were separated away from their parents into two big barracks where on bunks covered with moldy straw most of them were left to their fate approximately three times a day a gypsy woman brought them a pot of some sort of food which she distributed along the edge of the bunkbeds the meals for the gypsy offspring were rather more like a very miserable feeding time in a zoo most of the children were wearing just a shirt that was falling apart while some were absolutely naked the only bedcover for the herd of children was a large piece of canvas sail which was not enough to cover them all they pulled it back and forth among themselves not just with their hands but also with their teeth in order to ascertain the actual state of the hygiene beneath the canvas i removed it entirely the very first thing that i became aware of to my horror were the little corpses of other children lying there the second maybe even more horrible thing was the look of the children who were in agony some of them with fever i can recall absolutely clearly to this day that the image i beheld exceeded even the most tremendous description of hell in terms of the horrors i saw there    but as physician františek kopecký noted nothing was ever done in regards to health no medicine or medical staff were provided save for a single camp doctor despite his orders for supplies any transportation orders he gave for people to be sent to hospitals for better care were cancelled     for further reading black silence the lety survivors speak is a compilation of survivor testimony translated into english there is also a book by markus pape which goes further into the claims that the local czech government and civilians knowingly assisted in the romani genocide but i dont think its been translated
  found this interesting quote in regards to papes book which should give a better idea of the contentious nature of lety and its implications the quote is byastonishingly jan ruml czech minister of the interior who spoke to a public crowd near the lety site    according to the most trustworthy documents the nazis did not order an extermination camp in lety it was to be only a transit station on the road to auschwitz lety was changed to an extermination camp by the czech guards with the support of the czech protectorate ministry of the interior  and it was an extermination camp in every way
does anyone know of any novels that deal with the porajmos any age range im just curious to see whats out there
gypsy girls being humiliated by germans and romanians
  i wonder if they shot them after
    hopefully
  jan neuwirth  františek malík      františek patočka  františek kopecký    these names dont sound very german
  no one said they were 
  probably
    wait so was the camp part of the nazi concentration camp system or was it run parallel to it like how the romanians killed thousands of jews completely independently of germany
  it was set up by nazis as a transit camp en route to auschwitzs family gypsy camp which was eventually liquidated and the nazis pur local czechs in charge of the operations
  the color of smoke a novel by menyhert lakatos    a fictionalized novel based on the authors experiences as an adolescent romani during wwii one of the few novels about romani genocide experiences written by a romani author    the extra by kathryn lasky    about a teenage gypsy and her family who are imprisoned in a roundup the daughter is chosen by leni riefenstahl along with dozens of other gypsies to be an extra in a film she is making vaguely based on the experiences of rosa winter    settelas last road by janna eliot    a fictionalized novel based on the real experiences of settela steinbach a young gypsy girl captured in one of the most prominent photos of roma during the holocaust she along with her mother two sisters two brothers aunt 2 nieces and nephew were killed in the gas chambers in july 1944     gypsy tears loving a holocaust survivor by cora schwartz    a fictionalized novel based on the authors reallife experience as a wife to a romani holocaust survivor     the eighth sin by stefan kanfer    a novel about a romani survivor who immigrates to new york city with the help jewish survivors who want to give him a fresh start on life     the painted bird by jerzy kozinski    about a young romani boy who is abandoned by his parents and has to survive through the mercy or lack thereof of strangers in the places he wanders through
    of these ive only read the extra i dont know that id recommend it because lasky took major liberties with the timeline and i dont understand the point of writing about a historical topic if youre going to do something like that although the romani extras in the actual film worked from fall 1940 until spring 1941 the characters talk about being sent to extermination camps which didnt begin operations until december 1941and romani themselves were not sent to extermination camps until a year after that i dont know why she didnt just stick with work camps which were awful and usually resulted in death themselves
  people dont care about the porajmos because gypsies are much more hated than jews even though mass murder was taking it too far no one feels any sympathy for them whereas people before and after the war have jewish friends and neighbours that they get along with gypsies tend to be openly hostile to anyone outside of their community and almost all interactions people have with them are negative
    how did he collect them did he buy them
  he buys them at auctions mostly from what ive read a lot of them hes donated digitally to museums as well
    what are the red arrows supposed to be pointing at
  both the camp was planned out and opened by the nazi government but they staffed it with locals     what the minister of interior means specifically is that the nazis intended to have most of the prisoners survive lety until they could be sent to auschwitz to be killed or put to more labor but most of the czechs in charge of lety were like nah lets starve and freeze these people including hundreds of children and not provide them any medical care like when the nazis are sending in a literal microbiologist to figure out why everyone keeps dying at your transit camp to auschwitz youve fucked up
      were these ethnic czechs or czech citizens of german descent
  im glad they are dead
  almost entirely ethnic czech people i want to say frederich sowa who wasnt specifically in charge of lety but acting chief of the protectorate police was german or of german descent but im not 100 sure on that    ironically the only czech who was actually sentenced to prison for involvement in the romani camps was a romani man whose entire family was gassed at auschwitz he who was a guard at hodonin and a stubendienst room orderly in charge of making sure all the barracks were clean at the gypsy family camp in auschwitz
    thats not very nice
  tfw novellalength fanfictions of confederate soldiers saving pregnant anne frank are an almost daily occurrence while this girl is almost totally ignored    can we get just one greentext about poor lil settela steinbach being saved
  no because people who write that sort of autistic trash should burn in hell
  well i had totally forgotten that movie thanks    
  its a good one depressing ending of course
    you didnt take a job as a guard or kapo or stubendienst or cook or messenger etc etc you were assigned the position and if you rejected it you nothing pleasant would happen assigning these jobs to prisoners was a way to 1 save ss personnel from being spread too thin and 2 demoralize the victims by turning them against each other and in certain casesas with kaposmaking it part of the job description to be ruthless was a failsafe so the nazis didnt have to worry about dissent fail at your job as a kapo demoted and at the mercy of the new kapo and all the prisoners you used to be higher than stubendienst were lower than kapo but if you failed to instill order and apparent cleanliness in the room it was your ass on the line    also if you had any sort of position in the camp hierarchy you were given access to actual food warm clothing and room with a bed away from the other prisoners which could range from a literal private room to at least a room with real bunk beds that had mattresses and blankets not to mention little stoves for heat compared to starvation rations going through bitter winters in summer clothing and sleeping with a dozen plus people crammed in a long haystrewn wooden bunk crawling with lice and fleas
  do it again bomber harris
  sounds like they could have undressed the dead bodies or cut the fabric off but they decided not to because the humiliation/intimidation would be an added effect they wanted thinking about this is a glimpse into the mind of a savage
  sounds like they could have undressed the dead bodies or cut the fabric off but they decided not to because the humiliation/intimidation would be an added effect they wanted    undressing dead bodies was very difficult it was höss i think ill have to check someone who detailed about the trials and errors of the early gas chambers and one of the difficulties was getting clothes off corpses the nudity in auschwitz was also a way to ease people into the gas chambers with promises of showers or being deloused which made rioting and difficulties less likely though they still happened when/if people figured out the lie    while nazis did certainly humiliate people through nuditythink of prisoners made to stand naked for hours in some camps roll calls in addition to sexual assaults rape and the general dehumanization that occurs when you first people to be nudein the case of gassing and mass killings being naked was more so about efficiency in my opinion    at death camps for instance the clothes would all be piled up while the people were inside dying then the sorters could start going through it right away no need to wait for an hour or 90 minutes to go into the chamber drag all the bodies out with difficulty and time undress all the bodies then sort the clothes and go through them
    rude
  settelas last road by janna eliot    has anyone read this one got a tldr worth a read
  since this board is constantly flooded with holocaust threads more than the mississippi river  is the mississippi river known for holocaust threads
    it would be among the less toxic things you find in that river
    dont tell me the germans stole the poor ladys shoes too
  these probably arent gypsies theres a discarded rifle and helmet down there
  its some weird way of watermarking shit you see it a lot on private collector photos
  heres a group unbeknownst to them waiting to be killed    how can you tell
  i live in belgiumin a village near the french/luxemburg borderand reacenlty 2 large gypsie families moved in  one from portugalthe other from serbia  so what happened was that 2 groups of gypsies started a clan war  like they always do
      according to     massacre notice old people being carried off on carts and the absence of men because they were digging the graves the back of the photo identifies it as thüringen germany but no massacre is recorded there of course gypsies were rarely recorded as they were mostly killed at the side of the road    so basically its assumption of the guy who put it online based on pretty weak evidence given that historiography does not confirm mass shootings of gypsies at that location or anywhere in germany proper to my knowledge they were transported to auschwitz i dont think it depicts a massacre probably just a gypsy caravan in the forest
  yeah thats what i meant efficiency of the killing process was prioritized over anything else with people being seen as simply objects to be processed
  too many    t greek
    the stiffening the of the bodies wouldve made recovering clothing extremely difficult if not impossible in many cases
  weak evidence    the trouble with the romani genocide as is the problem with most of the einsatzgruppen and similar mass killings is that most of it was just not written down there are only a handful of romani genocide memoirs in some places the populations were so wiped out that there werent people left to tell the story so you have to extrapolate information based on an educated guess    its definitely easy to see the photo either way group of gypsies sitting in clumps general lack of men other people in the distance leaving easy to think based on the information we have about other romani massacres that it fits the bill the men are off digging a grave perhaps while the others wait behind guarded by soldiers etc yet you can also see it as germans finding the caravan ordering them to sit down and taking photos because it was interestingor because they were told to scope out gypsy populations in the area or because the guys mom is interested in gypsies and wanted to see some etc etc    i think dawson is assuming massacre because the romani genocide is his focus so theres some bias there although just because there was no massacre recorded there doesnt mean that no one was killed there the mass shootings were not as documented as the gassings there were some liqudations of jewish populations near this area and what little we do know about the massacres of the romani shows they were sometimes killed in prelude to the jews either because the killers were combing the area especially forests and country roads or to get the executioners in the mindset of viewing the victims as not human
any noteworth accounts of romani being hidden away/protected by sympathetic neighbors or they even more at the mercy of the mob than the jews
this is perhaps a stupid question but are the porajmos considered separate from the holocaust or are they seen as concurrent with each other
  i cant think of or find manyc ases most romani were outsiders who kept to themselves whereas at the least jewish victims could be considered neighbors and friends the cases where ive read about romani being protected tend to be people who were living in villages usually along with extended family who had lived there for at least 12 generations rather than traveling romani       elina holomková a czechroma along with her parents and her brothers were protected from deportation by the mayor of the village their family lived and worked in her parents were able to hide a 3 year old niece in their home until the end of the war and elina herself had to go into hiding at a relatives home in order to escape forced sterilization     zoni weisz was saved by a dutch policeman who pushed him onto a passenger train while he and his family were awaiting deportation to a transit camphe later hid in plain sight with his aunt
    i take it the punishment for harboring romani was similar to that of hiding jews death
    shouldnt she be wearing the striped pjs that were standard among concentration camp inmates
  no the people sent to the gypsy family camp at auschwitz were allowed to wear their civilian clothing
  tbh if youve ever been around gypsies youd want them to die too they just live in their little communes and come out trying to beg rob and steal from people and if you dont give them money they call you a racist
  gypsy family camp    she got gassed didnt she
  probably but theres no record of what happened to her the documents related to the gypsy camp are incomplete     most of the gypsies who survived the family camp were those who were lucky enough to get deported from auschwitz to concentration camps or to labor details outside of the camps such as factories farm labor etc some survivors were also wehrmacht veterans a number of romani served in the german military who were released or sent to the regular camp after the decision was made to liquidate the family camp those that remainedabout 3000 mostly women elderly men and childrenwere gassed then they combed the camp over the next few days and found children who had been hidden and gassed them too
  some survivors were also wehrmacht veterans a number of romani served in the german military    tell me more about this
  then they combed the camp over the next few days and found children who had been hidden and gassed them too
  whats forgotten about this honestly we got talked about it equally at school its just that gipsies didnt really seem to care much about it    sadly its quite like this their moving parks are fun tho
  shouldve finished the job desu
  a lot of germani roma were assimilated and didnt live a traveler lifestyle some of them had a roma mother or father others had been adopted by german parents or were from mixed germanroma families going back a few generations most if not all of them considered themselves to be german even wanted to join the hitler youth in 1942 all romani or romani hybrids were discharged from the hitler youth and of course joined the military     in 1937 it was decreed that sinti and roma could not perform active military service this was kind of ignored so in 1941 the wehrmacht high command issued a direct order that gypsies or gypsy hybrids could not perform active military service and any currently on active military service were to be immediately discharged some were literally deported to auschwitz from the front and arrived wearing their uniforms
  an account from one such man    i joined the reich labour service in 1939 and went from there to the german wehrmacht in 1940 where i served in infantry regiment 190 in the 6th army under general paulus by 1942 i had been decorated for bravery with the assault badge in silver the iron cross the medal of honour for the winter campaign and the wound badge i received a flesh wound and a lung wound and was therefore given convalescence leave in 1942    when i came home to wroclaw on leave neighbours told me that my mother and sisters had been taken away by the gestapo my twelveyearold brother and the daughter of my elder sister of the same age were also no longer there after returning from leave i told the surgeon major what happened the garrison commander senior physician and officers sent a petition to reich marshal göring    my company commander wrote to heinrich himmler and said he could not believe that i was a gypsy and he got an appointment for me at the reich security main office in berlin i was received there by kaltenbrunner i told him that one brother had already been killed in action at the russian front and that my other two brothers were also in the wehrmacht one in the antiaircraft artillery since 1937 and the other as a tank driver i also didnt know where my mother and siblings had been taken in my youthful foolishness i believed in honour and that my bravery in the war would be recognized in berlin i start to cry when i think about it now because in reality i still reproach myself today i had betrayed my two brothers in the wehrmacht and was unable to do anything for my mother and siblings    1/2
  my eldest sister was murdered in auschwitz my mother who was sent to auschwitz via ravensbrück with my secondoldest sister also didnt survive the concentration camp my little brother and the daughter of my secondoldest sister were forcibly sterilised at the age of 13 and 12 by doctors in passau in 1943 one brother was sent to auschwitz directly from the antiaircraft artillery battery at munich main station at the beginning of 1943 and was deployed in a suicide squad against russian troops at birkenau near berlin in august 1944 after liquidation of the gypsy camp which he didnt survive the other brother was dismissed from the wehrmacht as a tank driver directly following my meeting with kaltenbrunner    when i arrived back at the military hospital from the reich security main office where kaltenbrunner had told me that his office had made a mistake and everything would be sorted out for the whole family the senior physician told me that he told two gestapo officers who had just come to pick me up that i was still too ill i fled immediately after i had received my discharge papers and went into hiding in poland and czechoslovakia my brother who came home afterwards and heard about it also went underground at the end of 1942 and survived i was able to hide with a woman in poland who i married after 1945 since my race and the sections of the law according to which we sinti and jews were excluded from 1942 were not expressly stated on my discharge papers but the wound was mentioned i was always able to escape from police and ss unrecognized as a gypsy and so it was even possible for me to work at the skoda plant for a while until we were liberated by the russians on 8th may 1945
  its ignored in extreme compared to the jewish holocaust it wasnt until relatively recently that there was even a memorial to the romani victims at auschwitz and it used to only be accessible by appointment twice a day frequently roma speakers are forgotten or ignored at official remembrance events at auschwitz and otherwise at a recent nyc based united nations remembrance week roma survivor groups asked to be able to participate and they were denied    after the war the german government decreed that the forced sterilizations removal from military and other public office services murders and oppression of romani people prior to 1943 didnt count as racial hatred but instead tackling criminal problems so there was no compensation for the victims or families of victims it wasnt until the late 1970s that the german government admitted okay maybe killing groups of romani on the side of the road forcing women to become sterilized rounding them up in camps etc was racially motivated our bad compare the number of books movies etc about the romani genocide to the jewish holocaust and so on when it is mentioned outside of niche specific material its often a throwaway mention nazis also persecuted gypsies the disabled etc     theres a pig farm on the site where almost 300 romani children were abused to death via neglect and starvation where women were raped by czech guards where people froze and starved and died from terrible diseases to the point that even the nazis were like fuck bro whats going on and sent people to try to find out what was going on protests to have the pig farm removed are consistently met with counterprotests from czech nationalists who claim it was just a labor camp for criminals and that gypsies are trying to incite racial hatred between czechs and romani by not wanting a site where czech politicians deliberately abused their people to death to be filled with pig shit
  based
    sure is a sharplooking fellow nothing like the stereotypical dirty or raggedlylooking gypsy
  one of hitlers drivers who was nonactive military had a roma mother when it was discovered he was discharged from the military and forcibly sterilized and of course removed from his position as driver never was able to find out what happened to him if he survived the war etc
    hard to believe he managed to get that close to the fuhrer without someone looking into his pedigree first
  youd be surprised one of his bodyguards married a woman with jewish ancestry who had managed to hide her heritage it was only discovered after her death in the 90s when the wife mother told her grandchild about it her husband refused to accept that she was jewish though     i wonder if in the case of the driver it also has to do with the fact that the roma question was much more complicated and waffling than the jewish question it took a while for them to decide what to do especially with roma who were integrated into society
      quote from the source  massacre of gypsies photo taken by an einsatzgrupen soldier i have about a dozen from the same source copies of copies but this is the only one showing gypsies looks to me like dead russian soldiers in the distance left and in the foreground there is a red army helmet and a gun were the russian soldiers trying to protect them or did the gypsies just get caught up in a skirmish but it is an einsatzgrupen source others show massacres of jews civilians soldiers and hostages
  some were literally deported to auschwitz from the front and arrived wearing their uniforms  that makes me sad even if they are gypsies        good posts
    that woman truly has the face of an angel
  what book would you recommend covering the topic is this from the pape book above thats not translated
    for me its the mother
    were there any wealthy or powerful romani members of german society prior to the rise of the nazis as was the case with jews or were they already marginalized prior to that point    also was service in the reichswehr and early wehrmacht seen as a way for many romani to escape poverty/marginalization gain a measure of respect like it was for mischlings
  is the post you quoted from the pape book nope just a comment from me    if youre only looking to read one gypsies under the swastika is definitely a good concise history style overview black silence talks specifically about lety and the czech compliance in the romani genocide as well    gypsies under the swastika by donald kenrick and grattan puxon    a concise history of the nazi persecution of romani including the romani genocide look for the 2009 edition which has updated information based on new material    black silence the lety survivors speak by paul polansky    interviews with people who survived the lety camp controversial for its exposure of the compliance of czech police and officials in the camp     winter time memoirs of a german sinto who survived auschwitz by walter winter    winter was in the german navy he was deported from the navy then deported with his siblings and pregnant wife     a gypsy in auschwitz by otto rosenberg    rosenberg was a german sinti who along with most of his family found himself moved from work camp to work camp before being deported to auschwitz as a boy
  also was service in the reichswehr and early wehrmacht seen as a way for many romani to escape poverty/marginalization gain a measure of respect like it was for mischlings    varied from person to person once the nazi were in power many if not most were conscripted as part of the mandatory 6 months of labor service and then had to serve a mandatory term in army or navy up until they were discharged via racial laws they viewed themselves as being german just like their peers so serving was something they considered a duty/expectation as any other german albeit they had to deal with racism walter winter recounted that although he did his labor service just as ardently as anyone else he was the only one in his group not given promotions same with his time in the navy although he was a lead gunner he was not given the appropriate promotions to go along with it    some of whites uncles though voluntarily joined before conscription was mandated    i dont know of any super prominent or wealthy romani but its hard to find much information most of those who had more standard positions in german society tended to be middle class or working class walter winters brothers were both on the german national soccer team until they were removed after the nazis implemented racebased laws for national sports teams one of his brothers would become a millionaire after the war after patenting a fairground ride    on that note i definitely recommend this article about walter winter        he believes the story still needs to be told because there are plenty of people who to various degrees deny it a few years ago winter was on holiday in gran canaria when an elderly german couple asked what the number on his arm was you people are my age he said you know what it is
  and pregnant wife    she got gassed didnt she
  yep shockingly though only one of his 8 siblings died
    fuck
no holocaust denial in this thread  shocking
    its almost as if no one gives a shit about the porajmos so stormfags feel no need to strenuously deny it to justify their ideology
  some were literally deported to auschwitz from the front and arrived wearing their uniforms    any accounts of how the guards reacted upon seeing men wearing their uniforms showing up as prisoners an sstotenkopfverbände private who washed out of waffenss training because he was too fat too stupid or too lazy to make the cut and has never pointed a weapon at anything besides women and children suddenly having lifeanddeath authority over a combatseasoned wehrmacht sergeant or lieutenant sounds like the stuff of comedy
    what camp was this
just in case you guys didnt know
  replace defiance with oppression and tyrants with black people and there might be some truth to it
another porajmosrelated novel to add to the list ive been seeing this in historical fiction results for a while i didnt realize it was about the gypsy camp at auschwitz until now    helene hanneman was a german women who was imprisoned at the auschwitz family camp with her 5 children due to her marriage to a romani man she was voluntarily imprisoned as she choose to be deported with her husband and children at auschwitz she was recruited by dr mengele to join the romani camp hospital due to her profession as a nurse and she was asked to set up a school for the romani children to keep them occupied after the family camp was liquidated she was discovered hiding in the school with children including her own she was told that she would be set free if she would agree to leave her children behindto certain death she chose to die with them
  there might be some in walter winters memoir since hed served in the navy but i unfortunately dont have a copy on hand if this thread is around in a week or so i might be able to get it from the library
  rivesaltes internment/transit camp in france
  those tits on the far right  tfw no perky round breasted gypsy gf
  concurrent from everything ive read
  a civil 4chan thread  about gypsies  and the holocaust  i actually factually never ever thought thatd i live to see the day that this happened
  forgot to mention helene hannemann was a real woman the novel is a fictionalized version of what happened to her
  she was told that she would be set free if she would agree to leave her children behindto certain death  she chose to die with them
    yankees and nazism go handinhand boy
/tv/ here    any porajmos kino posting best holocaust kino btw
  i can only think of two and the violins stopped playing and korkoro korkoro is excellent    trailer 
    wow thats fucking crazy
    any info on her all i get when i research her name is the scant details of how she chose to be sent to the gas chamber with her children
  posing with them before murdering them  evil vile people germans deserve to suffer for the next ten centuries
    its already been up for 7 days might as well keep it up for another 7    if its not you can just start a new thread about it
bump
the massacre in szczurowa was the murder of 93 romani people also known as gypsies including children women and the elderly by german nazi occupiers in the polish village of szczurowa on august 3 1943 between ten and twenty families of settled romani had lived in szczurowa for generations alongside ethnic poles with whom they had friendly and neighborly relations they were integrated enough into the general community that there were several mixed marriages on august 3 1943 german police rounded up almost all the romani inhabitants of the village and transported them to the local cemetery where they were shot a list of all the victims has been preserved in the documents of the local church  on may 8 1956 local inhabitants of the village and members of local veterans associations erected a memorial stone with a suitable inscription at the site of the mass grave of the victims this became the first memorial commemorating victims of the romani holocaust in the world1 the memorial is cared for by local schoolchildren and the memory of the tragedy is part of the local historical consciousness  since 1960 romanies from tarnów have been coming to the region to honor the memory of the victims since 1996 the international romani caravan of memory travels around the tarnów region to commemorate the nazi mass murder of romanies during world war ii the main stop of the caravan is szczurowa where after a visit to the mass grave a mass is held at the local church
may hashem avenge their blood
  unfortunately it seems that no photos of her have survived nor did sheat least according to the historian who wrote the novelhave any surviving relatives    most information about her is pretty scant theres offhand sentences in a few studies on auschwitz from the 1970s through the 90shelene hannemann a german woman who was assigned to the gypsy camp kindergarten helene hannemann a german woman who asked to be transferred to the gypsy camp with her children helene hannemann who received a promise from dr mengele that her children would be saved but they were killed after hiding during the liquidation of the gypsy camp etc    ill be picking up the novel from the library maybe the author included resources that may provide more information about her
    this
    any records on her at all as a german citizen surely she would still have birth school and tax records unless the nazis destroyed birth and tax records of people they deported to concentration camps to render them an unperson    what about her husband did he survive any record of what happened to him

positive update on the lety camp site    the government years ago agreed to have the pig farm at the site of the lety camp bought out closed and demolished in place of a memorial as its been said this was stalled/reversed multiple times due to nationalist groups protesting the acknowledgement that hundreds of men women and mostly children were systematically abused to death at a czechrun camp     but it seems that common decency finally won out and in december 2017 the cabinet ratified the decision to buy out close and demolish the farm in favor of some kind of memorial it was meant to be shut down by februrary 2018 but progress was stalled the pig farm was officially transferred to the government in march 2018     no word on plans for the memorial yet though considering how controversial it was when a historian and czech president acknowledged czech complicity in the horrors of lety and previous examples of vandalism i dont think a museumstyle memorial that some are hoping for would go over well     the current czech presidentelected in january 2018 after the previous cabinets decisionis openly antiroma for what thats worth
    how bout declaring that the ground at lety shall forever remain barren as a reminder to what was lost    seems like a pretty good copout to me
  hitler had a polish driver and secretary too i mean they were germanized ruhrpolnisch but they were 100 ethnically polish
  ruhrpolnisch    whats that
    is the broken wheel supposed to represent something special
  a broken traditional romani caravan/wagon wheel
    were the romani imprisoned in lety formerly transient
  most of them yes most of the gypsies at lety were from the bohemia area enough of them died that it killed the bohemian romani language since so few that spoke it survived
gypsies are not romanian so fuck off
do we have gypsy mods or what since when /his/ love gypsies since my post was removed i should repost it i guess      oh yeah such humiliated facial expressions right here    have a grip mate they are fucking gypsies which means they probably are just prostitutes
op disgusts me acting like gypsies are some innocent victims maybe i should talk about gypsies genetics
  take care with what you post on askhistoy mate they might also delete your posts 
  different person but it refers to people who were descended from families that immigrated to ruhr in the 19th century they were primarily workersmostly minersfrom polish speaking areas so they were german nationals from polish families
  noteworthy victims  gyppos havrnt produced anything or anyone noteworthy for nearly 700 years in europe

  do you know why the porajmos are forgotten it is not because it is any less of a slaughter than the holocaust it is because gypsies are the one race in europe that repeatedly proves hitler right on them being subhumans  gypsies are roving thieves and swindlers that is it that is their work their culture their lives to poke palms and pick pockets and since they are nomads they will never contribute in any meaningful way to a community like the gull that flies over the beach shitting where it pleases so does the gypsy go around the lands to plunder   not a single person likes gypsies some will tell you that they do and that they are human too but ask them to spend the night at a gypsy camp and they will squeal like if you have stuck them with a needle only the western elite in their ivory towers shills for gypsies everyone who comes in contact with them regularly hates them and not without reason
  iktf
if there ever was a people that deserved genocide its the gypsies hitler shouldve left the jews alone and concentrated on the real menace
    rude
        any idea who this family is and what happened to them     im gonna guess since the filename says 1942 whatever fate befell them wasnt good
  höllenreiner family surprisignly    höllenreiners parents chose the middle name of their son in order to protect him from the growing threat of the nazis still he was deported to the concentration camp auschwitz on 16 march 1943 where josef mengele tortured him and his brother with cruel medicinical experiments after being taken to the other concentration camps ravensbrück and mauthausen he finally ended up in bergenbelsen him his five siblings and both parents survived the porajmos
    sad 
why call them romani romani is how they call themselves just say gypsyes
    gypsy refers to a lifestyle that of a traveler romani is the actual ethnicity
      will libraryanon come through
    no one said they were
  sorry about that so i forgot that i have a fine so i cant do interlibrary loan for winters book until i go pay it and auschwitz lullaby is checked out at all libraries as well so itll be a while longer
    do we need to crowdfund your library fine
  oh its just 10 cents but you can only pay the fine online if its more than 5 so i have to physically get to the library to pay it and the roads have been too shitty to get down there
  oh its just 10 cents but you can only pay the fine online if its more than 5    this is clearly a sign that you should buy from the library bookstore    and the roads have been too shitty to get down there    damn do you live in the middle of nowhere or something
    gypsy has oftenoffensive connotations
  auschwitz lullaby is checked out at all libraries as well    youre telling me that the one time /his/ is interested in this book on a rather obscure subject lets be honest the holocaust gets a lot more publicity someone was also interested enough to check it out
      they went to auschwitz didnt they
  i mean all 4 copies in the system being checked out is the norm for new historical novels here only 4 libraries in my state have it
  ywn gather camp guards together and gun them down with your browning
  ywn shoot the ss guards with scoped whitworths and watch the survivors scurry about like terrified rats
    also ss troops wouldnt be using brownings theyd be using mg34s mg42 or in desperate circumstances mg08s
  im referring to when american soldiers gunned down german camp guards
    oh carry on then
  that colorization
  more likely to be using zb26 or zb53 than mg08
  written accounts  youve never encountered gypsies in your life have you
    i know its pretty terrible        zb26 was meant as a light support gun concentration camps wouldve generally used heavier gpmgs capable of rapid and sustained fire ie what would be needed to kill a large number of prisoners threatening to overwhelm the guards
  only 4 libraries in my state have it    is it just that rare of a book or do you live in a flyover state
  what about that other forgotten holocaust known as the blockade by greatbritain after the end of wwi in 1919 and which made at least 700000 innocent victims men women and children  years before the official holocaust in nazi germany            maybe its not a bad idea to remember this one once in a while
  when it was discovered he was discharged from the military and forcibly sterilized and of course removed from his position as driver  i would like a link for this
    germany had food sources apart from the sea you know    also    the total blockade was lifted on 17 january 1919 when the allies allowed the importation of food under their supervision the allies requested that the german government send german merchant ships to allied ports to transport food supplies however the germans considered the armistice a temporary cessation of the war and refused believing that should fighting break out again the ships would be confiscated    weimar retardation strikes again i honestly cant believe that it had to be voted out of existence and wasnt violently overthrown much earlier
    hot
    this
  guess why
  romani  wealthy
bump
    bumping for this anons library bill
  oh its not that its rare but most libraries in my state are smaller so they dont tend to order new books right away unless theres a huge demand for them some new books pop up in 20 libraries in my state others just a few      surprisingly france didnt deport romani to auschwitz or the other death camps only to concentration camps or they were kept in french internment camps they did deport jewish people to auschwitz via rivesaltes they were sent to drancy from rivesaltes then onto auschwitz about 2200 jewish people were sent to auschwitz via rivesaltes about 50 children died in rivesalts but theres no statistics on if they were romani or not    when the rivesaltes camp closed the remaining 700 or so romani being held there were sent to saliers which only had 25 known deaths due to disease/neglect saliers was hit by aircraft fire in 1944 and in the chaos the remaining people fled so its possible they survived though its also possible that they were killed in the bombing or further air raids or were rounded up or killed otherwise before the end of the war
    f
    checked
  start shit get hit
  a few more book recommendations    the nazi genocide of the roma reassessment and commemoration edited by anton weisswendt    and i didnt realize that gypsies under the swastika was by someone who did a more comprehensive 3book study on the subject in order    the gypsies during the second world war volume 1 from race science to the camps  the gypsies during the second world war volume 2 in the shadow of the swastika  the gypsies during the second world war volume 3 the final chapter
    thanks
  no it doesnt you can say the same thing about the words jew white and black
romani being loaded onto passenger trains for deportation from asperg germany in may 1940
  they are asleep
    sleep tight little roma
    be sure you timestamp it when you get it
    is that staged or are they really carrying out a massacre on camera
  theres tons of photos of massacres from this era
    cute family desu
bump
    honestly if the germans had restricted their actions to jews and gypsies nobody would have given a shit
    but usually theyre taken just before or just after the killings rarely do you see pics of the ss in the act of actually mowing people down on camera
  why did the nazis persecute romanians i thought romania was their ally
  i have a few photos taken midexecution
  gypsies are hated in all parts of the worldand the holocaust is more importan and killed more peoplesowho cares
  sowho cares    i do
will libraryanon come through and get the book    will we ever uncover the identity of the beautiful gypsy milf in ops pic    will confederates saving pregnant settela steinbach greentexts become a thing    find out in the next bump

    chug on lil panzer
  romani    no such thing i wish revisionists would stop making up words to describe czygani aka gypsies
    rude
  your war  we gypsies  weve never gone to war    a little ironic considering all these posts about gypsy soldiers in the ranks of the wehrmacht until 1942    did any ever find their way into the ss wikipedia has mentioned that the 36th ss waffen grenadier division dirlewangers command recruited from nonjewish concentration camp prisoners so its possible that some mightve served
  no just regular navy and army
    ah
  will we ever uncover the identity of the beautiful gypsy milf in ops pic  will confederates saving pregnant settela steinbach greentexts become a thing    please make both of these happen
  based ustase
    no
  calling ustase autism based  pls
    t srb
    kek
  honestly this op nobody cares if gypsies get murdered
  unlike the jews gypsies contributed nothing to history or society and have been a constant blight in europe so i see no reason why anyone should care that a bunch of utter retards that refused to integrate to any of their host nations got shoahd
    really dude after we post about gypsies serving their fatherland faithfully and you claim they dont contribute
bumparoo
  the majority of this thread is about gypsy victims there are only a few posts actually talking about german gypsies and their contributions and it is pointed out that the majority of them had a nongypsy parent or were adopted by german parents the majority of gypsies never assimilated and you can point out a few individuals but that doesnt make up for the majority who never respected any state to begin with
fine paid books have been ordered white book will probably be here by next thursday not sure about auschwitz lullaby since all 3 are checked out currently
    you couldnt just check it out while you were paying the fine
  look like abos
  the winter book isnt at my home library its an interlibrary loan coming from a library across the state
bump
was there a bigger fucking loser than hitler  product of incest  beaten by his dad because hes a fuck up  does shit in school says he meant to lol sure  larps and does speeches to his best and only friend only demands positive feedback  rejected from art school  rejected from architecture school  draft dodger  illegal immigrant  only moment of happiness is his time in the army  blame jews for germany losing the war  total pedophile who tried to fuck his neice  have goons beat people who dont like him  cant even win a majority has to align with some fringe monarchist party  fixes the economy through bank fraud the same thing he accused jews of doing  no one wants a war but due to his edgy ideals he starts one anyways over a strip of land no less  wins only through the competence of his generals  invades the only nation that was ever friendly to germany throughout the 20s30s  gets his ass handed to them so badly he kills his dog his wife and himself    i guess i see why people worship people like him its hard not to relate to such a trainwreck of a man
western world will soon be nonwhite thanks to liberals and marxists pushing for more immigration    reap what you sow
  how is that related to shitler being a shitty human and a failure
  there is literally nothing wrong with nonwhite people i grew up in a small village and i pretty much hated everyone apart from my family who lived there lighter skin tone does not automagically make you any more of a person than others
  cry more
    
  makeamemeorg
  whats wrong with it is that they care about the interests of their own races and not those of the native whites  theyre going to want to change the country to fit their culture and to allow unlimited immigration from their home country     the only people who are truly on your side and have your interests in mind are your own ethnic group you dipshit  thats why people automatically feel trust towards those who share the features of their ethnic group  thats why more racially mixed neighbourhoods have less community trust even after accounting for income  thats why more racially mixed neighbourhoods have less charitable or community participation  thats why more ethnically heterogenous countries have less stability    once you become a majority in your ancestral homeland you will lose control of your ancestral homeland forever you will have no nation that your people control has that ever worked out well for any people in history you fucking idiot    white people need to wake up and remember the same racial consciousness shared sense of identity and ingroup preference that every other racial and ethnic group has
  ancestral homeland  white people as a homogeneous group   99 chance american
  basement dweller trying to tell me how society works  you never talked to another human being besides your mom you dont know anything
  white people need to wake up and remember the same racial consciousness shared sense of identity and ingroup preference that every other racial and ethnic group has    imagine being that much of a brainlet not to realize why this is the case
  the racial consciousness of whites is just western society with its prowhite bias   thats the reason nonwhites form their own ethnic based gatherings because they must help each other in a society that is actively hostile to them
  hitler didnt give a fuck about white people only germans who has more immigrants today germany or former soviet states
  your nose is showing
  white people need to wake up and remember the same racial consciousness shared sense of identity and ingroup preference that every other racial and ethnic group has  yea im sure those niggers in africa feel they are part of the same group go be mutt somewhere else
  99 chance youre dodging the point like a shifty little cunt     thats nothing but adhom    we all understand why this is the case it remaind a disastrous phenomenon that threatens the future of a multitude of ethnic groups     a society that is actively hostile to them  top kek time to stop pretending that its 1920 and actually look around at whats going on you idiot     im not the guy you all were responding to btw just remain astounded at how much you people squirm to try to avoid simple truths
  he became a statesman made his country good for a time and made the yids cry better to have reached the top and fallen then to have stayed at the bottom in obscurity
  dont project your own selfhatred of your jewish ancestry onto me be proud of your cut pp
  panafricanism doesnt exist and hasnt had significant impact
  made the yids cry  oh wow something really to be proud of the wholesale slaughter of innocents
  and actually look around at whats going on you idiot  lets see  everyone immediately thinks they are terrorists pedophiles misogynists stupid uneducated and filthy  police and security everywhere give them a hard time  their cvs get thrown in the trash  have a super hard time finding an apartment just because they are not white  half the people they meet automatically hate them for being brown  idiots like you exist  worst idiots than you exist that actually try to hurt/kill them    im not the one who needs to take a look around
  panafrican idea has had much less impact than paneuropean idea
  worth nothing that part of the reason is because europeans persecuted and killed panafricanists
  yes you
  everyone immediately thinks they are terrorists pedophiles misogynists stupid uneducated and filthy  who are we talking about muslim immigrants in europe   police and security everywhere give them a hard time  their cvs get thrown in the trash  have a super hard time finding an apartment just because they are not white  show me the evidence about where this happens it does not in my own nation unless of course were talking about people who are in the country illegally and if were talking about western europe explain why the native inhabitants of those countries have a duty to be accomodating to massive amounts of immigrants   half the people they meet automatically hate them for being brown  a huge exaggeration to be sure   idiots like you exist  you dont know what i think but even if i were the most virulently radical racist in the world there would still be counterparts on the other side   worst idiots than you exist that actually try to hurt/kill them  find me a western nation where immigrants are statistically more likely to be targeted by natives in violent crime than the other way around
    smaller than yours
  brown people have it really bad because of the bullshit you spread and what is sad is that you dont even realize what you are doing   i work with lots of indians in germany and they are all victims of racism to such extent that now many are thinking of leaving for the us which would be such a huge loss of talent btw
  jews consistently have a higher iq than whites   
  natives are not white you racist piece of dog shit trash everyone just trying to survive its not all about race most people dont give a fuck about race except for the psychos like you who make everything worse because youre upset a black guy has a better job than you even though youre unqualified and a shitty human so no one wants to work with you
  yes ideas that originate in places that dont have significant geopolitical influence will tend to have less geopolitical impact than ideas that originate in places that do thats moving the goal posts though it does exist just as an anecdotal example i can remember reading comment on major sporting facebook pages after france won the world cup and most of the people making the somewhat tongue in cheek comment that france was an african team were not white people saying so derogatorily it was black people with african names and in fact there were white people from europe arguing against that on basically every comment of the sort thats something of a microcosm of whats going on in the west as relates to immigration imo you wouldnt expect to be able to move to one of their nations as a white westerner and no one see you as anything other than a native but many people including some itt expect everyone in western nations to live under this massive cognitive dissonance and renounce their own identities whilst relinquishing control of the nations their ancestors built out of some sort of misguided sense of charity
  why do germans have a duty to accomodate large numbers of indians in their nation do you not believe they deserve the right of selfdetermination
  i live in the most punjabi part of canada and i can tell you that theyre all fucking awful people
    made the yids cry  captured four 4 rothschilds killed none of them and let 2 of them go    what did he mean by this
  it does exist  yet most people still identify primarily with their nations or ethnicum in case of less developed areas not with their race identifying yourself by race is colonial nonsense resulting from bringing together very distant peoples and erasing their identities while these pan ideas are just wishful thinking of elites that isnt shared by populus    expect everyone in western nations to live under this massive cognitive dissonance and renounce their own identities  you are part of this group you expect me to renounce my nation in favour of this american concept of white
  yes you
  yet most people still identify primarily with their nations or ethnicum in case of less developed areas not with their race identifying yourself by race is colonial nonsense resulting from bringing together very distant peoples and erasing their identities while these pan ideas are just wishful thinking of elites that isnt shared by populus  youre making the classic argument that i see from europeans on here all of the time that theres no such thing as race biologically untrue unless youre just arguing semantics and that recognizing it as existing means that you cant have cultural differences or national sovereignty within europe thats not what im saying at all im saying simply that importing large amounts of immigrants from around the world is a direct threat to selfdetermination of natives of a country and that this policy is something that is shared by nearly all traditionally white countries in essence im not saying that french and germans are exactly the same im saying theyre similar and that this phenomena is affecting both   you are part of this group you expect me to renounce my nation in favour of this american concept of white  nope not at all and the concept of whiteness or more succinctly a shared history and sense of commonality amongst the peoples of europe did not originate in the united states
  that theres no such thing as race  no im not im saying that people dont use it to identify themselves unless they are uprooted and exposed to large numbers of very different people    im saying theyre similar and that this phenomena is affecting both   but its not affecting for example ukrainians who are at war with a nation thats more simmiliar to them than french are to german or spanish people who have trouble keeping even more simmiliar people in their country    thats not what im saying at all im saying simply that importing large amounts of immigrants from around the world is a direct threat to selfdetermination of natives of a country  those migrants can easily be white and they will still cause simmiliar upheveal like serbs in sweden poles in britain russians in balticum or germans in czechoslovakia    and the concept of whiteness or more succinctly a shared history and sense of commonality amongst the peoples of europe did not originate in the united states  indeed current iteration was started by spaniards bullying christianized moors but the contemponary characteristics of what americans portray as wypipo eg bad cooks bad dancers bland and boring polite colonizers simply dont connect to lot of actual white people in europe its just watered down english culture
  while i might identify as white due to my european ancestry i feel i should remind you that up until around the 80s different european ethnic groups still saw themselves as separate in america i myself am a mixture of german irish french polish scottish hungarian and lebanese and every marriage in my family up until my grandparents was onlu saved from family scandal by virtue of everyone being catholic
  no im not im saying that people dont use it to identify themselves unless they are uprooted and exposed to large numbers of very different people  i agree with this assessment but i also would argue that this identifying factor is relevant useful and beneficial in the context of whats going on right now     but its not affecting for example ukrainians who are at war with a nation thats more simmiliar to them than french are to german or spanish people who have trouble keeping even more simmiliar people in their country  sure    those migrants can easily be white and they will still cause simmiliar upheveal like serbs in sweden poles in britain russians in balticum or germans in czechoslovakia  yes but theres one key difference here if i as a white american were a very convincing actor and a talented linguist i could go to essentially any western european country and not be distinguishable from the countrys natives and thats because from a genetic and physical perspective theres not a greatly significant difference between myself and a german or czech the same cannot be said if i were to travel to china or ghana people would immediately be able to recognize that i am not a native to that country and that my ancestors evolved somewhere else and theyd probably be able to guess with relative accuracy where they were from     indeed current iteration was started by spaniards bullying christianized moors but the contemponary characteristics of what americans portray as wypipo eg bad cooks bad dancers bland and boring polite colonizers simply dont connect to lot of actual white people in europe its just watered down english culture  i can understand a certain distaste for the concept from that perspective but i think youd be better served to argue against a simplistic watered down notion of it rather than to completely discard the concept
  this identifying factor is relevant useful and beneficial in the context of whats going on right now   in your country not mine    if i as a white american were a very convincing actor and a talented linguist i could go to essentially any western european country and not be distinguishable from the countrys natives  indeed looks are the most superficial aspect of ethnicity but one that cant be changed though thinking you can just switch nationality is very american thinking even in todays globalized world you would need to spend years in a country to learn all of its customs mores and memes before the act would become convincing    argue against a simplistic watered down notion of it  did you mean for more simplistic one i have distaste for fleshing out the broad concept of white race with narrow angloamerican culture which ignores that most of european peoples dont share large portions of this culture
the if only hitler listened to his generals meme was made up after the war by the wehrmacht generals to excuse them getting curbstomped
would it be correct to assume that this region of the world is as much a part of the grecoroman heritage as the western world is historically the richest and most cultured parts of those empires were in this region but theyre consistently counted as outsiders in opposition to the grecoroman world why is that how do people in the middle east feel about their ties to the greeks and romans do they embrace them or reject them
  meant to post pic related
  anatolia yes  the rest not really
  what makes you think that do you think syria the levant egypt etc had older cultural customs that were too powerful to be changed and persist more strongly to this day than what they received from the greeks or romans or would you rather say theyve been too thoroughly arabized
  anatolia was pretty much greek heartland   the others werent as strongly hellenized
  pretty much all of western turkeys  all of north africas economies depend on continues trade with the european union tunisians and libyans embrace their historical greek  roman sites but have been way more influenced by ottoman politics and history    so economically the region is very much tied to the western world but culturally only on a superficial level films music but thats it
  centuries of being part of multiple caliphates  the ottoman empire pretty much faded all grecoroman influence away plus the fact that until very recently almost all of the population was illiterate
  before the roman empire lost those lands yes  after it was taken over by muslims no way

shakushains revolt and shays rebellion are two wars i find really really interesting and i end up digging into them with more passion than i do either world war
  the sinovietnamese war
the austrailianamerican war
   
i dont have any specific conflicts to bring up but i share this sentiment op smaller wars are generally more interesting to me because individual people machines places etc matter more in them im sure there were many extremely talented lowranking officers in ww2 who performed excellently but due to the sheer scale of the war had little impact but these small wars one talented person whether they be a general or an inventor or even just a regular soldier or pilot can change the course of the entire conflict
viking ireland specifically the wars surrounding the rise of the dál gcais prior to brian boru becoming high king  like something out of an anime desu

t ukrainian
who would win in a one on one fight bare knuckles
  stalin was just as bad    no
  ukrainian  no such thing
  stalin just didnt give a fuck about you and subjugated you    hitler wanted to exterminate your people except maybe keeping some of your hottest women as breeding sows for his power fantasy wish fulfillment brigades     stalin was just a psychopath hitler was also an autistic incel to boot    t grandpa got sent to siberia for fighting in the legion but actually survived and came back
  bank robber vs artist
  ex solider vs fat jew who had a weak arm
  both are manlets but hitler has 4 inches on him
  hitler wanted to exterminate your people    myth not history your claims are debunked by millions of holocaust survivors
  hitler had 10cm in height on stalin though neither was much of a fighter but both had taken part in combat
  oh ok you delusional faggot    keep glorifying the people whose whole political platform rested on taking your land from your people
  stalin fought in the revolution and spent many years in prison sometimes escaping
  ukrainian   
    lmao this hitler was a pussy but he could beat up that georgian manlet no problem at all like that episode of south park where cartman beats up the midget
  yeah right thats why ukrainians welcomed germs as liberators initially but in the end millions fought for partisans and red army while only like 100k ukrainians fought for nazis maybe it has something to do with millions of civilians getting killed tortured enslaved and raped and having biggest percentage lost in ww2 after belarus
  stalin was a jew
  whole political platform rested on taking your land from your people    actually my land was stolen by the communists my great grandfather was imprisoned in a concentration camp and then forced to fight for communists    then the very people he fought with shot him and fucked him over
stalin unites ukrainians under one border for the first time ever  hurrr stalin was bad and shit for trying to stop a famine and stop hitler
  yes he was and was as evil as the other guy there is no one was better or less evil or something they drowned hundreds of millions of people in misery they fucked up a large portion of the planet
  the nazis would have done the same except they would have also shot or deported everybody else in your family and taken the prettiest girls to be sex slaves to their soldiers
  being a tankie  cringe
citing holodomor    jesus christ dude you would think after like 70 years of this being debunked as nazi propaganda you would have given this meme up that every academic doesnt take seriously at all
  everyone but tankies accepts it  bbut insert fringe marxist professor here wrote a paper on why it didnt happen
   but tankies accepts it  accepts it as what as genocide of khokhols yeah far from everyone
  its funny cause ukraine is only relivent because of stalins industrialization and killing of kulacks
  ukrainian    no such thing
  lmao go ahead and jump through hoops to suggest that it was either man made and not technically a genocide as if massmurder is any morally better or that it was somehow not manufactured and subsequently covered up when it blatantly fucking was
    never happened
  tankies and useful idiots get the bullet too
  my fucking granduncle died in the holocaust you dipshit
  lol  next youll say the katyn massacre wasnt done by nazis
  stalin unites ukrainians under one border for the first time ever  typical stalinite revisionist taking credit for lenins achievements
  which katynn massacre there was more than one
  the one you are going to blame on the nazis shortly
  tankies    youre the one spouting khrushchevite propaganda you fucking tankie
  denying the holodomor  laughable
  who fought in a war longer than hitler did personally killed many people robbed banks led armies personally took a city many thought would be unable to fall due to its location tsaritzyn/stalingrad/fuck volgagrad  muscular   vs   literal fucking autist with shrimpy arms sat in trenches cant command armies and had spastic fits whenever anything didnt go his way not to mention a biological lack of testosterone from a destroyed testicle
  taller and bigger vs manlet no amount of manlet rage will overcome that
  it never happened
  it did tho
  the figures about holomodor are even more fixed than the 6 gorillion literally american cold war propaganda
  ukraine should be starved of people and was to be resettled with german famers brainlet
  depending on how you look at it stalin might be worse  the man is literally the last tragic protag of the enlightenment saga
  what legion
  it wasnt genocide of khokhols it happened all over the su and kazakhs actually lost the most percentagewise wheres the recognition bigot
  literally doing exactly what i said you would  its all so tiresome
  let me guess he was a jew because thats the only group of people that ever died in the past 2000 years    do you jews feel bad for all the death your ideology and meddling causes
  nah it did
daily reminder that ukrainian cities were majority russian before the holodomor the supposed genocide of ukrainians and after it they became majority ukrainian because all the russians were starved and khokhol rural bydlo brought in same thing happened in lwów  soviets kiecked out poles and brought rural khokhols in
  nobody cares mykola
  the nazis would have done the same    you hardly make the argument for communists liberating us from the germans    speaking of rapes and genocides do you have any idea how many war crimes were committed by soviets and communists in general    my country would never even have people side with germans if communists were not raping and looting us

does anyone know this artist if so please share it with drawings on the theme of chinese weapons and armor and on other historical themes too if they are
dumb weeb
  cute girls can make even shitty chinese armor look good
  yeah the artist is ho li phuc of the sum yung gai art studio
       here ya go lad
i was wondering if anyone here knew what division rank or occupation this ss collar tab i bought was associated with i found this at an antique mall
    either sstotenkopfverände concentration camp guards or 3rd ss panzer division totenkopf which was originally staffed by concentration camp guards mustered into waffenss service and was led by concentration camps inspectorate chief theodor eicke    i went through original and reproductions photos of both sstotenkopfverände and 3rd ss panzer division uniforms and there doesnt appear to be any cometic difference between them so what you have could easily be from either    also it appears to be flipped in that photo because the teeth on the skull arent visible
thanks for the info i had a feeling it might have been 3rd panzer division or something like it heres an attempt at cropping it to be vertical
    no i mean flip the actual patch
dont listen to the namefag he has no idea what hes talking about this is not an ss patch its a wehrmacht panzertruppe uniform patch most likely reconnaissance units according to corps color facings
      imagine being so autistic that you painted the mannequin like a pureblooded aryan    jesus christ
  yeah the other anon is correct compare the form of the totenkopf of the panzertruppe top and that of the ss bottom
  your feelings have been hurt
  could also be panzerregiment 24 or a fake since it should be a metal tab
  so what should he have gave it a hook nose and made it jew looking
im indian but was raised in a western country i found it strange how in the bible jacob tricks esau out of their fathers blessing in indian mythology the elder brother is treated with almost as much respect as god by his younger brothers it would be unthinkable for a supposed hero to do something like that
  probably had different fathers west is a cucksnest its worse then niggers
jacob wasnt exactly depicted as a good guy in that scenario and he does basically apologize to esau later on in genesis
  because esau is a retarded barbarian take for instance the story from the picture you used in the op when esau asks for jacobs food he says    הלעיטני נא מןהאדם האדם הזה  which would literally translate into  please let me swallow from the red the red there    this is characteristic of his speech if you dont know the story and context its usually incomprehensible esau is basically grug from those memes that were being passed around a while back
    his cunt mother didnt apologize at all
  esau was geniune unlike that slimy fuck jacob jacob getting btfod by his own sons was so satisfying to read
  because western myths are more realistic depictions of human behaviour
  the torah  western mythology
  the west extends all the way through persia and south through the maghreb egypt and arabia
  in what universe
  i dont get it how is esau grug
  everywhere the abrahamic world is very recognizable in contrast to the dharmic world
  aside from religion the islamic civilization is as distinct from the western civilization as it is from the hindu
  you have esoteric understanding that most people lack when they grow up brainwashed god is the creator of good and evil as he says to moses there is also the example of isaac taking birthright from ishmael lucifer wants us to think for ourselves god wants obedience if i was in abrahams shoes i would have told god if he wanted my son dead he would have to get through me first if you read objectively you can see that a lot of the righteous were tested and failed
imagine your family wrote down every argument you all ever had for two thousand years this is the distilled version of that
    aside from religion     yeah religion is no big deal
  i mean its not like they share the exact same religion they have two distinct religions which reinforce different ideas they just use the same characters to do so aside from that there are again many other differences between those civilizations
  islamic civilization  ha
    they were doing better than western civilization for quite a while
    this wil help    
  how much of that was after islam we might be living in star trek right now if those people werent forced back into the stone age
  all of the time that islamic civilization was doing better than western civilization was during the time of islam since all of the time i am counting as the islamic civilization was when the region was muslim muslim scholarship flourished while european scholarship was counting how many angels could dance on the head of a pin a simplification but essentially true
  should be islamic scholarship but basically the same thing
  im gonna guess that that enlightenment was residual from before who burned down the library at alexandria
  im gonna guess that it wasnt in the same way that the european enlightenment wasnt caused by the romans by the time the islamic golden age had set in islam had been dominant in the region for hundreds of years
  thats a lot of homework anon have to get back to you on that
  deceit is built into some middle eastern countries it was a way of surviving
  how is it not western israel is hugging the very edge of west coast of west asia the philistines and amelekites were aegeans
  well no arguments that it seems that society started advancing outward from the middle east while europe was still playing with sticks i guess im getting stuck on the word islam the labels we apply today and the lines we draw on the map are not applicable to history
  weird definition of the west i could definitely see a claim about middle eastern civilisation spreading through the west but the west is best defined by spengler as basically germanic civilisation from about 900 in europe to today over much of the world
  imagine believing this is true
  it was basically a story ancient jews told their kids so they wouldnt backstab their siblings
  but does he do anything to reconcile it and why woul god accept him it as legitimate
  lmao the west doesnt extend past the rhine and ends at the pyrenees
  thats the middle east the middle east
  are we talking before or after the hyperwar
  i think hes saying that esau was verbally retarded as in he was literally incapable of forming proper sentences in hebrew i guess
  he was hairy as fuck
  and the balkans were defined as the near east at one point
  hyperwar  i dont know the word google is full of crap im saying that our present  could have happened a couple hundred years ago if dumbasses did not burn books and stab archimedes and suppress technology acting like a bunch of fucking barbaric retards and trying to spread religion
  wouldnt this story make them backstab more
  yep stab a back is the moral of the story
  asia starts at vienna
    why are jews dishonorable    go figure
  its not enough for you shits to shit in the streets now you have to shit on /his/ too    use a fucking toilet you barbarian
  read greek mythology theyre far worse
  half the bible which is the cornerstone of western civilization isnt western for some reason
  niggers  what did he mean by this
  in genesis 32 jacob gives esau 200 female goats 20 male goats 200 sheeps 20 rams 30 camels with their young 40 cows 10 oxen 20 female donkeys and 10 little donkeys  in genesis 33 we see that esau isnt angry at jacob anymore and has to be persuaded to take that gift
  considering how much of the wests culture is directly descended from rome its a retarded definition
  this p much
is this book good for learning history of nazi germany or is it not worth reading
  rosenbaum    jk posting to hear reviews
its worth reading but evans trilogy is more uptodate
  its excellent journalism  his theories on why germans are dicks and smell bad are cringe and blue pilled
yes its a very well researched and interesting book
    back to the containment board plz
  his theories on why germans are dicks and smell bad   seems redpilled
  its fine but you need to read other books though
im 1/3 through it and its hilarious
  its interesting and the origin of a lot of the hitler mythos such as lamoshades     it also has some anti holocaust memes in it because it was written before people cared too much     his problem was he hates germans and hitler in particular so he is incredibly biased and always assignés motive and guilt to hitler he has no way of knowing     its good but biased     inside the third reich and roland are better
   recommend reading the iron kingdom before so you would caught up richard evans brings up more facts and details it a hell of a lot more in his trilogy     iirc evans wrote his post 2005 when more information were available shirer wrote his back in the 50s60s so he didnt have that much which he stated personally he knew his book wouldnt be as complete as it should be evans did a wonderful job but i think reading iron kingdom first then shirer then evans is a much better experience
  leftypol subhuman crying for an anti white safespace
  no its shit pretty damned biased
evans is better i read this first but came to realize it was off on many things    if i was going to do it in a coherent order id say    optional prequel listen to revolutions podcast on the french revolution to see how modern europe really started    part i evans pursuit of power for a background on 19th century europe in detail    part i supplemental listen to revolutions on 1848 revolutions as this really sets up the dominant political struggles through the end of wwii    part ii  iron kingdom for a german focused deeper look    part iii  a world undone as a wwi primer    part iv  vi  evans trilogy    genocide supplemental snyders blood lands    war time supplemental  rise and fall for a proximate history    epilogue postwar then the crushing of eastern europe    congrats you understand the arc from napoleon to the postwar order better than 99 of people only takes 50 hours of audio and 10000 pages
  i would recommend habsburg empire as well impossible to know hitler without knowing austrian politics
    yeah thats a good point going forward from wwii on a larger scale i think the glory and the dream is the best book on america from the depression through the vietnam war i have yet to find a good volume for the ussr that is a comprehensive social and political overview    i have a hard time deciding if napoleon to wwi is the defining epoch to look at or 1848wwii     i feel like if you get to know 1848 really well you can get by without knowing the intricacies of the french revolution and napoleon which is its own rabbit hole
  shirer wrote the book at a time when no one knew that the brits had enigma so a lot of the wartime actions lack the clarity that we know today     but there are a lot of advantages with it being written so soon after the war ended shirer actually lived in germany during the crucial moments of the rise of the nazis his personal experiences are biased but its hard not be scared the fuck out of your mind with the rivers of fire walking down berlin after nazu rallies     as a holistic look at the steps behind the rise and fall of nazi germany the book was worth every page dont expect a great biography of hitler but an in depth analysis of the german people at the most pivotal time in their history the scientists calling physics a jewish science the firms competing for contracts to supply poison gas for extermination camps and the ordinary citizens who just wanted to get the fuck out of europe
what about wiemar guys is there a good overview there
bump for third eric
what are /his/ thoughts on the electric universe to anyone who has not seen it 
none of that is valid proof  
isnt this that whole coronal mass ejection causing massive electrical storms on earth thing    just gonna leave this here    
lmao dis nigga doesnt know about ancient tposing
  betteridges law of headlines
deal with suffering  tell the truth  try to be the best version of yourself that you can be  the bible and other old philosophical texts help you to find meaning  why is this dull stuff seen as so controversial people act like he is either the next hitler or a saint that came to deliver a divine message
he cant be the next hitler because his helium ass voice will never inspire anyone to go to war
  scarcity of said material to the public makes his work valuable
  its not the controversy was him commenting on the polarizing topics of gender equality and transgender pronouns also his religious views are a crock of shit but no one cares about that side of him
  helium ass voice
  the bible is a crock fest and not a book to find morality or meaning in 80 of people who read it were awful people that became even worse because of it burn all bibles
  how do he claims hes a nominal christian but wont comment much further than that i found his views on the topic quite insightful and its part of what influenced me to get baptized at my local episcopalian church and why im now attending an orthodox one    i can only assume the smug condescension that some attack him with comes from a place of elitism ultimately hes doing more good than most of us are and that calls us all to account some people dont like being held responsible for the burden they should be carrying
  youve never read it have you
  i really doubt you did
the bible
  never cared about him desu
  hes simply an easy punching bag for the left but also  tell the truth  leads to some very bad places for current left wing dogma  although peterson cant do it personally as is actually very dishonest over certain questions particularly vis jews simply telling young men to do that when theres a void is very bad for the left
  very bad for the left  hes barely worth mentioning
  he claims that religion is true in the sense that it is useful morality but not in a scientific sense in a sense i agree with this but at the same time he attacks atheism for not having a firm foundation for why we should be moral essentially hes accepting god very ambiguously because he wants objective morality rather than basing his belief in objective morality on belief in god his logic is completely flipped on its head
  essentially hes a conservative and wants to keep legislated morality without keeping the legislator
    i like how he talks about solzhenitsyn kierkegaard and jung he only lightly touches upon their work but its better than nothing    but at the end of the day his fan base is predominately uneducated trump voters who most likely have daddy issues are uneducated or are on the autism spectrum he knows this and what does he do    he takes their money
jung is a fucking hack
  he either says mundane shit that any simpleton knows or spews absolute rubbish he also consistently does this with such a pompous pseud act that makes him unbearable
  for the love of god can someone explain to me why he always speaks like he is about to cry
  he isnt what hes telling people to do is
  its not controversial its trite
  because he is
  that is not his position his position as nominal does sort of imply that for him personally but hes also implied that complete transcendence may allow someone to be like christ was which isnt entirely far off from the way the church views saints he certainly doesnt debase religion on a material/scientific level but argues that it is certainly and more importantly true on a metaphysical level
  loled    because telling the truth is controversial right now
  basically this but he is very eloquent and a lot of people find him inspiring the obvious stuff he tells might be obvious but for many its hard to act on unless a charismatic father figure like peterson tells them to do so so in that sense he might be doing something pretty valuable the rubbish side seems mostly harmless gibberish in flowery language
  this is exactly what i was referring to earlier    not an argument and youre a fucking dick how dare people find some guidance and get their lives together its not like that makes the world a better place
