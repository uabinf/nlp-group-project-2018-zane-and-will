  i saw some crazy effects in this skate video that i thought were really interesting does anyone have an idea of how they made them
my macbook pro went into kernal panic last night which resulted in me having to factory reset in doing this i lost all of my adobe software and the dmg files i have arent working    i torrented the software years ago and now need a way to get the current software for free  can anyone help
just torrent them again
just pay for a cc subscription they fully refund you if you cancel in the first 2 weeks plenty of time to find good downloads
  i dont even have enough money in my bank account for the transaction to go through
  then pirate it use it to make some money then pay for the adobe cc suite then return it for a full refund except you return the pirated copy they wont know thats how you beat the system and learn graphic design
  cgpeers
  go to nmacto was it to try it yourself
    what a homo
fuck adobe and all the people that came up with their business model    every single fucking time i start looking up fonts and find a decent one its either protected by the fag owner or typekit    whats your source for good and free fonts /gd/
  fontsquirrel
i usually manage to find some shitty website where i can get the font for free
searching for font name inurlindex of usually helps
  im going to assume you pirated photoshop
  font name inurlindex of    i assume its just a typo but intitleindex of instead of inurl is probably what you mean
  the only fonts youll need  bodoni helvetica neue times new roman century expanded futura   garamond optima univers caslon baskerville akzidenz grotesk
its black friday/cyber monday season and im looking for a drawing tablet for my gf as a christmas present but i have no idea what im doing i would like something that does not break the bank since im poor and isnt a piece of shit about 500 is my limit i think unless its a really good deal please send suggestions and experience that would be very much appreciated
  thinking lurking a little will kill him          cheap tablets are bad get her a wacom as the bare minimum which have steep learning curve but work properly  if you can find an affordable cintiq go for it without thinking twice they are expensive but they feel just right and drawing on a screen makes a hell of a difference  /spoonfeeding
  thank you anon i hadnt realized this board even existed until today i was intrigued by these xp pen artist tablets since theyre half the price of even the cheapest wacom but ill keep looking and researching and check the other thread
  in that price range honestly ipad  apple pencil isnt a bad option the stylus isnt as accurate as a cintiq but probably the cheapest youre going to get the drawing on screen experience
designing as a daily ui challenge what does /gd think about this payment form
    is that the final it feels too basic not minimal its hard to make sense and it just doesnt give any reassurance at all imho    also   modifying someone elses logos  thats just wrong
  looks good to me
typography is too big have you tried either removing the shadow or the stroke having both seems kind of redundant
  gradients in 2018  no thank you
  looks like something from 60s70s
  summery
  twice
    the architecture is there and that should be the first step so far so good    it looks more like a wireframe than a finished design though i would treat it as such and use it as the blueprint for a more stylized / refined mockup    keep going
so many steps to place an order
  this
  i love that kind of style lightweight but understandable i recommend you to look at skeletoncss they make a cool typography style there
  those rectangles around the fields make me want to gouge my eyes out and the lack of any contrast also makes me want to die
  i didnt have the effort to do the rest because goddamn please for the love of god look at frameworks you can use to design fields like this if you really are married to your gay rectangles i would make a bootstrap theme to make your actual development a bit easier
  fyi your bank will often have requirements such as the visa and mastercard logos must be shown in full color
  yeah op has probably never owned an ecommerce business
  i like it but i have a couple of suggestions that might make it feel better
  you made it so much worse and you have the audacity to preach and scorn instead of addressing your manifest lack of sense and taste cant wait for the work of your ilk to be replaced by software robots which incidentally might be taught better manners too        these are more sensible suggestions
  i like it but holy fuck everything is out of square if this were a house it would blow down the first windstorm that came learn how to use a fucking ruler and center an image try using css desu
  this has good advice id also do the following  remove the dropshadow around the payment box  look into unifying the location of the edit  back to cart text ones outside the rectangle the other isnt  i dont really like the strikeout effect on the card number seems a bit much   maybe increase the font weight of invalid card number just to make it stand out a bit more but thats just my personal preference
  lock icon  lmao  better have some recognizeable payment partners im not giving my data to this bumfuck shit even as a concept  is this supposed to be a real page layour or is this a powerpoint slide showing planned features  amazing how you managed to stay really bland and minimal yet make me feel like im choking in this space what the fuck is up with these boxes and shadows lmao  grid any alignment  bitch where   incomplete number is invalid  im typing bitch fuck off  this step by step shit is a terrible way to pay fuck right off with that bullshit  that fucking progress bar too it doesnt inform me just restates shit that even in this broken form is all laid out on a screen its useless  youre really just making checkout more complicated like its a goal to fucking annoy and waste time of everyone with your busy bullshit with 75 steps    gray gray on gray its so hard to read  those fields try to look like theyre ordered and structured but in reality that shit is all over the place and its hard to make sense of  eye searing orange text also fuck you and your dark patterns  issues related to logging into  why did you write it in a most innoticeable way then bitch  writing close  its a button  just put an x there lol
  disgusting
  what are you retarded  summery  oh wait
  looks nice but form follows function looks like it would require a bloated implementation of js to get those shadows and that bar at the top working the grey text order summary to the side indicates to the user that they cant highlight that text which they might want to do  perhaps a better design would be to have the card form on the right and on the left a live updating receipt that includes in the same box things like shipping address name ph number and order summary that is clearly and easily able to be copy pasted before buying things people want to check that they are getting the right things so they might want to copy paste those lists all at once send off an email and verify before making the purchase     im not a /gd/ guy im a software guy btw software guys always notice horrible web design
  looks nice but form follows function looks like it would require a bloated implementation of js to get those shadows and that bar at the top working  obviously not a software guy that can be done in pure css
  doing this for a thing thoughts its a scheduling form for iphone repair
  not him but    not sure if i like the way you smoothed the two edges on the blue box it just looks too much like a random choice you made in an attempt to make it look dynamic somehow    drop shadow on submit button is way too big think about why would it cast a shadow so big like that probably dont need it at all though    not sure what to think about the slider section but i dont think it works at the very least the dotted line needs to be more uniform each segment should be the same size    make all of the input fields align
how do i make this logo less boring
  start by thinking out different ideas or keywords that match the companys identity then sketch on paper at least 10 different concepts doesnt matter if they look good or not you can post them on here if you want further critique then pick up 23 and then open illustrator tracethem try out different layouts or fonts/colors then present them to the client for feedback sounds long and tedious but the result will be much better and after a while youll get better and faster also you can and should learn about branding not just logos  also watch  
  use a different font on the bottom segment using 2 similar fonts in the same area of each other can cause issues    also consider that bottom one as a serif all caps font    plus what  this guy is saying when im working on a logo ill do about 50 ideas just a minute or two each on sketches then take the best ones and refine those then the best one or two from that and refine that then you finish up with nearly all of it
  if thats not a sweet wrapper the words look a little lost in the centre
  id place the words hot sauce on the other side see quick doodle    id also encourage you to handletter el flamente itd make it more unique avoids fontlicensing hurtles and can be a great exercise in general  im a fan of the pentel pocket brush which usually retails for 20 its less messy than dipping an actualhair brush into ink and avoids the clean up  whatever you letter you can then outline in illustrator for your vector
  ditch the script for the hot sauce and use a simple sans serif typeface  this will increase readability and keep the emphasis on the name
  clean your filthy faggy fingernails first
  eat shit and die of a slow cancer you shallow pretentious fuckface
  getting this mad for being called out on your effeminate filth wont save you from ridicule next time you decide to show the world what you can do with your 20 brush but it does show a chord was struck be honest here for a bit mr hot sause was it about the lack of hygene or your homosexuality you will notice i have been kind enough not to bring talent into the discussion
    wtf is wrong with this guy those nails are a perfectly acceptable length albeit they are close to the upper limit and whats with the gay obsession gays trim their nails religiously
  i dont clip my thumb nails shorter because its easier to peel oranges and i am serious about the pen brush its useful
  not for nothing but you dont need to defend me
  remove everything except el flamente on a simple red background and youd have a fine enough logo add a little pepper silhouette if you want    where youre going wrong is mocking up everything else around it the difference between a pro logo designer and you is that they know how to present the logo to the client or in this instance 4chan    watch some videos on how to present a logo to a client     also change hot sauce to a difference complimentary font or dont have it at all
  spends time making a free hand rendered wordmark to help out a stranger on the internet  most useful reply on the thread  gets roasted for having dirty fingernails  doesnt even have dirty fingernails    lmao  this site
  coke ripoff
  good advise      quite honestly tracing this would make for a better logo
    he also spelt sauce wrong    graphic designers eh
im well aware that the golden ratio idea has been widely questioned but is using circles to design logos a legit technique or meme tier i kind of get the impression that a lot of designers just do it because its a trend and looks cool
  if a lot of designers use it and it works how is it not legit
    just because a lot of people do it doesnt mean its useful the question is how much of it is purely a bullshit fad and how much of it is legit technique obviously using circles can be a good tool to cut out shapes but im not convinced that the youll get a more useful result from using the circles derived from the golden ratio versus just eyeballing it
  because they arrange the circles after the logo is done by some arbitrary nonmathematical sense and thats not how these golden rules work
  the apple logo doesnt adhere to the golden ratio    just like the grid system it can help solve design problems    mathematical correct shapes can look lopsided in context like when you dont overshoot the cap height and baseline of an o slightly    like everything in life if it works use it if it doesnt dont
its a legit technique albeit overused recently using the technique isnt meme tier but how you use it can be    because they arrange the circles after the logo is done by some arbitrary nonmathematical sense and thats not how these golden rules work
check out this cosmic brain  
its a meme through and through no one can tell    rule of thirds on the other hand is legit
is gd a good profession for people with autism learning disabilities or other mental health issues
i dunno we have this guy with mild autism in our class he does karate n shit during lectures not really sure about his design skills but he breathes really loud
  certainly if you can focus on git gud tm you certainly can do really well at it which applies to anything you apply yourself to that has tangible applications    whats your mental aberration
  dyscalculia and a language learning disability also some trouble with reading comprehension
  just take a look around this board friend your are among people with worse afflictions
  i presume there is american designers so obviously this isnt an issue
    even though there is a craft to master its overall not very objective and relies on an understanding of many nuances to be good    not sure about dyscalculia the numberrelated comprehension barrier seems a bit troubling though but id imagine something like autism will severely affect your ability to take cultural and social information and abstract it into a visual thats widely accessible to others    how serious are you about pursuing gd do you have any previous experience would you mind sharing some work would help to clarify your situation
  im at a community college right now and i will hopefully transfer to a 4year program
  are you taking a gd program in community college    would recommend looking into 2year programs instead most gd programs in uni are pretty outdated since the field is changing so quickly better to get the baseline experience / technical understandings and play around in the real world asap     web design and ux is a really active market right now if youre interested in making interfaces / digital design you should have no problem finding work in a major city the work is surprisingly localized considering you can do it remotely i guess people want to feel more secure about outsourcing a website as its usually crucial to the business and theyre usually paying a decent amount compared to a poster album cover etc    i would also recommend building up your portfolio asap and trying to find some freelance work to get a feel for industry / get the tough lessons out of the way sooner when it comes to client work
not good you need to be a salesman and talk to people a lot if you want to get any money its 90 politics and 10 technology    better off in engineering or comp sci where some autism is expected    design is super social house of cards shit
  this is the program im doing right now
  what about if you work from home
  what about it everything that guy said still applies
  you still need to find a job first or a steady stream of clients if youre going freelance both of which require at least semidecent social skills
its hitormiss there are autists who have no idea how humans work and apart from the networking problem will just have no clue what things normal people consider connected when general /gd/ is all about those connections this category is better served going into something like drafting or industrial design where obsessive incremental improvement are the name of the game    but there are also autists who have too good of an idea how humans work as a whole and just default to this because theys still autists and have a hard time figuring out where any individual counterpart is coming from this category will also struggle to ever land work but once they get out there can do really well for themselves this is the tajiri or maybe tomino or so on category
is age an issue im 28 and just getting into gd
  made me chunkle
hey /gd/ i didnt see a book list here lets start one     heres my first      conceptual art from taschen
  designers dictionary of colour   sean adams    absolutely a must read    
i made the logo and website and video  follow trapmonkie seriouslyplaned    
i dont get it it looks like shit
  straight from /tv/ checked
  i dont get it    thats the problem
capitalizing smallcap characters  lol
its slightly dated but remember this film takes place in 1987 the card has everything it needs though what else would you add to an executives business card
    wasnt it supposed to have a watermark
  it did also checked
probably because youre not physically holding it to experience the tasteful thickness of it
carruthers unironically had the best card
how many vice presidents did that company have
  top kek
  lol
  oh my sides
oh and i came to /gd/ to do a request for this template as im from /p/ and want to make a business card to give to people who i take pictures of obviously i read the op to go to /wsr/ but this was just so random that you have the exact same topic of what i wanted    basically i want the tempalte so that i can add my name instagram and email so that i can take it to the printers as they want to charge me an additional fee just to design this card
thats the point the movie is a representation of how the bland faceless lifestyle they lead is still something they pride themselves on pleasures of conformity    
  40 keks
  off the top of my head try something like your contacts on the left name/business top corner others bottom then something looking like a blank profile picture on the right probably centred vertically  colour as you wish but nothing too saturated
  it even has a watermark
      this and this
  acquisitions
does anyone have the desktop thread edit
i got an interview coming up for a job as a graphic and digital designer its my first interview ever i have a pretty solid online portfolio but the interviewer mailed me with bring your portfolio and it threw me off is she going to expect me to bring a physical portfolio my plan was to just bring my computer and show my website with my works and go through/ talk about them in depth she has most likely already seen them as i gave a link on my resume am i going to look like a total tool if i dont bring a physical portfolio i dont have one but i could make one as the interview is on thursday next week but im afraid its going to be haphazardly brought together as i dont really have time/money to print out complete books or folders professionally    i understand that print works it probably better to be seen in print and there is an added sensation of feel with a physical portfolio i just feel overwhelmed and so not ready for this how fucked am i on a scale of 110 if i just bring my computer
this is an interview so you dont really wanna bring your whole computer try to get set up to go onto your website etc     print would be better imo but since you said you dont think you can make it of any level of quality maybe its better to just avoid that    i would suggest arranging a more presentable short version of your portfolio that you can just have saved onto your phone as a pdf or something that way you can just pull your phone out and show the interviewer with your phone   save that and your main portfolio in pdf forms onto a blank flash drive that you can give to the interviewer that way you can leave your porfolio with them in some way    saving it onto your phone to show them has the added benefit of showing that you can design for screens and since the position is digital designer that would look pretty good
hi /gd/    has anyone here taken the graphic design course at george brown college in toronto ontario    if so what are your thoughts on it is it worth it did you learn everything you wanted to did you get a job after    how bout any other gd programs at other ontario colleges any input is appreciated    also if i go at 26 years old am i gonna have no friends and want to kill myself even moreso than usual
  im 27 and i go to ocad for gd iirc a prof once told me that george brown was more focused on the technicalities of graphic design and less on the fundamentals of design itself if its anything like ocad though the workload by itself will make you want to kill yourself    as for being social im pretty sure no matter what school you go to for graphic design youre going to have to deal with class critiques youre work is going to be front and center for everyone to have an opinion on and youre going to have to talk to everyone about what your intent and the choices you made to achieve your intent graphic design is visual communication so get used to communicating as soon as you can
no response in /wsr/ except to say try here    im looking for an artist to do a logo/t shirt design for a kids karate club/class i run for low income kids    by low income i mean my rate is 10 a month testing inclusive and some of my students cant pay that    the idea is for a design that can go on the back of a tshirt and perhaps a 4 patch    im a looking to call it kaiju karate and am looking for a cartoonish godzille in a gi breaking a board with a chop and the phrase kaiju karate incorporated in the image    the shirts and patches would only be for my students no other sales and those sales i do make would be at cost    pay is negotiable not rich here but i know an artists work is worth money    please give me a link to your deviant art page as ill communicate through there and it will let me see samples of your work    thank you
  go back to  or   this really is not the place to solicit for work or put out a shingle looking for work done and i think youd be wasting your time here
  i have done some patches and cartoonish logos before pic related ive made it for 50 my email is axtaresdesigngmailcom
  you dumb fuckface by doing this youve just encouraged and enabling more filth to treat /gd/ as a request board  op you disgust me you animal said he went to /wsr/  why didnt you go there and respond to his post there
  this board has been crap for years who even cares but you
  habit and tradition i suppose
  who even cares but you  i do as well this was a beautiful board long ago  why do i even keep coming      to be fair paid requests were always allowed here      you can test your luck on  as well
thoughts on it seems like they added some pretty neat features and time savers more importantly spoileris there a torrent of the programs up anywhere yet/spoiler
  from what ive seen ae pr ps its pretty much the same with sensei integration which seems pretty neat    spoilers  cgpeers only has ps and pr as well as their elements verions at the moment but you can get the whole suite for windows from cgpersia
  thanks
  they have changed a couple of pretty commonuse shorcuts and its driving me nuts but otherwise its pretty lowkey
  could you post the splash screens for ai and id if you have them please
  google it
  seems like they dont care about innovating anymore since they went with a monthly subscription    now that you have to pay every month to get it they dont need new useful features to convince you to buy the next version so they just make small changes
  file type associations on windows are totally broken everything tries to open in xd registry editing worked until today when double clicking a file in explorer changes focus to the correct application but nothing opens 0/10 do not download
  has adobe finally made their schoftware uncrackable on mac
  it was for years all versions
  2018 was all cracked
  its just a matter of time
  no torrents out there yet they removed the amtlibdll so patchers dont work anymore
here 
  this is a lie
  seems legit
  its up on cgpeers
  this for real    can you confirm that this is a good copy
protip uncheck the use legacy undo in order to have a functional undo system again
  nice  i understand the logic behind the legacy undo but i always found it kind of retarded
  ctrl alt shift transform are all completely fucking switched around
  can confirm not only cc but extra ram download that will boost your performance 2000
  fuck off did you download it or not
  hey bitch did you fucking download it
  still here cumlord
  confirmed it works
  who ever decided to switch around the scaling shortcuts should be publicly shamed and hung
did they add a colour dropper to the ai gradient tool yet  copypasting hexcodes is a pain in the dick
eastern europe
yes theyre hot but theyre also the biggest gold diggers on the planet as well
i like the utterly casual yet somehow elevated vibe of the latvian photographer arnis balčus work    
what are you working on anon 
mite be too deranged to apply for application software developer 3year degree for now relearning js and cobbling together a disgusting little gulpfile today so i can continue them frontend webpajeet  /gd/ shenanigans depending on how things turn out until next september
  
  web design is /gd/ to
  yeah but i doubt theres more than a couple of guys who design websites and post regularly on here at /g/ it usually reach the post limit
    /g/ is too nerdy not enough focus on design itself
  i work full time in gd but i rly have no fucking knowledge about designing great things for web im not talking about shitty affiliate graphics with cta and bullshit im thinking about stuff like this        where do i even start learning what do i look for should i try to learn about processing java i have no clue and would appreciate advice
      looks fancy but canvas and webgl leaks shitload of data about users machine similarly to webrtc so i normally have this functionality blocked out web is cancer web browsers are cancer
      sharing from another anon     brutalistwebsitescom
ok guys i could do with a little help if possible basically im looking for a way to simply edit photos in this style while retaining the original resolution i used a vaporwave editor on android called vaporcam but unfortunately it drastically reduced the resolution im mostly looking to edit wallpapers purely in the way highlighted here with the colour gradient originally the pape was monochrome    anyone got any advice
  get gimp on your computer  open your wallpaper  make a new layer fill it with desired gradient  play with blending mode and opacity settings untill you are satisfied with the result
  thanks mate so would that be background or foreground or transparency and can u give me a bit of a walkthrough on how to do the blending thing
  i have troubles with my internet connection so cant post screenshots at the moment    its really as simple as i said these are the steps you need to take to do what you want to do    get gimp on your computer download it install it  open your wallpaper in gimp  make a new layer  fill the layer with your gradient  play with opacity and blending mode    opacity and blending mode should be in the layers pannel usually on the right side of the screen there are various blending modes such as overlay addition colour burn darken and so on opacity is a numerical value ranging from zero percent 0 to one hundred percent 100    your wallpaper would be backgrond and the gradient layer should be above in the layers pannel
  thanks bro ill screenshot this i figured out a way to retain the quality the resolution it saves at isnt far off really and the quality loss is easily compensated for with a slight blur
  okay glad to help you cheers
  also fyi normal blur blurs a bit too much n can be heavy on the eyes 10 gaussian blur is much better does the job and is easier to look at thanks again
    gimp
what is your idea of 2019 calendar
album art youve made
r8
  4/10  not big on the font and the border is unnecessary
hows this
ill post a couple
  i like this one a lot 9/10
  i could see it being used for experimental music but its just a tad too busy for my taste 4/10
here are some of mine
  that hair looks lovely overall but what the hell happened on the right
  its suppose to be the edge of the hairline like the front of the sideburn the hair is not as thick and more whimsy
one of my first attempt to redoing a album cover please rate
  pretty cool very clean composition 9/10
r8 boys    i used to illustrate a lot
  same fag here
  again same fag
  maybe try to add texture to you designs   looks more authentic that way
  you pick one of the only good covers in this awful pointless thread to criticize lamo
  wow i mean the illustrations style isnt that great lets say it doesnt make me go wow     the font he used is awful   the lines and the background lets not even talk about it     look at the fucking eyes on this thing     and i only said add texture     the other artwork are not really worth it
  i really like this
  thanks illustrator and photoshop for textures   simple brush that i made gives amazing results
a friend and i made this for a band shes very talented
  no
      cute and good would hire to design lofi house covers
show what you got
  thanks dude    i love minimal composition and ultra detailed illustrations
this is probably against the rules but idk where else to turn to im actually looking for someone to help design my album cover for an ep something similar to what posted if anyones interested then pls respond
  oh almost forgot my discord tag is 4568
  thinking the cover was made by some 2 click filters    please think a little outside the canvas
  this one actually looks pretty cool
i was not expecting this thought there was gonna be some anime shit in this over all some of these are really neat
  im the one that made that cover im in a /gd/ server hop in there and ask around    discord  gg / v5smyzg
made is a big word but i shat this out
  no lie thought that was a renegade penis floating in the bottom right
  blame 7/8 year old me for taking such photo
what do you guys think ill post a few
  great picture shit typography what the fuck were you thinking
graphic design is my passion
  agree the type is not as good as it could be had it been the original angled germanica plain and a different color it might have been a little better some kind of zone for the text to exist on/in would have been nice i like the type but it could have been much better out of curiosity tho what typeface is that exactly upload
  i like this actually could i see some of your other work
  id try gardening if i was you
it didnt turn out fantastic but i still like it as its one of the first things ive made in 3d
  did you make the detour bit
  yeah its my own design
 back
      really hoping this is an elaborate bait      if this is a postpunkish album then spot on      this without text would be a toptier cover  the text makes it look like straight outta bandcamp / black metal influenced suburbian thingy        i love this  is this band basic and butal  ala the locust or lightning bolt but more kraftwerk  because thats a good way to sell me that
  tnx for the apreciation 3  kinda its techno with some space/futuristic vive its the 2nd of 3 albums  this is the 1rst one similar but a little more rough saddly i wont be making the 3rd
 thanks here is another one   i upload some of my work on instagram macclem if you want to check it out
  i think i made it before i started studying grafik design      thanks for the feedback ill look into the type for other covers ill be making for them  not sure about the type i used it was some freefont i think
my crowning accomplishment
  trying to hard to replicate david carson imo
  8/10    6/10    4/10    8/10 but shit font    5/10 shit font again    85/10 needs polish    75/10    75/10    8/10    75/10    ok/10    8/10 but joy division is for fags    95/10 youre too good for this board get out    9/10    8/10 dont get it    8/10 shit colors    6/10 all effects no design    benis/10    8/10 dont know what it means    85/10    5/10      9/10    9/10 but bad font choice    75/10    75/10 tits    dont even smoke crack/10
silly me made this 3 years ago and i never bothered again
  garbage
  can you post that image you used
  0/10  do you even know what you are going on about
          and here comes the crap no ones gonna upload anything worth looking because of these
  pic related      crap  can you be more specific the music is inspired by steve reich with melodies taken from the delphic hymns i think the cover represents the album perfectly
  t butthurt he received low rating    not him but my knee jerk reaction was another teen watched too much vaporwave  anyway your concept might sound like it reflects contexton paper but its simply not working visually the images are too tiny and too complex to be repeated
    your concept might sound like it reflects contexton paper but its simply not working visually the images are too tiny and too complex to be repeated    agree with this 100
  the images are too tiny and too complex to be repeated  thats not a design rule
this ones several years old but its the only cover ive ever made
  it definitely is when you design patterns which you clearly wouldnt know flow and reading is what wed call it
  except it is this is design 101 dont make complex images tiny   your whole approach is flawed just because the imagery is related to the music doesnt mean it talks to people who are missing on the context or that it works visually at all just because its literal doesnt make it good  in your case you chose to repeat a symbol of greece but the symbol is so complex its grabbing all the attention it actually has its own dramatic plot and its not clear if i should be looking at it or notdo all these people and their actions matter and if yeswhy are they so tiny this is small even for an lp size   moreover the white lines make it look like film strips which almost implies a reading direction but when you look at it its just the same image which raises question if it had to be repeated 48 times with no change   last but not least the medium is the message the image you chose gives vibes of ancient culture and myths classical hellenic connotations question do all of these really need to be there its like if you showed people a picture of a bottle of refined oldtimey american bourbon and implied that they should read it as just water and next you repeat it confusing things even further  so its supposed to be read just as symbol of greece but its barely what you get and the image just falls apart its meaning is clear to you only   regardless patterns rarely make album covers of course few reich works did use them but they were all minimal abstract patterns picrelated for other examples merriweather post pavilion comes to mind and again the pattern is very simple and it has an actual purpose or merzbowsame thing  and in case you were trying to do something like achtung baby note that it has 4x4 grid not 12x4 like yours and the images are all different which gives purpose to multiimage format every photo is also pretty simple not a complex composition
  9/10 gives me 80s vibes
  what are you going on about morris got very small  complex with it
  see the context were talking of a whole composition used as pattern what morris made was floral patterns not repeating a composition full of people
  fursuit
  my fav
  5/10 just add effects until it looks cool
ok boys what do you think
    heres another
    looks like a joke but i can see you spent some time on it  looks like something that came from the 90s your work has this anarchic informal and expressive vibe to it but its not the 90s anymore these things are badly unfashionable so 99 of people will tell you its ugly as all fuck which might be true at least to some extent  also you need to brush up your skills theres a ton of poor crops jaggy lines and eyerape colors in there
need text for this so badly ive been sitting on it for months
  david carson    do ppl really not recognize this cheap imitation of a beautiful cover
  do ppl really not recognize this  i dont listen to this pretentious garbage
gon prolly turn this into single artwork  white border inspired by kate bush
   this is gonna be the album cover
  alternate single art
  another single art
        i hope your musics better than your covers
  take a photo of sweater  oversaturate it  wow so genius is this some nuclear shoegaze or something
  cool but album covers are square
  falled in love with this one
the final version i made had a stars texture in the bg but i cant find it rn
  its actually pretty ok   but that crop on the handfor fucks sake man
i dont have the knowledge to create anything unique but is this at least passable
  actually this is quite good 8/10
  i like it fuck that guy who says its crap
so i made this for a client they asked for an illustration never done before and i spent hours on this using only mt trackpad only for it to be scrapped for a super simple design that took me 10 mins to make     what do you think for a first time illustration   its not finished and are small lines not connected due to it never getting a green light
first cover ever made took the photos too
thoughts comments concerns
  its pretty bad dude
  its legitimately terrible dude did you attempt to charge your client for this
  could have used a higher res base image as the pixellation around the masking is bad    its a cool concept overall though
  only ok if its done in halfironic way but otherwise id be pretty embarrassed if i made this
  that guy here fuck you too
  kek
  my art is prob shit but i like it 
from a breakcore cover
  75/10 good effect shit picture    8/10 very good but that font looks like comic sans also needs more attention to color combination    65/10 good effect but awful colors and pixel artifacts    8/10
  you are an idiot or you did these
vaporwave album for a guy from my city
  another low quality amateur attempt to pander to the lowest common denominator
  absolute trash   steal pictures with higher quality and kys
  6/10 looks neat but shit resolution and uninspired
hey amateur here i made this with a friend cause i wanted to try my hand at album art and photo manipulation i know its not good but im hoping i can get some feedback and maybe some tips
  your only tip would be start learning and come back to it when you actually know something you cant expect to just randomly jump into design and do something good without knowing anything neither can you expect to magically make it good with tips
  i get what you mean i do actually have some experience with illustration in different mediums but i am starting out with this type of digital design stuff i do all of this stuff just for fun/personal use anyways what would you suggest i do to start learning it seems like a very large subject to know where to start if you dont mind me asking what were your first steps into learning
  depends on what you mean  if you mean just digital art learn photoshop 101 theres plenty different tutorials last time i checked  if you mean design theres a list in the sticky also a good book for starters is ellen luptongraphic design the new basics
  sounds pretty good thanks
not an album cover but music related and hopefully pleasing to view
  8/10 p good but geo sans just doesnt fit also wtf is that tooth    3/10 cant see shit
here goes nothing
  1/10 you tried
  if this isnt for a primus esque band it is awful
  billy not much looks silly  the border round the pic looks weird  parental advisory should be a higher res    i like paul  the pots  not sure what else youve done
  i like this but it could of been done by someone with zero knowledge just clicking filters and actions
  i would of made the spill between r  y blacker so it looked more like the misery ran rather than a separate splatter also theres a blurry bit between the e  r i would of tidied up
  i like this id like to know a brief outline of what you did how accidental it was and is the background one solid piece
  the background of each side obviously
    yea man i took the first picture and placed it on an add layer over a generic scratched cassette texture i found online then i adjust the levels to add more contrast and reduce the saturation the second photo i adjust the levels the same and place it over the first in a difference layer hence the inverted effect i also added noise layer over the top to make it grainy and gritty on the second side i just changed the layer type of the top photo to multiply and thats it i guess it was pretty accidental as i was just messing around with the filters with a death gripsstyle image in mind and about the background im not sure if this is what you mean the black bars are a layer underneath that i cropped into a square to fit thanks for taking interest 
old shit but i wanna contribute
that misery poster back with more edge
  black and white
  2/10 is it ugly on purpose      7/10
  first honest critique in months  im guessing your not a 14yo vapowave enthusiast
  not the same person but your cover doesntt even look vaporwave at all its not even so bad its good its just a gross picture the font doesnt match and the colour scheme is an eyesore im sorry but im not even sure its salvageable id just start from scratch
  made for a shitposting group on normiebook
  i didnt think it did it was a dig at how this boards gone
just a concept ive been messing with
  honestly im interesting in seeing this without the bents or textures could give nice brutalist feel
  6/10 great execution but so awfully uninspired
  0/10 dont post here again    7/10 lame execution but surprisingly powerful photo
  very nice very doom
does making your own counts
  the problem for us is knowing the difference between crap intentional crap and fluked crap but the key word is definitely crap
  ok but what is wrong about it
  different anon here i think its ok but the image quality is really shit also the message is quite vague good colors though and overall shoegazey feel is nice
  thanks    well the image is shit because i had to upload the low quality version but the original is better     its me in the picture it was a still from a music video we recorded i took a picture of the screen with a good camera than edited it so the colors look nice so yeah the hq version is way prettier    its synthpop/industrial but could be used for shoegaze too haha
  is that like one of those car stickers  my other versions a porsche  dont upload the crap version and ask whats wrong with it you wasting mine and your time
  dont be rude anon  you dont change anything and certainly dont make things better
  i think that if youre in 4chan youre time is not being spent well anyway
      gotta confess made it in 2 minutes on my phone
  i wonder what gave it away
just made this please r8
  i like this layout its clean and makes me want to check the band out good job
  5/10 pros potentially good hues clean cons shit photo composition with no clear focus very vague meaning shitty solarizelike artifacts
crit me
  4/10 its just text on bg pixelation looks bad
  rate
  surely thats just shit heavy noise thinking this guy know how to pixelate lmao
  is that it or a screenshot of it
  thats it
  well i dont like the silly effect youve added over the top but apart from that its genius i love it
  8/10 idea 1/10 image quality
  grainy image  saved in png  wew lad  kinda weird for a cover feels more like an illustration
what about the back and the cd  im trying to make something for my bands ep but im out of ideas and everything i make is terrible
  its hard not to think of flash gordon when trying to be original
nothing fancy but its a good vibe
  still in highschool
  nothing fancy is an understatement this is garbage
complete amateur i know it sucks had fun making it though
  doesnt look like you had fun looks akin to dragging your nails down a chalkboard
  this kind of effect needs work otherwise it produces ugly colors pixel noise and looks like bad exposure
  font does not help border neat but iffy cool pic and composition
  album for ants
  interesting texture a bit muddy looks like you greyed out the darks and highlights
  image over posterized and poorly masked interesting composition within photo though font is meh sizing seems odd font kinda cheesy
  this is dope
    made this one too both for a school design class project last year im really proud of the first one though
havent been designing as much stuff the past year so im kind of rusty but if anyone wants to critique this cover i made for a friend feel free
  meh
drone cover for a friend
  this one i did it as an exercise
rate me
  7/10 dislike the semitransparent text and the colors are a bit clashing/oversaturated    6/10 if ironic 2/10 if unironic    5/10 ok picture good fonts shit contrast letters distract from the image    5/10 good clean trendy style but absolute shit composition middle feels too fucking small and light like its a coding startup and not a record sides have too many effects no for real you have like  1 weird spelling  2 4 reading directions  3 varying colors   4 outline  this feels extremely clumsy and amateur    7/10 same good clean style and good font but too empty and mixing clashing styles in one package have black cover for cd and itd be 85/10 also annoying black lines on the front because of word spaces id remove them    2/10 good images which shouldnt be overlayed overlayed
    does it make it any better if im a girl
  the fact that you need to ask this makes me think i rated it too high
  you totally did  check out the masking on the small objects
had no clue what i was doing when i made this one lol
but the album never showed up 
  75/10 great palette/contrast more or less understanding the trends the composition looks overly empty the sheep  looks very weird the wavy letters arent wavy enough beats sleep is too tiny     65/10     2/10 no    3/10    7/10 the composition is good enough tacky logo font relies too much on cheap looking effects polygons on moon feel like a very forced meme trend and moon cut in half looks awkward back is very good though
ill post a few
  2/10 ok photo the stripes are disgusting uninspired overall    0/10 are you being ironic    2/10 smartphone apptier    2/10 okish colors shit grain no composition    4/10 you tried  thanks for shitting out this gimp cancer
  cool photo tho
i have no shame follow me and if you want we can touch butts
  oh i literally just realized i forgot to convert profile fucking rip 51 days later      
  also i was working with a tv as my monitor at the time but now i have a 4k ultrawide curved feels nice
r8 pls
cultural roots a musical project with children
  3/10   not sure about those gross 90s colors also i think thats a straightup system font and it makes the rest of the album cover look too cheesy
  2/10   looks like bad steven universe fanart     the glitch effect could be cool but the mass of diamond/rock is taking up too much room and the font looks boring and the colors dont provide enough contrast
    the vector art is really nice the colors provide a good tone for what the listener could expect the music to be about 8/10
just finished it its not quite my taste in style but the client was happy
            really tasteless desu
  was the original image shot by yourself
  what
  made it for my friends screams/trap album
  i really like this one others not so much
  1s i like                      ooboobie                     
    yeah these are cool all digital or did you collage and scan some in and finish it
  mind if i use this for a song on soundcloud im a small time artist and can credit you as well if youd like
  wow this is surprisingly good  love it dude
  whats the font called
  sounds interesting can i get a link
  they look like straight out of 1990s
  
  this is quite lovely my only comment would be to play with the transparency on the text and the paint backing so it gets the texture on it i think that would really make the piece cohesive
  messaged you on ig
  good shit
crit this
  overdone and bad
  this is very fucking cool    the first one was done entirely with real paper the second one is digital but i scanned the stickers on the lid of my laptop to cut out individually ended up using the first one for the school portfolio project which ive now finished
  this is terrible i know that graphic design is done almost entirely digitally nowadays but you need to know how to use a pen and paper thats just fundamental shit dude
giv r8 m8
  i find it hard to comment when i dont know how much works gone into something you could of just added the text for all i know but i like it i hope its all your doing its a good style
  study line weight values figure drawing composition other similar but better album arts gosh everything
  this looks badassis it for a homebrew game or something
  made all myself     thanks mate
  too busy and pretentious with predictable shapes  4/10    the text should be moved somewhere else the raster dots are awful i like the effect with the tv screen but not sure about the wall behind solid  6/10    looks pleasant but fonts are awful  75/10    the multiplication effect is horrendous colors need an overhaul the design otherwise is decent the bottom and the cloud are well thought out  35/10    looks good and professional but not very original its like ive seen this on 2 other albums already even if it was oc  8/10    i hate the eyes could do with texture on the characters otherwise good  7/10    simple beautiful throwback  9/10    not bad but the anatomy looks incorrect to me the ear looks to be too high if the sideburn is any indication distracts me personally also the entire teal part feels very empty and could do some addition  6/10    very nice to look at but the japanese symbol feels pretentious 85/10    somehow this doesnt invoke any feelings in me time freezing the texture part is nice but the image looks out of place could work with engrave texture  5/10    the idea and execution are superb my only gripe is the image inside the circle i dont happen to like it just personal preference is all  9/10    bootleg version of the upper one still solid the colors are pleasant the fruit looks bad  55/10    imo looks a little bland the darkness seeping through the window could be more wide spread 6/10    looks cool colors in the sky feel uncertain the bottom is well thought out  85/10    seriously needs something behind otherwise the texts and their effects look good  65/10    looks like some drug addicts mixtape  35/10    the image looks good and would make a great album cover but the typography is awful  45/10    horse groin  1/10    not bad not fan of the fonts  65/10
  75/10 nice texture wouldve been good tog et stencil look seen on dog on text    8/10 needs some work on the gradients    9/10 wat happened w your bottom font
    how could you not  the first two letters in the vowel song
just wanted something clean and simple are these fine and if so which do you prefer as the front cover
    sick bro
  7/10    4/10 cool concept but just looks off    75/10 sendaboy font looks a bit strange and too much noise looks good though    9/10 really really cool    3/10    4/10    7/10 colours are a little off    6/10
  damn you are all smugs here
    bottom left is really good and so is top right for the color contrast
  i think its pretty tollerent to have a crappy album art thread desu
super basic art i made for my first demo tape  gonna shamelessly plug it if you like folk check out long way home on it  
                                              trash                      cool      so bad it deserves its own mention      cool image bad type      would be spectacular if you made the art yourself    bored now so im not gonna scroll through these any longer conclusion 99 of album artists are shit that should never see the light of day
    im digging that is there any way to follow you 
just for fun inspired by this thread and not wanting to play the random generator album game atm  thoughts
how bout that 
  even the pictures got a bad composition and im guessing you didnt even take that the rest shit font badly placed over a pictures whatever
  no i did take that photo  im less bothered by your unhelpful critique than the baseless insinuation that i didnt take a shitty quick photograph
    tas osé
  cgi hammer  what the fuck this is complete garbage
  cringe/10
ik this is a meme band but this is a great album cover nonetheless
  keep on yeeting my dude
  a sublte  hey  would have done
    one of the most influential second wave black metal albums  meme band    are you retarded
  r8    logo  studio pictures made by me  graphic design exam
    thanks man i just started so ill b posting more stuff
  i do not like the rest it feels and looks like a class assignment that logo is nice though
  the kerning on ur logo needs work the e on pie feels way too tight and the y on cherry feels a little loose that little interaction between the y and i is pretty cool way to lead the eye though
  everything is child like except the logo and thats because someone on here did it not op
post sexy business cards
currently trying to design business cards for myself for the first time ever been out of the design scene for a while so would be nice to see what you guys have come across or created yourselves
  reaching into the archives of my 20132015 portfolio
  example 2
  and of course (((example 3)))
  is this a mockup done in a 3d software
  no idea i found it on some behance list
  what printing companies can do very well made cards as in patricktier autism type printing i like options
two sided
  leaving precious real estate empty that could otherwise be used to your advantage  what is wrong with you dont you fold your toilet paper and wipe again
  exactly what i was thinking
    first one is nice
  lol i love use the same paper to wipe my ass twice with
duplexed  blind debossed  red foil on the front and back  white foil on the front  one other additional color because why not at this point    this card is on another level
  i like it can you get the purple in a rough felt how much does that cost
  back is nice front is a mess      very 2016 not bad though      extremely meh      square really        terrible      also meh so minimal no one is going to remember it      garbage horrible adidas ripoff on the back and dafonttier styled text on the front what year is it      design is nice but vertical business cards always rubbed me the wrong way      not even a business card/10      not bad
itt average business cards dressed up with lots of finishes
  not much you can do with a business card desu
    apart from design them to be interesting rather than just foil your logo
  not worth the hassle
  lets see your card anon
  square  
this thread needs a bump
i dont find any of these sexually arousing
  ocad is trash lmao
  booooooooooring
  you guys might shit on this one but it is honestly excellent
  very 2016     very 2016 not bad though  nice projecting lol its international style     extremely meh  this is actually a nice card your opinions are trash     garbage horrible adidas ripoff on the back and dafonttier styled text on the front what year is it  this is your one valid piece of feedback     design is nice but vertical business cards always rubbed me the wrong way  again your opinions are trash     not bad  lmao easily one of the ugliest business cards here  this is very 2016
  its spelt mexico
  nice dubs but is that logo off center reeee
  ocad  its piss
  this    i know about vista print and moo both suck but i want to know what other people use for their printing needs
  did you just graduate or something
and that is not something gpu heavy like deepfake i just want a black box or pixelated box that censors things and tracks them i will download whatever program is needed as long as it not extremely difficult to do
motion tracking in after effects
  thanks but is it reliablein the sense that it wont make mistakes and does it require big amount of effort to use
fampai have you ever watched japanese porn    have you ever watched the nightly news
  true xd
  xd
  
  yes if you know what youre doing  no
  use mocha for after effects
  if its not too complicated you probably can get away with premiere pros masking tool its as simple as it gets    after effects is more robust but theres a learning curve for beginners more so for mocha
does anyone know what programs would be good for animation specifically geometric shit like those trippy gifs you see on google sometimes i was looking at maxon 4d but that looks like more than ill need will illustrator and after effects be enough what else would you suggest maybe tutorials as well
  they tend to combine 3d c4d or blender ae photoshop and sometimes ai but not likely maybe post some examples of what you want to make your pic is probably just photoshop
  not op but id love some leads on how to make something like this
  forgot pic lol
  artists in particular id like to replicate include yoshi sodeoka and ezra miller
  i was hoping to make something like this in particular
  yeah probably photoshop for making assets and aftereffects is all you need plus webmconverter or handbrake if you want to upload to youtube i dont think theres a single tutorial for those so youll just have to experiment and try out different tools  usually for learning after effects people learn with video copilots free course but that more for movie effects so try it if you want some tuts/vids              
  thanks a lot for this stuff man i have no idea how you found all this but its perfect man thank you so much
heres what i ended up making thanks again for the help
  nice one it could be better if it was a loop but i know it could be hard to make it seamless also if you want try learning how to use precomps theyre really useful    heres some tips for that        source of webm  
photoshop  hitfilm express after effect and premiere equivalent in 1 free to download software
blender is what i use
  toon boom  classic vector and more animation  flash and that new adobe program strainght for animation  vector animation mostly  after effects  motion graphics
  i think that stuff is generative art made with code but as everybody is saying can probably replicate    the effects on ae
heya /gd/ i am trying to make my own font i have drawn out the related jpg in hopes of using that how can i go about making my own font but more than that make it so the pc will automatically convert grouped letters into the new characters th sh gh ou all have their own character in this script ultimately this is for dd and i just want to be able to use it more easily even if that comes with more work up front
  
26  27
  the easiest way to fit arbitrary new letters into a font is just to map them to unusued points say for ease of memory chx ghh oou ouu quq shc thy greek and derived languages use x for ch to begin with and english once had þ which looks almost identical to y when handwritten for th  for japanese fonts for example most professional ones rely on complex input conversion software but most amateur ones simply present themselves as english fonts that happen to draw か when you press q て when you press w and so on matching the printing on the keyboard to the display on the screen even though the computer is internally representing it as iyb rather than にほんご    you can then use simple findandreplace or better yet an office macro or regexp to convert automatically    as an actualgd aside id spend a moment thinking about how your script is meant to be physically written ideally using a brush or calligraphy pen or chisel i think youll find that the first is poor at closed loops the second at diagonals and the third at curves and decide to modify it based on whichever is predominant
  thank you very much for the advice
  also worth noting theres nothing preventing it from having an upper and lower case our upper and lower cases derived from proper blocky no curve smaller than a segment of a circle half the letter height inscription form easy to carve with a chisel vs more variable curvier tailed rather than serifed form easier to write at speed with a pen    if you do this of course it limits your ability to use upper/lowercase for added gylphs with similar sounds but youve still got a wide variety of symbols like  presumably your world doesnt use dollars or  and  ligatures of at and et presumably would appear in your system as things like  with two /s through it and  with two s
struggling to find a font like this can anyone help out been searching for things like 70s font hippie font everything i find is way off or just has ridiculous curls and flourishes on it thanks
maybe try neon fonts
  thats royal acid from the rolling stones logo just make it outlined on illustrator or photoshop
brilliant
  it certainly is memorable
  trumps a blowhard but the maximum butthurt this generates among the left is truly impressive  sometimes i wonder had he chosen a different motto would they still be as outraged or is there something about these four words that cuts straight to their souls
  i was talking about the hat mostly
i think this one is damn good as well
    primarily because its indefensible if you agree with make america great again youre an idiot
  nah it more that it makes libshits say america was never great etc and then have to backtrack stay mad faggot
  make america great again is a dog whistle for make america white again
  great  white  arent they the same thing
  not because of the design but because of the big man himself
  ladies and gentlemen your run of the mill sub50 iq reddit tourist
how did she go from intern to partner at sagmeisters design firm
youre just asking because you already have a certain answer in mind
  i want to lick her legs
she made flat illustration and used only gotham bold
she sucks a mean dick
        i mean she was 24/26 when she was named as a partner at sagmeister and walsh    name on the wall too who does that anymore its not the 60s anymore    if she is such a prodigy designer that changed the landscape of modern design how come she hasnt produced a single iconic design before and after being a partner
honestly i find sagmeisters success in the first place surprising hes a fucking hack
  she doesnt have to impress the world she just had to impress stefan which i guess she did    stefans overrated anyway imo hurr dae text but in real life
  every time he needs to promote his agency he gets naked for the magazines
    i do have some respect for what he did in the context of postmodern design but id be lying if i said i like it the whole schtick of signs vs context is like shock value it surprises you when you see it once but it gets old really quick its also really pretentious even by design standards
  you would be fooling yourself if you think everyone is not wondering the same question but is too afraid to ask because the creative industry is a liberal hugbox    a 25 year old with no professional experience goes from intern to creative director with her name on the wall theres a lot of steps in between that are missing and people are afraid to call her out
  lmao stefan can have pretty much any woman he wants at this point why would he share his entire agency with a person just for some pussy    besides is stefan even straight i get a gay vibe from him
  she was an art director before working with stefan also interned under paula sher    jealousy is weak and a key character trait of people that are ngmi
  stefan can have pretty much any woman he wants at this point  lmao
  lol is this the gmi board
  her eyes are really far apart
  is that why they call her visionary
she sort of looks like that chick who out of pity hanged out with cwc
  but he bleeds for it
  ayy lmao  but just imagine how wide opened her legs were for stefan
  so she sells meme designs to rich clients
  sagmeister metoo when    surely she would want to take over his business or maybe not because she lacks the talent to run it on her own
because hes an ugly hack and he needs an attractive hack for the face of his business which is something you design nerds dont k ow a damn thing aboot
  yes op probably has something in mind a thread about it would be a great place to offer evidence in the opposite direction wouldnt it why arent you offering any
  one word yoko ono
  attractive hack  what the fuck man  that is in no way attractive
peggy olson
  bingo
  kek
  how desperate do you have to be to promote your new agency like this
  and this is how they announce when moving to a new address    what a joke
  what is this image trying to convey after sex bug collection
  what is this image trying to convey  its in ny so thats what youre going to get therecockroaches and pollution
  
  sagmeisters design firm    
  what makes their work better   what makes her work better 
      who the fuck even agrees to hire their agency they should be laughed out of the industry
  sagmeister and walsh        why
      
  kneepads
  nice meme
  10/10 boobies tho
  after ten beers
  lots of antitrump sjw bullshit and terribly mediocre design overall how do these people make money zero talent
  that poor photoshop tho
  how do these people make money  ive noticed the same pattern in many liberal design houses in usa yet i too fail to understand how they get work in the first place and its not any job either always high profile companies call them
  pentagram has outsourced to them a few times no wonder pentagram are the biggest hacks in the game
  because sex    that is all there is to it move on

why are top graphic designers such insufferable wankers /gd/  they never seem design anything clean functional and pleasant its always edgy modernart bullshit  their work is bad enough but then they promote themselves by getting their cocks out    its shit like this that makes me embarrassed to say i work as a designer outside of actual interviews and shit i always pretend im a frontend dev to avoid being lumped in with these insufferable faggots
  pleasant    effective design isnt necessarily pleasant
  true but literally everything agencies like this produces seems to be jarring no decent branding for actual products that anyones heard of or companies anyone cares about no quality web design just horrid lurid shit on shitty books and magazine covers
    i cant wait to see what you consider good design
  hi stefan
i heard an interview between walsh and debbie millman and walsh struck me as an incredibly out of touch product of extreme privilege she comes from a wealthy cultured family that allowed her access to the best education and opportunities on offer so its no surprise that she achieved this level of success at such a young age she would have had to have been a complete failure to have done otherwise
  yeah thats the kind of vibe i was getting from her
is this another sex and glory kind of chapter     im bored anyone hire me i am from singapore    teoboonhow dot com
maybe its not such a good idea to post this here but i will  the case is im not good at drawing and editing a bit but im interested in the graphic design career for the simple fact of the money you can earn its worth noting that i live in mexico my problem is if i necessarily need to know all that or over time in the faculty he taught me so much or i chose another career
its never late to learn something and you can learn this also id suggest you start learning adobe photoshop and adobe illustrator  learn whats raster and whats vector image  its a broad term post more questions ill answer them
  unless you can get on one of the top design colleges artcenter risd sva pratt institute calarts saic etc is just not worth studying graphic design unless youre really good at making connections  if you want to pursue a designer career youll either go with visual communications or computer science etc it depends of your interests then you can learn graphic design on the side nowadays you can get some design 101 courses from lynda/piratebay and youll learn faster and better than almost any college basically only us or northeuropeans colleges are worth the investment you can be a designer and start making money within a couple of weeks to make real or decent money though youll need a good portfolio and learn about dealing with clients/freelancing browse behancenet for examples and search for the art of freelancing
  t will be a good idea to study graphic design  no
hello guys i am an freelancer without any work can you please check out my portfolio    and tell me what i need to focus more on and how to get clients currently i really need some money
  not bad i liked them but they are a bit amateur and abstract to get any attention i would suggest you split your commercial work from your personal artwork since most times your personal style could take years before you can cash on it     since you seem to have experience with mockups/printing i would suggest youll focus on branding/stationary or just make a cool design that can be used anywhwere and make mockups for stuff like a phone background business card posters letterhead etc and maybe even on a website that would show your potential clients that your works are adaptable to any medium also for logos ill suggest youll make a few ver minimalistic ones just a modern font/startup name and an original small abstract icon on the left thats what clients usually want    wedding and editorial stuff pays well but is a nightmare to work on i would stay away from them    also listen to this audio he gives great tips for freelancing a sample is on youtube the full thing cost 60 i think      and some heres some really useful videos          for getting quick cash theres sites like freelancercom upwork etc just bid on projects that youre good at  also having your own website will help you a lot it ads a lot of value for your brand

how accurate is this thread    
  its accurate if you put yourself in that position  the only time i received a call for work is  if original op had a good portfolio this wouldnt be a problem  sure its an oversaturated industry since everyones nephew can put some shit together in ps/ai but its full of hacks if you arent one youself you should be able to get a few calls  as a fresh out of college anon you will probably be underpaid for the job most advertising agencies have a predatory pyramidal scheme but doing free internships is plain stupid if you are over 16 years old    so work on your portfolio every single day  you are never done with it it just evolves over time  and im not saying that you stressout doing portfolio worthy shit just create something every day whatever you want eventually youll end up with a couple of very good ones put 5 or so of those on a neat website and you should be dandy  picrelated
  how do you know if youre a hack
  are you proud of your shit or just content with it not being vomit inducing
  is it decent do you think its decent compare it to the best graphic design work youve seen and ask yourself if you compare in anyway keep up with trends and always know what people are looking for when it comes to advertising and logos as anon said have a simple clean website with a few of your best / recent pieces and take yourself seriously so other people will do the same dont be afraid to put yourself out there its like website building probably anyone could do it but only those who really have an eye for design excel at it
  but then you can just use a template and not pay someone who needs a computer to draw jack shit
good read what a bunch of losers it opened my eyes for who are the people that constantly trash the great work of the great design studios and firms its all because of jealousy and anger from i dont understand these kind of people you dont go to university to get a job you go there for yourself in order to understand yourself to explore to learn and grow most of these people go there to get a diploma and then wonder why no one hires them well if no one wants you then start your own thing and then you will discover you true inability and lack of knowledge in other words you suck

im on the same boat as the guy that said it took him 8 months after college to find a job it took me about 7 months that whole time i autistically worked on my portfolio and website and made it look really good you know for someone whos fresh out of school im only making 15 bucks an hour right now but at least i have somewhere to start and love what im doing
  15 bucks an hour  thats pretty good
  are you proud of your shit or just content with it not being vomit inducing    some of the best think their shit is terrible and some of the worst think everything they do is golden trusting you to judge your own work can go super wrong

take a break sit somewhere peacefully and try to relax after that speak out your intent finding an idea for your logo close your eyes and just observe whatever comes to the senses ohja keep a pen and paper nearby to write the ideas/images down success

im studying towards being a graphic designer and im wondering how much does a full time professional graphic designer make per year spare me the comments of you dont do this for the money you do it because you love it bla bla i already know that im just curious about how much i might make
i make 40 an hour im good at what i do graduated top of my class with an amazing portfolio i know i could make more as a freelancer but the work wouldnt be as steady i know some colleges who are making 17  25 an hour that seems to be the standard for entry level graphic design jobs
  23k a year   know people who were offered 17k as a junior
why are there no nonshit font managers out there   ive tried suitcase fontbase and nexusfonts and there is always something about each one that either breaks or slows down to the point it becomes useless only ever been happy with font explorer x but thats only on mac  so yeah  what font manager do you use  do you like it
  nexusfont also ive been hearing from designers that they only use/have less than 50 font families i think it was vinelli who said he only used 12 in his career mostly helvetica
  its not only about the number of fonts you have/use font managers make it easy to see how a string of text looks like in many different fonts at a time that is very important     personally though in general i dont use too many different fonts either 50 sounds about right even less but when you are making a logo for example its nice to go through a couple of hundred fonts first to see what fits and you can do that the fastest with a font manager it might even give you some ideas about interesting ways to draw and intertwine the letters if you go through some nonstandard ones
the one built inside windows 10 is good enough
  having tried a bunch i tend to agree its not that bad after all
  its good to have a limited set of things you trust and which flatter your other habits when youre in the position to lead designs and afford what you want    but if youre dealing with clients with established designs or trying to do things on the cheap the pool of what you have to deal with grows massively especially if youre also doing lowbudget projects and relying on free or discounted typefaces to replace what would be handlettered or stenciled if more time was available    some of us also work in multiple character sets which can multiply the number of families exponentially  not only do you need your top 50 latin your top 50 cyrillic your top 50 cjk and your top 50 kanaonly say you also often have use cases like a latin face you dont really like standalone but blends well with a cjk face you do

      minimalism is ruining design these days google pepsi ebay microsoft etc all just flat font logos with nothing else pure cancer
  i love minimalism and i hope it doesnt go away any time soon minimalism is hard to do well everybody should begin able to do with less before they attempt to do with more   by the way minimalism isnt why the second logo is worse than the first

  this all art is a waste of time black text on a white background and red for important text that is all we need everything should be flat and blank texture culture history etc should just be forgotten and erased wherever it remains tradition is a crutch i dream of a world where the only barrier to becoming a professional designer is buying a license for lowercase helvetica
  texture culture history  tradition  ah yes we had so much of that in early 2000s logo design and now its all gone the timeless tradition of the glossy gradient and the layered metatextual connotations of the drop shadow all those starving designers sleeping on the street warming their hands by the flame of their graphic design college diplomas forced out of work by corporate designbots with one font installed in a flat shadowless sansserif dystopia

hello /gd/     im new to photoshop and i want to try some easy effects     looking for something easy to start with i tried the turn to stone effect thinking it would work well     this is as far as ive gone but the hair eyes and eyebrows look awful     how can i work with that to create a real petrification effect    any ideas/tips    source pics in the next posts in case you want to show something with my picture
dark hair is proving to be a problem but i dont want the easy way out of choosing blonde models there must be a way here     so far ive    selected the model   desaturated   pasted texture into selection and chosen multiply as blending mode     where can i go from there    thanks
and the texture ive used thanks for any tips you can give or show me
  kinda lazy to cut it all right now heres a half baked pic  separate the image in pieces exposed skin hair clothes  desaturate the entire skin and hair apply a filter to the hair so it looks more like stone apply a different texture for the hair and eyes all the skin should have the same texture  now you have to play with the levels and saturation of the texture itself when this is done add some details like blank eyes and shadows and there you go
  well thanks a lot for you input    two questions    which filter would you use on the hair   is there a way to make very dark hair look the same light colour as the skin thats the part ive not been able to do     if anyone else wants to help ill be watching this thread regularly thanks to all
interested
op here checking the thread daily keep it up
  you need a better texture  clip it to the layer and puppet wark it around the curved parts
i lazily started one    hair clothing accessories will be the toughest part youll have to go in and replace them entirely using the skin as a base texture/color then overlay some of the details from the actual hair    surface blur will smooth out some of the textures so that it all starts to blend together and look like one solid piece of stone
    thanks a lot for your help ill try your tips too    thing is what would be the best way to make what you say about the hair making it the same color as the skin while keeping the details an unfinished example would be enough feel free to use my pictures for it     also any texture recommendations
  i just masked out hair and top put a threshold layer on top then the texture layer with no filter clipping each layer    im just doing this on the fly maybe id go about this totally different if i spent more time on it
  thanks for the time youve spent on this    which settings do you use on the threshold layer

some good things here but still too flat
  op here     youve found the same problems ive found dear anon     how can one make very dark hair or lips look the same light grey colour as the skin without making it look flat    thats why i opened the thread
try to use images like this to generate the stone look you can achieve it with these kind of images by playing with the blending modes id also advice you to grey out the eyes since statues usually dont have irises     the problem with the hair can be resolved by using your pen tool to make a cutout and changing the lightness or you can use the dodge tool to lighten it look up some tutorials online and combine them if you look up lighten hair color photoshop tutorial you should be able to get a proper tutorial good luck
i made this a while back while i was still inexperienced in photoshop i think it came straight from a tutorial
  its good but what about the eyelids eyebrows and hair    i want to make them look petrified and the same colour as the rest of the skin without distorting the persons face     im thinking is there an easy way to turn a person into lineart that might help
  looks realy good but since stone cant grow hair you might wanna get rid of it or replace it with like moss or something since you used a old stone texture
    id say its a contrast thing if you look at the chin and bottom lip its starting to work     its also why the eyes look funky because thats where the only blacks are     left eyebrow is starting to take shape even though i was sloppy     but in this kind of project youll need to up the contrast
promising thread this one
  id say yes every time i scroll by this thread it directly reminds of horrible 3d art or photoshops of exactly the same thing id come by on sadpanda or deviantart down to the quality of execution imagine someone is so autistic and bad at blender photoshop or some posing program that the uncanny result hes capable to produce by changing materials / textures or colors of stock assets eventually gets his dick hard
  op here    i just saw the effect online and thought it was cool and easy enough to do so im asking how to overcome the difficulties ive found     if someone wants to fap with the resulting pictures i dont care at all its the internet everyone faps to the weirdest shit    even more what makes you think that nobody has ever fapped to the picture youve just posted
  what makes you think that nobody has ever fapped to the picture youve just posted
    dont lighten all the pic or detail will be lost use dodge tool on the dark areas    also look into displace  also add shadows later on another layer
  find edges might get you into the lineart direction
  and ill fap to that dog too

  being so fucking sensitive you cant take a joke  please please please go back to fucking tumblr you little bitch

re
back to page 1
  fuck off  as soon as i googled and found at least 3 video tutorials worth watching your thread become invalid
  op here none of those tutorials addresses the problems im having with the hair and eyebrows thats why i made this thread
    oh right if only someone addressed this issue for you
  if i use dodge tool details are lost instantly its not that simple friendo
  then turn down the opacity of the dodge tool    you want this spoon fed to you dont you
  not really im just a noob at ps
bump
  i would use the burn/dodge tool for all the dark spot to get the shadows lighter
  but it destroys the lights and shadows coherence on the image
up
  you really are a complete idiot
  lol why the hostility though
  if you think that was me being hostile please dont visit any of the other boards i was just stating the obvious
  why is it obvious
  obviously it aint to you and your special needs brain    there is enough info in this thread for some with basic ps knowledge if this thread confused you or you cant get the info you need from it you fucking shouldnt b here

i think i made it worse in mk2    maybe this
      these are way off they look more like a sketch filter
  perchance  did i strike a sore nerve
  op here still monitoring the thread and happy that people post on it thanks to all of you    lets see if someone can solve how to petrify dark haired people
yall a bunch of niggas who cant petrify a girl proper    photoshop aint the way just call medusa
just member to petrify your bae if you catch her with some fuckboy    and yea these two be brunette bitches
    do you wank to this  asking for a friend
  yesh my negro
    how the fuck did you do that
    goddammit thats perfect how
  this is not an easy effect at all    im not even sure if its possible to successfully turn a person to stone with photoshop as that requires changing material lighting etc seems like its more suited for a 3d rendering program    if you want to brush up on your photoshop skills i suggest checking out psdtuts go to their photoshop tutorials section some of them are really good and useful to try
  this isnt your recycle bin this is a thread
yo   look at  and  and tell me its impossible to make a good petrification effect with a straight face
  leave him alone you can tell he just wanted to be a part of something but knew fuck all about it
     i want to try some easy effects      this is not an easy effect
  not op dude
layer blending modes  product     this thing does miracle
  and the idiot award goes to
  how come anon  im still learning
    stone is all one color retards look at a statue stone doesnt have dark hair or light hair stone doesnt have dark eyes stone doesnt have dark eyebrows so you have to eliminate those color discrepancies
blending modes yes but most importantly well crafted displacement maps you apply to the texture before you add a blending mode to it    
  thanks now the question is    how the fuck do you do that
    all this including displacement got mentioned 3 months ago in here and he still hasnt learned a fucking thing he still bumps he still asks question he is a fucking retard if in 3 months i didnt master this on my own i would be embarrassed
  op here ive learned a lot of things and im quite grateful but i havent posted the solutions ive found because this is one of the few threads on /gd/ that has actual content and im enjoying the discussion     have a nice day d
  you too
guys if you turned a girl into stone and she had smelly armpits before petrification do you think her petrified armpits would smell like delicious sweat or not    i mean the person turns into stone but the clothes and everything surrounding it are not petrified the sweat and filth would be already outside of her so they should be spared from being turned to stone     what do you think
  i think you are retarded and desperate for friends
  yes but her deodorant is spared the petrifying process too so its all good
  thats how great minds work
  this anon gets it     pic related is my halfarsed attempt but keeping these principals in mind with some time you could get a reasonable result     my process involved getting rid of detailed features such as eyelashes iris/pupil and other shit you wouldnt see on a statue then using curve adjustment layers with masking to target specific parts of the subject such as the dress hair and get all tonal values within a close range overlay a texture and liquify    hope that helps op
  op here it does help    the idea is very good and although it looks more like sand than stone due to the texture the process seems well thought and the details are well done    thanks for it lets see what others can make
  dude
  man
  step one get a big block of marble    this clearly isnt just a couple filters the hair was almost certainly manually redrawn it doesnt have the same shape as natural hair     op here  how badly do you want this petrification effect
  op here i want to see how good the effect can get i want to see different peoples ideas what can you offer matey
  not friendship now get a life and fuck off
  hostility to internet strangers is so futile any tips on the effect
  you could of took a course and passed in the 3 months this threads been active you just sound desperate for friends
  lol    if you think replying to a thread every two or three days is a way of making friends
  the fuck does a course have to do with it you projecting cunt stick guy just wants to know how to produce an effect and after 3 months there hasnt really been a well constructed solution fuck off seriously
this thread
  no information in this thread lol there is plenty to go off and look up three fucking months waiting for the answer to be spelled out in some dumb cunts language so he can absorb it this fucking thread lol
itt    the absolute state of /gd/
  is that ironically bad or were you trying
in every attempt the biggest problem was the hair and bathing suit the second to last image uploaded did an alright job of mimicking the texture of granite on her skin but the bathing suit and hair were awful most granite sculptures ive seen simplify the texture of things so they look smooth you need to find a way to still show that she has hair but simplify it have less texture and value you would probably be better off just learning how to draw and drawing it yourself
  op here thanks your reply is very insightful we face two problems here   making the whole statue more or less the same colour fixing the dark and light parts    adding details like the ones shown on  in order to make the picture look more like a person has been petrified than a normal statue   drawing those details is always an option and i reckon thats the way its done on the picture i linked to but im sure there is a way to make it with filters and adjustments     lets see what others can make
    t unironically think that i would spend a more than 5 minutes for this image
  lets see what others can make  now i see your plan this is an advice board not a request board
my selection was very weak

  couple mins in gimp
how is it done thread    post your questions regarding styles and techniques youd like to know how to create    i actually figured out how to make pic related before i got to post this thread ill post it when i get the time
  youre a fucking retard
  do you have time now you fucking prick
  in after effects  soft shapes  gradients  easy ease transforms  blur everything    for the small focus areas green  copy a shape  remove its blur  add a mask  blur mask
  not that guy but thanks
herr i go again    hey guys  can someone tell me how people create these types of color grading  i always wanted to know which techniques or tools are used to do this
forgot the picture
    theres a bunch of ways to do this but the simplest is to make image black and white make a new layer and with the layer make it the desired color and reduce the opacity the way this is done though is a bit more complicated forgive me since i dont have photoshop available to mess around with and havent done this technique in a while but i believe there is a specific tool that lets you take an image and create a gradient of colors that basically define the colors used for lights and shadows for example in the bottom pick the person most likely made a gradient of darkish blue used for dark and an of color yellowish white for light colors i think the tool might be gradient overlay just mess around with stuff until you find it i just remember it being really easy but cant seem to find it easily with google
  that sounds good thank you
was quickly fucking around in aftereffects and came up with this
  this looks horrible learn to easy ease
  everything actually has easy ease but as i said it was just a quick shit to test it out i dont care about the movement
  gradient maps ez pz
it looks like someone is playing with a lens in camera on some shitty blured thing
  illustrator cc 2019 has a new point gradient feature that would give similar but not the same results too bad its a buggy piece of shit

  too bad its a buggy piece of shit  damn that was the reason i wanted to get 2019 or at least wait for a torrent of it
all right /gd/ i usually have a good idea how things are done and have helped out anons in the past on here but this one has me stumped   how do you even approach creating something like this what program would you use  i ask because i find it cool and would like to create something similar  thanks in advance for any clues
  you wouldnt by chance know how to get a torrent of illustrator 2018 would you
  thats made with code not manually in a graphical program
  how/where to learn
  im the guy who asked why do you think so anon can you please expand also how does one go about learning to code to write something like this thanks
  
  check out the framework called processing
      another coding/processing question im trying to learn processing at the moment to create trippy visuals like those of the visual artist ezra miller can anybody maybe give me some leads i could check out for achieving similar effects thanks guys
  this is 3d  thats how
      gradient map
what kind of a machine is used to stamp text on hats like that  are there any smaller more portable/home use types
  can either be embroidered stitched on applied via heat transfer with a hat press or screened on    heat transfer via a portable hat press would be the best option for an athome solution but youd need a plotter or a way to get cut vinyl
saw this in a design streamanyone know what software it is
  figma
  i looked a bit into some heat press machines for stamping hats/tshirts and they are kinda expensive 150 to 200 bucks and im looking to use it for myself every now and then are there cheaper options also how do i make the prints do i need a special printer
  very smart nice
how the fuck do people make watercolour paint splashes/brush strokes
  with a paintbrush
  digitally or am i being retarded
  you paint with your paintbrush on a piece of paper then you scan it and process it via photoshop
how would one make something like this and instructional/technical images in general
    im fairly sure this could be somehow recreated in any 3d software with some sort of spiral deformer applied to splines after all 3d modelling is also code/math
  the process can vary it can be made by importing cad drawings inside a 3d program then rendering the images
  dont make us focus in the middle of the art rather glare spread
  all straight likes remain straight  the shading is flat and exaggerated dropped shadows are almost black while internal shadows are lighter than you would expect this helps the icons pop     last these icons use thick outlines and thin/lightened interior linework line hierarchy
  line weights are super important for making 3d diagrams readable
how to recreate this type of effect on photoshop
  split into three layers left right and a center band thats literally a pixel or so wide move the right side up and away transform  stretch  skew center band to meet the moved right side
  cool story bro  one sides front and ones the back

how would i remove the white background from this image in a way that retains the blurry transparent border just simply using the magic wand in photoshop looks like garbage
  you need to add a layer mask and paint out the white with a soft brush to produce the best results alternatively you can create a clipping path using the pen tool and adding a feather effect after you make your selection active however this can be very time consuming if you dont know what youre doing
  further detail on layer masks as follows  open the image in photoshopit should show as background in the layers panel click the lock icon to the right of the thumbnail to unlock this layer  below you should find a rectangular icon with a circle in the centre of it have your newly unlocked layer selected and click on this icon to add a layer mask  with the layer mask active go to your brush tool and select a soft brush from the brushes palette you can increase or decrease the hardness of the brush using the slider  when the layer mask is active the foreground and background swatches default to black and white respectively you can alternate between these by tapping x on the keyboard  black removes  white adds  with the black swatch active simply paint away the areas of the image you dont want if you unintentionally remove a part of the image you want to keep just switch to the white brush to add it back in  its good practice to use quick keys to speed up your work so use the  and  keys to decrease and increase the size of your brush as you go along when you need to get into those tighter areas or if youre removing large chunks
  and thats how a 10yo teaches another 10yo
easiest way to do it is find the source file without the effect and then re apply the effect on a transparent background save as png and youre done

since tumblr already got hold of the 19972002 design can we just skip it and go straight into the mid2000s  aldo general mid2000s thread

  people will get hold of shit as they grow up and get nostalgic 19972002 roughly coincides with childhood of people who are becoming adults today mid2000s didnt really happen that long ago but wait several years tumblr will get hold of it make it gay and you will hate that you were growing up at that era
  this
  well fuck  i was born in 98 but i have fonder memories of the mid2000s  i guess ill enjoy this while it lasts

  applel shit has always been boring  i actually like the modernist aesthetic of their productsrounded geometry plus glass/plastic/metal looks interesting enough to me  but those ads look simply bland to me they were a homage to modernism but that was the whole schtick really the late 90s and 2000s had a lot of this retro style and it simply lacked punch kinda like empty nostalgia without point the actual modernism was more interesting than this
  fuck wrong file  whatever might as well leave it because its from 2008

    what the hell is this
  this is what peak branding looks like
      imagine being this insane wagecucks really are pushed to the limit with their bullshit if something tastes good people will buy it yeah the logo as a brand statement means something but putting someone through this much autism just to make 2 half circles and a squiggly line is the most autistic form of retardation ive ever seen in my life dating things from 3000bc to pepsi electric shock therapy when
  i guess its been made just for a bombastic sales pitch to a client the rest looks like ideas for further marketing campaigns again with epic pitches   if something tastes good people will buy it  this is how i know you have no clue about advertisement at least watch some docs like art  copy
    i will admit i know nothing about advertising but to go that far into madness over 2 half circles and a squiggly line one word certifiable
  is it the weather forecast or soda theyre trying to sell
  if something tastes good people will buy it  this is true paul rand said the same thing the only reason to have a good corporate identity is why not have a good one
  paul rand said the same thing the only reason to have a good corporate identity is why not have a good one  are you the guy who posts this in every thread are by chance that same guy who made an opera poster and claims rand is the best designer ever  you seem to dismiss advertisement and branding as pointless pure statistics show the opposite a good product is not enough especially today when every brand competes with a dozen of very similar products selling just a product doesnt cut it anymore today its often about selling the idea and what people identify with   few really care if nike indeed makes the best shoes few care if beats are the best headphonesin fact they are not and yet they do outsell almost any other brand people will pick them over other brands  you also ignore the difference between design and advertisement rand with all due respect wasnt an advertiser and despite his importance design didnt end with him neither did advertising  there are cases of rebrandings which clearly show that a bad identity can ruin sales take examples from logo design lovegap tropicana new coke not to count other disastrous identitiessuch as the hut the shack which had to be reverted in mere months these show that a bad identity can provoke negative backlash and thus kill sales and its especially harmful in areas where competition is strong and image matters such as soda on the other hand good identity can help build an iconic brandsee fedex or apple for example   ignoring all this is being oblivious to reality
lets go for 2012 already
  tfw 2012 was 30 years ago  remember obama fuck im old
  whos president of the united states
  20092014 was the slow descent into madness fuck those years
  youre proving him right maga was a a solid compelling idea that got to people supporting hillary by literally following i support her creed was pointless to many  and bierut made a lot of mistakes in his career  check out mastercard rebrand
  theres nothing inherent in the hat people like it or respond to it because you saw trump always wearing it     bierut made a lot of mistakes in his career  true  check out mastercard rebrand  the mastercard rebrand was good
  so you mean good design doesnt sell first i never implied that and in fact good design alone is usually not enough to sell anything it has to come with a good ad and a decent product second politics are a different territory from consumer goods choosing a candidate is a more serious decision than what brand of beer you will have this evening  but in this particular case the candidate with the good ad actually won   trump had an excellent campaign he made an iconic slogan and iconic albeit simple merch he had a program with big simple relevant and memorable ideas that stood out and everyone even his haters knew his slogan his views and his promise to build a wall he was great at communication and he even managed to make his twitter relevant  maga is a great slogan its dramatic its a call to action it expresses leadership and a promise notice how theres no me in this slogan its not about trump its about america with 2 wordsgreat againit communicates the whole idea of nationalist conservatism its also flexible and trump often incorporates it in his speeches   i dont know but to me it sounds like a very good identity im almost sure it will be remembered for years after trump it is trump  as for hillary yes she had a good icon and better design but her campaign and im with her theres no message in her slogan theres just her as the central point the whole message of it is vote for me im a woman what does it tell you if anything why is it relevant   and what was hillarys program again did she have any big ideas to match trumps  its not all bad i admit some candidates have no slogan at all hillarys slogan communicates personal identification and this makes sense for a candidate whos about community and identity politics but still its generic as all hell a ton of other candidates could run with something similar   its not terrible its just forgettable
  people like it or respond to it because you saw trump always wearing it  do you have any arguments to back that up the hat might not be good design but plenty people bought it and its a wellknown symbol
  do you have any arguments to back that up  can i use your reply as an argument  its not good design  its a wellknown symbol
  no thats not what i meant you said people like it because trump always wears it but its far from being the main reason exposure from one person isnt the reason rather its popular because its a way to show support for trump and his agenda express political identity and to some extent personal expression because the message goes beyond just trump campaign   design and advertisement overlap to some extent as far as communication goes this cap does excellent job its become a recognizable symbol and it reached huge exposure the fact that its mocked by opposition is a testament to it as for pure aesthetic value of course its what many call boomer hat then again its very conservative downtoearth and very american so its a good fit much like something by bierut naturally fits democratic party
  now take that argument and reconcile it with the election before that
  really though    so you mean good design doesnt sell  course not   politics are a different territory from consumer goods  the president is a product  choosing a candidate is a more serious decision than what brand of beer you will have this evening  for middle america doubt it  just joking    i didnt actually want to go into maga specifically but why not im not american but to me its a silly sort of hat and if i saw someone wearing it before id seen it on trump i probably wouldnt think much of it would you   a ton of other candidates could run with something similar   well maga is just reagans campaign slogan minus a lets     none of what you said is inherent in the cap these are things people have seen in it from association to the product if hillary had won you might say its a simple square h with an arrow pointing to the future it fits into the new world of apple and nike that im with her is about solidarity it embraces every leftleaning person in their feminist sympathies      looks like were in agreement the hat becomes good after the fact the association makes the logo as far as communication goes this cap does as good a job as a nigerian scam email until trump puts it on an apple silhouette is an apple silhouette until its on a mac  how is it american under similar circumstances couldnt a greek leader use a hat like this same colours and typeface you know
  but i never really said anything regarding design per se only about the power of good communication and advertising if you ask me i think pure design only plays supportive role in establishing a symbol plenty popular symbols are actually average designs they just got a huge exposure through success of the product nevertheless i think good design is the invisible power that gives a logo a potential to become an iconic one its what makes fedex a fedex and not just another popular delivery service  in the case of hope poster though it was good communication and it was good design it was visible it was relevant it spoke to people and it was aesthetically pleasing but reducing it to sole or even main factor that won the election is misleading    the president is a product  i meant that theres a difference in how consumer decisions will impact your life grabbing a 1 drink because it has cool package is one thing but sometimes practical and other concerns outweigh other ones and in this case you decide the fate of the country for next 4 years the qualities of the product are more important to you than personal expression in this case  if i saw someone wearing it before id seen it on trump i probably wouldnt think much of it would you   i dont think youve been paying a lot of attention to 2016 election then the campaign established the cap as a symbol pretty quickly and yes we are talking about political campaigns if i saw anyone with bernie tshirt before 2016 id also ask who is bernie  none of what you said is inherent in the cap these are things people have seen in it from association to the product  how so i told you exactly what connotations the quote has theyre subjective only to small extent the meaning is rather defined and clear this is good tagline writing
  the hat becomes good after the fact the association makes the logo   youre just bent on saying its subjective and relative its not its been sold by trump campaign people bought it to wear it   your argument is take it away from the context and it loses meaning wow what a surprise yes this can be said about plenty ads brands and designs its a symbol made for a political race if it wasnt for obama hope poster would lose its meaning too it would also look weird before 2008  how is it american   baseball caps are part of american culture
  last  if hillary had won you might say   i wouldnt say anything because her campaign didnt have that impact its not as viral as trump campaign even making fun of her logo is pretty pointless because its not as instantly memorable maga had people talking h with arrow didnt  its a simple square h with an arrow pointing to the future  yes it is that indeed  it fits into the new world of apple and nike   taken out of your ass  that im with her is about solidarity  yes to some extent  it embraces every leftleaning person in their feminist sympathies  no it simply states that the candidate is a woman clinton campaign apparently treated it as a major selling point
      not sure how to respond to this now do you think im attacking trump    if the fedex logo was in old english itd still be accepted if it was used everywhere and seen everywhere    i told you exactly what connotations the quote has  a connotation is inherently subjective if you show the apple logo to 10 people each will have a different opinion  baseball caps are part of american culture  fair enough   taken out of your ass  thats the whole point
  do you think im attacking trump  no i think youre ridiculing the hat despite its been very successful for political merchandise   if the fedex logo was in old english itd still be accepted  not really what helped it become iconic was its simplicity with a small punchlinethe arrow  very few bad logos actually become iconic compare it to any other delivery logo they arent as popular  a connotation is inherently subjective   to some extent yes any symbol is by definition is subjective to some degree but thats like saying words meanings are entirely subjective then why even write or read the whole point of communication would be broken this attitude of total subjectivity is misleading  classic examplecompare word and clique denotation is the same but the connotations are different are you saying they are entirely subjective   there will be some degree of subjectivity to any symbol be it a word or a sign or anything else but the goal of successful communication is to make the meaning as defined as possible to control peoples readings of a work and their associations its not always easy to measure how successfully a work accomplish that but this is why companies care about words associated with them and their products and they do care a lot this is what they seek to accomplish with their communicationsto create particular associations and change other ones  if you show the apple logo to 10 people each will have a different opinion  but thats a logo a logo is not an ad it is but a symbol of a particular company or product its just a part of overall image which is defined much clearer with ads a logo usually serves as an identification mark and it should be recognizable and easily associated with a company but thats about itits a signature
  i think youre ridiculing the hat  ridiculing is a bit strong    an arrow eh and you never really see fedex in england the royal mail logo is probably much more iconic here anyway the really good delivery logo was the old ups one
  theres nothing inherent in the hat people like it or respond to it because you saw trump always wearing it  wasnt talking about something inherent in the hat the maga itself is an idea people can get behind as opposed to hillarys slogan in a war of two taglines only trumps made some sort of a promise laid out a vision even if simple and copied from reagan  the mastercard rebrand was good  was not the logo itself works fine itll be obsolete in a while but whatever check out pic related though  it works terrible on dark backgrounds because it lacks the drop shadow that created a safe space in the old logos and because of that it has to be used like this it looks awful and doesnt even look like the mastercard logo itself
  a lot of people did get behind her though didnt they people can get behind anything really they got behind sieg hiel in europe 70 years ago    i dont think youre right about that by the way it was quite good as far as rebrands go
  you on some crack fedex is one of the more popular shipping companies
  a lot of people did get behind her though didnt they people can get behind anything really they got behind sieg hiel in europe 70 years ago  hitler didnt get to power under a heil hitler slogan though did you forget what the nazi emblem was and that it represented some ideas as well    and people got behind her sure but which one of the two slogans became something representative of the candidate used by their supporters outside of conventions and showed an actual goal of their eventual presidency  im with her says nothing except i support hillary its not a call to action it doesnt say what she will do as president or what are her values in the slightest something you should use to show support has one message i show support its redundant uninspiring and has zero impressive function
  hitler didnt get to power under a heil hitler slogan though  that was rhetorical
yeah i had this phone and i really liked its design that was back in 2008 and it also had some nice games in it
  thats what i said whos on crack again i mean that there are other successful companies but only fedex has made an iconic logo
  imagine no advertiser would dare casually showing a drop of their typical samshit/ishit slab of glassminum on pavement nowadays
  man this is such a good ad    makes a real point instead of just hey look at all the different ethnicities and lifestyles that can enjoy our telephone maybe you should be like them
web 15
  what about midcentury modernism
  looks very nice  a bit abstract but also straightforward
  i used to have this as my home page back in the day  they had a shit ton of flash games mostly stolen from newgrounds
  those mid 2000s phone games were comfy cant believe they were so expensive though didnt they all run like 5 dollars         shit i miss the old windows media music interfaces with its primitive visualizers is there anyway to get those on new oss i remember one called lava or something i liked it really felt like it was the future as a kid having a laptop and playing your music with those shitty visuals on screen      i think their page still holds up today surprisingly i go back for nostalgia every few months they kind of ruined radial stripes for me though
  netvibes was superior to this garbage
  but those ads look simply bland to me they were a homage to modernism but that was the whole schtick really the late 90s and 2000s had a lot of this retro style and it simply lacked punch  not very different from the products themselves
  if anything the colored 2nd gen ipod nanos had more personality that any pocket apple sized product since that guy was a fucking retard
    oh yeah i remember these came out in the heat of the sexual revolution  s l i g h t l y e r o t i c
  in the heat of the sexual revolution  the 60s
  radio  computer  always gets me 2bh
    the 2nd phase (((they))) became bold from 1990 to 2007  you know where music videos became basically porn and the movie industry only spawned sex themed movies
  ariel pink is hypnagogic pop which is kind of a precursor to vaporwave
    
  
  they could use plastic screens to falsely advertise durability and then blame the user for not taking proper care of the phone
  gets me every time
  honestly i think this was the most iconic ad campaign apple ever made
  grew up on this fond memories rest in peace depthcore in cms etc
  i beg to differ
  very true
i liked the silver aesthetic of tech from the 2000s the most   
      miss my palm pilot
  the whole aerodynamically molded chinkplastic volumes thing seems to have really kicked in 2000s
  the mid 2000s style was cold bland dogshit that looked like it was created by corporate executives and i fucking hate it you can do detailed skeuomorphic design without it looking cold and dead    pic related its realistic and three dimensional but doesnt make me want to kill myself    also who the fuck cares if tumblr likes something tumblr can go fuck itself for all i care
  forgot my pic
im getting tired of graphic trends and revivals in general come up with your own style you lazy fucks
  just scanline my shit up senpai
skeumorphic era was just a nightmare desu
  lel
  but thats mid 2000s
  enough shit has been thrown on skeuomorphism but even without its gimp look i really hate this approach  we just have to reference real life objects the user simply cannot understand computer program as something abstract how else would you understand its a note app but with familiar yellow paper  what do they think its my first time seeing a computer its like theyre making these interfaces for old people who avoid all tech like fire for fucks sake even babies use tech now yeah imagine human mind doesnt just panic and turn off when it encounters a computer  im so glad forstall is gone
the early 2000 were the last period where experimentation was a thing too bad i was born to late to experience a world pre 2001    shit was ugly as fuck but i still have good memories of it a sense of freshness
  underageb
  its like theyre making these interfaces for old people who avoid all tech like fire  werent they
  macs are for old people  ummm i dont think old people buy macs
  even babies use tech now  thats the point of that approach retard
  i meant that babies are already familiar with computers perhaps more than with many real objects that skeuomorphists think they should relate to
  i miss my iphone 3 best one i had
  i meant that babies are already familiar with computers    not him but babies and general normiesphere are only familiar with above mentioned digital interfaces meant for streaming content by content creators consumption in 16 by 9 not computers its unacceptable to sit down and learn general concepts and any sort of safety of using computers its unacceptable if one isnt allowed to poke around colorful shit right away after unpackaging one from amazon nobody knows or would want to know how them computers work they want tv computers are marketed like tv  what is a filesystem  what is a zip archive  why is my bank account being perpetually drained by weird firms after my kid used my credit card for buying roblox that money  how did they knew my phone number    to be fair nothing comes with a nice comprehensible manual anymore
  this is some raw unfiltered autism right there
  youre very smart
  this
  i miss these _
    barfed a little    not so bad actually with a bit more polish and slightly less gloss couldve been gr8
  i used to have one of these  it died because it fell on the toilet
  wtf was microsoft thinking i would never associate an operating system with fun in my home like thats not a thing i keep in my living room and tell people wanna have some fun with this crazy new os that too windows vista no no no
  i guess that was a different era when having a smart media center on a pc was still hot just viewing photos and watching videos on it was still relatively new and cool today its become so available on anything from tvs to watches that it doesnt surprise anyone anymore its taken for granted  vista got released in jan 2007 iphone wasnt a thing yet flip phones were still hot palm was still alive hddvd was still going broadband just overtook adsl by popularity a year or two earlier youtube launched just 2 years ago it was simply a different era only 11 years but in those years tech made a huge leap ahead
  needs more detail
  tbh 2007 was the beginning of the end
  since when has tumblr taken late 90s and early 2000s aesthetics theyre still stuck on cutesy sjw shit     link me some examples faggot because it sounds like youre talking out of your ass the tumblr boogeyman doesnt know shit about design
  just google y2k aesthetic you stupid nigger    
  its how fat people see the world
  eurobeat intensifies
  why was nazi design so good    god its beautiful
i hate mid to late2000s design but im sure its gonna become aesthetic at some point    pretty interested desu
  im pretty sure tumblr with its myriad blogs has all bases covered as far as aesthetic archiving is concerned the site isnt anywhere near as homogeneous as you make it seem
  gives an example of only one tumblr blog  bbut all of tumblr got a hold of our super secret aesthetics guys    fuck off dude stop being so paranoid of tumblr if anything its probably good that someone is archiving this like  said
  i only gave one example out of many i also told you to fucking google it are you fucking retarded
    also since you cant be fucking arsed to google shit heres another example   facebook com/groups/y2kaesthetic
  eh youre probably right i was a bit assblasted when i made this thread because of shit like this  and i thought tumblr had turned y2k design into gay sjw shit but its actually just a handful of sites and shitty blogs  besides i just wanted to make a mid2000s appreciation thread because i really liked the graphic design from back then    calm your tits my man
  im not calming anything you dumb cuck you started this thread because tumblr raped y2k design and now you want to back down  fucking zoomer cuck faggot
      le tumblr sjw boogeyman  are you all 14 how the fuck does a blog / facebook group collecting examples of an aesthetic rape it
  the first one was better
  also i agree with this guy
  because i thought they were going to destroy it like vaporwave destroyed 90s aesthetics
  you dont understand im fine with archiving what im not fine with is vaporshitters ruining raping a design of a certain era because they think theyre cool for following a design trend without understanding it im also not fine with the no transphobic ableist bullshit on the facebook group
  destroy it like vaporwave destroyed 90s aesthetics  this is like hipsters saying oh no its popular time to abandon it if they killed it for you you didnt care about it in the first place  i agree that by itself vaporwave was shit but it helped spur a huge rediscovery of 80s and 90s aesthetic made by online communityan unprecedented movement in design history this generated popular interest in the subject and spawned great blogs collecting bits of the 80s design i think this is an amazing thing for everyone who actually liked that aesthetic which had been largely forgotten before that
  gets mad at stupid shit  asked to provide examples  gets mad the burden of proof is on them    ok bro      gets mad again for no reason  provides one facebook link to prove their point  top fucking kek    its a good thing the op and you arent the same person because  op you sound like a chill dude and i will always appreciate a good late 90s  early 2000s aesthetic thread     you sir are my nigga
      he is /ourguy/
  2009 and 2012 where amazing years for music and culture bro the decline was 20142016
  2009 and 2012 where amazing years for music and culture bro  how so
  flash games were the shit if you were to poor to buy games
  im in class rn so i cant quite elaborate but to put it into perspective 2009 was peak year for posthardcore for example
  posthardcore  neck yourself
        zoomers wont even dare to fuck with the y2k aesthetic because for all they know the techniques used to make the pieces is a form of black magic unbeknownst by them
  also make your own archiving group  protip 2/3rds of the shit you need to look for is actually in magazines and thusly need to be sought out in magazine archive sites  car/product ads/computer skins/periphrials is also an aspect the hipsters havent fucked with yet
relevant
arnell can suck my dick this was the real pepsi
  holy shit this was good fuck pepsico for discontinuing it
  this will never not make me laugh
  actually not bad strip it down a little and it would look like current year
  reminds me how just not long ago type without antialiasing was the norm  it was a sad time
  had a girl confess to me on pictochat during a school trip  every fucker in the bus was trying to impersonate either of us to get the juicy infos  weird times
  lmao
4chan hasnt changed its design since its conception
  hes a hacker known as 4chan not designer known as 4chan
  gotta love that mid2000s cgi
  fuck microshit for killing userstyles
  lol
  if it aint broke
found this thanks to an anon from /wsr/  
  god windows vista was so fun
  it didnt even really make it out of mainstream wtf are you smoking
  you will never have early 2000s euphoric trance ever ever again  feels piss
    those look like toys i love them  i prefer  a bit more though
  the y2k design is simply elegant and aerodynamic looks very good  i am very upset by the current flat design shit its just a laziness mess   im glad to know that y2k aesthetics are in a state like the vaporwave used to be before companies overexploited it without even knowing what it was
shiny chrome plastik
  i wish we had stayed with skeuomorphic designs  i agree anon a lot of software i use has updated its ui to this stupid flat vector shit for example i actually use older versions of music software for the realistic buttons and knobs which are designed to mimic real life instruments and synthesizers the flat design versions look like garbage  it reminds me of some cheap smartphone game for kids instead of professional audio software
  whoops i forgot the picture this is just one example of what im talking about left is the old plugin and right is the new one i much prefer the visual design of the one on the left to be honest
  designed to mimic real life   why you people have that need ill never understand what if the people designing the first synthesisers decided to get skeuomorphic youd have buttons that looked like piano keys and knobs like violin pegs
  ok looking at these i prefer the one in the left too it has that analog look the one in the right is also skeuomorphic though
  i had an upstage it was pretty tight for its time i actually still have it but the charging port is proprietary and i lost the cord   id love to turn it back on and check out my shit from the 10th grade again
  anon when i say real life im talking about actual analog synthesizers the korg ms20 for example has a digital and physical version the digital version is an emulator that faithfully recreated the look sound and design elements of the original if someone works with the physical one i can guarantee that they will have no trouble adjusting to the digital one which is the whole point if they randomly updated the look to vector shit then it would complicate things for no reason
    idek you could put pdfs on 4chan is this a gd thing only
  this is fucking dumb but literally the perfect line of thinking for pushing your logo people eat this shit up
  its also on /po/
  silver  chrome aesthetic  man i love the look of this stuff so much i could never really explain why i like products from this time but you just pointed it out for me thank you very much anon   heres another two to look at the nintendo gamecube left released in 2001 and the nintendo ds right released in 2004
  huge
  ive always hated that cheap fucking aerodynamicallyshaped mattemetallic plastic trend of 2000s especially when the paint starts coming off  t millenial
anyone got any links to some early 2000s design threads since you cant search archivedmoe
  simple / lazy the style has a purpose its designed to be legible on really small screens    a flat circle is not only more legible on a smart phone than a realistic one it also takes up less space as the designers dont have to concern themselves with the socket around the button
  not a fan either im fairly certain it was a throwback to 60s design with real chrome due to all the boomers retiring
rate uruguayan logos dumping now ignore the fact that canal 10 has cbs logo these three are from different tv channels each other

wtf is this thread
they were truly ahead of their time back in the mid 2000s
  thats actually a nice geometric sans i like the lowercase a anyone know what it is
customer wants me to fix pic related without making any major changes is it possible
absolutely i think theres numerous ways you could go with this test things out and see what works
just simplify it bro
  did you make this in ms paint      this is really good
simplify the font its a bit hard to read
changed up the fonts a little bit from 
  the serifs on that font are still incredibly obnoxious my dude
  the font was kept since the first logo had that font
  that looks good    the customer did
  keep mat and son more symmetrical with the triangles and your pretty much done
    i would add a bit more line spacing between the triangles and the text just to let them breathe     as for the serif is it possible to replace it with something similar but less tragic
  sure just make it sharper
  fuck accidentally flipped the colors around looks too french
  r8
  made the same mistake
  why not make all the triangles the same
  why isnt the white triangle touching the point
theres only one way to go and you know it
would make a major change to the font cause that shit is horrendous
thats wide latin yer fookin zoomersshow it some respect doubt yer latos and brandons will be about in 2118
  whats the font/font type i swear its literally on every logo i see nowadays
  good    no    font kills it     i really like this one but why is the middle triangle different
  montserrat motherfucker
  cant find it anon
  are you actually retarded  the font is called montserrat that motherfucker was directed towards you
  he doesnt get it
  guys do we tell him
why not just get rid of the middle man entirely
  why is the middle triangle different  with the gap i was hoping you could see an uppercase m in the negative space it might need some refinement for that to work if the upper part of the white triangle is level with the tips of the right  left triangles you might see it
  why does it feel like theyre going to try to sell me oil
  t engineering
  its like a combination of this and marathon/chevron def feels very vaguely named petroleum company industries
do yo see the hidden m
  i see an extremely ugly logo
  no propose a complete rehaul
did what i could without changing much      this is sleek af i feel like the first one was better though      i wouldve done the same thing
  the one on the left is nice    i kinda like the others too but i dont get the one in the middle how come you have a gradient in the middle and not on the left and right triangles    the uppercase m on the right looks like shit at that size  you should consider using a different typeface
    left is okay but too dark    right is fine but very boring    middle is a complete mess
  if thats the rehaul dont propose it      why are there still replies after this /thread
  why are there still replies after this /thread  because its a good exercise and critique is always welcomed
  is it really possible to just ask 4chan to do your commissions for you how much did op make from all this
  the trick is making 4chan angry about how bad you are
trying something different but the shape looks more like an envelope when shown in black and white    anyone else seeing this
  adjusted kerning
would you buy high res png or ai of stuff similar to pic related if so how much ive got a bunch of these laying around and want to make a few extra 
  did you make these yourself
  fuck no man
  i would never pay to use something to generic however i can see a situation where id pay to have an exclusive license of it     but id probably just commission it instead of buying it from some /gd faggot
  yup
looks like drakes 6 god logo
  if you have any skull/skeleton ones i would buy from you
  there is a ton of this old timey etching/litho illustration work in the open domain due to age
  no you didnt you may have brought them into illustrator and used the live trace tool but you didnt make these yourself
  thats how things work in this industry cry about it bitch boy
  epic kek my man
  naw that shit has obviously been image traced my dude
  yea    you got a portfolio or website or something
what do you guys think of this take on the four leaf clover i like its simplicity it screams unite in my opinion it kind of calls out to me thoughts
  tell me more
this is a meme from the future you dont get it now but you will soon
  the future also thinks your a dick
is there no moderation anymore on the new 4channel
ok guys im in shit i need to deliver some photoshop and / or illustrator files of any kind modified photos recreated objects posters isometric graphics etc but i lost everything if someone wants to help me can upload something on some site like wetransfer drive etc and put the link here i know its an impossible request but its my only chance
  what  you just want random shit uploaded  and you need random shit  gtfo to  or  with your nonsense
  exactly already done
here you go

am i good enough to become a graphic designer
  
  youre as good as set mate now just wait for the work to start pouring in
  trolled softly
  srs
  unfortunately yes
  tthanks
  what am i even looking at
  rotate it upside down
    is it dino head and bones on a shelf  haha sorry just not really seeing it i think
  animal skull still life close up
  mother fucker graphic design has nothing to do with drawing pretty pictures im not even going to grade your work because it is irrelevant learn to slap together some stock photos and colors because thats all the client is going to want derivative horseshit from whatever buzzword they saw last week
  its literally part of my major curriculum
  obviously you have the capacity to become a graphic designer you just have to keep working on it and produce content / get feedback / improve
  well tough titties kid did the same thing for my degree and have yet to use my still life drawing skills for a client
  well there you have it must never be an issue then thx for clearing that up master jerkoff
  i was drunk so my apologies how is one supposed to gauge your graphic design skills based on a still life while i understand its apart of your curriculum you should post some of your design work there were other students in my glass who ran circles around me when it came to traditional art but they fell short when it came the design work keep doing what youre doing
  op here that wasnt me
  are you retarded that is not design
    isnt artistic ability a prerequisite skill to be a good designer
be me  be loser that falls in love with girl  get busy and try to keep up with life schedule since being an adult is like that sometimes  gf gets bothered when i ignore for long time  mybadwav  she says to be friends  oofzip  multiple attempts to get back  fail  last ditch attempt to get her to at least consider getting back is this shit meme i made  probsll send at midnight  wish me luck lads
this seems sad but im gonna call you a faggot
  id advise against this effort try something more mature like promising and keeping basic consideration and mutual respect    id also advise against using /gd/ to complain about nongd related topics    lastly im presuming youre not in the us because wed write it as 10/31 which is about how much id rate your chances
  wrong board fagg  nevermind this board was already shit
  31/10 is the meme ie you are beyond the maximum rating which is 10 meaning that she or he is way beautiful/handsome
  no shit sherlock im making a joke that in the usa we write mm/dd/yy instead of the more reasonable dd/mm/yy which would mean that if op wrote it the usa way it would be 10/31 and not 31/10 and furthermore ten out of 31 is not a flattering rating to give a woman or really anyone    im over explaining because i dont think your skull fused when you were a baby and that nuanced concepts like breathing while walking making reasonable bites when eating or not trying to suck more than two dicks at the same time is beyond your comprehension skill level and pay grade
  actual retard      if she doesnt respect that you need absent time shes not a keeper sorry to say she sounds like a teenager
what is the cheapest way of getting creative cloud particularly indesign and photoshop
if you are a student or someone you know is maybe he can have a good discount i got my subscription for like 50 bucks a year
  damn really the student packages ive seen have been about 200/year
  cheapest  a torrent from either   thepiratebay3org/  cgpeersto/  rutrackerorg/
  thread
just torrent it
  adobezii patch/installer
  that shit is super expensive i just canceled mine
what does /gd/ think about tui text/terminalbased ui and minimalist window managers as a way to interface with computer    im not a fan of ricing /g/ / lebbit/r/unixporn pretending to be ui designers all day but after setting things with i3gaps window manager and after using it for a few months i do find this way of doing things more contentoriented no distracting branding currentyear trend visual quirks like in windows or macos no contentoverlapping ui elements just text images videos pdfs etc in appropriately divided frames can quickly put any application fullscreen put streaming video floating in corner of the screen etc something along vim text editor key bindings seems to be pretty common way to interact with the relatively small and unixish applications that more or less just werk    too bad i have no use for this on wagecuckstation because gnu/loonix wont run all my adobes    pic related some random spergs setup with application windows thrown around in floating mode looks good in ricer screenshot but i3 is generally used with screen divided in tiles
  you write like an obnoxious faggot and a complete tool
  thanks
  i was literally trying to decipher what the fuck this post was and then i read what you said lmfao
i see it this way if im gonna use a terminal im gonna load up arch or debian dont startx and not fuck with gui at all    with that said i feel like having a user interface that doesnt make you cd to literally everything or pass arguments to open a file can be nice    doing the same thing with mice and menus but still nice for simplicity
im at the end of the project and just looking for the most appealing option of the set which of the 7 is the most appealing    by all means critique the hell out of it loading the rest behind this one
  i like 2
  whats this for
              not sure how much work actually went into this because some aspects are so so basic and crap the background on all of them is terrible is that the standards round brush on ps you used come on it looks like a child ran in and got hold of your mouse and started colouring with the white brush the boxes on the writing dont overlap enough for it to look intentionalif you are over 14 this is bad
  its for a breakcore mixtape not for pay     obviously not meant to be a long creation/edit time window also not meant for print only as album cover and zip packet jpeg
  is that the standards round brush on ps you used  remind me whats wrong with it new friend
changed 2
  lol thanks    i actually did end up doing one or two changes the one spot along the bottom of the wording was a little too obvious like how yours shows i did some minor edits and tested a gradient over a solid color shift i may actually degrade that edge similarly to how you have up top
  do you have those layer images onhand those would be pretty useful
  its mainly water wing brush the only layer under that is a forests which is pretty lost in the final edit
  heres the one where the forest is visible but i thought it was to much
  layered in here   i really appreciate the feedback i think its done now
  that background looks a lot more organic i like it
/p/hotographer here greetings from your autistic gearfag neighbours    never posted here but ive lurked for the last day or two is photo manipulation considered /gd/ anyone have interesting examples of photo manipulation beyond basic processing or ideas    dumping a few of mine would also be willing to try out any simple ideas mentioned/requested
  go away
  no u
  no u that come back is worse than your pics  anyway you asked for requests on a non request board and i gave you one
  shitpost makes more sense now i guess
  im sorry people on /p/ dont like you but this isnt the place for your crap i know you mother loves your crap bit this isnt the place for it
  i like your image dont listen to that other faggot
  oh look at that i made the same pic in 2 steps in ps i must be amazing to you too you fucking faggot
  the image is amazing to me you on the other hand are not not sure why a faggot like you assumed you must be
  this ones better too than ops
  find a pic  create a rectangular marquee all the way across  click the move tool and drag the top of the rectangle to the top  job done not clever not /gd/
photomanip is definitely /gd    a graphics designer who cant photomanip is like an artist who cant draw
  agree with the first line but not ops shite  then you just get silly

do font files installed via creative cloud reside somewhere on your computer    i downloaded a font but cannot find it in my cwindowsfonts folder where fonts are traditionally installed
  they reside inside the bowels of the cloud they are not yours to own anymore and neither is your soul its all in the terms and conditions
  once you cancel your sub your font dissapears from everywhere even ones linked in web

why do cities have logos
bordersign for the capital designed in 1980 by artist valdis celms
  tshirt  merchandise series designed by asketic agency
latvian logos over the rest few ones look too mswordclipart tier
  nu galīgi neizdevies
god i hate the typography for this
  godīgi sakot jā varbūt labākajā gadījumā der viņu starppilsētu autosatiksmes firmai vai tml    stendzinieka domu gājienā varbūt arī ir taisnība ka baštika uzceptais jūrmalas variants tās vietas kontekstā ir daudz daudz par daudz a s k ē t i s  tfu  less is fucking nothing hea lai gan parasti viņiem tādi lielā mērā pārdomāti un smukci brandingi
  because some designer out there tricked the mayor into thinking that they need a logo when in fact every city has its own coat of arms which always looks better and is more fit for the purpose
  exactly whats next logos for countries
  literally a flag
  about that
can anyone tell me what this effect might be called so i can find a tutorial on how to do it     i dont think this is something in the standard ps filters but i dont know if its an action along the line of sevenstyles either
  open ai open your pic grab the pen tool have a blast

can someone please make these letters of this logo a solid white with no shadows if you leave a little space between each letter that would be great thank you

  thanks
be me  have gf in applied arts / design  want to find gifts that are related to her field that would be both useful and enjoyable    what gift would you like to receive for christmas  what would you suggest me to find    i know its not exactly graphic design but some of you might be students or already have a job in those fields or know someone who is
drawing tablet perhaps
i just got gimp yesterday and ended up making this it was a complete fluke i have no idea how i did it or what to do next is photoshop really all that much better i liked gimp because it was simple and free just wanted to show someone and didnt know who else to show
  thats not that bad my first piece was complete trash some stuff you can do as a beginner is banners if you or your friends have twitch or youtube thats just fun and youll learn a ton of stuff also photoshop is better
  wow you used the mirror function literally kill yourself
any child can do that horrible thing you did there
  photoshop is better for graphic design while gimp is better for drawing and painting
being a graphic designer is kind of lame when people can just make logos like this with a template instead of paying some wannabe photobashing adobe illustracer user to make something equally as crappy
  then who made the template fucktard
  someone dumb enough to put themselves out of work
  ye i see what you mean the industry is definitely in trouble with these great designs
  wow it must take a degree in graphic design and 3 years study to know how to choose a nice font    opinion totally changed    thank you for enlightening me
thank god graphic designers come up with brilliant designs like this
  i was taking the piss out of op
  you failed at it
    no he didt he used a totally inappropriate font might as well have been comic sans  fairly obvious that he was taking the piss to the initiated anyway    i dont think you belong on this board
  so you think it takes a high level of creative skill to choose a better type face than that
  better type face than that  better in what way
maybe that was the last font he used and no actual thought went into it
  being a restaurant cook is kind of lame when people can just go to mcdolans and order a cheesburger
  the difference is most graphic designers suck just as much as a template
  that template looks like shit theres no transition between the ribbon pieces the marks on his abdomen dont make sense everything in there is easy as fuck to make    i could make a logo better than that in a day thats the difference
  in a day i could recreate that logo in 30 minutes or less the hard part is the concept and branding which is something templates obviously cannot give you
  you can redraw the human figure as well in 30 mins also yeah i could do it in like an hour also
  i also said better than
  if it takes you a whole day to make a logo like this you must be broke and out of work
  i said i could make better wtf can you read
  do you know how licenses work      go ahead and start a business with a templated logo looks like you found a great loophole
  you clearly dont
  you do realise most people wont even give a shit if a small corner store level business has a template logo    the only people that will say its terrible are graphic designers
  this    all you who are complaining i doubt youre even putting boots on the ground to find those small businesses and make a pitch for them to hire you    a lot of small businesses dont care because their customers dont care    you know what this family business that makes lug nuts for a highly specific use and has been for decades has many trade awards phenomenal word of mouth and top ratings from the bbb and osha this notgreat/template logo is enough to completely take a pass on them    if your response to that straw man i just created is yes exactly thats why you need a better logo youre fucking stupid and arent thinking about broader marketing beyond visual aesthetics
  you have dinner parties to hear yourself speak dont you
  nobody really cares if a small business like a family corner store has a template logo or even no logo at all    except for graphic designers who will say its a complete marketing fail despite the business doing fine without hiring a hipster to do a logo for them    for every talented designer there is like 50 wannabes who make terrible looking shit
graphic design is one of the most important parts of a buisness    its litterally not thats one of the things they tell you in design school to keep you there    nobody would go if they said    graphic design is a dying industry getting replaced by simple easy templates
quite impressive apple well done

biggest cinema chain in sweden just redesigned their logo  hmmm
  i noticed they tried to retain that neon effect but its completely lost at smaller sizes  too similar to pic related as well it was the first thing i thought of
  f
  that sucks their old logo was way better
train lines in france
the only plus side is itll photocopy well
  id love to be able to have a look at the brand identity manual crap or other marketing speak bullshit that they tried to justify themselves with
  its because the new breed of designers can only into vector
  too similar to a us party logo  why do you think that would matter in sweden
  just pointing out that theyre too similar both are shit anyone can take a letter a put in the middle of a fucking circle so whoever got paid to do these scammed the client neither one represents film nor politics and there are far stronger examples for each of these  i do wonder what their rationale was how they presented this to the client and essentially duped them into believing this had some hidden meaning behind it
s
its not about the simplicity there is alot more to it also the first one was not their original logo its just i neon sign they had infront of the cinema here is their real logo they had before     
  and that sign is a faithful representation of the logo in neon form so wtf are your on about
  theres probably an ulterior reason for that too
  if i dont speak french how am i supposed to know what the fuck these logos mean absolute retardation
  pay a designer 30000 for a new logo  could have just asked your kid to make a new one
  its not about the simplicity there is alot more to it  its true because i said so  lol faggot  the first one was not their original logo  even their website had it stylized in neon retard that was the most common look
  so you dont know how public transportation works ok
  they mean line a line b line c of the suburban train in any language
  train lines in france  are you retarded 
  looks like they gave the right grade to their own design
  kek
  imagine being this dumb
not like this will matter much but it was the first thing that popped into my mind
  reminds me of my report cards
i have to write my name here for this poster design about myself but i dont know which font fits with this design please help me choose one i have to hand it tomorrow
lato
lmao get doxed yugoslav fag
can anyone make this black background seamlessly transparent
  yes someone can but this board is not for requests try 
i would make a mask with a normal brush with low hardness
im working on my youtube channel named blunted player its about video games    unlucky i know nothing but shit about image design    looking for a decente top banner someone can give me any help giving me something basic to put there    thank you
  something basic to put there  people on here wont do anything for free /wsr/ is the request board also if you can search for youtube banner template if you look hard you might be able to find something decent  also this site has tons of pirated graphics/templates    
i guess ive been away from the gd game for too long i no longer have an adobe subscription affinity designer/photo and polarr have been adequate for my needs for awhile     now im starting a project that will require me to quickly create a number of simple animated gifs basically all i need are the same animation tools that ps had 10 years ago i need to move drawn objects around on top of a stationary background ive scoured the macos and ios app stores and still have not come up with a straight forward solution i bought a couple of cheap gif maker apps but they all basically require each frame to be animated individually in a separate program you cannot do something as simple as moving an object left to right over a specified amount of time or frames    do any of you have any recommendations ill abandon affinity and buy another year of adobe if i must i just have a hard time believing theres not a better solution thanks
  pirate ps/ae/an whatever saves you the most time  adobes suscription scheme shouldnt be encouraged
what design related websites do you browse     no behance or dribble
  itsnicethat  creativebloq  abduzeedo  arstechnica  baubauhaus  fromupnorth  graphis
  thank you    forgot to add that im focused on web design
  then try awwwards webdesignermag and net magazine
httpster
  not really web design oriented but web oriented so you find some design from time to time  smashingmagazine
  how about brutalistwebsites
im late but i use uplabs mostly they got different categories for different shit
i recently made this mandelbrot set using python turtle took me a long time to write code to interpret complex numbers
  nice i search a program which computes fractals using my graphic card
  heres mine written in c using posix threads  the colouring could use a little work
  grayscale
a scan from a book about fractals the science of fractal images  by heinzotto peitgen dietmar saupe if you want more just ask
is this any good i have no idea what i am doing/ still learning
raindeer has pp
  ok the idea is cool but it may need something to help complicate it a little bit just adding some depth and smoothing some of the effects    i think the pink haze should maybe extend up the trees from the base possibly    maybe have that as a haze coming up from the bottom and top of that horizon line something to make the trees pop a little    the height of the pink contrast could be bumped up a little higher    maybe run a blur on the grid enough to soften the line edges    maybe shade the top of the sky grid to fade it just a little further down the image    not that any of these will be necessary but the concept is interesting
nice idea but i don t like santa
  do you like the reindeer cock
  very class touch i had to zoom the image to see it
not really
  jesus fucking christ i may be new to this board  but that fucking aliasing is disgusting just convert to vector   same for that anti aliasing on the trees    moon looks like shit and could be done better with a different texture and a soft reflection of the grid
  just to add to this  youre using wrong bit more is why youre getting banding on the bottom left corner change that  if youre gonna use anti aliasing make a proper fucking layer op that looks like you literally just turned on the function and played around with the smooth and feather slide if youre using solid shapes you have zero excuse to not use contrast  you can also blend in the moon glow by blurring out the edges
  is it bad that i dont understand what you just said
rly cool for a newfagg on gd u need learn more about    theory of color  visual lenguage  photography    read more and u know how to transform this newfag shit into a masterpiece
  will do thanks
  it looks great but i would use something other than santa he seems out of place
  its supposed to be christmasy i do these for every holiday for my background
not a fan of the style or concept but i guess thats subjective swallowing that heres the only feedback you need most of these suggestions are atrocious    1 the sun should be centre aligned maybe even a bit higher than the exact middle to optically balance the trees use your best judgement after seeing both move santa up and maybe to the right slightly as well always balance things optically    2 theres a disconnect between the suns texture and everything else i would suggest changing it to a solid colour or gradient the abstract texture is out of place    3 the area where the back of the vortex overlaps with the front needs to be finessed more kinda ruins the depth of the grid try adding some shadows to seperate it more which will recall the top part fading out as well
howd you make the vortex
this thread is a contest where we post the worst logos weve ever seen  try to beat this faggots
  or this gem
  it took me a few seconds to draw it but it took me 34 years to learn how to draw it in a few seconds    paula (((scher)))
  what if this guy actually looks like that and what if his burgers actually look like that
  in case youre serious first its still ugly as fuck 2000s coreldraw second its so complex its an illustration not a logo because it scales like shit and is hardly applicable to anything third cartoons are best reserved for kids stuff not restaurants fourth portraying the owner and the product is some of the most tired ideas for a logo
  you literally described the average pizzeria   logo
  he looks like hes about to cosby that burger
here is
  most logos on this page
  the absolute state  anyone can be a designer they said
    fucking this its literally just a swiggle did a two year old draft the logo
  this one is kino
this is such a dead board
  slow doesnt mean dead
  good band
  why does he look like putin
bump
  consider that this is in cursive
bump form the dead
  what you have against paula scher 
this was from some pizza place i think
  he looks like the pizza is paining him
i made this shit a long time ago
this shit is terribly wrong and those guys want their logo on every of my production cant get it through anymore
  that grunge font is searing my corneas
  nah that shit has aged like wine from the 80s
  fuckin birth of a hero font aka every screamo bands logo in 2009
  that is not a logo  that is someone testing their mouse with the brush in mspaint
  yeah its in the wrong language
  its not that bad
  what the hell was that even for
  move aside cunts
  shut the darn up     sent from my viewsonic
    pentagram in general have the most weird logo designs like the fucking fading weight watchers rebrand
  nice bird
  mdr
  a challenger appears
  gtfo    scary shit
    mdr centrale
  what the fuck
found this absolute masterpeice doing market research
pronounced cunts  logo literally in the shape of a cunt
  its pronounced cunst though
    oh shit pizzagate 20
  can you make the list of services below the smart phones bolder so they stand out more  i know in my last round of changes that i had requested you put in the web addresses before the social media handles in case people cant tell that the icons mean facebook twitter etc but ive given it more thought and i think you should expand these to include the  in case the person looking at them cant tell that theyre websites  im not sure if using a white man as your mascot is inclusive enough can you turn him into a minority in photoshop maybe change the color of his skin so he looks asian just a suggestion
  is it bad that i like it
copying someone elses portfolio    then using it as your own work to pretend you can do it and make money    what happens if you do this    does it matter
  well first off youll had to hope your clients dont look up the image sources then youll have to hope someone doesnt call you out for copying the artwork of another designer your site could be hidden away with a dmca from google and since youre just a copy youll had a hard time getting any decent money youll probably would be more sucessful and save a lot of time by working on your own interests theres also an ethical way of stealing someones else work and make it your own check the video below    and also tons of chinese and indians have been blatantly copying designs and artworks for years they sell them for pennies so good luck competing with them    
  even if we ignore for a moment the chances of getting caught how will your make money if you cant design and if you can why not make your own portfolio it doesnt make sense to me
youll be a con artist but obviously its possible you can lie about anything you can put cv experience on your cv that you dont have get jobs youre not fit for even if those give you access to things you really shouldnt    most people are lazy they wont try to search your credibility if you get caught however and it is tied to your name you can get into some serious trouble
 however you still have a longterm game if your product isnt as good as advertised you wont get paid theyll fuck you right back
thanks for new wallpaper
i made the logo for an upcoming event in my hometown and they chose number one the event itself is aimed towards the mainstream youth 1319 and will feature artists and bands on stage with booths around selling food and clothing etc    id like to know which version you prefer and why because i was requested to be in charge of their media so there is still room for the logo to be changed thanks3
by the way its supposed to represent an abstract firefly
a friend of mine told me to combine the two so heres one like that
  i like this one better having the linework of 1 which looks nicer but the tail of 2 which looks like a guitar pick which makes sense and not like a shield  nicely done anon
  this what i was gonna say the thick lines on the other look awful and i liked this bottom bit better
i like the second one cause you can use it on different scales rather than the first one
  that one
  thanks its what i thought too the shield made it also look like a wasp rather than a firefly hahah      yeah the thick lines do make it look a lot more childish which doesnt really fit the age group haha      yeah thats the one i wanted them to use but i do realize it doesnt really reflect the cool image the event wants to have but it totally works better as an actual logo and is more visible from afar      33 yup
2nd  also what kind of software are you using its not symmetric and looks messy as fuck
  i need to make some symmetrical curved lines and circles what software did you use to draw this
2 because its a logo an needs to work at many scales 1 looks like ass when its small ref thumbnail    i would also consider removing the horizontal stripes inside the triangle for the same reason
  i use a mix of photoshop and illustrator i mostly use illustrator for vectorizing and for the actual design i use photoshop
  photoshop i wouldnt recommend my way of making logos though hahah its mostly self taught but it works for me i usually just make posters and logos for norwegian russ groups which tend to be way messier than what i made here    i would recommend learning illustrator as thats what im planning on hahah
terrible boomer and red neck design thread    i know those arent the same thing
fine art general
  /ic 
  apparently not
would you mix linseed oil with your turps
whom else here likes 16/17th century european genre scenes
  no i like my turp like i like my alcohol pure simple and easy to get high off
  there really isnt a proper art board here    /ic/ is basically just a manga illustration board    any fine art or abstract art thread gets sent to the bottom straight away because its not manga illustration
would you say this image is edited
obvious edit  light/shadows from clothes are inexistent on the face  black levels of face dont match either
  thanks yeah i know but this idiot claims its real lol found a higher quality where its super obvious
unbelievable he still claims its a real photo what the fuck do you do in these cases
  stop being autistic i guess
does anyone recognizes this font
thats not a font bro thats tagger writing
nope
  thats no font my friend thats probs just some style that the tattooist offered that he inks in
how do you live like this   
  sad sans pro
its not a source its a type of signature that is very used in graffiti
  tried and didnt work thats why i turned to /gd/
someone needs to turn this into a font now whos gonna do it do i have to do everything myself around here
what happened to the discord that /gd/ had i met some of the most helpful people on that place i got swamped with life stuff and i stopped being active as much but then when i went to go look the server was gone
server owner lost interest in it and closed it down
    theres this one but its not very lively
  can you post the link again anon    it seems to have expired
  discordgg/v5smyzg    its not a fully /gd/ one but i think its the most active one weve got left
discord is propietary privacyinvasive cianigger software that despises your freedoms
  this you should not be using discord
  dont see how its any different than this website considering all you need for an account is an email
  whats so different from skype teamspeak vent or any other communication software
  shut up dude
  rizon then /gd/s channel are long dead though
  this is the power of fretard autism
  have mor autism  
  implying i dont feed the cia loads of normie activities to create a false profile about myself
  theyve always been onto you you cant fool them
  terry is gone theyll leave us alone tho
  should i make one never been in the old one im not really a graphic designer or anything yet though but i want to get back into it
  this is not a graphic design server
  yeah its pretty lame but they share a shitload of design resources so its helpful to lurk there
  not him but i went there too and the design stuff seemed mostly dead and everyone else there wasweird also it explicitly states its not a 4chan server and has a lot of silly safe space rules
  ya i dont go anywhere outside of the resources channel
    yeah its pretty eh but im just really not that much of a fan of super huge servers where theres a constant torrent of shit happening   im working on a server now if anyoned be interested in joining
  if its gd focused then link it
    just getting it started
is there one for motion graphics
bumping
  make a new invite dude it expired unless you deleted the server
  my bad  
  hmm
  thats not that server
  my bad meant to respond to 
bumping this get in here   yeet
  i dont really know or do /gd/ but ill make a discord  fuck off you desperate cunt
  what
  
  that is not me i made the one linked in 
  lmao this thread is a clusterfuck how many shitty servers are you guys gonna fucking plug
  i agree anon they can suck on a cock
challenge design a new postracial flag to represent the southern united states that can be used to represent all races equality and does not share the historical baggage of the confederate flag whether or not it uses design elements of from the original confederate flag is up to you
impossible there will probably never be one singular element that whites and blacks can agree one thats of historical value to be used on a flag one group might find one aspect racist while another might find one aspect to be of irrelevant importance and be offended by its addition and thats not even considering how ugly it would be if you tried to accommodate these groups equally
how about this it combines the three bars of the official confederate flag a triangle formed from half of the saltire of the battle flag filled in and as an additional layer of irony its shape also resembles that of the modern flag of south africa
  why doesnt the triangle start from the corners
  because i wanted its shape to be reminiscent of the cross in op
  do you really want a southern flag or are you looking for a rural pride flag the united states is mostly divided now by population density rather than by regions for rural pride a symbol already exists and is in widespread use the browning logo its trademarked so you couldnt make a flag in an official capacity but non commercial use of the logo is so widespread in rural areas that it could eventually be in danger of losing its trademark status
why not just go with the last design of the confederate flag    ive attached a copy for us to discuss
  isnt that just the porto rican flag lol    you dumb racists dont even realize it
  pr flag has 5 stripes and 1 star but i see what youre ge  you dumb racists dont even realize it  nevermind youre a fucking idiot
how about this i want to convey a sense that the past exists but we dont dwell in it i still think that the horizontal y shape of the south african flag is the most interesting symbol of reconciliation between blacks and whites thats been created in recent history
    dont tread on me    this slogan doesnt really fit  like it or not most southern state governments dont allow for any citizen referendums have right to work laws that forbid employees from collecting royalties and everyone in those governments is still trying to lock people up over weed    the south has never respected freedom probably why slavery was such a big thing here
  porto rican
  its much freer in new york chicago washington etc no guns no fireworks cant park your car in your own driveway without current plates cant barbecue without a permit cant paint your living room without a permit the list goes on about the only thing freer up north is the freedom to have abortions in the fourth trimester    inb4 one of you yankees mistakes sarcasm for accuracy
  looks like a zipper in the process of being unzipped
  but why    and does not share the historical baggage of the confederate flag  if the states youre defining as the southern us are the states from the confederacy its inherently impossible to separate that from the historical baggage of the confederacy    maybe we should try not to romanticize half of the country turning on the other half by defining them with separating characteristics and see the whole country as one    they dont need their own flag because we all have a flag already as the usa
  the south has its own cultural identity that has existed longer than both before and after the confederacy
  words on flags are an awful idea in the first place its a symbol not a business card
  no flag that is literally just the outline of the southern states on a blank background    kinda disappointed honestly
  this is /gd/ not cyprus
art i made for an ep
    another
    if only there was 2 other threads you could of put these oh wait there is you self pruming prick
  only saw one had almost 300 thought it was dead
  make random model  uv unwrap    art
what font is this
hopper sans
one that ruins otherwise nice art
hello brothers    for a small project i need your help    i need a picture of a nice coffe table with 2 used cups on it like a coffe cup and a tea cup mugs as if 2 individuals had coffee together    focused on the table and cups    thank you very much
  
  not the right spot for this   /wsr/
post the best/most aesthetically pleasing flags old thread reached the image limit    my contribution would be the austrian flag very striking and has an amazing legend  according to legend the flag was invented by duke leopold v of austria as a consequence of his fighting during the siege of acre after a fierce battle his white surcoat was completely drenched in blood when he removed his belt the cloth beneath remained unstained revealing the combination of redwhitered so taken was he by this singular sight that he adopted the colors and scheme as his banner
  there was a referendum on changing the new zealand flag a few years back this contender red peak was a late entry but captured the attention of the nonelderly and nonmentally challenged personally i voted for this flag
  inspiration  the red building is a traditional maori meeting house marae
    i like it
my contribution is the flag of dominica
i had designed this a few years ago for the neighbourhoods in northeast minneapolis but then i moved just a little more north of ne minneapolis and lost the urgency to push forward with it    green land the mississippi and the cardinal location of that part of minneapolis as the city is bifurcated by the river
    dope
is maine the most aesthetic american flag
  move the star to the hoist instead of the fly and itll be great
the simplest flag in the world  im not always simple but when i do im a red circle
  then it wouldnt be in the northeast the star would be in uptown on the other side of the river the composition is based on the geography of minneapolis    this is something ive been thinking of quite a bit if only sewn or printed onesided it would flip when seen from the other side but if manufactured itd have to be two pieces sewn back to back which is actually pretty common when constructing outdoorready flags the dyesub shop i worked at until it closed in 2016 would do this regularly for outdoor flags especially ones that wouldnt be lowered nightly    i hope im not coming off as too defensive
the flag of my city 
  hero of the soviet union star  nice
  yep
  wtf i live here too tula right
  maori shit  thank fuck it didnt pass
  looks great with this symbolism but i feel like the flag is strangely offputting with its asymmetry something just feels off about it    pic unrelated northafrican nation flag
  triggered by a red triangle  sad
  the execution could have been made better but for me its the flag of the albanian republic    there are 14 feathers on each wing making it 28 the day it was raised 11 feathers on the tail meaning the month it was raised and 6 feathers on each head making it 12 the year it was raised in
  the flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory
  it looks like roadkill
  yes зeмляк
  flag of india plus two brown streaks by the sides  it fits
  he cant draw a two headed bird
  what about the thin black line
  simply beautiful
  the city of antwerp
  it looks like its for the city of fagtopia
  meh    awful    good so far    absolute trash
flags i have some of those
this one is pretty fucking great desu
the seychelles flag has wonderful colors
  more like the gaychelles amirite
denmark has the most aesthetic flag among simple flags in my opinion
  good god
  this
  im assuming the town is named after montpellier france in which case they have a typo for a name in addition to having a flag thats worse than aids
anyone know what this kind of style is called
i fucking love negroni    50s design
  pink panther bg core
neo 50s
itt big companies with shitty logos
  denuvo is not a big company and i think their logo is cool      this on the other hand
  so further proof that logo design dont count for shit
  logo design dont count for shit  i wouldnt say that i think the business you are in determine how important a logo is for you    for example a petrolium company probably wont need a good logo because their main source of income doesnt land with recognition while a brand like nike or coca cola lives and dies on being recognized by consumers
  lives and dies on being recognized by consumers  recognizability and good design are two completely different things dummy
  recognizability and good design are two completely different things dummy  do i really have to spell it out in detail that aesthetically pleasing logos become more recognizable because the human mind enjoys looking at them good design promotes recognizability you mong    the absolute state
  aesthetically pleasing logos become more recognizable because the human mind enjoys looking at them  lol no but i understand why you have to keep telling yourself that
  well one of us didnt go to a design school
  one of you didnt learn much beyond design school probably neither
  aesthetically pleasing logos become more recognizable  wrong again dummy  go ahead show me an unsuccessful company with a logo that everyone recognizes
  fixed for 2018
  teslajpg
  obviously unsuccessful as in nobody knows what the company is retard  nobody would recognize the tesla logo if it was the logo for something like dadi auto a great logo wouldnt magically make it a wellknown brand
are logos actually important
  yes but only after the fact after the fact that the company has become successful you cant be in the public eye and have an embarrassing logo thats mostly it though there are counterexamples even to that
  small e  what did they mean by this
garbage it probably took them 25 years of evolving shitty logos until they finally settled on this piece of shit
  you see son a valve is a sort of throttle so they throttled as it were the size of the letters now youre a designer now son dont make me have to explain this basic shit to you again
  you cant be in the public eye and have an embarrassing logo  this is how metrosexuals actually think
  wrong pretty sure its a way of portraying valv raised to the third power since e inverted is 3
  yeah youre wrong if a logo doesnt flow well then it sucks no big name company has a logo that is visually unappealing
  no big name company has a logo that is visually unappealing  didnt even read the thread  ahahahahahhahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahhaahahhaahhaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahhaahahaha

i designed this flag for a postapocalyptic american faction ive imagined theyre a religious/military organization called the knights of cheyenne  the white cross within the red represents their commitment to look beyond the bloodshed they must sometimes inflict and focus instead on its holy purpose namely to defend the weak the four stars represent the four characteristics aristotle said a hero should possess those being courage wisdom temperance and justice these guys are all about history and philosophy as well as religion  any thoughts
uninteresting if you told me this was the flag of a country or faction irl today i would believe it i dont mean that as a compliment i mean it to say that nothing about it necesarrily connects it to anytime or place for me honestly this could just as easily be some carribean or random african island country today as it can be what you said
  that was kind of the point i wanted it to look like a flag that could exist in real life
quebec
  you made a thread for what is essentially a pattern i mean thanks for that i spose i did have to remake your shitty attempt but it did only take 3 minutes
  its great
  black outlines around the stars  the black outline is really throwing me off the four stars look simultaneously too much and not enough it kinda reminds me of a chest of drawers overall its okay i guess i would go for a royal blue instead though
not really a request but an opportunity for your design to be implemented in a countrys national pension fund for eternity  troll away as they have no internet or meme knowledge
a prize will be given to the winner  sounds like peanuts piss off
  the current logo is perfect and bears no improvement what better metaphor for happiness in your twilight years than a front view of a happy penguin head
the idea is to create a logo that is hugely offensive as papua new guinean judges would not know it is
  if they dont know its offensive it means its not offensive to them who would it be offensive to then gays or feminists im pretty sure they lynch their gays and feminists there
quick question  how do i make the edges hard  posting closeup  i want to make this a wall sticker they said i should add a 2 mm green contour
  if it were me id place the raster image in illustrator and trace it using shape tools as the artwork is composed of basic geometric shapes pretty straight forward stuff even if youre a novice in illustratorit might be timeconsuming but it will be worth it in the end and you have a higher quality print    remember to turn off align to pixel grid in the transform panel because that will drive you nuts
  align to pixel grid  no option for that in transform panel using cc 2019
doing pretty well  but how will i ease the process when i want to add an extra outline to every shape
  using an earlier version here
  looking good so far    providing that you are using the same swatch for each red square you can select one square then go to the select menu select same appearance / fill / stroke etc  now you can make edits to mutiple objects at the same time without having to group or shift click every one
  bump
screw it  going to do this one  do i really have to do it from scratch or is there a way to make the colour solid and the edges crisp
  you can try vectormagic image looks crisp enough to get nice results but it might round up your corners  first one looked nicer imo
will look kinda like this
trying to recreate it in illustrator but turns out weird  what options should turn off or on snap to pixel
  turn on smart guides    it appears you are attempting to trace the entire object here  the bottom half is a mirror image of the top half so you only need to drawn one half if you follow    when said half is complete  select the object  right click  transform  reflect  choose the desired angle horizontal or vertical  click copy not ok  drag the copied object so it snaps to the other half  go to window and open pathfinder you should always keep this open  select both objects and click merge on the pathfinder window
im trying to join this piece at the right angle  how do i do it seems there are no smart guides for diagonal
  you need to determine the angle of each of object using the line tool and subtract the difference then rotate the object using this figure  see pic related drawn from one anchor point to the next and take note of the angle from each object
  how do i make the edges hard  read them soft porn stories
  right click  transform  rotate
so /gd/ lads i know most of us have had this happen so ill tell you my story 5 years ago when i had just started gd as a job    be me  be a graphic designer  about to go to bed until i get a dm on twitter  some weeb wants me to draw a trap fisting itself  debate for a moment  tell him my normal rate is 40 for characters but since ive never drawn this type of stuff its 60  dude says sure  give him my paypal and start working on this thing that literally makes me puke  3 days later  tell him its done show low res watermarked image first  he says hes not sure about how he feels and wants the hd image first  tell him that it doesnt work like that  he flips out about how im a scammer and reports me to twitter  ignore him for a few hours  he starts getting desperate and says hell kill himself if i dont give it to him  tell him to pay  he goes on a weeb rant about how his trap waifu can save the world and i need to give it to him for free  block him  he emails me on my business email and tells me hes gonna kill himself    /gd/ this was one of the worst times of my career as a graphic designer i spent days drawing something disgusting and i didnt even get paid now what are your tales
  things that didnt happen the post
    i wonder if he realized how empty a threat that is coming from anything related to japan
what do you guys do when you find yourselves lacking in motivation and/or inspiration my usual routine of lurking 4chan doesnt seem to be working    also itt post pics of shit that makes you wanna draw or oc youre proud of pic related
  oc im proud of  ok sure i made this a few years ago along with a a reasonably convincing backstory of how this lost game was found the fake company that developed it etc i had intended to circulate it as real but decided against it when a friend of mine got a little too excited about my find    what do i do when i find myself lacking in motivation and/or inspiration  i dont beat myself up about it ill write down any idea that comes to me even if i never have any intention of following through on it at the moment i also use the motivation to create something that _could_ be real as a catalyst right now im making mockups and packaging for the inexpensive toys and party supplies youd find at dollar stores halloween stores and target/walmart along with a sell sheet and sampling brochure itll be a fun portfolio piece/leavebehind and ive been sitting on the vague idea of it for almost 6 years until now    my usual routine of lurking 4chan doesnt seem to be working  then stop using it as your routine read a book in a genre you dont usually read and/or dont care for think about adding a fictional coat of paint to a real mundane product like a box of nails or instructions for a bike tire pump go outside more i believe in you stranger
  back of the box the goal was to imitate an actual gameboy game and its packaging as accurately as possible
  and the japanese title  handlettering is a fun exercise in creativity too try and see if you can imitate an english word in a different language especially one that doesnt use the romantic alphabet like hebrew or sanskrit
      this game should be built you have art layers import them       
all you need is the rest of the gbsdk files   very simple c
  motivation  i open the refrigerator
quite honestly i go to a library and look at books not just their cover design but the color of the paper used the quality of the ink the font the side wether its paperback or hardback or leather if its fit and conpact or has edges that sort of thing
  realize motivation doesnt actually exist you need to explore and develop a more diverse visual library and have the discipline to draw/design/create regardless of feeling like it   90 of what you make will be crap but quantity over quality and youll have more to pull from
  thats a nice looking book
      woah thats legit catastrophe is giving me a strong sudden desire to play my old gameboy color pics related working friend    write down any idea that comes  stop using it as your routine  and this is really sound advice more than i was hoping to get from /gd/ honestly i was expecting just to get some cool pics that make people feel stuff but it seems im lucky enough to recieve the whole package today    i went for 2 walks today instead of my usual 1 cant say its helping the sense of lethargy though        this is a very profound name      is it motivating because its empty and you wont eat if you dont draw      i love the library i think ill try this tomorrow if its open although its holidays here so it very well might be closed      discipline  yeah thats what i was looking for gonna let this be a lesson in becoming not the drawfag i want to be not the drawfag i ought to be but the drawfag i need to be if im going to fill my fridge by drawing stuff and selling it to folks in the street
    thank you i probably wont due to time constraints offline but i appreciate it      this is good advice too theres a lot of books that will call out the fonts they used or what mill their paper came from good exercise for noticing the little things you might ignore because the designer did a good job to make sure you did
  fuck motivation discipline is what you need
  fuck motivation discipline is what you need
  fuck motivation discipline is what i need
working at a law firm and ihml theres so many resources i dont know where to start looking to learn mg on my free time
  videocopilot isnt focused on motion graphics but they are good for getting familiar with ae    but you can get lots of lynda/skillshare/udemy/gumroad/etc videos from cgpeers/cgpersia/rutracker
i just purchased a wordpress theme called divi supposedly a graphic builder that allows you to easily create website with sections and more     i am trying to build my first website with it and i am trying to use css to move around the elements in this header i tried using padding and margin for them but still they move weirdly around the elements have their own css which is title body text and button and i tried to move them around with the code but the layout just seems to mess up the spacing between all of them i figured how to do it once for the text in them but then it messed up the mobile version     if anyone has any idea how to do this please help also i am not an experienced web dev by any means as you probably figured since i am asking this
look at the parent code css there could be some stuff that influences its children title button etc it could be built with flex in that case the whole section can be modified through the parent container of the header you can always resort to using positionabsolute but that will mean it will not be responsive and is a shitty solution desu
im not too sure how wordpress operates as ive only discovered one website i know of that was made using it which is some shitty thing i found on reddit called flowerchain or something looks like shit so id use a different builder tbqh    as for your question i would simply just relax and learn how to use css as it is really easy to use ive found a handful of good tutorials online for when i built a website for my college a few months ago
  check out dudaco    they are legit with their design and building sites fuck wordpress no matter what theme it is always looks like garbage plus constantly updating plugins and the site speed was awful    go to dudaco and get a site its worth it
does anyone here know how to make a website in visual studio code i have an assignment due on the 20th and it has nothing to actually do with my major i got 20 for your time if you can send me the code needed for each part of the requirements the money is yours
  wrong board go to wsr
im considering going to school to become a graphic designer should i can i find a job in the field is the pay decent i know it wont be that much but can i actually live off this/make it a real job
your indecisiveness is unattractive    choose a particular area of graphic design like layout ui production product/packaging then get granular book layout ecommerce ui catalogue production inhouse generic food packaging then get really good at that narrow focus and make your self valuable with specialized expertise in that field we dont need another graphic designer when you could be so much more
  do comp sci degree and spend all your electives on graphic design course its not that difficult you brainlet
only go to school for design if you are going to be proactive on campus  network with everyone in your field and do as much internship work as you can if you are somewhat decent it really just depends on connections in the beginning
  this  every few days we seem to get some greenhorn asking should i go to college for this shit  inevitably a lot will respond that its useless or you dont need a degree or you should shoot birds at the airport for all the use a degree will get you  but they ignore the value of networking    i would also say the value of design schooling is learning to take critique in a group session youll have to defend your decisions but learn how to finesse the urge to just block out irl people saying your work isnt good swallow courage and learn humility to ask how to git gud
  imagine paying money just to make friends
  imagine getting paid a steady paycheck for something youve invested time into because you paid to go to an institution that put you in contact with friends    stop being a whiny little pessimist
  yeah loser haha imagine paying money for friends that get your foot in the door to a successful career    no one cares if you taught yourself how to use illustrator they care about if you can deliver the product and solve their problem    without networking or having a connection you are just another nobody online that knows how to use the pen tool
    this is only part of it there are so many other factors at play in gd industry like for example where you plan on working if you like in a meatandpotatoes blue collar city no one will pay you jack shit for graphic design you basically need to live or move to a coasty state and a major metro area for your best luck    other things to but i am too lazy to type em out  i agree in essence though school is way more about what you make of it than the curriculum this can be said for any feild if you dont squeeze every drop out you are going nowhere
  why not online courses
  test
  its a decent industry right now but its going through alot of changes     getting a formal education is good if you dont have the base knowledge plus a degree looks good for employers but not necessary however i would recommend you spend as little money as possible on your design education unless its really prestigious most gd programs are not very relevant past the foundational skills     i would recommend looking into a 2 year program at a college or something to learn the basics then just build up your portfolio from there thats what will get you jobs at the end of the day
  should i stay in cali since now ive completed my degree currently at my hometown which dont really value graphic design but the working environment is a challenge that i want to experience should i move back after working a year or two or move back right away
im in a 2 year college as a graphic design major i wouldnt go to school for this if my college wasnt offering what it was we get to work with real clients as homework assignments and the focus is more on expediting your work into the real world rather than learning how to use the programs id say if you can find a college offering something like that then its worth it im also very active on campus have campus jobs etc really important dont be passive about any of this
    this is better than university fuck face
give me all you got on composition visual height and all that jazz
i know some of you know your shit about this stuff i got taught the basics and i feel like im missing a whole lot        im mort interested in the art kind of side of it but ui is always welcome
  the art side of it is all it is its all one only stemlords classify art as some mystical kind of thing seperate from mathematics
can nobody give me the basics with a tiny bit of expansion on it
sigh last bump
just eyeball it nigga
  this has to be on the next /gd/ banner
  actually laughed out loud
  based
        funny but i would like the real thing anyone
    ill print this on a shirt
how do you niggers do it what do you use grids thirds grids aurea proportion grids aureic spiral grids what do you use
    its one of those things youre just born with if you suck at math you have to study your ass off and work 20x harder at it and still get a c but some other dude just gets it because thats how his brain is wired     so just eyeball it nigga
  id eyeball it but i dont know the full set of rules to eyeball it with
you fucking niggers are useless where are my /gd/ teachers and /gd/ experts teaching me about compositing weight tension color texture balance etc
  the secret is ripping off designs from the 50s90s and giving all that shit glossy buttons like it was 2005
  everything but using grids and compositing techniques i see
  honestly im probably just bitter but i had to work reallly hard myself to get all that info and to learn it and develop my own techniques and tricks to learn it quicker i dont want to just tell you shit because if this is important to you part of it is to struggle and learn it on your own there wont be someone there to holds your hand    basically stop being a crying baby and find out yourself    also the sticky is useless dont bother with it google coffee and time really are all you need
  not wanting to share valuable knowledge with newbies    absolute scum
  that 25 year old boomer who refuses to accept that graphic design is getting easier and easier as time goes on and refuses to share any info to make things easier for people starting out
  if its so easy then you should be able to do it yourself right    its easier in that theres more information and the computer can do a lot of things a lot faster but if youre not gonna put in the work yourself then it means nothing
is there even a single one person going to share something how do you do it guys what are your methods
hahahahaha i know stuff and you dont get dicked we dont share our secrets in gd were a close nit group    you should try briefboxme anon it has tutorials that even your stupid arse can understand     its too wide and complex to write it down for you so just eye ball it faggot
  this settles it you guys are fucking pieces of shit
  you dont understand you faggot the new technologies enables them to learn things far greater than you did at their point in time and to build their foundation they need information which was new and shiny to you to be taught to them    you didnt need to know how to make a computer to study graphic design
  what the fuck are you talking about you dont need to know how to make a computer to study design today literally all you need is an internet connection the ability to type in questions and the discipline and time and possibly drugs it would take to sit down and just take in the information and apply them    and im not even old im probably around your guys age i learned graphic design web design 3d modelling motion graphics and marketing in about a year and a half of grinding i didnt have anyone spoon feeding me information theres absolutely no reason why you fucks cant do it youre just weak and spoiled and telling yourself its too hard so you wont do it
  while you were out there teching yourself you found nice ammounts of resources all being compilled and expossed nicely by people who took the effort to do so now you dont want to share your knowledge you are a piece of shit
  no i didnt you asshat thats what im trying to tell you i literally just googled and youtubed whatever i was trying to learn i didnt take anyones resources or lists or anything that shits for weaklings and cops
  try this one next google wizard
  art
  i didnt use other peoples resources  i just googled for other peoples resources  woah
you are designing for humans so you will sadly have to use your human eyes in deciding what looks good and what doesnt its your job as a designer
maybe stop acting like an entitled douchebag and someone might help you
  this one is a very good pic good example
  ok ill try this
  only one rule look good or you dont get paid
why would you be so autistic about exact mathematics unless my client is willing to pay an astronomic sum he unironically gets eyeballed nigga
  i fucking kekd way too hard at this shit     good job bro
  why would you be so autistic about exact mathematics  because it supposedly makes things look good and right  unless my client is willing to pay an astronomic sum he unironically gets eyeballed nigga  so you are saying you use grids and calculations only for well paid jigs interesting if you could provide extra sauce on this it would be appreciated
  so you are saying you use grids and calculations only for well paid jigs  yes  the agency i used to work for had some big clients and we still didnt give a fuck about any kind of measurements some things we made were embarrassing form a technical point
  but did it looked good or professional at least
bump anyone
what are you even asking you basically want us to give you what amounts to a college degree in graphic design in this thread piss off man
  this is absolutely so far from the truth about both mathematics and design it hurts you can always tell how lazy an so is with rhethoric like this
  just eyeball it bro  if this is what your graphic design degree is all about
what the hell am i suppose to do with this lel
  
  /thread
/gd/  we dont like to share our knowledge  wasnt expecting that to be honest
hello does anyone have advice on how to create weird or experimental special effects or special effects used to make a creepy or weird feeling i am familiar with a few editing programs and am interested in making something experimental i am also wondering if the analog ways of creating these effects are available thank you for reading
              do you about aftereffects i learned by making frag videos the videos above are some examples of what you can do with it however good tutorials for glitching videos are hard to find for analog ways the sky is the limit although you might need to invest in hardware and theres not that many tutorials since its experimental trial and error
  what kind of hardware is used for stuff like that
  just google glitch art  
  thanks for the link anon
video synthesizers video mixers and of course you can just fuck with the colors and levels and keyframe changes in between them in whatever video editor you use the most popular analog video synth stuff is lzx industries and tachyons  while digital is a bit more openyou have apps like resolume touchdesigner vvvv max/msp smode synth cathodemer and many others
how do i get this good in apparel design  how do i come up with simple a good design like pic related
  how do you come up with any design experience and a creative mind meld together to create something good    look for inspiration and lend ideas that you can put your own spin on
  thank you very much for your kind and positive words
  for learning about logos read logodesignlove is on libgenio
  thanks i really appreciate your help
  np if you have a discord let me know i can give further advice and maybe even collab since im also interested in logos and selling merch/apparel design  
  ok cool thanks again will do
bought a commercial license from this store then found exact same images for free on 10 other sites scam artist     wwwetsycom/shop/myclipartstore
hey /gd/    i dont even know what i am doing i just do    am i going the right way
does anyone know any japanese websites where you can buy their game assets
does anyone have any info on this technique  the closest thing i can manage is the wind filter in gimp  this one looks different because the end of the trails keep the original intensity
another example
  its called pixel sorting i think
perfect thank you
    ok listen  this is a technique called pixel sort or pixel sorting theres more information about it   theres a good references and examples of it like giacomo carmagnola   signed a guy who works with this technique picture is oc
what do you think its a bar for gamers
the graphic and the text clash too much graphic has all these nice clean lines will the text is all jagged and shit
  this  ditch the meme font op
  pros  the linework is very nice  the colour choice is nice albeit not as vibrant as it could be  cons  the font is terrible  the actual design has nothing to do with gaming or bars/drinking it should immediately tell the viewer what to expect
  them colours just dont fit together man
  the actual design has nothing to do with gaming or bars/drinking
  its a bar for gamers  it looks like a logo for a semipro sports team
  i agree
  taking little time out of this this would definitely be a better logo if they just started
  rise up
  i think the best part of this logo is the claw and it should be in the center of attention the text you have made takes it away
  font is bumpy pixels btw its free for commercial use iirc
  font is already but the kerning is too tight give it some breathing room
  is alright
  i think that for such blocky design its alright the text looks solid together while still being readable     still its not my design im just giving feedback
  youre wrong    theyre not even evenly spaced it looks bad
  font matches the graphic better and says gamer bar better but idk the talon looks too much like a minor league sports team logo
  this is way better than your first post  therere still some little things you can fix to improve this even further buts already going there anon
  make it look nerdy because chances are   unless the font is pixel or it clearly states that its a gamer bar then people wont understand the connection and they will lose potential business
trying to start a small tech related podcast called decompiled any logo ideas all i can think of is that i can make the i as a led and d like a wire     pic is a logo of a tech conference named decompiled
no one cares about your podcast faggot sage
  make the i as a led and d like a wire  please dont do that  maybe ditch the word and just use the conceptlike a box being layered and with those layers being set apart or something      having a case of the mondays honey
  if you are interested in commissioning a designer  shoot me an email very affordable    niko101publicgmailcom
  make it out of ascii art with 1s and 0s
which one is best to create fonts

i need this program for the university searching on the internet i wasnt able to find anything working i tried some tutorials and web sites with cracks butnothing  i have a mac os high sierra 10136

anyone here knows what font is this please help
what do you think would something like this work
i dont like it because i dont have friends
  what do you think  cancer
using meme writing to describe a product    i dont even know what it is but i already hate it
  i think its a good idea
    go for it put together your minimum viable product and get it out there    have fun explaining why your server gets hammered during wierdly specific times of day    harvest data on sleep and waking habits  how often do they hit snooze  what keywords pop up in conversation when people are waking up and their brains are really up and running    someone wants to buy that data  speaking of putting content in peoples faces when theyre critical thinking is impaired  advertising  what products/services/porn gets the most clicks when users are still blurry eyed and jonesing for caffeine  are they more susceptible to political campaigns first thing in the morning  will people with nothing to do on a saturday morning be more willing to buy movie tickets through your add  will people whos chat the day before was rated by your ai to have a high chance of sexytimes on a friday night click through your app to call an uber saturday morning
cool renders but cancerous idea
might not make it into the medical field next fall decided graphic design sounded fun what stuff do i need is adobe worth it for the money paintnet any good     i have no prior art experience or natural talent but post on here from time to time and you all make fun of it so i figured i would spend 40k to prove you wrong
  spend 40k  dude dont  just torrent the adobe suite as any sane human  you are not supposed to use freeware alternatives for professional work but dont fall for adobes predatory jewness    i have no prior art experience or natural talent but post on here from time to time  you sound like the regular /gd/ zoomer
  inviting crummy comments but could we see some samples of what youve posted ill constructively critique and give you my two cents as to whether or not you should spend money on schooling
  i figured i would spend 40k to prove you wrong  lol so you plan on putting yourself into massive debt for a barely above minimum wage paying job i share a warehouse with a printing company their senior gd who has been with them since the day they opened makes 14 an hour you would be better off being a cashier at costco
  thats 3 more than i make now so pretty good
  if you do the math it isnt
adobe suite is pretty much all you use illustrator photoshop indesign
  printing company  its no wonder he only makes 14 an hour all the money is in marketing
  if he could do math he probably wouldnt have started this thread
  i can do math i just dont want a career in it
  that was nearly my daughters story school messed up grades for the full year of the school and everyone in english got marked down anyway she loved art as well when she looked into it all she decided to be an architect shes got her degree now and loves it
  then why would you give up medicine for graphic design not only the money isnt comparable your also get to solve some of peoples actual needs
  if you have a good chance to get into the medical field you should probably try for some other high paying/big field gd isnt one of them  is adobe worth it for the money  not really no  paintnet any good  not for gd  i have no prior art experience or natural talent but post on here from time to time and you all make fun of it so i figured i would spend 40k to prove you wrong  ok so this is a bait thread
  not a bait thread ppl hurt my feelings on the internet and now i want to get good at art to prove people wrong
how does one make this chrome effect ive found some silver chrome tutorials and was thinking of overlaying a holo texture onto it but im not 100 sure its gonna work
i was also thinking that it could be modelled in c4d and then had a holochrome material added to it
bump
i use a gradient tool for the chrome and use a turbulence effect similar to what paintnet has it make a really nice holo i dont know what the name for the holo effect is except for what paintnet calls it
bump
ask questions and give answers here    old thread 
starting illustrator is mesh tool worth it to learn for drawing also any recommended vids/materials on the editor in general
how do i create the type of noise on the left like when you try to take a picture of your computer screen
  if you use photoshop could try making 2 curved lines and using blend tool on them  in any case it looks like brighter/darker stripes could make a repeating black/white gradient fill a layer set the blending mode to lighten turn down opacity and then warp it
  like when you try to take a picture of your computer screen  i think you answered your own question
  from a student to teacher perspective what was the best school project that you have work and why
  design related pls
i guess i could create a landscape sorta thing like this in after effects or cinema4d but how do i make it show this grid
  on c4d theres at least 3 ways that i can think of  i guess the atom array is the best one since its very easy to make and customize  
  nvmd found a tutorial  
  appreciate it
how can i make this feminine and still keep it simple ive tried adding eyelashes and it just looks stupid
  more context is needed what is it for where is it gonna be displayed why the need for two üs
  the big u is just there it is for social media and the logo would be the red circular shape the u is there because inside the circle has a pr before hand except the client is female and said that she would prefer if the face/head looked more feminine ill post the full thing when i get home thanks
ive been trying to decipher just what methods did he use to get this subtle dimensionality i also have no clue what the texture is of looks like rough rubber
  looks a bit like a skateboard
im making a pamphlet for a meeting that has a lot of text is it alright to use a serif font or should the body be sans serif for readability if i do serif i would be using the font freight       if its supposed to be a face like the left add a bow or some type of barrette to their hair maybe
  but anon how do i do it without taking a picture
  nvm didnt realize freight came with a sans serif variant
any automatic saving programs for indesign/adobe anything something like google docs level of frequency
  adobe anything  picrelated  getting used to increment and save is a lot better though  alternatively you could set up autohotkeys to autosave every x time
  it really does thanks for the tip
my image colors arent saving like how they look in the photoshop workspace ive already tried converting to srgb and it didnt do shit    pic related what it saves as
  i cant post a comparison picture because even if i take a screenshot of the workspace when i save the screenshot it messes the colors up the weird thing is that certain photo viewers display the colors differently
  it looks like you are saving it with indexed colors
  i use the index color mode very briefly to achieve certain visual effects but switch back to rbg afterwards when i save it
  i think it looks more like car dashboard leather with a white speckle overlay but ye you 2 think it looks like sandpaper ok    take the pic  make a 40x40 square in the bottom left of the w  copy to new layer  filter/other/offset 20 20 ok  edit/define pattern  write text/pattern overlay
  or you could just open a texture create a clipping mask altclick it to direct edit it paste monochrome logo
  dude i opened your file and its in indexed mode  i dont know how you saved it but its still in indexed   is picrelated what you were going for  if i take a screenshot of the workspace when i save the screenshot it messes the colors up  wtf really i think your computer is cursed
  a texture bbbbut he wants this texture  i feel you just wanted to be involved awe
  what the fuck is going onnnnnnnn    and no that isnt what im going for if you save the file and open it in quicktime photo viewer you should be able to see what i mean the whiteness of the angel is more pronounced where in the final version it appears more grey
  quicktime photo viewer  you mean preview  the whiteness of the angel is more pronounced   preview doesnt interpolate the image so white dots are pixelated and thus less blurry   doublecheck photoshop settings when you export the image or post a screenshot of them
  anyway i just opened the file in ps switched the mode to rgb turned the red to transparent double checked the result its rgb   the rest boils down to interpolation this doesnt come in play often but dithering is one of such cases
    thats the easy part im wondering what is he doing to achieve that slightlyraised look there seems to be a really subtle organic black bevel/stroke around the letters which i cant replicate the closest i got is by applying a small drop shadow but its still not there yet
  could be unsharp mask because of resizing  see picrelated
    have a play about with inner shadow
not exactly a how do i make instead a very stupid question  how do you decide how much margin to use  i mean when doing a work for digital use
wtf man cgpeers and cgpersia dont work for me are they both down at the same time
  yes guess they use the same servers
i often struggle to decide wether i should try to recreate something in photoshop or cinema4d any one else pic very related
guys i need help with something  lately ive been having a weird bug with photoshop  i design flashcards for a website and i like using lightning effects but lately ive been unable to apply lightning effects on my designs whenever i click on lightning effects the effects panel appears for one second and then a lightning effect layer appears cant edit it either  ive been looking everywhere and the classic lightning effects fix i found didnt help and ive yet to find someone else with the same bug  i was using a portable version of photoshop deleted it and extracted it again still same bug erased it and installed a full version of photoshop still the same issue cleaned registry and restarted my laptop and its still there  my girlfriend has the very same protable photoshop and she can edit lightning effects   i cant even edit the lightning effects of my previous photoshop projects  im desperate can you guys help me please
  complete newb here whos taking the plunge into scanning my cd inserts so im humbly asking for some advice i have an hp officejet allinone scanner picked up from costco over a decade ago which ill assume is garbage since all the images look like moiré riddled shit     when i tried applying the descreen effect via gimp the image washed out into a blurry mess even at low sensitivities the image still doesnt look quite right so im obviously doing something wrong    what kind of gear is needed for optimal scanning     what settings do you scan your images at     do you descreen before or after the image is scanned    do you use gimp or photoshop to scrub up your scans what techniques do you follow    any/all help would be greatly appreciated    pic related a sample scan from my current gear
  try this 
  1000 hours in ms paint
i have less than 1 year experience and i have no college degree    should put that in my resume or would it be okay if i leave it out
  thanks 3    i used a different scanner followed those instructions and produced this    r8
  much better the typographic grid is there but then again thats how the booklet looks irl
there isnt enough contrast between the buildings and the background how do i improve that ive tried adding glow and shadow neither look all that good    this is a part of a design not the whole thing
probably not the right place to post this but im gonna try anyways  what text is the say hi been looking and i cant seem to find wondering if 4chan has answers

  hello is there a material on how to draw shit like this on picrelated whats it called and whats the style

  well if you have dark grey on black theres not much you can do  either add glow inside or outside the house like picrelated or a white outline
some please tell me i can disable this shit in photoshop cc basically when i use the move tool to move a layer it will create a selection box when im not selecting near that layer which is really fucking annoying
  are you an idiot  do your friends think you are special
  whats your problem retard how is this not helpful
  so you are saying that when you move a layer in ps said layer gets selected and that annoys you  thats the most nitpickyfag thing i ever heard  just press ctrlh to hide/show selection
  no like lets say a have a bunch of layers stacked over each other i select the one i want to move in the layers tab then i hold the mouse and drag the layer to see it better but it instead makes the selection box  i found the fix i had to disable autoselect im retarded
how would one go about recreating this by just using and manipulating basic shapes im trying everything but when i go to the pathfinder i just get a damn half circle thanks

sweet jesus i have never struggled with something so simple before /tut/ how do i make a parallelogram in ps i though i could just make a rectangle and then skew it but it leaves the tilted sides looking gross
this thread looks head as hell but i guess its worth a shot     i really want to make mtg art edits like  does he has short videos showing a basic few seconds of how he makes his edits he says they are simple and quick edits he can usually do in an hour or so but i have no idea how to recreate this so i can make edits myself     can anyone with photoshop knowledge watch one of the little videos he posts and deduce what i need to do to make edits like his
  i can relate because i grew up with mtg 4th edition was new back then  can anyone with photoshop knowledge watch one of the little videos he posts and deduce what i need to do to make edits like his  you are asking for basic photoshop tutorials  i watched those gifs and he does nothing fancy just basic ps as basic as it gets
  hey same here just being able to make one edit that looks at least decent would be motivating to say the very least but i have no clue where to start nor do i think of myself as very skilled in general to me it feels like its just one of those things in life that you can either do or absolutely cant do     if nothing else i can only wish you and possibly others best of luck id love to add more to the album dedicated to this on imgur even though it sucks that votes and comments are reseted with updating the gallery
  ya kinda right you probably do have have a good understanding of shadows but mostly its pretty straight forward
    okay lads i have a video question    storm/lightning  whats the best way to simulate a stormy sky/lightning strikes in videos  get stock footage and tryto blend it in    use artificial footage and blend it yourself like eye of the storm    here one of many examples  
  get stock footage and tryto blend it in  this is what i would do with something like your pic/vid
  you can do that in ae  
how do i achieve the imperfect edges of this logo i know about layering actual paper textures and adding distress and pointilizing instead of adding noise i cant figure out how to get a natural looking ink bleed to make the edges imperfect/analog
  i just woke up but look at displace maybe  i can see one speck of green on the k so idont know i need 3 coffees first
  there is a probably a much simpler way but i basically set the layer to dissolve and then apply a stroke set the width to where it sits right where the dissolve ends
  took my own advice and tried it to double check  heres my attempt hopefully theres a simpler way
  yeah now that i look at its nothing alike
    in illustrator   effect   distort  transform    roughen
im not asking someone to cut this out for me but does anyone happen to have this high quality metal gear logo without the blue background just a regular transparent version
  
  sent 
  photoshop lmao
  i think you can use your first image turn it into a pattern by using content fill    then just use it as a pattern on a pic that you want to edit by just choosing a good blending option

packaging in indesign cc    so i have a file and want to export it as a package for indesign cs6 ist that even possible    its requirement for my university and im like 2 months late simply because im so mad i have to pay for this cc crap while theyre refusing to upgrade
does anyone know how to prevent banding in really big files i saw a trick that noise into surface blur would work but surface blur seems to be glitched in my version of photoshop cc like itll load forever then just not make any changes to the file    also is it possible to do the really aestheticy disintegrating pixel art without that one after effects action its not that expensive but i was hoping thered be options for photoshop or cheaper options in general if i have to download a whole new program to do the effect
  could someone please tell me why the fuck is the  on the left

hey im trying to export this as a svg but when i do the background concrete texture which is just an image with the opacity turned down dissappears in the top portion of the screen as if it had been cropped what am i doing wrong
  yeah it can give it a bit of energy and break up some potential monotony of just hearing talking
what software is the best for making maps like these
  you cant export raster graphics your texture as svg you need to vectorize them first      that looks like a regular map edited in ps that van goghcky texture is just a filter preset
damn this board is slow how is this thread still up anyways what free program can i use to replicate pic related i want to make a checkered room and place 3d objects in it then use photoshop to remix the screenshots is blender good enough i want it to look realistic with shaders n shit

inkscape  how do i cut away from stuff i want to make this logo and made the g by cutting away from the circle with a smaller circle and boxes with a white fill but now i want to make a shadow and the white fill also blocks the shadow  also how could i make a black outline for the entire letters rather than all its individual subparts
  within the packaged folder are two indesign files the first being the regular indesign file and the second being idml which can be opened in previous versions of indesign
how fucking dead is this thread  how fucking dead is this board
  hey there lad you must be new here chill
so a while ago i did a group of friends a favour and did their first iteration of their clubs crest for them in gimp i traced a handdrawn version they gave me with pathes and then stroked them with various tools to make it look a bit calligraphic  now i am learning to do inkscape and want to recreate it i exported the crest which consisted of many individual parts that i adjusted by moving them around into a eps and now want to import it into inkscape i see myself confronted with many different options some questions  1 can i seperate paths in inkscape so that i can move them individually or are they eternally part of the same pathgroup  2 poppler/cairo or internal import  3 at first i tried multiple scans and ended up with 8 times the sma epath just for different colourtones now that im trying a colourquantitized single scan with 12 colours i used 11 different colours and tones it wont start the bitmap scan i click ok and at the bottom of the window it says select image to trace but clicking on the image with the select tool doesnt do anything how can i initiate the scan
  i have never installed inkscape but  1  i suppose there should be something like ais pathfinder window it would be unusable if it hadnt  3  manually tracing it will always grant better results however if you insist on auto tracing it use vectormagic theres a clean copy on tpb
where can i find a distressed record cover and how do i make the statue and text look like theyre a part of the cover 
  where can i find a distressed record cover   google something along the lines of worn vinyl  how do i make the statue and text look like theyre a part  lower white output levels to start with
is there a good linux alternative to adobe an  i tried a bit of synfig but it doesnt seem to easily allow frame by frame stuff    i looked on alternativetocom but found very little other programms that can do that tuki seems to be one should i get into tupi for animating mostly graphs and simple objects i dont want to become a flash artist just animate my own pictures of rays going through prisms or other technical/scientific illustrations for laymen
  tupi  not  tuki  sorry
  halftones
  just one word and i already know youre an idiot
  the example of the mewtwo they gave is halftones but i should have replied to that specifically you are correct that that isnt halftones and just some texture over the image
  ok so youre not an idiot ill take it back
  i would have called me an idiot too so no worries
    i make all of my shapes in illustrator and them paste them like smart objects on photoshop making shapes in ps is a pain in the ass

how do i recreate this chrome/embossed look
  like an oil slick kind of chrome
  bump this
how do i recreate the layered text effect in this
  ok its me again i tried to do this again and the imported svg file has some issues related to how i did the entire thing in gimp  i got a photo of a hugehanddrawn crest from my friend i traced all the important lines on the photo with paths then stroked the different paths with different tools and finally filled the areas with the appropriate colour the tools often had a side ratio to give the impression of a calligraphy quill the problem is just that the svg file traced every line seeing the inner and the outer border of each line as a seperate point now i am faced with this dilemma just look at the 0 or the point how many datapoints that are so many it crashes my pc  is there a way to reduce the datapoints without losing the shapes is there a way to stroke paths in inkscape as i did in gimp is there a way to just import the paths and nothing else rather than scan off a bmp
  thanks for this not the anon requesting but it got me going back to c4d to try this out
  i do id have to say i prefer cinema but thats simply because i have a better understanding of it then i do of photshop
pro concept artist/illustrator here looking to get into ui design for vidya and such can you help me out a bit with the resources what should i start with
  doing it the lazy way will always generate a shitload of anchorpoints  if you want it clean you will have to grab that pen tool and vectorize it manually  it will take longer but it will look a lot better and will be easier on your cpu
  bump
  how many answers/threads do you need  kys
hello /gd/  pic related  how do i get vertical text like the one on the left with illustrator i tried using the vertical type tool in the text tool box and it returned result on the right i also tried using character rotation in the character window but that refuse to workwhen im uising vertical text what did i do wrong here
is it difficult to get a job in the gd field im just starting out in college and im really ambitious but scared
  tried that as i said in   looks like it simply doesnt work for me
  click on it and drag a square with it then type your text
  tried that too doesnt work either  i ended up rotating a normal horizontal text grid and used character rotation not a good solution but it solve my problem for now     thanks anyway ddue
    youre doing something wrong then open a new document select vertical type tool click on an empty area and start typing if this doesnt work then something got fucked up in your illustrator i just did exactly all that and it worked perfectly for me
whats the best video course on photoshop cs6  i have a good understanding of the basics from playing around but i want to make sure im doing things the right way

  salut le lyonnais 
i really need a white remover for photoshop cc 2018 or cs6  something like  is promising to do but this one doesnt seem to work with my versions  theres like 3 different ones of these and none even shows up in my filter tab
create a logo for tshirt print i know nothing about photoshop im using cs4 what format should i save
is there a website to sort background images by perspective angle    i have taken various shots of items i need to use while making a website and have taken out the irl background and want to put something in but it will always look odd if the perspective doesnt match is there a site that lets you filter by angle
  for tshirts and other prints i really recommend using a vectorization program such as illustrator adobe and corel draw that way you can save the vector file
  duplicate the layer and select it  ctrla  ctrli  ctrlc  create mask and altclick it  ctrlv    that script will never appear as a filter you have to run it from filescripts
question    im making a brochure for a company im putting symbols next to contact info im wondering if i should use a cellphone symbol or a classic telephone symbol     telephone seems old and outdated  cellphone seems immature but modern    cant decide
  telephone is a universal symbol smartphone is not and it could mean just an app id go with obvious and choose phone
  cellphone seems modern  maybe now but it wont hold up over time  the older one is more iconic
    very well thanks for the input
how do i make this
what font is this
  one layer of a pink gameboy with blue added to the midtones/highlights reduce contrast across all channels  one layer of bottle pouring out into a pool of some sort add layer mask so that the only portion of the pool/ripples showing overlaps with the gameboy screen  text layer  mountain layer with reduced contast  some sort of ripple/smoke layer  reduce contrast on whole bit  save as midquality jpg  not sure why the bottle looks halfcartoony perhaps its just been compressed multiple times
  thank you so much
i want into making metal ass texts like super detailed and crazy does anyone have a good starting point

hello /gd i was tasked with developing the branding for an arab café does anyone recommend any arabic fonts
  this is just a texture with a gradient on top of it
gonna start my internship this fall and im nervous how shit am i allowed to be and what should i work on in the meantime
  i am still interested in finding a solution to this
  no clue what youre going to be doing but you can be fairly shit as long as youre not there to just fill in as an inhouse designer    if it seems important make sure you learn about bleeds/margins/etc and everything you need for print
  do you have me hacked or something  aaaaaaaaanswer mayyyyyyyyyy
    according to their wiki  inkscape calls pathfinder operations boolean operations on paths  so try googling that      internship  they propbably expect you to be pretty shitty  try to maintain above their expectations though
  how do i use indexed colors the option is greyed out and im using rgb 8bit
  i managed to make a close sketch of that f using the extrude and bevel effect on illustrator    simply make your letters i prefer to convert them to outlines before working on them and then go to effect3dextrude  bevel    once in the dialog you can rotate the cube using the parameters you desire and choose the shading options for this kind of flat color gradients and such i use no shading and then color each face one by one after expanding the appearance of the effect    hope that helps
why does cc suck compared to cs6
  what do you mean its superior on every way except the subscription model just crack it to block its access to adobe servers and forget about it
  i got a lot of crashing and bugs with illustrator and premiere
  thatll be the underpowered comp you are using it on
hey guys  im currently working on the ui of a 160128 screen in order to draw pixel perfect objects should i use photoshop or illustrator  i tried using illustrator but using it to draw pixelshit makes me wanna shove a cactus up my ass with gravel     should i first draw on photoshop and export it to illustrator the main reason i use it is for the artboards    any tips
  what you could do as a bandaid solution is using horizontal type tool click once and then type  l  i  k  e     t  h  i  s      also center the text so it doesnt look weird
  are you using cc2015 thats a buggy mess  2014 and 2017 are fine recently switched to 2018 and no complains so far  also regardless of how powerful your gpu is render with cpu only      use ai and stop thinking in pixels
  since the screen size is so small id definitely go with a raster editor so photoshop     use ai and stop thinking in pixels  the dumbest thing ive read on this board
  use ai and stop thinking in pixels  t never designed an ui      alright thats what i thought thanks
  thanks man boolean operations are the shit experimenting a lot    took me a while to figure out that grouped onjects cannot be parts of boolean operations
thoughts criticism
do you know of any tutorials on how to achieve this moving gradients colors light in after effects or is there a better software for this or what keywords should i be using to find relevant tutorials thank you in advance
  you can do it easily with trapcode particular or any other particle generating plugin stardust is cool too  the newer versions have an intuitive effects builder ui  it will be pretty cpu intensive lots of small glowing feathered particles  make sure to play around with the depth of field inside rendering options of particular to get an uniform look
  looks like a particle effect
  
  whats the best way of getting convincing grains and textures over designs without it looking overly artificial or corny most tutorials and howtos have horrible results that look like shit but plenty of designers are doing digital designs with analoglooking grains/textures so i know its possible
  dont draw attention to your lack of experience instead list the things that actually qualify you for the position you plan on applying for
  the subtler textures on this illustration are what im referring to
how do i make a prespective in illustrator cs6 without using the perspective grid like in pic related   i swear i accidentaly did it a while ago using some combination of ctrlaltshift but now it doesnt work i forgot how i did it the official adobe docs said to use ctrlaltshift while dragging but it doesnt seem to work
  dunno the hotkey but this is the tool at least
  maybe with the shear tool
  you need to select free transform tool first then start dragging a corner not a side and while youre already dragging it hold ctrlaltshift  t been in the same place
    heres an example of what i can do now its pretty shit
when creating a comic font how can i create that auto crossbar i technology i assume it just checks a small table of letter combinations and replaces the gylphs but cannot find something like this within fontforge
how would you illustrate something like pic related with a drawing tablet select tool and fill bucket
    hi sorry i made  without checking for a general as every board has    basically what i said in my post there my issue is not creating an intricate design i just have no idea what kind of format the asset has to be to be holographic i did some thinking when i thought about alphasevery element might need a b/w gradient or solid b or w over them to cast the direction of refraction that would make sense
  resize overlay like 5 w bilinear interpolation sharpen size back down to 5 of the original with bilinear size back to its original size with bicubic adj opacity to taste    also non monochrome with heavy desaturation helps
what illustrator tool did this guy use to trace over his initial drawing
  drawing tablet  select tool  no  you would be using brushes for drawing it      pen tool g
  sorry i meant the grid he lays over the drawing the keep everything straight i dont know where that is
  literally called gridtool  
  oh damn it was right there i wouldnt have thought something like that would be in that place thanks a lot
  dunno if your style guide allows gradients or not
  what text font is that
  the fuck is this meant to be i cant tell anything about it is this a game for the lawnmower man movie or something
  its meant for you to feel the v a p o r
other than finding the exact font used in an image is there a way to duplicate a font used in an image for example in some memes involving a book or product theyve somehow not only recreated the font but the style
  just use a tool like this  
is cgpeers down for anyone else ive seen a few people suggest the to domain but that seems fishy to me

i will be going to a stem grad program i want any publications etc that i write to be good do ive been learning about latex and typography  i also want to learn how to make scientific illustrations the thing is ive never drawn a thing in my life how do i go about learning this  i have inkscape for now should i start with that or pen and paper  are there any books for something like this
can someone explain to me how to recreate a graphic like this in illustrator using only two groups one rectangle one ring i have looked at a few masking tutorials but i havent found anything that suggests you can make two objects partially hide each other using masks i dont want to cut any paths to accomplish this what you see here is a simple example of what i want made in photoshop
  just cut the circle in two
  im asking if theres a way to do this without cutting anything if there is a way id like to use that technique for two much more complex sets of paths cutting them would be tedious and as far as i know i would not be able to adjust the position of the object again without having to do more cutting or start over its so simple to do this in photoshop is there really no other option
  take a photo of your computer screen with a white or light background   take the image you want to have that effect and overlay it on the photo choose multiply for the top photo and play with the transparency until it looks right  play with the contrast and structure of the bottom photo to get more texture
so i have this fakemagazine indesign template that im trying to edit im not familiar with the program but ive been able to get along until i want to edit this  i cant click on it i cant unlock it its not selectable if i use the text tool it draws a new box over it it appears on every page but the objects id expect dont show up under heading how can i change chapter name to something else
  nvm i figured out its a master page
do you guys have a stock image thread where one can ask for an image and someone with an account will deliver it
  no and ive never heard of a stock image site that you can pay monthly and get unlimited downloads you usually pay per stock image/video and you have different prices depending on resolution
  i see thats a bummer know where i can get them for free i found a pic on 123rf and ive tried searching but got only scammy sites that do nothing
  
    rofl sorry but this little interaction had me crackin up
total noob here just go interested in graphic design and wanted to know if it is a must to know how to draw if i want to have any future in gd
  not really its beneficial because it can help get better feel of form space color and stuff like that but most /gd/ work does not require good drawing skills
  how do i go about creating illustrations for publications   any books/tools etc that could help me get started
  i thought you were talking about layouts and stuff like that if you mean illustration then obviously you do need drawing as for books not sure and id suggest asking /ic/
  not me but still thanks for the answer
i work for a small car manufacturer and i agreed to design a concept dash display i can do the ergonomic side but i have no idea how to use actual graphic design tools    whats a good way to get a crash course in gimp in under a week
  use photoshop instead its easier to understand and has a generally nicer workflow and interface
explain
anywhere i could pirate or download free fonts
  the whole thing
  if you dont know how to do it theres no need to reply thanks have a nice day
    how cranky here anon have a snickers
  no one is going to help you if you dont say what you even need help with
  probably wants to know everything but wouldnt understand any of it like all the other cunts that say very little
i like the roughness of these sketchings  i presume they werent made digitally but maybe drawn with ink and then scanned
im trying to set up a brush that can be used to imitate fluid dynamics using brush options  shape dynamics i can get bumpy looking ones that vary in size like pic related but cant figure out how to get cohesive ones that dont look like a tightly packed collection of circles what am i doing wrong
    are you this thick its damn obvious the fucking font is it done in processingjs or what
  take a look at this dumbass zoomer  posts same thing on 2 threads  calls every anon stupid when asked to state a valid question  so tell me brilliant young man have you ever made a custom typeface  its hard work it take time working with rulers and measuring angles its about crafting each fucking letter somebody probably spent quite some time making that which is nothing but a cleaner novelty font    is it done in processingjs  it could be done with a snakelike script even using basic logo and other archaic languages but it probably isnt and if you have to ask if it can be done this way you are not one to write a script for it    being an edgy faggot wont take you far specially when you are asking for help
how many pieces should i put in a portfolio that would be used in applying for an internship
  you can roughen vectors in illustrator fairly convincingly
  skip the okish thing just throw in the really good tuff that makes you proud  i would say 56 as a bare minimum but dont try to inflate it with pieces that will lower the overall quality
hey anons was wondering about how do i get into motion graphics where should i start im not that bad at art and like sketching in my free time but i would like to get into it professionally any advice appreciated
  sounds good thanks
  where should i start  videocopilots basic training  afterwards browse through their nonbasic tutorials and do the ones that appeal to want you want to be doing  andrewsensei will have your back and teach you how to solve things in ae in different ways    2 good excercises you can do for practice are   going to videohives motion graphics section picking one you like and trying to recreate it from scratch   downloading some cool looking template from shareae or similar and backwards engineer it    godspeed you anon
  thanks anon appreciate it
  not anon from above but do you have any other tuts you recommend that doesnt use an ancient version of ae
  the ui might look outdated but the contents arent and andrew kramer is the best teacher you will get  so no i dont know of better beginner tuts than those  they are just 10 short ones and you can even skip a couple like chroma key if you dont intend to do that    the film riot guys have a couple of good tutorials but they are kind of annoying and im not sure if they have something teaching the very basics
how would i go about bending this already outlined type around a circle the bend effect produces poor results would i have to do it manually
  holy fuck kill yourself already you old boomer just admit it that you have no idea how to do it and be gone why did i ever expect someone knowledgeable from a design board you waste of bytes baka
  for anyone wondering turn the object into an art brush place the path select the path and select your newly made brush   adjusting the stroke size will adjust the size of the object along the path as well
this gif doesnt have all the newest emojis it seems quite old i want to make a new version i might just literally add each emoji and center them manually for several hours what software should i use
  why dont you just add this gif to photoshop and add the emojis you want i mean wait till ya home from kindergarten first tho
  what is the general age on here now 14
  why dont you just add this gif to photoshop and add the emojis you want   the colors seem to have changed the new ones would look out of place also i cant find any image files of the emojis which are the same size as those in the gif     im basically looking for some image software which can add text center images and make gifs with over 3000 frames guess ill use photoshop until further notice     wait till ya home from kindergarten first tho   its 8 oclock my guy the day just started do you not like the snacks they serve at lunch i could eat goldfish crackers and drink grape juice boxes all day why would you go home so early did you pee yourself or something
hey /gd/ whats the best/quickest way to get this effect    ive tried using the 3d  emboss/bevel but thats really only doing the sides of the letters unless i being an idiot and using it wrong which is possible    or do any of you know a font that looks like this
theres a good site to dowload footage whitour water mark to edit en prmiere good qualitiy
  google bevel fonts augustus beveled seems like it will need only a slight edit but i havent used it  also using an action if maybe you have a font you like        footage about what theres some sites that have free hd video clips but mostly about random stuff you can find list on google searching for free stock video or footage also if you want to pirate maybe try at cgpeers
  what for  theres archiveorg for random stuff mostly bad quality but i dont think you can get free stock footage in fact ive sold that shit hand gestures with a proper chroma bg and the likes      this isnt doable by adding fxs to your text in ps
  holey shit what font is this
this is going to sound extremely amateurish because it is but im working on an internship at the moment and got assigned my first fullpage advertisement for a client im supposed to be working on a full bleed advertisement but how exactly would the printers requirements be interpreted is this a 9x11 with a 125 and 250 bleed on each edge or like a 0625 and 125 respectively or something else entirely
  im struggling with this type of crap too from obtuse printers with little patience for noobs like me oh well   heres how i see it you set up your artboard at 10125 x 7625 with a bleed of 05 on the top and bottom and 08125 on the left and right text and logos should not touch the sides of the artboard 10125 x 7625 while background fills shapes and photos must extend to the edge of the bleed area 11125 x 925 make sure document colour mode is cmyk thats what i make out of all that someone better versed might want to correct me if im wrong   anyway those three decimal figures confuse me i work in europe and here a bleed area of 3 to 5 mm on each side should be safe for pretty much any work
something like this  
  some people here knows how to but with that attitude were not helping you fuck off right back to plebbit bye
  natron

so im trying to make an effect where im masking off parts of the video put i also want the video to scroll down a little but using the pan/crop tool would move the whole thing with the black bars included which isnt what i want is it possible to do something like that
  i dont know what software you are using but this is how to do it in aftereffects maybe theres a similar way or you are willing to upgrade to it  place your footage in a composition  create a rectangle on the area you want to be seen either use a shape or a masked solid  make sure your footage layer is underneath your rectangle layer and take a look at the layer modes  change track matte from footage layer to alpha matte rectangle
  im using vegas pro 13 yeah i was thinking doing a very similar thing to what you did putting a black solid shape on top of the video then using the mask layer to show the footage behind it so now i can move the footage without affecting the black bars
  now that i think about it having a masked black solid that covers your footage creating bars is even easier just put it on top and move your footage till the portion you want to be seen is behind the black mask
  because install adobe
why do lines look so crisp in professional work but my paintnet stuff always has fuzzy edges
  paint outputs rastered images  im guessing you want crisp vectorial lines  in that case illustrator is the way to go  or as this anon stated 
does anyone know how to remove/smooth out those green lines from a scanned photo on photoshop cc 2019  the picture on the right is heavily saturated just to make it easier for you guys to see  i tried the spot healing brush and the clone stamp tools but i wonder if theres a better way  sorry about the crappy resolution any help is appreciated
how do i into musical logo/brand thing
is there some software that already has these corny 90s video effects already that i can use example at the beginning     
  aftereffects already has the corny text animation presets  and you can find thousands of plugins/overlays/tutorials on vhs distortion  twitch plugin has some of those flashing presets  the rest youll have to do it manually but its nothing complex
how was created this gradient
  hey man try to use selective color and reduce the color of the greens to the black    image  adjustments  selective color
  what about your english  this is either a blurred photo or a smudged gradient my guess
i have 14 mall artboards in illustrator how can i precisely downsize all of them and keep my artwork in the center of them
how do i take a metric fuckload of pictures up close in free cam inside of a video game and stitch them all together to make one very high resolution map besides doing what i just said manually for the next year fly over an area in while recording cutting the video into frames then stitching the frames together nicely there has to be a better way
  looks like a distorted blurry normal map
  looks like dusty leather to me m8
  cool story bro
  well holograms have a bunch of directional things so maybe formatting it somewhat like a normal map for 3d effects
  thanks a lot anon
whats the best way to remove the background color from an image with a transparent stroke and still retain the transparency    eg this image    i want to retain the way the border is transparent but remove the color white so i can use this as a discord emoji without it looking ugly im a noob sorry if im not explaining this well
  someone knows if this is a specific program doing this or its a fake if its true someone knows the name of that
  maybe ask on the pixel art thread at /ic/   also ive seen that somwhere not sure where the best software for pixel art are cosmigo pro motion aseprite and grayscale so maybe look into those
  invalid link op what is it that you want the program to do for you  as the other anon said aseprite is comfy and flexible  and just using ps in the first place isnt a bad decision
how was this done
tinkering with blend modes perhaps and adjusting hue/saturation
i made something similar to this by throwing an image into audacity the audio program putting a bunch of audio effects on it and then exporting it again
can someone please make an entire a4 document size file pdf or jpg anything i can print like the photo attached save me the time of putting two red and one green sticker for days please needs to be two red/orange together with a green below thanks
what the fuck are you trying to say    
  no  go to  or  for requests
fuck off beggar scum
i need two green one red sticker below asap pdf
  two green one red sticker below asap pdf  its a weird request but hope this helps
heres mine its both a two ds connected to the name  an eye to symbolize visual idendity  graphic design
visual idendity  yes you sure love ds
  it looks unfinished but i think the idea is clever    this ones unbalanced and clumsy it looks like the a is trying to awkwardly climb on ps back and has poked him in the eye with the foot and p is about to throw a face first to the floor because he deserves it because a is drunk af
  d on the left needs to be shrunk slightly
just a sample when tinkering over logos trying to fit stuff with other stuff bg is irrelevant
  just made this it is a lighthouse made from two gs the first letter of my last name  graphics the lighthouse symbolizes visual clarity/ guidance/ beacon/ new land/
  just fixed the outer frame
  the d on the right needs to be shrunk slightly to combat the optical illusion
  looks uh bad
  i thought so
  is this ms paint
      who do i believe
this is the logo of my personal small record label im the only artist on it thoughts
  looks unfinished maybe make the linework on the shapes slightly more organic somehow      too simple and easy to make looks like nothing also if the background is irrelevant then you need to make it white the dark grey is difficult to discern from the dark green      the black square is too simple and too dark to be that size its ugly make it smaller get rid of the border too maybe bring records down just a bit
  square has no reason to be there at all honestly the typeface for blind optimism doesnt really do it for me but it might look decent without the square    not a fan of the color scheme it just doesnt inspire much confidence its not terrible but overall just seems heavy handed as a design
made this a while back for a buds team
  nigga that double d is so fking lame
itt people still creating wordmarks in 2018
my first name starts with c and my last name starts with e genius i know
  this begins with s and ends with t
  its pretty cool what music do you make
  the black square is too simple and too dark to be that size its ugly make it smaller get rid of the border too maybe bring records down just a bit  its his logo dont say make it or get rid of  say you could do or maybe could be better if
  fuck off
  yeah fuck off
  if crap had a daughter this would be her
rate me pls    inb4 le gradient

lets be real    all these logos are total shit lmao
  post something and revive this thread youre our only hope
  i am not a robot
made a bunch of logo all based on car headlamps wdty /gd/
  3 in 2nd row is the best one id sly wingshape works with sky also shoes speed otherwise i dont really get the headlamp feel in any of them
  make the left side of the d slightly concave
this my personal logo
  what does it say
  i think it says dont hire me in russian
im a music producer
  fuck i forgot the image
here is my personal logo ive completed
is shit
  ok heres the last few logos i made they needed a logo that was easy to read at a very small size none of these got used for some reason they even said the last one looked too much like scholastic books 
  bad awkward intersections the more you look at it the more abstract it gets       based and redpilled      autodesk much      looks too busy and disjointed my brain refuses to see it as a logo and not some abstract art made of randomly placed lines      eye sticks out way too much i just want to center it      cascimat ascmat i kinda dig it anyway      looks like a rough draft like your attitude with colors weird symbol 9 sticks out too much reminds me of alien glyphs in media      first row looks like a bunch of misaligned bricks note how rectangles of the same and different colors join with each other second logo is the best there  second row is better i would say that second logo is better but i dont like how the bird is going down instead of up  third row looks like some sort of skin disease awkward stroke width      what does it say      nothing special but its good      symbol and text look misaligned you can fix it by not being a pussy and actually drawing your symbol by hand instead of unorganic mirroring since you were going for a faux cursive anyway what is that symbol supposed to be anyway h jh je      might b cool      kkk supporter alert  last one looks like a mishmash of different logos none of which i can remember  1 and 3 look clean and good 2 is fucking trash
  ok faggot now its your turn to post a logo
  ok faggot now its your turn to post a logo
  thinking this opinion matters in what looks like a joke thread surely nothing in here is serious
  youre a pussy
    post logos guys otherwise nobody cares about what youre saying
  what is minimalism      the logo looks nice you could create something cool if you play your cards right
my monogram is bp
  thats not minimalism you nitwit and that guys logo doesnt look like anything minimalist logos show more intention and are much cleaner stfu and fuck off
  i like them but they feel a bit abstract i didnt realize they were based on headlamps until i reread your post and had the ahha moment
  pls r8 my logo
  below average unfortunately
  your outer line has a break in it  topright
  change it to be like this including the image dimensions and white space around the logo
  oh i see it now
pretty shit but its a logo for a wrestler inspired by jojos
  please go over and fix your lines
any feedback
  really it looks like fucking nothing all these logos are total shit except  please stop trying
  those are shit too
post your logo  crtiques ideas on how to better this are appreciated
  i like the grey background not joking  the rest tells me i wouldnt hire you
  could you elaborate    have done a couple reworks
logo of my band
  the flash and flash gordon megamix at least you distressed it yourself
  more like jizz lmao
  this is from when i was a small business owner   i still keep it active just in case
  i do like this one a lot better than the black/teal version very nice
  love the very subtle inner dimension between the white and black
  here is one more variation screenshot of the front parallax banner from my old website
  and another variation dont bother trying to prank call me my number has changed anyway
  this is what i called my freelance business prior to rocktopus this is from 2002
    average gets iconic part right but it looks like streamline aesthetic which is tacky as all hell     looks like something from mid 2000s like vimeo and lobster plus graffiti very good execution but meh style which is badly out of fashion    okay but too elaborate and not iconic enough looks like stuff from stock logo sites    why its engraved is beyond me    i get it an octopus    tacky as fuck to be honest also  w an ted
  tacky as fuck to be honest also  fine with that got about 70k worth of business in 2 months time after posting that stupid thing online people sometimes like tacky
  okay but too elaborate and not iconic enough looks like stuff from stock logo sites  was awesome for the time era i was using it for at that moment demographics changed dramatically ive been employed with a company for years now so never had to change it ps the w an ted is on purpose old type and posters  irregular spacing between characters vintage designs should not be computer perfect
  stock logo  i never use stock logo shit i think people who do that should be shot everything i do has always been custom im a real artist i can draw paint sculpt etc
  i never use stock logo shit  i never implied you did i said it _looks_ like one
  gets iconic part right but it looks like streamline aesthetic which is tacky as all hell    top tier criticism this is no wonder this board is thriving
  do you always contribute so much to discussion
  logo i made for a fake mushroom company
  it looks like a dick
  it looks like it was made by a dick
havent posted here before just found this board not a professional in any way but i like making things like this on ms paint what kind of software should i get to make this look clean
  ai ps anything but ms paint
    jokes on you it was meant for a dick company
no art degree never done ux in my life  im just a pentester  but feedback is appreciated
  did your son do this for you
  did your son write this post for you
  stick to pentesting
  lmao the fuck is that bruh
  pentoo more like i just learned how to use the pen tool
i need to modernize my logo more the old one is looking outdated ive been playing around with this right is logomark concept
      your design sucks dick  just like you do apparently
  the arrow just doesnt look right to me
  hahahahaha  bruh no art degree looks like youre lacking a highschool degree
  hahahahaha  the absolute state of /gd/
what do you think
  another version
  hund means dog in german dog was my nickname in the hood its a logo for my design studio
    interesting but a bit quirky and bland
  i love it
  theres a little weird thing going on at the r that i would fix
      i approve
        thank you
posting this again here please tell me your thoughts
designed a logo for my garden machinery company    why is it so bad how do i fix it and make it good
  looks like something straight out of nazi germany      not bad dislike how detailed the braid is vs everything else would probably try to redo that or remove it entirely         pretty boring imo not bad though just not my jam
  is that morse code
  updated the logo    give me opinions please
  where is the garden  and what kind of machine is that
mine though its not for a graphic deign company
  weightless forms  font is heavy    id lessen the weight slightly increase letter spacing and fix the r clipping into the m
  there is no garden or machine in the image i just like the shape    does it need to be related to the product
  or maybe weightless in in light and forms in black/heavy all in one word weightlessforms
pls help  how do i kill myself  or make my logo better _
  the colour choice is a bit 1980s
heres a logo i designed for a local cafe any critiques
  this newfag put his full name as the subject
im sure by the end of school ill end up changing it
cant choose between any of them opinions
  id go for the left graphics but with the hlvtc text the same size as on the right
  this dumb fag cant even say anything relevant
  yea ive seen the exact same thing used by others kinda boring would change
  sorry but  is right you sound so fucking pretentious and smug about denouncing everyones designs
no my logo but a logo ive designed
how do i create a logo lads    im experienced with illustrator but i have never undertaken a logo project
  put your dick in your ass first  logos tend to need inspiration  from there   just go with the flow
  in this case the easier solution is kill yourself
  i kinda like it but something about the logo is making me read it the initials as ccb also beanery sounds funny
  think me lightening the line on the right or removing it might fix that
  dont post pdf of logos
  what kind of autism would compel you to create this complex shape in ms paint  also not good at all as a logo
    i dont get what its meant to convey
  you need a dark transparent layer on top of that octopus dude that or make the white darker
  holy shit if you are doing that with ms paint i can only dream of what you could do with ai or ps adobe illustrator or photoshop i aint gonna be mean
  the balance is nearly spot on type seems a bit too formal for a cafe apart from mill street bit too up tight for a place to chill      looks alright but not much of a logo would be looked over in situ      not very imaginative could work for a military surplus store or something      as  said nice idea but maybe simplify and make it less rigid to suite the purpose      thin lines are too thin wont look good on business cards/letterheads etc decent concept like      not bad nothing special though maybe try integrate it with the surrounding circle a bit more lower dashes and dots arent aligned with top ones or each other  i see youre projecting them at a right angle from where they sit on the j but it doesnt work for me  better maybe give the is in illustration a touch more room to breathe and the s on logos seems to dip too close to the surrounding circle    also awaiting a roast 
  something like this but obviously far better
  i used another photo for the inspiration but the idea is that you can see a happy dog
  kinda odd but i hope you get the idea
      lol my first thought was an erect penis
  ye i respect your point of view sr  penis is everywhere
a bit basic bad font
  this is way too black and austere looking for garden machinery the shape needs to communicate more garden and less machinery than it presently does and i would switch up the color scheme to something more earth toned even a really dark redish brown would be a huge improvement    right now it looks like some stock graphic for a distopian future like ministry of mecha religion or something like that
  does it need to be related to the product    yes definitly  the worst thing a logo can do is create cognitive dissonance to the customer if you go into a store because the logo has spooky bats and pumpkin shapes and you need halloween decode but its basically a bed bath and beyond you are gunna be pissed    worse yet is drinking past a place because you have no idea what they do and cant be bothered to research into it  in the age of buying shit online you need this to be as clear as possible if someone needs to go online to find out what you do they are already a click away from passing you up completely
  decore  driving    fuck
  decor    fuckfuck  ok i am done for the day
  cute fish
rebranded the logo for school assignment any thoughts
  any reason why you should take the weight off typography  maybe you should improve it and not change it lightly on the other hand the shape of the icon  could have more prominence if you look for another form or add perspective just sayin
  dollar here ask me anything
  do you have any understanding of why the logo looks the way it does    its the fucking dollar store not dollrstoreapp
  no stroke on the text and dont make the fluid green    this would look good with the beaker and text all the same color but you just highlight the negative space with the beaker so its a solid colored wordmark/logo combo
  learn some color theory
      still looks like a dick to me i know what youre thinking this says more about me than about the logo perhaps yet the odds are i would not be thinking about dick at this moment were it not for your logo
  for me it has this fururistisc iron cross vibehmm
  i feel better with this review 10/10
  might i ask how you opened his image and smoothed the edges was it just saving it as a png
  not op  but you probably just save it and vectorized it  ai is kinda good at that 
starting my journey into gd i love minimalist and geometric designs
  in adobe illustrator you can use the image trace tool to vectorize anything its not good for complex images but for simple groupings of color it can work you can also set it to ignore white which will make the white section transparent then you can toggle how rought the edges are and all
  okay how do i become a pentester
  okay just bingd and apparently it means penetration testing damn i though you check if a pen can write smoothly or not
heres a logo i made for my upcoming record label i made this using the wix logo creator thing and it obviously shows thoughts opinions etc should i make a new logo
  although the idea is generic it can be good but it needs a lot of work  the main problem is that it just doesnt work well together the thick outline doesnt fit with the font youre using  you could try making the lock the same thickness as the type but that could make it too tacky or too weak pic related    or you could try other ideas like making pentoo linux under the lock   example     just keep sketching and experimenting until you find something that works and ignore all the shitty comments that have nothing worthwhile to say
  i thought it was a dog trying doing that hopping off the front legs thing this picture makes it hilarious
  not the person youre replying to but im currently interning as a penetration tester and hopefully can give some advice    its 100x easier if you actually go to school for it particularly if you go to a decent school where theyve got a security community learning from other more experienced people can save you an incredible amount of time if youre currently in uni even just picking up a couple of infosec electives if you can would accelerate your progress    if formal education in it isnt an option do your best to learn it yourself and aim towards getting an oscp id start at learning basic web penetration testing
  dude come on locks are such a cliche in pentesting you wont stand out to clients and other infosec people will laugh at you probably think of something else  also if youre setting up as a freelance pentester youre aiming your business at nontechnical people right whats the deal with pentoo linux its going to sound like total gibberish to a normal person
  better not sure that the connection between the a and the z works kind of looks like jar to me
  uterus/penis hybrid
  i understand that youre trying to use the s  step  arrow moving forward but its just not working the arrow is too big too bold increase the size of the s and decrease the size of the arrow or abandone it all together
  better maybe increase the size of the arch and add a dot or a sideways teardrop under the arch to better frame the face of the dog
  that braid is ruining everything i get that its a patriot its not necessary the stars are a little too big kind of distracting
  definitely does not say garden it needs to relate it looks good but for a metalshop or a biker club
hello folks  dumping
the most advanced hack you can do with helvetica and no cheating
actually used on a bar done on my intership after ending gd studies your typical word with a custom typefont client was billed for this i saw none
in this era typography was unknown to me so i was fascinated with just icons messin with type will have to wait a few years still
japan influences perhaps
d  o basically
concept get the ball rolling
this waterfalls are around usa somewhere used the name to just practice
  too much going on a simplified box using the u  d and maybe some trace lines for the top corner would be more memorable also for something thats unified there should be some form of simetry the top and bottom is are not uniform
my take on electrical vehicles logo an update to mercedesbenz still thinking its a badass update 2012
  i was thinking chinese
as part of my selftraining routine i would check stuff on the intewobs and try to improve the original design and when done submit to the company to just make sales didnt worked even once this is a japanese company that creates paints you can read japanese top to bottom so here you are and remember japanese does not change their company shit ever
the 606 is an iconic shelves made in germany i though a nice germanstyle logo would do it i even indulged with a little optical sheganigans
the torque game engine had a promising but awful logo i just sanitized it it was offered for free they didnt used it either
        i like these especially the do not a designer though
i was fascinated with the concept of the arecibo message and modeled my email around this the idea i was on the webpage for years and ofc nobody had a fkng clue of what this was all about
i believe my mental coherence at this point was completely lost
at this point was just doing rebounds on dribbble
created with the intention to sell it to the navy so they put it on the dock of the enterprise carrier with matching stuff for the rest of the carriers fleet actually not joking
finally got lucky and this was an actual unsolicited redesign that went greelighted the site was called aqua zoo and it was on north of new york state i believe the idea is just two fishes crossing the dude was very supportive and everything went fine until the dude got a hearth attack all of sudden and everything went to hell send it anyway to the 2017 graphis annual and got silver its also featured on the logobook site probably one of very few masterpieces to this day
drunk with success probably i was just reusing the aquazoo concept so i merged arrows in and out if you want to see a truly horrendous logo look no further than gzip
they do arms so i combined their initials with a bomb wtf do u expect
they do steelworks so here you are
this guys uses the surname plus to create their logo that looks like  i liked the idea of using three crosses in a 3d way
after all that i was just confident on my skills with logotype imaging and just started to mess with the final frontier typography of course the first steps was just creating ligatures of existing typefaces
my father needed a monogram
still resorting on geometry when felt lost about typo
do you remember my first logo ever this is what 12 years of practice looks like
do you know the spiky wire that goes on top of fences here its called concertina and the biggest company around europe its located nearby so i tried my luck
  looks pretty neat  any ideas for g t or t g  all i got is a t with a fish hook
you dont go 10 years doing geometry logotypes without going unharmed i guess
in 2016 two things happened i was able to break down typography rules that is a letter its just a puzzle of predefined basic geometry forms and i enrolled on a gd masters degree where they unveiled typography for me in all his glory
since a letter is pretty much a geometric form then typography is easier than i though this was done for a japanes sculptor
i just like to do ligatures it seems probably another of my crowning archivements on logo design
at this point i pretty much abandoned the idea of abstract logotypes by now i did believe that a wordmark is much better for a business since you have the name of the company as a mark by this days i was busy creating logotyped on instagram
still not satisfied with my first logo rework i rereworked it remember that is an astronomical association still dissatisfied with the a
as a masters work i did a complete rework of a pharma located in swedenperhaps  i went full banans and did pretty much everything new logo new trademark packaging stationary id cards ads iconset etc and bilingual presentation after all that 12 years doing this thing 14k on course fees and shit i got the best project with the lowerst grades on my class because my writting was the lower pagecount of all so yes i passed it but on that moment i quitted gd for good
a friend said that he was starting a coffee business and wanted a simple logo being the good friend that i am i offered my help pro bono  1 for you if you get the hidden reference after all what are friends for  ps its an english/spanish hybrid he has no idea
  move the star inside the a sometimes a little bit of asymmetry the rays in this case is just the touch needed
and thats perhaps my final advice after this long journey i was fascinated with gd gurus paul rand vignelli and everything i did my best i really did but simply speaking the glamour of old days of gd are long gone nobody cares quality nobody cares knowledge i do still believe that logo gd is king of gd and logo design is the hardest and ulmost trial on gders and thats why today we have so low and shit logos but as nobody cares this is the world that you get and this is the results of it i went as far as i could with this thing finding gold sometimes and failing spectaculary others and since i was just unable to make a career or a living out of it simply i left the moment i finished the masters degree and now i make my living programming in java    i wish you the best guys oh and as a final note i created a company just for myself because i was and still amazed with big powerful corporations and powerful logotypes so just for myself i created my final piece as a farewell to that world perhaps it took me two years of work until i finally settled on it but for me it means quite half of my life dedicated to a dream that just vanished in thin air
i would probably reply since i would come back here from time to time curious to read everyones comments on my designed shite
  your swansong masterpiece looks like a irregularly lumpy yet remarkably straight turd
  your work seems to have taken a southward turn right after you enrolled into your ma however i think the two fishes the three shelves and the do ones are great work with several others being not bad at all sorry to see you didnt make it after all ive seen people capable of far less doing far better
  when posting your before and afters you should post the before for reference i like these
    it spells doodoo so youre not quite off
      you are not wrong thats why i still look at it trying to selfconvince me that its great legibility is shit anyway the word isnt up to much more fiddling its easier and probably better to scrap it entirely lol
  oh youre right pardon the shitposts
   your work seems to have taken a southward turn right after you enrolled into your ma    curious about that statement probably because i went full typo after all that time doing pure geometry perhaps     sorry to see you didnt make it after all ive seen people capable of far less doing far better  probalby my country wasnt the most indicated to job in the field there are parts as good as nigeria jobwise now im in uk
just looking at this from an average persons view im far from even an amateur designer        first one is very good as an icon and pretty unique though the lines/dots on the left doesnt look like it flows as well as the ones up top      generic/overdone style even if its retro       not awful      pretty dope but i dont like how big the first o is really off putting the the other o looks goofy and doesnt really flow like the rest of the image why is the r and k randomly grey is there significance or what       ew      bad bait      ugly and i dont really get it      i like the idea behind it but as other anons have pointed out it doesnt look quite right maybe if you made it thinner and added more steps it could work maybe maybe try to have more distinction between the steps and the arrow so it flows but it doesnt look like a zaggy pointing arrow      good idea but you really gotta put more man its just too simple for people to entirely get it      ew      either adjust the braid and stars or remove them they dont flow as well        looks like a miliary or faction simple not awful but it would give off a weird vibe used for gardens       ew      smart       something a high schooler would make either change it up more or kys if youre below 20       i like the left the most but it kind of makes me think of a television or some sort of media logo if its not for that use then right might be the better choice      this genuinely hurts my eyes stop just fucking stop      meh bait      needs a little more oomph  but honestly its pretty good but feels like its missing something      grocery store / bank horrible font for that kind of thing shouldve kept the 1 with the  too      i like it but id also put some space between each letter it took me longer than it should have to understand it
  for the limited tools you used its pretty good but please do not use this for a professional business      i hate almost every logo you posted sorry      i dont get it but it works well enough are the figures/eyes a reference or what they look out of place
personal logos i did for high school gd i turned in the first one but fucked with them more later for fun but that was like 34 years ago now and i havent touched gd much at all since going forward should i keep working on this at least use the base design or scrap it entirely also sorry for the shitty way its organized away from home and just grabbed this screenshots from messages with a friend

this is a design i made a long time ago on forza and actually ended up liking it quite a bit and had a real banner made for my car
  heres what it looks like irl keep in mind i have zero graphic design knowledge and just made it because i think it looks cool anything to improve with it does it work at all
    they didnt use it because in your remake the point of the logo is lost    you can clearly see that the original logo is meant to be 3 letter ts for torque    i didnt get that from yours at all maybe if its remade so the left hand t is the correct way around
  the remake is not only also made up of 3 ts but theyre positioned in a way that resembles a gear which is somewhat relative to the name torque      the problem is that you put it onto a miata
  no u
  cant hear you over the sound of you driving your miata to the makeup store with your bf
    its not awful for someone who doesnt know what theyre doing i fucking hate how uneven everything looks
  wew lad       uneven as in the spacing between letters
  as in the fucking drawing of the letters
  this will shock you dude but the two logos are exactly the same figure its the point of view what is different your spatial awareness is on point
  damn it i need feedback
    k it sucks
  its not feedback you need its lessons   did you use powerpoint to make these
  thats not useful feedback      away from home and just grabbed this screenshots from messages with a friend
this isnt my personal logo but i made this for some product mockups im making an invented chinese manufacturer
what the fuck is this thread  i really hope yall are just memeing
  cant even read it dont know what youre trying to convey are you an artist i say just scrap it all together and start new use different colors like someone mentioned they look dated practice your signature if thats what those white lines are
  wow lmao i dont think anybody would look at the logo and think thats a dog snout and eyelid i legit thought that it was supposed to resemble a dog body with a tail youll get somewhere eventually      decent execution but looks like something id find in a dusty garage sale cd rack dont use this looks like the worst part of the 80s make a new logo
  oh you think its the quality of the pic im talking about lol
  you still didnt help me out man cmon
critique are welcome
  are you designing a logo for a lesbian coffee shop
jm
  sucks    looks like 3
cc roll
  daym u work for nike
  heyyyyy those are my initials
r8 n h8
  ruined a perfectly good car
  eh  your file name says tab but it looks like ta8
its for my brothers used video game store video game exchange
  the redesign doesnt look like theyre ts thats literally what he said      i agree with  like you dont need a fucking degree to make everything neat and lined up properly look how close the racing gets to the other letters close in some spots not close in others almost everything could be spaced better
made for a possible client
what you think guys
  connect the lines on the k it doenst read that well if you dont know its supposed to be ko
  the hidden pencil is pretty cute 8/10
  im not hyped on the font but i like where youre going with this      would change nothing
alright roast me faggots
    kinda resembles this
    more like hung amirite
  you are not right
  this one is fine i like the font weights and colors aside from that its just ok      i dig it nothing wrong with it not too much or too little next time just show the logo black and white nothing else      your logo is rad someone said it wasnt memorable and id say to fix that is you need to give the octopus something that reflects your values i should look at this and know its you and not just any octopus     i do not know what this is this is not a logo just a few squiggles      you have a sweet idea but the execution is lacking it just needs refinement      pretty average kind of bland doesnt look the way you think it does its a fine logo though it works      is this for a bank im not a fan of these logos as they feel very outdated however it works nothing wrong outside of that      i have no idea what this is it just looks like you were fiddiling around with the pen tool colors are nice though      its average nothing exciting about it and the triangles are bland i also suggest next time you would like to share your logo you do just that the background is obscures your work youd like critiqued      this is bad theres just too much going on and the font is difficult to read imagine this all on a business card      literally looks like a little league team logo      its average nothing wrong with it its a badge and works just fine im not a fan of the font used for cafe too rigid for my taste    heres a logo i made most of the issues with it were designs decisions made by my old manager he had a terrible eye and wanted a logo that was more like one of those apartment images you see outside of their property just too big and too much detail oh and he was a huge fan of big dawg shirts
  works better without the river tbqh
  yeah i made it without but the river represents some tribal bullshit it had to stay
  color theory
  it feels as though theres too much detail and i dont like your fonts   also bit of nitpick because my monitor calibration might be a tad off but it seems as though youre using two different blacks dont do that if its the case
  thinking about it i whipped up a quick mockup of what i mean
rate
  real original
  cant tell what it fuckin says but it looks cool would hire
  wtf this is objectively better maybe they thought it was sus for some random to send them a free logo out of the blue had they gone through a proper redesign process they should have been glad to pay alot of money for this    out of curiosity do you often send people random designs for free genuinely wondering if this has ever worked before
  this is better now just change the font and simplify / redraw the mountain peaks and youll have a decent logo
      good concept but lemme help a bit with the execution
  thanks is says rjmv its actually inspired from alex pardee signature from albums i used to hear back in the day ill probably add or change something to make it more interesting
  wow nostalgia havent heard that name in years but he was one of my earliest design inspirations from a darker time in my childhood lol    him and justin maller mallers former work before he did all the shitty geometric 3d stuff were probably the reason i got into photoshop
  damn are you me depthcore was pretty much the reason i entered the industry
any advice is welcome
  right in the feels
  that salmony strip is fucking with my depth perception is that the point i hope not because its annoying
  clever idea but i find it too blocky too pointy and black too scary maybe make the text smaller or just the spokes or add some texture
  i see the hidden leaf village logo from naruto more than anything that resembles letters
i winnnnn
  thanks for the input could you give me an example of what kind of texture youre referring to
  dont add texture      good concept weak execution would be helpful to know some more context for the logo but i would simplify it alot more the cassette frame is a bit overkill on what could be an elegant nod also pick a new font    ps not sure how i feel about the cog on the d that i put but too lazy to redo
  people will read it as a b take it out
  agreed    but too lazy to redo
        based      based but the edges look weird        good concept but not finished    everything else either outright sux or is good practice but overall incomplete
  also i meant to reply to  for the rocktopus logo because it looks great in that context
  best logo in the thread
  this is great
  this was great when you was a teenager back in 1938
  wow thank you now can improve on my graphics thanks
  where is catal street
  make it green and lime green
  kinda looks like a toilet roll
  you cant afford me but heres a free tip start over    free tip 2 consider subverting the j into a musical eighth note this in addition to your name will nod to jazz and musicality and add a layer of novelty that you can bs into your brand philosophy to show that you can think critically
im so uncreative that i couldnt make anything better than this
  what is this for
personal logo i made a while ago its my name jorin is it good or should i just kms
  its clever live another day
can someone please make these letters solid white with no shadows
this is mine it was originally a semicomplicated diagram on how to draw my head only for the 4th step to be a goofy scribble but i abstracted it    i dont use it when presenting my design work and its more for illustration as its simple enough for me to draw quickly next to my signature when im doing something that isnt on the computer
  thank you very much
  go to  or       you goddamned little shit i hope you rot in hell and never receive a gift that pleases you for the rest of your flearidden mangey yellowbellied life we dont honor requests on this board because we dont want this to become another  or  so again choke on sewer water and jump in front of a bus
  you goddamn nigger faggot  
    lol u mad af
  why isnt this a ban
  clean simple nice    also nice trips checked
  you goddamned right i mad this isnt a request board
based off the ohm symbol and was used for a start up i was working on with a friend before he committed suicide rip kyle
  how about a saxophone
  dont take this the wrong way but this is sort of an ugly logo youre complicating the text and the graphical element looks nothing like om it looks like a bowlegged stance with a dapper pair of dress shoes  needs work if you were to continue working on it
  hey thanks for responding yeah the text is more of just a place holder for now     as for the logo what do you think i could improve on the legs are not connected in fact most people often think of a pair of legs to be honest but im going to stick with it and improve it some more
  just reread what i wrote back and noticed i sounded a bit retarded im quite tired to be honest    i meant to say that since the bottom symbols/assets arent connected people often think its a pair of legs and well feet    im not sure why but i find it really funny that you said a dapper pair of dress shoes
  event button  what do you think
  also maybe b/w
  apologies for spam 
  was this shit logo the final straw for kyle
    i was thinking the same youre shitting on kyles memory just like your bowlegged halfman seems to be preparing to take a piss onto the viewers face  no the final straw must have been the ohsosubtle and trendy   chromatic aberration   time to get a clue from kyle for what the next step in your career should be op
  it really bothers me that the 3 and the a arent level with one another on the bottom otherwise this first one looks good
  absolute sheit all 3 take it out back and shoot it
    
  fag
yet another haha  thanks so far
  actually i like where this is going once you got rid of that stroke around the photo element it opened it up  its getting there
  i would say my biggest quibble is the a feels like its too close to the edge try moving it over just a titch to the right
simplified looks pretty good thx
  simplified looks pretty good thx
    im developing a logo for a small tshirt company called demo graphics trying to make the logo good before putting it out i like the way yours looks more modern
  ah i see yeah a simplified logo will work much better for that application can definitely see my version on a tshirt with more massappeal    share updated logo when you got it
umm i wanted something that worked in bw but its hard to handle that massive visual weight of the black wedge at the bottom    its for a music label
      really like this concept i do agree with the others decreasing the thickness of the arrow and adding a third step i feel like usually when you see a stairway sign or whatever theres usually at least three steps i think itll turn out really cool
band logo
  the logo part is really well done maybe swap fonts for the name though it doesnt feel like it connects very well to me    but that main logo thats great man
  seconded this looks really decent
  looks pretty solid but i wouldnt be surprised if people new to the product/service/company dont see it
  this one also i like this version a lot great sense of depth and organic forms i would worry that it might not translate to something as small as a button though
  its actually 6 ts
  straighten it maybe
  fix it
  fuck im depressed now
im stuck on this logo and i think i painted myself into a corner the company is some errand running startup like taskrabbit while i was doing research i realized that smooth curvy text conveyed a sense of ease and speed so i ran with that idea the only problem is i suck at curvy script text but i am convinced that it is the right idea    how can i fix this
  well if the last logo you produced is anything to go by its no wonder you couldnt make a career out of it no visual impact at all
    by the way yonima means send me
  iw3
  maybe add a little bit of a curve to the text
  looks like a car logo badge very acuraesc    no gradients in my opinion how else can this be used orientationwise
      also make the split between colors is straight dammit
    seriously 10/10 day made excellent humour
  pretty great
hi i am completely new to design i went through introduction page it is quite good can some one give me technical tips like  windows / mac should i buy wacom or anything you want to share that you think will be helpful thanks
  windows is fine wacom is worth it there now youre all set go get em tiger
  thank you
post the most aesthetic movie posters
  you start then
  wtf japan
yeah yeah i know the double exposure effect has been done to death but i really like this one
  better image
big fan of this one japan seems always on the lead of graphical trends
  god i hate this poster so much
  i second this its actually fucking terrible
    yeah but do you not see the blade in the picture and deckard is running along it    blade    runner    get it
  thats pretty obvious but the movie is not about that at all
          i know this aint  but i appreciate your patrician taste on movies      never seen this one before its cute buf missleading gives me an unrelated gone with the wind vibe
i quite like this style  just a montage of clips from the film basically with some text doesnt take a whole load of effort but suits relatively low budget films llike this well
graphic on blank list  no need to be friendly  graphic hey how are you you have nothing write something hey hey
its the visual equivalent of chatty copy i remember the gmail app used to have all sorts of critters in the blank screen for the trash section which felt unprofessional as fuck designers probably justified it as increasing brand image by removing negative associations of nothingness or some shit but it keeps people like us employed so who cares
this is a place to discuss topics about visual or graphic design requests for photoshopping or free work go on /wsr/  worksafe requests or /r/  adult requests as appropriate    

/gd/  ircrizonnet  
4changd  ircfreenodenet  
    

what literature should i read to get into graphic design  
the sidebar on the /gd/ wiki has plenty of book reccomendations    

what programs do i need to get started  
vector  
adobe illustrator  
corel draw  
inkskape     

bitmap  
adobe photoshop  
gimp    

3d  
blender  
cinema4d    

which program is the best for x  
its usually subjective if you pick a program in each of the right categories above use vector programs if your making a logo/icon/illustraton use bitmap programs if youre messing with a photo or stock image gimp inkskape and blender are free alternatives and have the same function as the paid programs but the paid programs tend to be used more in a professional enviroment    

what font is used in this image  
try these sites before posting a tread asking for fonts  
  

can somebody photoshop x can somebody make me a logo  
all requests for photoshopping belong on /wsr/  worksafe requests or /r/  adult requests /gd/ doesnt take requests or do free or even paid work sometimes however if youre new at something asking how can i x rather than can you make x will give you better results    

can i post some of my work for critique  
there is usally a critique/whatareyouworkingon thread and that is where work for critique go    

can somebody find font  
  
also check out your local torrent site or the fontshare thread  
remember to share and not just take also remember that using liscensed fonts in commercial works is a bad idea    

where can i find inspiration  
  
  
  
i dont know why but i like making casino designs anyone have a same like addiction with making 1 specific thing/category of stuff
  thats terrible
  im the opposite i enjoy working on and learning about tons of different stuff
  lets see more
hmmmm
  so all op did was put the text on very badly is that really an addiction
why does every site ever nowadays use white background with black text when the opposite night mode is infinitely better
  nightmode is often exceptionally ugly unless its down perfectly you either get it completely right or completely wrong  getting it right is difficult    even macos new dark mode looks pretty ugly in practice despite the hype
  good luck using dark mode outside or by a window
  i do it literally everyday
  is that a question retard
  are you fucking dense
      great discussion lads now lets keep bumping this thread so more people can benefit from such learned insights
    
  good job since this is an anonymous message board we have no way of varifying that and also who the fuck cares
  is infinitely better  better for what print    i smell a troll
  because you have shit tastes
  yes night mode is better espically how it then shows white text for white text being appealing to the human eye
i have a theory that basement dwellers who never leave their room are more probable to use night mode on everything and bitch about light modes
  this
because people like to be able to read whats on their damn screen
  nice pasta
  it isnt it looks like shit and its usablity outside of a gloomy basement is also shit
i am outside a lot and i feel night mode or dark mode is actually often bright enough to be comfortable i prefer it even though im not a basement dweller i am a beautiful woman i think darkmode is a lot more elegant and modern i prefer dim lights to bright lights in my home also 
working with moire/halftone how do i get this pattern   just going with basic photoshop halftone overlaps are failures
anybody here pursued or considered pursuing graduate design school   if so what were your top school choices and did you get any scholarships or other financial help   mostly local or international     dont pursue graduate degree in the same school you got bachelors
are you dutch is the sandberg instituut a well known design school internationally
/ic/ here i was told to come here to talk about vectors  i want to learn vector art so i looked at some inkscape tutorials and then give the program a try it was a terrible experience the more i used it the less i accomplished and now seems like i broken the program because none of the tools work  the whole experience has been really bad because of how unintuitive the program is  what are my alternatives
  just torrent adobe illustrator  better software better documentation
  adobe illustrator is just way ahead of any other vector software its on cgpeersto what do you want to do with it i think it took me like 3 days before i could start making stuff since the pen tool and interface has a kinda difficult learning curve mostly if you havent used photoshop before   also depending of what you want to do a drawing tablet could speed your workflow a lot also you dont need to learn that much stuff mostly just the pen tool and 35 other tools
  now that i think about it maybe affinity designer might suit you better  it isnt very complete but its as simple as it gets and if you are used to /ic/ stuff you will surely enjoy those vector brushes
    but how is the workflow on illustrator like  i just want to learn vectors as a medium to keep on my portfolio i love the flat a geometric look of vector art and from what ive seen vectors mix better with other media like animation    sounds interesting
  maybe post some examples heres some random vids about geometric shapes and animation youll have to learn aftereffects as well also search for adobe live illustrator      
  but how is the workflow on illustrator like  standard adobe interface its pretty straightforward might look scary at first but a half hour tutorial on the basics should get you started easily    affinity  if you are planning on doing vectorial animation ai is preferable since you can read those files natively in ae
  ive used psbefore its not my forte but nothing from another word  i still cant make animation but i know itll be useful when i actually get to work with those
on a related note where does /gd/ recommend to go for illustrator tutorials
  cgpeers  cgpersia  rutracker  tpb
op here again i got inkscape to work for me and managed to get an idea of what do the tools do  my issue now is that i dont know what to do im still too dumb for stuff like characters and environments and i have no idea what is some basic stuff to do  pic related is a basic logo thing but i like it because i got to use the rectanlg etool and to skew it and cut it but beside that is really bland
i tried doing a rubber stress ball i have on my desk this one looks kind of nasty and i finally see that all vector art has to be stylized
this pear looks quiet nasty i have to stylize even further  should i seek criticism back on /ic/
how did you do it    is gd actually scalable
  yes    increase your skills therefore increasing your value which grows your rate and makes higher profit
  how did you do it  object  transform  scale  come on op this is kindergarten stuff
  explain it to me like im a 5 year old
hire junior designers to do the job you landed pay them a portion of wht you charged your client only oversee their work to make sure its up to your standards its a basic business model youll eventually only be landing the clients and having junior designers doing all the design work
  do you mean build once get paid forever type of deal    build products templates fonts courses coaching    graphic design is perfect for that sort of thing
  stop making shit yourself and start learning business and networking create a design firm and sell branding to domestic companies for thousands then pay people on fiverr pennies to do the actual grunt work     boom scaled
imma tell you this once fuck scaling    all business is a margins game not a volume game i can serve 10 clients at 15000/hr and make fucking bank with next to no overhead    just network and garner b2b clients who wont flinch at 510k for design work if you can code too that helps a lot    after that just keep it rolling and you dont have to put up with anyones shit
craft beer label crit    it is going to be printed on transparent plastic with white ink and then stuck to a dark beer bottle the beer is a korean style craft beer meant to be sold in north america the label wraps around about ⅔ of the bottle    the thought was that since gangnam is a neighborhood in seoul and the translation is something like south of the river a little city and wave motif is on the label to represent the neighborhood and the river    i think it is ok but kind of plain    thoughts
  thats cute i would drink it
the font choice could be better for gangnam lager but the concept itself is cute
  it would be quite unique when put alongside american craft and euro imports it would certainly draw attention with the hangul as i dont see many asian beers other than hitochino ashai soporro and tsingtao which are pretty dimeadozen at my local liquor store
  thats good to hear i had hoped that people would be attracted to the hangul
  anything specific about the font or is it just to wacky to be paired with all the simple hand drawn lines
looks great opie i would just print it out and make adjustments after seeing the actual packaging in 3d     have you considered rendering the side text in a handwritten style i like the font choice if you traced over it in hand it could be a nice subtle touch same with lager
      wtf the wordmark is perfect please dont change it op
this is pretty good doesnt blow my mind but i like it good move on the wordmark    the copy isnt very good though did you write that 
thanks for the help everyone theres gonna be a small test batch made soon so ill post a pic of the printed label when they get made      i had never thought about the side text in a hand written style but now that im looking at it that could be good ill see how these turn out and if there are no other changes to ill try that      noted      no i dont even try to write copy im a terrible writer
  maybe change the copy texts font to something more gothic/serif letter gothic possibly reduce the leading on it also    probably change the 650ml to 650ml too nitpicking here cause it looks really good
  thanks for the advice its the little changes that can really make the difference near the end of a project
im a good designer but bad salesperson    recurring clients would be ideal but at this point im looking for any
  also pls dont recommend websites im already aware of these and would rather not underbid my work if possible
  build a professional looking portfolio and indirectly network go into irl and talk with other designers and nondesigners about their businesses visions and dreams flex with your ideas and build trust with a healthy relationship with those people if they dont work with you directly they probably have friends or peers who are looking for your design work dont be afraid to make yourself seem bigger than you are confidence and assurance in yourself is important imo find a certain aspect or field in design and specialize learn the history the best work in said field and predictions for the future use this knowledge and communicate it with people   for recurring provide a solid experience where the client feels like their needs are being met their voices are being heard and you have genuine care and are invested in their business send thank you notes follow up afterwards and have a certain closeness with your clients
  advertise yourself make yourself big a printing house i use charges 5 cent per flyer full color on both sides print posters or business cards its gonna cost a bit but be worth it
  like put up printed posters on the street
  im a good designer but bad salesperson  be a mediocre designer and a good salesperson
  how to do
to be honest i dont think you are cut out for it i can tell by the pic you choose for the thumbnail youre not the type of person that succeeds creative world
  can you elaborate ive received a fair amount of praise from teachers and peers and have interned at some of the best studios in town
  pff teachers and peerswhat do they know post your work on 4chan in todays pussified world its only real measure of a mans worth
  not posting client work but heres a selfinitiated art piece to show technical skills
theres one for cs6 ps and ai on the pirate bay i got a few months ago its probably still there
  tpb  1337x  rarbg  etc etc    its not hard
  the pirate bay  is it still online
    cgpeersto is the torrent site for creative software programs it opens registration 2 days each month
  yes thepiratebay3org
just look for ccmaker and make sure to download the real one it downloads it for you from the adobe servers and cracks it select cc 2018 as the crack for cc 2019 is not fully ready/reliable
  1337x offline tpb is a honeypot
cracking the adobe suite is fine for practice i guess but if you cant afford a measly 50 a month then youre in the wrong business
  1337x is online and the honeypot is an old rumor that has never been proven
  1337x is online  just checked godspeed anon i havent been able to connect for week might just have been at bad times who knows
what do you guys think about this magazine collage i made its for my clothing brand
  nice type except for the space age bit youre trying way too hard to make the p a connection work and it just doesnt give it some space also its way too crowded keep it simple
  dang i didnt even notice that i was just trying to have to look like age was in front of space but ur right thank you
how can i improve this
  watch some more tutorials and start again
  i dont think its possible
start over
  dban
delete it
  delete it 2
by turning off the computer   take a breather  come back  start over
  oof im sorry anon
theres so many things that make this image disgusting that i dont know where to start obviously a bait but still    fuck me is there anything worse than the slowly disappearing square capcha
font  is this the zommer version of bleeding cowboys may i call it glitchy cowboys
it looks like christian chavez from rbd
  oh god i hate that shit so much
how do i go about achieving this glitch wave effect shown in each of the letters
  displacement maps
  what would the map have to look like ive been trying to figure this out for a bit and cant quite get it
  well this is for ae but it should help you understand how maps work so you can apply it in ps or whatever  
  create a rectangle marquee the width and length you want it go filter/distort/shear move the lines to make the pattern you want press ok      you are a complete idiot
hey guy could you help me find this font
  crop it and use whatfontis or whatthefont also try /wsr/
  ok thanks ill try that
  kek cake this is hand drawn my boy and not that hard to replicate once you get basic principles of lettering down so instead of using a font how about you just pick up some grids in illustrator and knock it out yourself   also bebas neue is better
is anyone using dreamweaver or muse to make websites looks interesting but not sure if it is truly useful
i dont think anyone uses dreamweaver anymore not sure about muse
  muse is good for a onepage preview website but anything more complex than that ist impossiblealso your code looks like absolute shit in muse
  learn to code simple shit and use bootstrap for everything
  i can second this its nice to make quick previews or one page sites but anything else you arent going to want to use it i use it every now and then but mostly use visual code or sublime text
  i used dreamweaver to make my site but its just super simple html i just liked how easy it is to preview in dw while you work
  using dreamweaver in the 21st century
  adobe dropped muse a while ago its actually not bad for slapping up a landing page or a simple static site with a handful of pages the responsive tools are solid too
  no one use dreamweaver anymore try to use muse men      dw on 2k18 come on men
  no some use photoshop but better to use a prototyping program like sketch or figma
  dreamweaver is just code based so if you can already write code you dont need to pay for adobes interface    muse is completely different its a pretty poor wysiwyg type editor wouldnt recommend
from illustrator to vim/sublime/whatever favorite text editor  web browser  gulp or grunt thing for template stuff automation
doing a graphic design course in canada we learn dreamweaver and wordpress    dw is code oriented while wp is the easy ui that does almost everything for you
  lmao dreamweaver is wysiwyg and not code oriented at all
  last time i used dreamweaver was for a highschool computing project its better than what people knock it for but i think the lack of direction and input for javascript and how shit it can be sometimes made people including myself really avoid it
browse g/wdg/ for info on this we use code editors like atom vscode vim notepad  webstorm etc addons and plugins for those editors help too and you should do most of your work striaght in the browsers built in f 12 since it lets you visualice your html/css changes live and even save them to file it even comes with a nice built in code predictor
  there is absolutely nothing that dw can do for you better or faster than you can write it by hand through regular code in a texteditor    so anyone that knows even basic html/css will never have any use for it and anyone that doesnt know html wont need it so there should literally not be a market for this shitstain of a product but there is because teachers all over the world keeps insisting that there is some fucking value in using it well newsflash there isnt    fuck dw and clients who use it and then ask me to fix the craptastic code it spits out
  what are you talking about dreamweaver is 100 code oriented and i think its the easier to use than a normal text editor since it has a pretty interactive ui for web designers  people who studied computer science may want a more conventional text editor when they code    if you know html and css in a basic capacity give dreamweaver a go it pretty much has all the functionality for front end web designers built in      dreamweaver doesnt spit out code its not a wysiwyg im not sure where the confusion is coming from  adobe muse is the wysiwyg      i included a screenshot of what dreamweaver looks like
  markup  code  web developers are pathetic
  fuck off just because it isnt programming doesnt mean it isnt code why would we say view source code when we mean to look at the html not all code is programming
  markup is not real code its for those who are too retarded to learn code or computer science cope
oh nice
  try webflow
  this
  dw has both functions the code side is super robust and highly recommended super quick preview and makes code super easy its like atom but better
ive just realized support for muse is getting dropped    what the fuck am i supposed to use to make my pages now programming is for nerds
ok
wordpress squarespace any other drag and drop website builder
squarespace is good enough but people get snobby when they shouldnt wordpress is too slow and youll still need to learn a few things
what do you usually charge for a squarespace site
  you can do it yourself theres no need for help
hey guys i design logos and typefaces for a living but i find these can be very time consuming i also do hand lettering and calligraphy and im wondering if theres a quicker way to make money using these skills also i feel like we should have a lettering critique thread so post your work and discuss ways of making money doing lettering
  ways of making money doing lettering  tattooing you have a pretty steady pulse
  ive thought about that before but ive never picked up a tattoo gun before surely it would take a long time to get used to
can you tell me how you get good at this is it just practice even my normal day to day writing sucks
  yes its just practice i started off doing calligraphy like brush lettering then got into blackletter italics and copperplate learning from youtube tutorials then just started sketching them out rather than using ink pens my everyday handwriting sucks too its not really the same thing at all
  consultancy
  tattoo guns are weird they feel a lot more like a paint brush than what one would expect  i have 2 friends that became tattoo artists both of them spent around a year after getting their guns working on friends themselves and fruits before starting working at shops  its a whole lifestyle though it might be for you it might not
    besides selling fonts at creative market try getting into selling your own merch way better if you set your own shop instead of using a pod site  heres an old thread with all sort of questions about that  
is affinity photo a good replacement to photoshop    im downloading it right now anyone have experience using this
dont get affinity its trash its a neutered verson of photoshop
  affinity is coming into its own and isnt engaged in the money grubbing tactics of adobe updates are free forever and good something are designed better than adobes bloated beast
i havent used affinity photo so no help here id imagine it works fine but there isnt really a reason for me to switch from photoshop aside from the cost    on that topic what do yall think of affinity designer i picked it up a while ago and its functional enough but im not doing anything seriously worthwhile
  i used it on windows with a 3770k and gtx970 and all ssd storage and it was dogshit slow dont waste your money
  im running it on a cheap macbook finely maybe hardware isnt your problem
definetly has its flaws being a cheaper alternative  but i do like it  has its problems tho with slowdowns and shit
i have photo and designer big fan of both the publisher beta is looking promising as well photo is light years better than gimp and 50 one time is more than worth it
its obviously worse than photoshop but then again everything is worse than anything adobe makes because adobe is throwing so much money at their shit that they are literally lightyears ahead of the competition    taken by themselves the affinity software are good programs that are better than most free alternatives and imo worth the 50 price tag theyll probably be more worth it in a year if they stay 50
  its alright i never got the hang of it but many people argue that its better
  the only category affinity beats adobe in is pricing if you were to compare the programs without mentioning cost adobe would win by a landslide
  doesnt allow you to save/load selections and the available adjustments arent great no desaturation filter etc and i wish theyd just copy photoshops ui more closely rather than using their own clusterfuck      it runs fast as hell for me on a ryzen 1500x and gtx1050 off an ssd    im looking forward to them improving though
  you can save selections  you cant just ctrlj to duplicate a selection from a nonpixel layer or load selection from channel with a simple ctrlclick and that drives me nuts
the logo looks like something a newgrounds flash author would be proud of
i did a simple album cover any feedback
e is too happy
  e is too happy  damnit now i cant unsee how derpy it looks
    lol it does look like it is laughing
  even in its simplicity its crap and really didnt need a whole thread to itself    how do you get 3 layers so wrong
sorry im newbie in 4chan so i did a thread for it just because i dont know how to do it in another way
minimalism / good design
font sucks try again
  nice trips    darken the red maybe add very minimal texture and make the font more slab
the redand the white vibrate i dont know if thats what you want but in general you shouldnt use any of the 5 primary colors red blue yellow white black next to each other as they vibrate the same happens with the secondaries purple green orange and with the black and white  try saturating the red
parental advisory looks kind of low quality
what do you call the type of lettering on the poster behind dakota johnson how can i find more examples of it
the font looks like helvetica relatively common just google it
  not the font i mean the way the way the letters are arranged on the poster   what would you call that style ive seen it before but i dont know where
i think its sometimes used in poems  not quite but perhaps the futurist usage of type is somewhat along these lines you can look up parole in liberta
mildly jumbled idk
  dadaism
    futurists and dadaists still had a programme and a purpose ops pic looks more like they made a mess because they lacked any better ideas
  theres certainly a direction going on there its not just random    op i dont know if theres a name for that but i think just by looking at it and examples of futurism or dadaism you can start to toy around with that style without proper terminology    my friend whos a much better designer than me or was when i last saw him in college always just spent hours playing with design in whatever way he thought of i spent too much time overthinking things you get the idea
  what there is certainly an idea behind the design of the poster it can even be replicated in real life by taking upsidedown letters and hanging them from a horizontal pole with threads in different lengths
  oh yeah and whats the idea  taking upsidedown letters and hanging them  thats not what id call an idea unless you are a kindergarten teacher looking for fun new ways to past the time in class and where are you seeing upside down letters
  implies superiority   past the time
  i didnt imply superiority thats just your inferiority complex getting triggered as a result of your inability to muster any argument beyond your diligent hunt for trivial typos by the way good job
      tanzvorführung  the poster is for a dance performance thus the typography is also dancing very simple and clear idea if you ask me stop being such a cynic graphic design is not literature
  that shit isnt dadaism my niggas thats a minimalist way to represent a dadism in postmodernism     cause in the dadaist we need a lot of help to read in the op post clearly have structure
  you call that structure thats fucking center aligned text  sounds like you adore church bake sale posters and etsy emails
  you have no idea what youre talking about noop lol fucking noop
what about this any input what makes it work how can i create something similar
  im this guy    but not this one    youre an idiot
its either dadaist or constructivist poetry
i need help fellas i dont know if this is the right place to post this but ive seeked help on a lot of places  any of you know how do i edit/open these type of files ive tried with some window recommended programs and searched on a lot of forums but i couldnt open these theyre from an old 2007 game called mini fighter
  searched on a lot of forums  yeah sure    use aseprite or something like spr viewer
  thanks for replying senpai tried both of these just now but they dont open it either  any other that might work
  i can assure you aseprite opens spr files because you can output your sprites from there as spr  and this should as well   githubcom/evozi/sprviewer  maybe your files are corrupted  you can also try googling for a program that batch converts them to png/jpg
was windows 95 the peak of os aesthetics
cant be too sure but i do have a lot of affection for that time period
  yes only xp comes close
  fisher price aesthetics
  surely your mean windows 31
  well thats just like uh your opinion man
what is this kind of illustration called
  third wave medieval engraving
  scary
spooky
  a drawing
how can i recreate this in photo shop and make it look real
youll need to draw it in photoshop
the circuit diagrams will need to be drawn custom for the head im just guessing duplicate the layer and then set the top layer to blending darken maybe sandwich the circuit btwn those two lyers
  u need draw in 3 layers  darkest  brightest  solid    u need do it by hand its hard but its cool ar least
some random article headlines need to have a gif of justin timberlake singing its my dick in a box right below them
this one too
for people that think theyre both assholes

whats the standard price for a musical album cover   and who do you recommend   pic related thats the style i want to go for
bump
i love sbtrkt this is one of my favourite albums
does this look like a solid program    its california state university east bay    what would a graphic design senior project entail
if youre going the degree route you want a bfa    also theres a shit load of classes missing from that roadmap that looks more like a rushed associates degree curriculum
  what is the difference between a ba and a bfa
heres the bfa
  looks like a good amount of class not including general ed requirements
heres san francisco state
bump
id explore some more options we cant tell you if its a solid program or not because we do not know your interests or experience find the program thats best for you op youre the one shelling out all that money dont leave a decision like that up to some 15 year olds on a chinese cartoon fan site
suh my dudes i was working on an emblem to be embroidered in illustrator but i cant get the turbine blades to look right i want some sort of detail on the blade because otherwise itll be plain as fuck but i cant make small details because itll have to be embroidable on a 75mm75mm around 3 by 3 inches patch   thanks in advance guys
  is this your design for an automatic multiblade bread slicer
you should make the highlight at the base of the blades solid and only break it up as you want it to begin fading at the end that should help it look more like what its supposed to be
you should look at some other reference for the overall shape of the blades as these look like bread knives turbine blades have some pretty distinct contours you could pull from even the hub could be more interesting    the real challenge will probably be in having the detail you want come out in the embroidery
designed this table mat for a local place    what do you think
the drop shadows combined with the flatness of the red background make it look super cheap dont really like the space between the diner  and restaurant either could be a tiny bit smaller the sans serif text for welcome to and dinnerville ny kind of clash with the small text used for everything below id try to make them a bit more distinct
  sorry i meant serif not sans serif
  thanks i tried to put them in subtly and this is the color scheme she had its basically just a highres version of her old logo so i tried to keep everything very basic and simple most of the fonts are from the same family and i didnt want to use more than 3 or 4
vaporwave aesthetic
  i dont think so
    your open 7 days and breakfast buffet icons need to be balanced to one another  maybe try a texture for the background    what if you put a white semicircle on the bottom half of the red space kind of like a dinner plate   then place your diner and restaurant in black text over the semi circle
  its all crap but them shadows are fucking horrible
  its fine nicer design is preferable but this is doesnt need to be great it needs to be utilitarian    im betting that this is going to be purchased in bulk on absurdly cheap paper and thrown away when the table is bussed    im guessing you work for this restaurant and that your boss told you to make this but not to waste time doing it because surprise surprise the sponsor frame is probably more important
    i thought of using a texture i might go ahead and do that i feel like your idea with the dinner plate is too much though i made this extremely simple on purpose i just wanted to do an hd version of her logo basically its not nyc where everything needs to be hip and super artistic and cool looking its just some podunk town      please offer real crit post your own work or just fuck off i dont care faggot      right it just needs to get the point across and yes its cheap as fuck paper covered in ads     i dont work for the restaurant i just ate there and noticed all of their table mats had their name actually drawn in crayon like a child made them it was ridiculous i found out they just opened so i told them i was a graphic designer and offered to make their mats for them still havent heard back after sending her the design though
  the knife and fork are the wrong way around retard
  the shit ones always want bad responses to come with a sample of the persons work lmao because thats how critiquing work right
  what you said wasnt critique it was just an empty insult so your point isnt valid
band name      album name      album artwork      old thread

  i have a few black metal style fonts    
  pls no
       the backcovers are a bit awkward i would try and align stuff more otherwise theyre very cool
  nice
  general idea is good  font is terrible
  this one has a weird composition of the cover reminds me of the 60s generic portrait  title albums
  its a weird image
started this  lost interest in it dont feel like finishing
very nice
i feel like some kind of obscure experimental punk band in the mid 80s would make
  digging this
  the fly on the front was the original image
  excellent juxtaposition of pixel font with painting meh everything else
  the text colors are an eyerape posterized effect looks ugly

  the dudes got summerfag written all over his post  the amount of people waiting all winter to say that so they can play down all the bad comments they get  of course we dont get to see his work of course  putting text on a pic badly isnt work  and he is probably too busy bring great to post why something sucks  see above  why even come to the thread  why even have the thread it just invites dickheads to stay and think they have an opinion in real threads
  see above  not an argument
  hey i had another idea with another one of the pictures  i like this one better
goat right here

basic k e r n i n g amirite
  43/10
    nice
  id listen to it
ok so this is my first time doing this    im not even familiarized with gimp
  half assed this one cuz i didnt really like the pic
  then why burden us with your crap
  its ok
  you could of used ms paint for what youve done here or even powerpoint apart from resizing a pic and placing text above it what have you done
  the jew cries as he beats you
  yo this is fucking sick actually i love the shadows on them
my second time ever doing this getting used to nugimp
  
here are some i made in past threads
  all quite nice  the first one is my favorite  i dont really know about grid covers though
  so what
pete ortas ignazo silone
first time trying this exercise its quite fun
  holy shit this stuff is incredible do you have a link to your actual portfolio id love to commission you for an actual album cover
    
howd i do guys
  you added a red filter to a pic and covered the focal point with text how well do you think you did
  my fucking sides
  great idea countering those vertical lines simple and good      i like them a lot my dudes
  what do you guys think  would you give it a spin    
  scrap the whole back cover front is pretty decent tho back should match more thematically and just be overall neater
  pretty good
  its literally just a photo of a cassette tape
first attempt at one of these tried to make it similar to some other album covers ive seen
  it looks the same as every sacred bones records album covers
gaudy techno/electro mixtape cover for friend dj economixtrying to fit in with the rest of techno album covers is this too little
stinky
  i think mine kind of sucks but i havent used ps in a while
  here is a better one i did a while back
  oh i see now your better was never that good anyway explains the other cover
  post some of your own shitstabber
  the shit ones always say that lol thats not how critiquing works fuck face
im a noob but i tried
  it actually looks good
  cant walk the walk i see
  thats kinda cool
  id spend a week on cropping if i was you
was inspired by some of you guys
    folks are just having fun e experimenting but crabs gonna crab i suppose

  random album art thread  i dont think you know what youre doing  look at the very first post
is this the amateur thread
  heres what i managed to come up with saul county down with their soontobe postindie ambient pop smash album the welltodo peasants  back cover featured below    track titles and album title based on quotes from this page      label name birksgate music group was also a result of selecting a random wikipedia article  original picture   i chose rm as a featuring artist on one of the tracks mainly because i really like his recent album of his mono
and heres the back cover i originally wanted to put executive producer anomynous on there as well but i just somehow forgot to lol    might need to fix up the outlining on the copyright text but otherwise everythings all good
  fucking horrible
  which one the front cover or the back
    im just going to assume you mean the back cover then thats fine heres a refined version now with the executive producer credit
  ohhhh nooo i just noticed i spelt anonymous wrong aaaahahahahah
  the font / colours / image have potential to be a great looking cover individual elements are nice but composition needs work not bad for first try 7/10      did you try to make this ugly on purpose genuinely curious 2/10      if youre going for a simple / minimal approach the flaws in each individual element become even more apparent horrible typography 2/10      better than your first try but looks like a shitty opn cover also needs more negative space 3/10      good concept lukewarm execution esp on the typography also why is that logo not aligned 5/10      not bad could use some more type contrast between the top and bottom text and that branch needs to either go off the canvas or have more margin 6/10      meh but not horrible 5/10      good textures and colour but bad composition and type 5/10      too much going on but i like the type 6/10      that texture hurts my eyes text should either be the same size or more of a size difference 3/10      interesting image but ruined with shitty type 2/10
first time trying this out its pretty bland but i like it
first try attempted to experiment a bit came out somewhat okay i guess
  i have literally no fucking clue what im doing im normally a /p/hoto fag who has been photographing for quite some time now a friend of mine asked me if i could design an album cover for one of his tracks i guess he wants to uploade that one on youtube or something    well the only thing i know was that the picture i used is good ive taken that one and that it has to be kinda red    what do how does it look so far   what should i change  inb4 everything  well i have as i mentioned no fucking clue of what im doing i know shit about photography but not graphic design
i have liked them all
  tried this out for the first time and had some fun doing it
hey /gd/    got a job interview in a couple of days and the employer wants my design work printed off   problem is i have never had to do this before because its all online anyway and im somewhat stressing out about it      a lot of the work i have done for my current job is video based and a lot of the actual graphic design work i have done that gets printed i never actually get a copy of it just goes straight to the client or its some massive banner which clearly cant be taken to an interview     is it a solid idea to just chose the best pieces for a series of a3 presentation sheets to highlight the work i do for my current employer / work i have done on the side      any other tips you could give me    sorry if these questions seem basic as fuck     regards
  dude just bring your laptop or smartphone and show your work
  my work does not bear printing on a sheet of paper i have conceived colours that defy the limits of human perception and understanding let alone your puny cmyk colour space
op im presuming youve already shot them a link or a pdf so if theyre taking you seriously theyve probably investigated your work ahead of time and what you present is more of a traditional custom of visual art interviews
if you print it at home it will looks like shit just borrow a big tablet or something
