alright i decided to use aa liions 9900mah capacity is a shitton and they are rechargeable too this is great  chinks sell them pretty cheap too i just ordered a 20pack  thank god for chinks i wouldnt be able to afford a fraction of the nice things i have if i bought them here with insane mark ups
  workbench with no space underneath for your feet or legs for when you want to sit at the bench and work  retarded benches like this why
  its a standing station its much healthier than sitting on your fat ass all day growing blood clots
  900mah is pretty impressive for a 14500 9900mah is horsefeathers
  wow great so when i cant actually make anything because small intricate parts are too far away from my eyes to see and break my back bending over to steady my arms on the bench and shit and dont actually get any work done to pay bills and end up fucking homeless at least ill have my health except the previously mentioned back problems  op is clearly too short for standing at unless its for a midget
  insensitive asshole  that bench was made for a vietnam war veteran in a wheelchair who got his legs blown off by a faulty lipo battery in a vietnamese radio
  f
  most workbenches are like that    youre thinking of a desk or something
  its 18650
  aa sized are 14500 14mm diameter by 50mm length and the final zero is because fuckyouwereaddingazeroattheend even 18650s the highest capacity ones are around 4000mah
  the how do you explain this  you are making some very serious accusations here
  those clever chinese must just be lightyears ahead of everyone else on battery energy density
  you are reading it upside down   its actually 0066mah
  w2c      i could have a workbench twice that size and i still wouldnt have enough space to work because it would be covered with a bunch of half finished projects    tfw power supply is here but i cant open it for another month   so many toys sitting here that i want to play with already but cant did i do gud with the linear supply i know its only one output and nothing fancy but what are you gonna get for 100
  i think those are fakes too good to be true but i heard that pic related is a good deal at 2ea
  the how do you explain this  the same way you explain 5000 watt car stereo for 9999  its bullshit    theyre chinks they dont have to abide by the advertising rules of your country
  why not use the original circuit 1 in 1000 is more than enough resolution in any case and at a much faster sample rate than 800/50  16 samples per cycle  8 samples per halfcycle which id say is pretty borderline as far as getting accurate data id prefer at least 20 samples per halfcycle      can confirm digisparks are the shit and if thats too big for you get yourself a handful of pdip8 attiny85s and a tiny usb programmer
      thanks anon i wanted something more diy homemade ill keep looking
  not gonna lie i would like to see this every new thread btw i dont come here often so idk how long this has been going on
  for a while but like half the time theyre led drivers or switching supply controllers
when a scope is isolated against what ground reference it measures voltage
my friends i have another retarded question    so i wired these 4 little panels in series maybe they will put out nearly 20v with good sunlight but its 3am so my best bet is getting 5v from the flourescent lighting 9v if i hit it with this flashlight    anyway if i were to hook them up directly to a liion battery and lets say with the 4 panels in parallel i got 50v with 40ma or i run them in series and it ends up being 200v but only 10ma is it all the same in the end would both charge the 37 battery the same or did i misunderstand something
  the negative probe the probes ground clip if youve been using your scope without a ground clip all this time id be surprised if you were getting optimum results for interference reasons      hook them up directly to a liion battery  youd see 3242v across the cell because thats the voltage of the cell if theres a resistor in series with the cell then youll get whatever the internal equivalent circuitry of the pv cells allow for alongside the current going into the liion cell youre acting like theres some extra degree of freedom that allows the current and voltage of the solar panels to vary by some method other than ohms law but there isnt because the resistance of the circuit is more or less constant measure the opencircuit voltage of the pv cell and then the shirtcircuit current that should give you a rough estimate of the equivalent series resistance r  v/i which should be far higher than that of the liion cell but probably lower than that of any series resistor youd add in there to limit current subtract the voltage of the liion from the opencircuit voltage of the pv cell and divide the lot by the total resistance and youve got an estimate of your charge current
    wait is whats pictured the charge circuit youre talking about because that isnt hooked up directly at all those will limit the voltage going into the cell i wouldnt run those on something that can go as high as 20v since theyre fully linearly regulated and will make some heat not to mention it might flatout refuse to work since those solar cells put out such a pitiful amount of current if theres no linear regulator and the ics are expecting 5v from the source then youll bugger the circuit immediately  tldr use anything other than solar panels for fucks sake
do you think lm317 can do 3 amps for couple of seconds
  put a heat sink on it and it can do so indefinitely otherwise no the heat builds up on the tiny silicon die far too quickly
  forever but it is only rated for 15v if heatsink fixed that i am sure the datashit would mention it
  15a
  i am trying to measure the ac sine voltage with a probe placed on the top leg of the burden and ground clip placed in the middle of the voltage divider   but i am unable to get a sine all i am getting on the scope are garbage scrambles
  i meant ground pin placed at arduino gnd  expected result should be a positive top half of a sine between 0  5v
  scope input across burden resistor where did you get the 100a primary current from
  its not across burden the burden swings between positive and negative the votlage divider shifts the ground referrence so i measure on the top of the burden and ground of the arduino which swings between 0  5v  the actual current is not 100a that doesnt really matter for testing purposes i raised the burden resistance to get 5v at peak of the ac going through the ct
  measure current going to burden resistor measure voltage across burden resistor and then report back
  i try but thats what half of chips with 4digit type numbers seem to be these days      typical max output current is rated at 22a but it is also limited by the vinvout differential and heat dissipation
  maximum power dissipation is a function of tjmax θja and ta  the maximum allowable power dissipation at any allowable ambient temperature is pd  tjmax  ta / θja  operating at the absolute maximum tj of 150c can affect reliability  as stated on the datasheet more specifically p  v_in  v_outi_out the junctiontoambient resistance is probably about 24 c/w and for 3a at the minimum 125v drop thats 375w or t  90c add that to ambient or 25c and youve got 115c which is just below the maximum recommended operating temperature of 125c even without a heat sink if youre dropping 10v though youll need a heat sink with more stopping power    though ill have to admit if youre asking this question in the first place you should be looking at some sort of switching regulator
    oh does output voltage regulation just die upon exceeding 25a in that case then no dice perhaps you can get away with a big enough output capacitor
  you mean buck converter  i need a constant current so no dice there and the output also has to be super clean i want to use it to test a laser diode i posted before before i order a new driver and find out it was the laser that was fried  it is also just for a 2 second test to see if it turns on
  like i literally just need the lm317 not shit itself long enough for my eyes to register any light coming out at all even 1s at 3a is fine
  could be buck converter could be a capacitive switcher charge pump      in that case a large output cap and maybe a diode before it should be plenty though personally id test it at a lower current and/or with a power resistor as your dropper if youre dropping more than 05 times the diode voltage you shouldnt have a problem with thermal runaway
  i was told that laser diode wont work at a lower current than its operating current was that not true  as in if you supply 98 of the current the diode normally operates at it wont turn on until you supply between 99  100 of its normal current
  im no expert at laser diodes but as an expert in generic laser physics i can tell you that there should be a wide range of pumping power that will result in lasing characteristics and since semiconductor diodes are pumped pretty efficiently you shouldnt have an issue at the very least sending a smaller current to your laser diode shouldnt ruin it if you want to test that    that advice might be true for the voltage however in either case id advise looking for a source other than anons on a jamaican cattleherding forum
  ok i will do it like this  set up the lm317 with a potentiometer to regulate the constant current output amount and then start raising the current from 10ma to 3a slowly and if at any point during the test the diode vomits out any visible photons i will turn the power off and call it a success
  put a pushbutton between the 317 and the diode since surpassing 2a or so for a prolonged time might blow your 317 good luck
  if the current is too low its like like an led and is much dimmer than youd expect from the current actual turnon is pretty abrupt
    the whole thing was the one little solar panel will put out like 08v under interior lights 20v with a flashlight on it and then 50v under bright sunlight at the right angle    so when i put the 4 panels in series i can get 40v under these flourescent lights and then 8v9v with a flashlight inside and im guessing i could get nearly 20v with good sunlight since i got 5v per panel individually when i had one cell under interior lights 20v i was getting negative current between the panel and cell with 4 panels in series i got 5v8v under the same lights and actually got positive current to the battery but low low current that was the same with or without that circuit board    i think i learned that the charging source needs a higher voltage than the battery to charge it so 20v output wont charge a 37v battery so when i get out into sunlight where one panel would get 50v im curious what the 4 in series will do and what that board does to the voltage going to the battery the board was originally just hooked to one panel that maxed out at 50v in bright sun so well see i was sort of expecting the board to bump up the voltage so even partial sun at 30v from the panel would jump up to 50v and charge a 37v battery but it stayed the same still learning
  there are boost converter boards that will step up the solar panel voltage to charge the battery and even some thatll optimize their current draw to get the maximum power out of the panel without collapsing the voltage if your setup works then it doesnt really matter though
  standing in one place actually aint healthy walking is
  walking wears out joints
    see this board confuses me without the little board hooked up the panels were reading 40v i hook up the panel with no battery or led attached and voltage drops to 095v at the panel orange meter is the voltage at the output to a battery not connected which is 070v i expected the board to give a more steady voltage to the battery even with varying voltage coming from the panel but i guess that isnt the case    i need to work on these equations some more to understand it im not sure what that board is doing its the innards of little solar lights so theres 3 / pairs one for solar panel one battery and the third for the led with a daylight sensor
  thats what i though that the output for the battery should be 5v whether the solar panel is sending it 25v or 50v but it doesnt seem to be the case unless possibly the fact that even bright interior lights are a horrible substitute for the sun
  in moderation it harms you less than sitting or standing in one place
  unless possibly the fact that even bright interior lights are a horrible substitute for the sun  yes
  maybe the current is just too low but im at 41v on the series of panels which is close to full sun if it were outside with one panel like the original light    just tried a second board and its the same thing 41v on the panel alone hook it up to board reads 095v from the panel and 069v from the output to the battery    and why would the voltage at the panel drop from 41v to 095v without a battery or light connected     sun is coming up so i can go fux wit it outside in a bit i guess
  the output voltage doesnt increase linearly with available power pic is an example of a single cell where a panel will have many cells in series    and why would the voltage at the panel drop from 41v to 095v without a battery or light connected   the board has its own current consumption independent of the battery granted i can only see a coil and a pir on the side of the board in your pic so i have no idea what its doing underneath
  welp its darker outside than it is on my workbench but the sun definitely has some more juice to it partly cloudy dawn and on the west side of the house so its shady and this is what i got    solar panels were reading 8v9v with nothing attached that still seems like a big drop considering no battery or light hooked up
  hmm ok i see i is an retard with electricity i need some real sun to see what happens but the voltage coming in should be much higher than it originally was and i want to see how that effects the battery charging voltage and rate    and pic shows the front and back of the boards a little switch which was turned on a year ago when they were new daylight sensor in the middle and then the 3 connections on the other side for the solar panel battery and led i was assuming the daylight sensor is basically an onoff switch leading only to the led output and not connected to anything else but im not sure
so i read the guide on lips and it seems actually pretty easy  so for one cell  dont discharge or charge them faster than 1c when discharging dont let them fall under 4v when charging ideally at 1c stop charging when they hit 42v   is that it  i cant believe so many people are getting blown up this shit seems easy
  lips   liions/lipos
  dont discharge or charge them faster than 1c  usually you can get away with faster but it depends on the cell check the datasheet and monitor the temperature  dont let them fall under 4v  kek no youll only get 5 of the capacity if you do this 3v/cell is usually safe  ideally at 1c  too fast for most cells c/4 is almost always safe but check the datasheet and monitor the temperature  cant believe  i habeeb it
  dont discharge under 4v  huh that one seems too high i thought it was cool to go 30v 35v    there is some stuff about storage too i have heard you want to store them at about 70 charged and there was something else about not letting them sit for more than a couple months with a little cycle/charge
  more reverse engineering always helps but i dont see a switcher on that board since what looked like a coil is only a switch so i guess that board is just a linear charge controller of some sort if you care about efficiency you could try to find a switching charger board ideally with mppt unfortunately googling that will be hard since the results will be full of 500000mah solar packs and control units for home solar
    that was a typo i meant 3v    one thing that sucks is that i will have to add some sort of charge control into all my projects to make sure they dont drain the cells under 3v since i dont want another chernobyl on my hands
  i habeeb it  damn that is some vintage meme there i actually had to look it up
  i have been ripping apart these 5 walmart power banks for that purpose its just a 3350mah 20650 battery and that little board with a usb out and micro usb in should give you charging protection if you charge with the micro usb and discharge protection going out through the other usb or soldering to those points like i did    only issue i had was the boards not exactly liking my blinding bright led projects like theyre pulling too much current for those 05a chargers i grabbed a larger 10a charger but have yet to rip that one apart    im sure theres a better way to do it but this was easy
      have to add some sort of charge/discharge controller to my projects    here you go cost about 50usd
  there are protection boards that will help keep you from setting the building on fire but theyre not designed to protect the battery itself from such damage that you might safely recharge it fortunately 3pin voltage supervisors are available and can be combined with a pmosfet and a large resistor to shut down a load early enough to allow safe recharging without taking up a whole lot of space on your board  protectiononly boards are like 5 for a burger better to apply them nearest the battery in case of accidental shorting or the like also theres no charge circuitry included so you might have to take the batteries out and put them into an external charger  protection boards with a builtin tp4056 microusb linear charger are easily gotten and pretty cheap 
  benis  every time
  charging is fine i will never charger them inside of my devices i only need a discharge protection so they dont dip below 3v or draw too much current if that board you linked can do that which as i look at it it can that is exactly what i needed i am going to order a pile of them now
  dip below 3v  those only cut off at 25v or less when much below 3v its unsafe to charge them without special precautions and procedures if at all which is why i suggested using a voltage monitor and a mosfet to protect your battery to easily charge again
what are the downsides of using large voltage divider resistors  surely there must be some or everyone would be using like 100mohms
  whatever adc or op amp is reading it will have a bias current thatll pull the dividers voltage up or down and its worse the larger the resistors are also resistor thermal noise increases with value but that doesnt matter as much
  i see so about 20k should be good for a battery powered arduino project
  20k is perfect iirc the arduinos atmega datasheet calls for a max of 10k input impedance on the adc and two 20k resistors in parallel equals 10k
  lookup thermal noise the effects of thermal noise are worse as the resistance increases
      as i mentioned im sure there is a better way to do it but i was trying to play with the thing this weekend not april 7  may 22 2019 if that china shipping goes smooth    they actually worked suprisingly well once i worked through the overcurrent bullshit and dumped about 8 hot glue sticks into the thing
this looks really cool do you think its worth making    it is for leg bending
  i wish i had one of these if you know cad though it might be better to design a two part die
  you mean cut it in half i can do that easily in blender but that seems like you now have to take care of two items instead of one
  i was thinking of having a top half to the die so your big meaty claws dont get in the way of forming anything 03 spaced or smaller like dips or 1/4w resistors i havent used one of these before though so maybe its not a problem
i was really hoping to see more sparks by stripping the wires and throwing all of these in a pile but i guess theyre too dead    maybe they need some gasoline
i often noticed that when i fucked up and something starts smoking then if i turn the power off quickly and fix the mistake the thing than smoked works just fine do most components not mind having a bit of a smoke break if you dont over do it
  resistors can definitely handle some abuse ive never seen a semiconductor survive after the smoke escapes though
  yeah the only option after that is to take it to a repair shop and have them pump the replacement smoke in and seal the tear so it cant escape back out
  its breddy cool smaller than it looked just buy a printer man they are cheap as fuck i am sure my friend ping pong can get you one for under 500 burger coins
  stick a nail through it
  bending gauges are dirt cheap less than one  coin
  i sometimes get shipping in 10 days and im in fucking new zealand i think thats through yanwen air mail not to mention shipping times are typically within 1 month for small pcbs and such and youve been doing this for at least 2 months now    so did you measure the shortcircuit current under fluorescent lighting
  seems really easy to make with some thick cardboard or some random trash
  well it is just as simple as it looks like  that said if youre such a jew that 1 is too much then theres no pressing need to get that thing
ive got a bunch of motors and steppers from hard drives and readers most things i see on the web about reusing them involves buying a cheap arduino driver shiel or something similar why people dont make their drives it isnt viable im pretty sure i can make two low power hbridges to control the steppers maybe im missing something
  you can make manual bridges or you can buy ics for it people buy shields because they dont require soldering or thought
  so did you measure the shortcircuit current under fluorescent lighting  nah i was busy shooting those used liion cells with my bb gun    3 of the 4 were swollen but still had a low voltage reading and those didnt do shit the 4th gave like 0006v and wasnt swollen and that one let out a nice puff of smoke when i sent a copper bb into it
  0006v  looks like usable energy to me
trying to design babbys first switching benchtop power supply of the nonisolated buck topology preferably with a current and voltage knob that works just like those lm2596 modules im trying to design it discretely from opamps and comparators and the like but i cant seem to get the variable dutycycle sorted at all do i need an instrumentation amplifier im guessing railtorails help but is there an easy way to not require them in general im asking for pointers to circuits or sites perhaps looking at a buck converter ics datasheet for the equivalent circuit would give me something usable but i suspect theyll be a little complex pic related
  those lights were outside for like a year and a half i think the one reading 0006v had a corroded terminal and was the only cell that was actually useful if the terminal were fixed since the other three were swollen    two of the swollen ones were like 300ma and the third one was 17v so i was hoping the higher one would do something cool when i shorted and shot them but nothing happened to those so i tossed em in the recycling bin
  is there a site or a book that can help me read schematics like this i didnt see any info in op unless its in the books that are recommended
  its all fairly representative aside from the comparators and opamps and transistors and linear regulators know how those components work alongside simple digital logic elements such as gates and latches and flipflops and also circuit elements like capacitors and such and youve got basically all you need to know the boxes driver thermal limit current source bias etc are representative of what are probably fairly common building block circuits at least in the context of the circuit    while driver doesnt mean much on its own seeing that its connected to a latch and thermal limit and feeding some power transistors in a switching converter circuit is enough to know that its a circuit made to turn transistors on and off as efficiently as possible according to the latch output and has a thermal override input that will turn off the circuit if the temperature gets too high from this id simply use an and gate to combine the latch and thermal limit inputs and feed that into a bjt totem pole
  most of that sounded gibberish to me when i see the shematics the r1 r2 etc i assume those are resistors and their values i can identify some stuff but its merely guess work for me im sure i will get better at it over time
0dbfs is the maximum possible level in digital audio but what voltage does that translate to
  90kv
  most of that sounded gibberish to me  in that case learn the basic building blocks and work your way up from there i took physics uni papers on basic analogue electronics and digital logic but just looking at and making simple circuits googling what you dont understand and advancing to a more complicated circuit big clive is a great channel to see what fairly simple circuits are out there commercially and eevblog is pretty good for more complicated circuits and a bunch of other drongo    id start with ohms law and kirchoffs laws move on to diodes and bjts perhaps touch on some transistor amplifier topologies then probably go to opamps one of the books in the op would be pretty good for this ltspice is free and a powerful tool for messing about with circuits once you understand its quirks on the other hand logisim is pretty neat for digital logic
  theres no single standard it varies depending on where you are and what youre doing
  well it has to translate to something if i take a 0dbfs peak waveform and put it right through a dac and terminate it into a high impedance load like a buffer amplifier with no other analog voltage amplification what level should i expect to get out    i dont understand how this can vary
  depends on the dac read the datasheet
can you recommend me some good adc module for arduino  basically i need something that has its own precise voltage reference and is able to get me good precise 12bit adc readings with voltages around 0  5v
  doesnt have to be super duper precise just good enough to allow me to sample output from a ct and get rms
  ads1115/ads1015 theyre 16 bit and come on little pcbs for those unable of thinking for themselves but why 12 bit
  12 bit is minimum i need more is of course fine  10 bit on arduino is not enough  also how does it handle the voltage reference on arduino using vcc 5v reference blows up the second you try to run it on batteries and the internal 1v1 ref is garbage since it is only 90 precise
  yes every time      variable dutycycle sorted at all  the 150khz oscillator generates a sawtooth wave the amp marked gm transconductance which is a bit fiddly but all you need to worry about is that the gain is relatively low amplifies the difference between the reference and the feedback which changes the duty cycle of the square wave out of the comparator      oh and thats a block diagram      fs which is chosen by the designer      only 90 precise  so calibrate it out in software or with a trimpot  also how does it handle the voltage reference  rule 1 read the fucking datasheet
  they are ok or its stupid to make them instead of buying a ic
  imo its a waste of time to create discrete drivers for motors unless you need more power than an ic can give there are a few wellestablished hbridge chips with logic inputs that will save you the tedium of wiring up a dozen discrete components even for unipolar steppers the uln200x is an array of transistors with integrated base resistors all in one package    for hard drive spindle motors bldcs youll need supporting circuitry to go with your driver anyway though since unfortunately theres no dedicated ics available in through hole packages
i would like to measure the internal arduino voltage reference which is 11v to see how much it really is but i am unsure of how to do it    i dont think i can access the reference directly with a multimeter so what if i take some voltage 1v or less that is stable measure exactly how much is it with a multimeter then connect it to arduino analog pin and print out the analog value  so if i know i connected 055v to the pin and i get back a reading of say 490 when i know i should get 511 half of 1023 since i am suppling half of voltage then i can use the 490 to calculate the real internal reference voltage  would this be a good method to do it
  them timer chip digits  i like the working height of a standing bench but i prefer them with at least of portion of it to be open underneath for when i want to sit at the bench on a stool and rest my feet/legs underneath on a foot rest or a wideopen bottom shelf  other wise you are forced to stand always or you have to sit sidesaddle in front of the bench with no place to put your feet under there
  i dont think i can access the reference directly with a multimeter    is this the internal adc voltage ref my pdf for atmega8535 says pic related  you can measure it at aref i tried to get a pdf for a newer avr but google was not nice
  so i set the analog reference to internal and then i measure the voltage between ground pin and the aref pin that would be so much easier
    thats the way i interpret it    fucking microchip wont show me the 328p data sheet
  well there is easy way to find out if the aref pin will measure around 1v1 instead of 5v then it means its working
    yes     finally found one with 11 ref and it has the same wording so it should work
  fs which is chosen by the designer    well thats annoying any idea what the typical full scale voltage of a dac that outputs line level pc audio would be
  line level standard is 2vrms for consumer gear but any given dac might not be able to reach those peaks
can someone recommend me jelly bean parts that are easily found people that work in local shops dont know anything they just give you part name you ask for  cmos arrays for use in a h bridge 051a  eeprom serial memory chip 1kb
  so i tried it and uploaded a sketch with just analogreferenceinternal but the voltmeter shows 25mv so it doesnt seem to be working
  post contains no useful information
  cmos arrays  if you want some decent jellybean switching mosfets consider the ao3400 and ao3401 very low rdson and vgs 0085 ohms at 25vgs but be prepared to deal with sot23 packages  if you want a complementary pair in one so8 package try irf7309 irf7343 si4532 si4542 ao4600  if you want parts that are handy to breadboard you cant beat irfd024 and pch irfd9024 if you have enough gate voltage to get them open otherwise the good old irf520 and complement irf9520 aint bad to have around even though kinda large  eeprom serial  24c16 is a 2kx8 i2c device 24c32 is 4kx8 etc on up to 24c512 25c16 and m95160 are 2kx8 spi devices and so on and there are 25q devices whose type numbers reflect mb instead of kb      did you turn off digital output on that pin did you power up the reference if needed
comp sci student  bought a stm32 dev board motors md and other components  the code is easy  cant figure out how to design a circuit  feeling like a brainlet tonight
  thanks friend dont you know any tht arrays i have a bunch of irfz44n and the complementary pchannel guys but they seem like an overkill for what im doing i also have some 20 igbts a lab threw away 600 v 75a kek ive found some 24c16 chips already gonna buy them in my next shipment    im making a lab supply until my scope arrives then ill make something to make signals then a laser engraver feels like minecraft
  tht arrays  i dont know of any i doubt there are very many per se the closest ive seen are tpic6b273 opendrain 100ma drivers with latches built in i wish there were wider more powerful plain old mosfet arrays even in soic  usually i just build my own when i need a dip you could get some of those handydandy adapter boards and put your so8s on them along with some machine pins then treat them as pdip8s for all practical purposes it might even be cheaper than buying pdips proper in some cases  hvmdip 4pin 0300 dip are stackable look for some part numbers in that package using the parametric selector at 
  set the supply rail as your reference voltage measure aref with that then measure your supply voltage and do the math to figure out aref
    what does it mean to be stackable literaly one on top of the other i dont see how that could work
  iiuc the internal referenced cant be switched onto an input but it can be switched out to an external pin for decoupling if it is set as the adcs reference      side by side in a 0300 dip footprint
  these are the things you call breadboards so whats on the back im assuming lots of alligator clips while you build and test but then do you wire and solder or what or this isnt permanent so no solder but you test on here before having the pcb made
  kek my little brother can code and has a degree but i gave him a multimeter the other day and he was like so what do i do with it
  thanks        12/10 please remove your trip and die
  it took me about an hour to kinda grasp the difference between volts current and resistance  still not sure i actually understand it  dont know why i thought hobby electronics would be somewhat easy
      side by side in a 0300 dip footprint  no no no
  12/10  thanks bro      it took me a couple fuses to realize you dont measure current on the dmm by touching red to red and black to black and about 10min before i realized my desk fan isnt running at 900w and x10 isnt a model number
  the gain is relatively low  so this is the problem i thought just using an opamp wouldnt work too well using an instrumentation amplifier should work right or a differential amplifier if the signal is buffered enough ill see about combining the current and voltage feedback lines once ive gotten each sorted individually thanks      if you dont at least know what a solderless breadboard looks like least of all own one you dont belong on this thread  inb4 you buy one for more than 8
  if you cant run before you can walk you dont belong on my 4chan  bad news bro this is 4channel now
  tripfags dont belong on this site let alone in this thread

what is the easiest way to precisely sense mains ac voltage with arduino
  voltage divider thing  adc  pic related looks pretty good    if you just want to sense whether its live instead of measuring its amplitude then either rectifying it and dividing it down and/or some form of capacitive sensing to isolate the ardy should do the trick watch that you dont get any nasty ground loops but that your arduinos ground is properly referenced relative to the mains id recommend using the earth lug for this if you have the luxury ie arent pushing any current through it but otherwise the neutral pin should work fine
  uhh connect arduino directly to mains ac voltage with nothing between but a couple of resistors that is scary as fuck
  it is scary would not recommend unless you can have the arduino well away from anything you can touch including anything connected to the arduino also make sure voltage rating of r2  the actual voltage    going via a transformer can be much safer but adds distortion and phase change if you care about that
  isnt phase change only a problem if you measure multiple phases  what i need to do is measure peak sine and bottom bitch sine so i can calculate rms voltage  i will definitely want to use a sense transformer but i am not sure which one all i can find are current sensing transformers
  unless where you live is pretty fucked mains has symmetry you can just get the positive peak  you could use  resistive voltage divider  some fuckery with opto isolators  transformer  capacitive power supply thing
  i was toying with the idea of measuring the mains voltage with a multimeter and just hardcoding that value i mean i wouldnt think the mains voltage in developed worlds wobbles too much
  it does change a little what is usually very controlled is the frequency youd have to look up what are the regulations you have there and see how it is allowed to vary but its not more than 5 which is the same youll get with your resistors so meh
excuse me i only use the highest quality chinesium 5 band resistors with 1 tolerance  i just want to measure current for my appartment so it should be good enough basically i donẗ want to be off by more than two kilowatths per month
    then you have to measure v and i and multiply each one point by point to discover youll be paying less than you should because of all the harmonics you cause with electronics that arent measured in the analog meters
  also there are indirect current measuring methods for mains you just pass the wire inside the sensor and call it a day
  iiuc the internal referenced cant be switched onto an input but it can be switched out to an external pin for decoupling if it is set as the adcs reference    this is correct it appears on the aref pin which is labeled ref on my nano      so i tried it and uploaded a sketch with just analogreferenceinternal but the voltmeter shows 25mv so it doesnt seem to be working    per picrelated using assembly language on a nano atmega328p if i set refs0 and refs1 for avcc voltmeter says 482 volts vcc reads 504 if i set them for internal 11volts i get 117 volts so it works as it should    note that the register that controls this is the admux register which also selects the adc pin to read which means that the arduino code will write to this register when you call analogread its possible that the arduino code screws this up and i dont see any way to use the registers directly unless you go to assembly code    note that if you are using an arduino mega you use internal1v1 instead of internal for analogreference
  1 resistors are cheap as shit can also calibrate value in software
  endstackable that is      you dont need that much buffering really just high enough resistances on your diff amp a full inst amp is overkill for accuracy and probably underkill for gain  you could get a proper transconductance amp but theyre not exactly jellybean parts  combining current and voltage feedback  an error amp and comparator for current in parallel with those for voltage wired such that either one can turn off the output transistor      two kilowatths per month  thats less than 3 watts sure youre ready to tackle that kind of precision  also what    said about power factor without actually saying power factor
  power factor is linear analog readers dont get that but harmonic distortion caused by switching isnt linear and he will also get that and depending on how he lives that can be significant
  measuring rms current  assumed constant voltage can be would be a reasonable guess should read above your real power
    i think i can get pretty precise actually    i will use a good proven ct with a high as possible 6band precise burden resistor so that the voltage is as close to the maximum arduino can handle as possible at maximum current my apartment draws to get maximum resolution  i will use an external adc with 16 bit resolution instead of the shitty 10bit arduino one and use an external voltage reference ic with 05 precision for the adc to compare the measured voltage to and with all this i am pretty sure i should be able to easily fit within the 3kwh  and if not then then electronics as a whole are just a joke and nothing more than natures random value generator
  why did you ever remove it
  no really fuck off shit dick youre not funny youre not ironic and now youre shitting up our thread as well
  do you have physical access to the power meter for your apartment if so a very accurate approach would be just stick a light sensor on the meters pulse led and count the flashes
  accurate  in the sense that it will agree precisely with what the power company bills if thats what electric meter anon is interested in maybe thats the better way to go
  he is lookin tomeasure the peak not frequency or zero crossings
  couldnt do that anyway the meter is locked away in a cabinet owned by the power company  they wouldnt let me putting anything there anyway because they do not want you to know how much energy you are using for obvious reasons
  hey do not want you to know how much energy you are using for obvious reasons    doesnt it show that on the bill
anyone got i2c to work with esp32
i have a floor lamp with a dimmer thats acting weird first it started pulsing erratically at a very low frequency with periods of normal function and now it will immediately go to fully power as soon as i turn the knob any ideas what the issue may be
  the bill is annual its just a big mistery lump number they dont want you to know it in real time so you go like wow that second fridge sure eats loads of power better turn it off during work days
  the bill is annual    are we talking about residential power or something else i have never heard of annual power bills in the usa
  triac or diac  ded
  usa  im not fat electricity bills here are annual for pretty much everyone
  yes
    is electricity there a private company or govt owned
  both
  both    so where exactly do you live where the power company is both a private company and a public utility and they charge once a year    that annual billing would go over great in america where losers would rack up a thousand dollar bill and get evicted because they dont know how to save money
  there is a big government owned energy company and also private subcontractors
  whats with all the cabinets are there really that many different varieties of small parts
  you need 50 different drawers just for resistors  and then you have diodes caps chips and other chips every one needing 20 or more drawers
  haha go check the component distributors mentioned in op and see how many different resistors they have or transistors or whatever
    he doesnt have a little plastic box with 50x each of 100 values smd all sizes in little zip bags
  yes ics alone could take up half of that space plus the undershelves      not keeping your smd components on the cut tape
what on gods earth are vr3vr0 this is a pic675 im trying to understand teh comparator
  vr3vr0  a 4bit field from some config register
  an error amp and comparator for current in parallel with those for voltage wired such that either one can turn off the output transistor  thanks for this tip        if its an old mechanical meter those do measure actual power instead of apparent power so would be perfect to slap an ir led  phototransistor to    if youre trying to accurately measure the real power power factor etc then a current transformer and sense transformer might not cut the mustard due to phase shifting there are safety features you can add to the purely resistive method  that shouldnt be a problem namely a 47v zener from the adc to 0v and a ptc/resettable fuse before r2 a mov between the ptc and r2 going to ground will prevent any big voltage spikes from lightning and adding something like a choke or capacitor to get rid of the normalmode highfrequency components of lightning that might pass the mov might help also    put a current shunt resistor and an opamp to get its voltage up to a reasonable level on the neutral line and you shouldnt have any troubles with high voltage
  post code
tfw need to do shit on arduino  there is a library widely used to do shit  open it and copy the code i need  the code looks like a clusterfuck with mismatching types ints declared as doubles doubles as flotals some longs as doubles and other longs correctly as longs adc is calculated with as a 1024 top value even though its zerobased so it goes up to 1023  the problem is that i dont know if this code is complete shit that will greatly benefit from me fixing and optimizing ir or the code is next level genius which uses quirks of the platform to stretch the way the types and shit work with each other and stretches them to the absolute limit by intentionally mismatching shit and therefore fixing it will actually make it worse  i mean its a hugely used library its cant be fucking shit
  if its hugely used then theres a chance that the guy who originally made it knew his stuff but the guys who improved it later were retards
  its arduino go in with literally zero expectations and come out with even lower ones
  opinions are a dime a dozen   knowledge means work   belief is for free
  well its mainly used by normies who dont know shit about electronics and are just following a tutorial to make a cheaper alternative to an expensive commercial solution  i guess i will try to optimize it since i just dont see how that crappy code could be covert high iq shit
sup /ohm/ think i just made a pretty gutting discovery    pic related is the mainboard of a commodore 8032 deader than fuck i have been trying to establish the power rails at least are present but this is the only schematic i can find for the board and there are some different part numbers on the schemo vs the board    1 does anyone know of a good lookup site for substitute regs i remember back in the day doing electronics in high school we had thick arse books full of substitution tables all i am finding in google is guides on what parameters you need to cross check breakdown voltages pd ic etc as opposed to a plug in part number receive substitute p/n kind of gig i want to make sure the 7805s are equivalent to the 3045s and arent a bad hack by the previous owner unit came from a ham shack at a deceased estate and shows all sorts of signs of customisation including a new row of keys above the factory one for rtty functions    2 i bypassed the rectifiers and am injecting 9v  30ma while i test enough to run the regs but not enough to let smoke out of the chipset if shit is wobbly i am however seeing 9vdc on the output of these regulators which constitutes the gutting discovery if that is the case all components on the board have likely copped 22vdc/2a unregulated to their vcc from the factory power supply which is of course the equivalent of a nuke from orbit all three are exhibiting this behavior however i would consider it highly unlikely that all three could fail in the same manner unless they somehow break down internally after 20 years of doing fuck all i seem to recall as i was learning about electronics in the late 90s that to3 package regulators could catastrophically shit the bed in this manner and were to be avoided like the plague for to220 packages if possible when designing/building can anyone verify any this
you need to prevent against 505v overvoltage but you only have 51v zeners wat do
  use something else
  
  1 does anyone know of a good lookup site for substitute regs  the term for that would be cross reference but they kinda went out of fashion at some point  lm340 and 7805 arent strictly identical but theyre close enough that ti has a common page for both of them also considering the data codes of your regs says 1981 theyre quite likely original  i am however seeing 9vdc on the output of these regulators  id doublecheck your ground connection first
  is this connection to blame for really slow internet
  no what kind of internet dsl i presume and speed are you paying for and are you see those speeds
  att uverse  speeds up to 100mbps   connect up to 10 devices at a time     its usually been ok to stream on 2 devices but its always hit or miss  i remember the tech hooking it up a few years ago and saying something about a depreciated line in the garage but i cant remember what it was thought id start at the entry point and work my way downstream
  another  wife is streaming netflix but thats all thats going on in the house and these speeds are pretty common wireless 10ft away from the modem  in the pic above only the green and white are live the white to the right is the old telephone that was snipped  from this box the cat58 runs about 12 feet through the garage and into the modem
    cricket 4g is faster lol
  cat58 ive never heard of that before
8 pin pic  4 channel adc  want to control 4x7 segment displays  even with multiplexing the adc inputs and the bcd outputs and the displays ill only control 2   reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee why im autist and bought this shit instead of an arduino ill have to use two pics ree
  youre prolly busting my balls b/c it should be a letter but that looks much more than an 8 than a b or e  24awg outdoor rated
  yeah thats an e as for the depreciated cable where did the tech say it was mspaint me a map if you need to
  thats cat5e    rj45 wires are usually either cat5 letter or cat6 the coating is stronger in cat6 making it harder to bend the wire
okay so i got my electricity metering working i am now accurately sampling watts every second  but how do the official meters store this  how do they take watts and turn them into watt hours  do they use some sort of averaging  should i just have one number and add watt second readings to it
    ahh thanks i know yall arent customer service and i appreciate you taking the time to help    cat 5e goes from the exterior box originally pictured through the brick around the garage and into the living room plate which is where the ethernet cable attaches to the modem  now i have no clue what the hell the tech was saying 5 years ago  maybe trying to sell me a bs upgrade i guess ill check the connection at the plate as well as the hardware
  youre welcome but what the hell is a living room plate honestly that sounds like a potential problem in itself
am   this guy is probably the most right     more likely than not retarded lineman being a tard mangled installation shit happens easy fix as above
  the deprecated garage line is the red green yellow black in the back thats not connected to anything    its slightly strange he used the green pair to run your service maybe open your phone jack and make sure its on green otherwise its outside your house
been using pic relateds 015vdc power supply    may have overloaded the fucker a time or two now it only outputs 2829v and the voltage adjustment knob no longer works     any clue how i fucked it up or how it can be restored
  you might still have enough pins left for an i2c bus on which you can place up to eight pcf8574 ics to drive your display  why im autist  or you could use two pics which is hardly a terrible thing      how do they take watts and turn them into watt hours  sample at regular intervals add samples together and divide by how many samples you take in an hour so averaging of a sort      the pass transistor has probably failed short
  i need to measure two things thatd be 3 pins one fo reach channel then id need to drive 4 bits to the driveri could use the same 3 pins plus another for the last bit and one to control the multiplexer cd4053 tally so far  5 pins  im using pic16f675 quite a neat chip 8 pins and it can do a lot of shit this is my first pic project    now i need to multiplex the displays but with the remaining 6th pin i can only change between two of them    
  three things and three displays
  numerical integration aka a sum
  i just meant the appropriate box ie wall plate in the living room pic kinda related    will do thanks
fuck finally i have the power averaging working  fuck that pigeon fucker tesla and his shitty ac fucking curves they make everything super complicated  edison had the right idea nice flat line with stable voltage no autistic flinging it around up and down constantly so easy and comfy to use and measure
r8 my car amplifier preamp components are on the back side of the pcb i havent soldered on oem amplifier connector and mounted the heatsinks yet  uses balanced inputs from factory radio  3way 4th order active crossover  3 tpa3116d2 amplifiers for 2 tweeters and 4 woofers bi amped is good  144v to 20v boost converter  all on a 100mm x 100mm 2 layer pcb
    heres the other side of the phone companys box really unless the other 2 wires are also internet i cant imagine the colors matter her used a red and green jumper to tie their blue/bluewhite into the bus bar which my house is connected to then left the orange/orangewhite
  what problems you encountered ac power in that scale has nothing complicated post piks
  from what im gathering the incoming blue is data and orange is phone so the box should probably be ruled out for lack of speed along with you guys iding the cat 5e cable earlier  ill focus on hardware and the connection to the router next  /blog
elektro retard here why are my resistors overheating i think i did everything right  ac 220 v  resistors are 48k each  led is idk what 25 v
i have one of those small infra red light detecting 3 legged thingies can it also detect normal light from a led bulb for example
  well some basic math here 220v  25v/96k gives a current of about 22ma each resistor has 10875v across it and a current of 22ma through them multiply those and the power dissipated in each resistor is about 24w so no shit theyre burning up
  nigger dont mess with ac if you dont know the basics of dc and ac power  wiv
  also a meter ideally consumes/interfere as little as possible on what its measuring so using resistors to measure mains with 1w precision monthly is kinda pointless
  its probably an ir signal receiver that only receives 38khz modulated ir beams if you want a visible light detector use a phototransistor
    i get it resistors are built to handle only so much power and these watts are too much how would i go about solving this i just need to power the led from 220
  bigger resistance or large power resistors or use a method that draws less current
  first off use a high efficiency led that can achieve good brightness at a relatively low current and then use a capacitive dropper for the current limiting use a 10nf cap for 1ma led current or 100nf for about 10ma
  you can buy ferrite cores or make someshit up with iron/steel wire or what ever and try atleast it wont be a fire hazard
  old charges and not utter shit chinkshit stuff have little rubberized cilinders on the wires you can cut them up and use the ferrite you can use this for air cores  
  not even protecting led from other half of sine wave  might as well just electrocute yourself with ac right now
  i have a photoresistor can i use that
  yes if you want it in some light flux unit you will have to calibrate but for just sensing light its ok
  did you try google
  not bad but if youre putting a heatsink on those to220s i hope youll give it some affixation to the case
hey guys i want to build a small to device to prank my co workers at work    i build cranes so its nosiy place    i want to build a device where i can hook it up to the horn and either use radio frequency or possibly my smartphone with esp8266 and set the horn off and freak my co workers out    so the horn is a 12volt and is a simple push button i am planning to connect with the horn with two eyelet connected to it i was thinking of using a relay    but most of my projects are either 33 volts to 5 volts is there such thing as a adjustable voltage relay where i can open/close the relay with 35 volts and let 12v current through the relay    or are all relays ran on same voltage
  contact voltage and coil voltage are independent and sually specified separately
  a normal 5v relay shouldnt have any problem holding back 12v on the switch contacts theres at least a couple of mm separation there 8266 through wifi sounds like a good idea but an esp32 with bluetooth is also an option not to mention standalone wifi/bluetooth shields for a minimal 8pin micro also id advise using a common mosfet instead of a relay since youll probably need a transistor for the relays coil anyhow
  i originally intended to use a different cooler but it ended up being far too tall im probably going to end up going with pic related a northbridge cooler and 3d print a mounting bracket and possibly a fan shrould so i can use a larger quieter fan mounted like so
  sounds fine
    pretty damn good if you designed that pcb  did you solder everything on yourself or can you get a the factory to do some of it for you tell us more     t im looking into getting some of my own amp pcbs printed off
  the cat5e is nearly brand new as is your demarc just call your provider they can run a line test from the dsl equipment
  switch from 4chan to 4channel  suddenly far more referral link shills  what hath god wrought
  its not crazy to think it could be youll get a lot of crosstalk from that mess and as the data integrity gets worse your devices communicate slower
  its protected by the 10k resistance bro
  sure if you want to put 20ma through it in reverse
i watched a video where the man shown using a led with mains with a diode and 220k resistor in series but 348/002 is only about 17k ohms i dont understand
  nothing says you have to run the led at 20ma or anything near to it it depends on the led how much light 20ma produces or is that much even allowed
  this running it at 20ma means dumping 25w through your dropper resistor its more efficient to use a neon since they run at 90v
to run an led off mains with a 10k resistor just use a 5w resistor then it wont die
i dont really understand electrics but i have a question  power company guy showed up at my house to remove my old power meter and put in a new one  after he installed it i noticed that instead of kwh the display shows kwa and when i asked about it he said that the power company is switching billing from kwh to kwa  so what the fuck is kwa is it same as kwh
  kwa or kva
  a might stand for apparent but that doesnt mean it doesnt need an h for hour
  not sure i am at work right now its possible its kva tho
  ive never seen that can you post a photo of the new meter when youre back they cannot bill apparent energy without legal trouble maybe they switch to yearly billing if so 1 kwa  8760 kwh
so normally a heat meter measures heat with two thermistor temperature probes and a flow sensor so heat goes in heat goes out and how much water it took and then it calculates the temperature diferences  but i see they sell clamp on ultrasound heat meters now pic related  how the fuck does that work how can they measure heat and water flow without putting anything inside of the pipe
  seeing they have two sensors in tandem probably it has to do with wave propagation and wave speed and its relation to fluid flow
  
    that is pretty stupid  if you like to listen to music then the more you crank up the volume the more will your heating bill raise
  are you retarded     can anyon redpill me on reusing dvd lasers i got four of them here they all have three terminals the internet tells me one of them is a photodiode for feedback control but the internet also tells me the only people reusing them are indians with lm317 to control current anyone has experience with them they have no part number so i cant find specs to design a control system
  ive got two from a r/w drive so one of them is ir but the lens that is glued to it cracked during removal godammed epoxy
  if it can handle 20ma forward it can handle 20ma reverse
  are you trying to be funny or something
  turn your treble down and dont worry about it      thats not what your mother said
  do you think semiconductors just magically break if you run them reverse biased what do you think a zener diode is
  theres nothing magical in breaking shit with excessive power dissipation which is likely considering the reverse breakdown voltage is much higher than the forward voltage drop  also zeners are built so that the breakdown happens relatively evenly across the chip instead of one small hot spot
  its barely twice as much power in reverse if he designed his circuit to be at a reasonable power in the forward region hed be fine in reverse
can i run a piezzo buzzer directly from mains ac with just a resistor i just want it to make a sound when i stick it into an outlet
  you need to look up the term frequency response and work out how it relates to a piezo
  its barely twice as much power in reverse  where did that come from are you quoting some datasheets absolute maximum value for the reverse voltage its not the guaranteed breakdown voltage and the actual breakdown voltage can be several tens of volts  relying on components to be better than their datasheets say to save one diode is dumb jewery and recommending that practice is even dumber
  pls
  so no eh fuck it ill just use a led instead it will be easier
  you realise these are a thing right
  hahaha holy shit only a complete autistic retard would ever rely on these to test a live wire
  wew they make those for 120v thats a lot of power going into a little bit of chinesium
  i have been using ftp//wwwzimmersnet/pub/cbm/schematics/computers/pet/indexhtml as a resource that doesnt tell me anything that i dont already know but thank you i guess        the term for that would be cross reference  doesnt yield many more results i guess substitution guides are a thing of the past    theyre quite likely original  the rust was a give away on this hence my questioning about failure modes anyway i dragged them out and tested them they are dead short between their input and output pins so i guess this board is fucked into the trash it goes       pic related though a non contact tester will only test if power is present a neon tester will let you test individual lines so you can tell if your wiring was installed by a mexican and the neutral is being switched instead of hot etc you prolly dont want to be fucking with something thats home brew if you think wiring a piezo to a mains outlet is a tenable idea      yessiree a far worse option than wiring a piezo to mains via a resistor       youd know all about chinesium wouldnt you you vapid fuck
  not so fast plenty of that board might be nmos even the ttl might have survived if power supply fusing blew quickly enough your chances are even better if the regulators were dead short between in/out and ground it wouldnt be too much trouble to hook an atx psu  a 9vac timebase up to it for a minute and see if anything still works surely
  a non contact tester  is trash  only a someone with extra chromosomes would trust their life to a non contact pen  the only correct way to test a live wire is with something that actually physically connects it to a ground wire such as a multimeter
  tfw no fluke ncv    and yeah im familiar with chinesium i am an american consumer so it would be difficult to stay away from it i prefer taiwanesium    anyway life and the internet have kinda taught me not to go as cheap as possible on testing equipment i may not have 3000 worth of fluke meters but ar least i didnt go and buy some aliexpress true rms meter    i still gotta get me an ncv tester but i normally have the meter nearby when i fux wit electrons so i can stick the clamp in there and look for the little red light
every electrician has a fluke
  fluke indeed
is makeelectronics a good book
  download and see buy if it suits you  along the way you will make some mistakes this is good mistakes are the best of all learning processes i want you to burn things out and mess things up because this is how you learn the limits of components and materials
can i power the tiny esp01 board from mains without using ugly and big power bricks  what is some tiny little thing that can devour 230v ac and shit out 5v dc
  20x34x15mm
    output 5v/3w    who the fuck specs a supply in terms of watts i know the math is simple but jeez
  power supply designers who offer multiple voltage options in a single form factor thats who  also chinks
    so are you with me or agin me    who the fuck ever looked for a supply at a particular voltage and cared about watts rather than amps    let the autism flow
  the first remarkable thing i noticed was the super generous 5mm separation of the high voltage ac inputs vs the 15mm separation of the low voltage dc outputs  so i dont recommend you use this in your showercam
  probably very few people otoh people who looked for a supply to fit a particular volume then worried about voltage probably thought out their watts first because voltages are fairly easy to change  pic  roll
  ever heard of a stool
   i will blame audiofags transformers are always given by power determining physical size probably power matching speaker/amp power i guess
  one of them magic stools where your legs dissapear fucking idiot
  tear apart a phone charger
  search ac 5v buck on ali and youll find some pretty tiny modules if you dont mind wasting half your power again in a lowdropout linear reg you could just use a dropper capacitor  rectifier  regulator dealio which is arguably more efficient if youre going really lowpower
  20x34x15mm  that is fucking massive  look how tiny this thing is compared to even my midget hand  i can can literally fit it under outlet covers without any drilling and shit so adding a 3cm brick to power it would really suck a lot     too massive    ac 5v buck  i already own several of those with the small transformers ones but they are still fuckhuge compared to the esp01 i dont want the powersource be 4x larger than the powered device  am i basically fucked here  dropper capacitor  rectifier  regulator dealio  i dont care about wasting power since it will be powered by mains even if it is wasting like 100ma thats nothing as long as it wont set my house on fire  do you have circuit
  here you are  basically youll need to define a maximum current and be prepared to always run near that youll select a capacitor value such that this current causes its reactance  x  1/2πfc  to be enough to drop the voltage across the rectifier to a volt or so above the 5v/33v you need its reactive power so the calculation isnt very straightforward so id just test it in spice free until it works as you need it to the minimum voltage across the rectifier needs to be at least the minimum regulator dropout and appropriate rectifier drop higher than what you want across the esp ensure the dropper cap is not polarised a film capacitor should do and can handle the full peak voltage of your mains test with a resistor instead of your esp01 for obvious reasons    things to possibly add  resistors in parallel with large capacitors to prevent them staying charged up  thermal fuse on the regulator just in case it gets too hot  full bridge rectifier for a smaller filter cap    perhaps look at some of big clives cheaper led bulb teardowns as they often contain such a power supply for the leds where the capacitor is simply acting as the current limiting resistor since the current through a capacitor is 90 out of phase with the voltage the net power consumed by the capacitor is zero it simply collects power and feeds it back into the wall again instead of heating up like a resistor does an inductor can do the same thing but getting a big enough inductor would take up a lot of room
  so this then eh  
  looks about right yes though testing one in spice it seems you probably have to use a fullbridge
  oh and a normal regulator doesnt seem to shunt the input voltage to ground if it gets too high so either just use a zener or use a zener before the ldo to clip the voltage i wouldnt recommend just running an mcu off a zener without an ldo but it wouldnt be the end of the world    pic related looks to work fine on 240vac up to 5ma output and even at that it goes though buggerall power the 100µf cap could probably be smaller too
someone recommend me an 8to3 encoder ive been googling for two hours now and can only find priority encoders i swear im going to develop brain hernia at this rate
  what kind of behavior youre expecting output  number of input pins high
  output  number of input pins high  yes just a octo to binary conversion it seems like no matter what i try to search for ai only get priority encoders who only encode the highest pin    
i have a newbie question im working on a game boy project with a game that was designed to use a custom token ring to enable more than two players to link together as i understand it a token ring is a network architecture where a piece of data is passed from the output terminal of game boy a to the input terminal of game boy a1 all the way to game boy an which feeds its output back to game boy a completing a loop     i have verified that this system does in fact work for this game but i am having trouble getting connections to be working let alone stable past the point of 10 game boys or so as i understand it the game was intended to do 16 players but i am having a hell of a time getting that to work it seems like the token keeps getting passed around and then when you add that many game boys it just cant make the loop around the whole path    i guess my concern is that maybe the hardware im using isnt up to snuff im using some cheap chinese game boy advance cables that i bought in bulk off of ebay they seem to work fine up to the 10 player limit that i explained but then fail to connect much further i remember hearing once about signal drops in cables could that be the cause of the problems that im seeing i could imagine that the game boy just doesnt have enough power to push data across that much cable each link of the cable ring is about 1214 and there are 10 of them nintendo never made a game boy link longer than 3 feet in length that said i dont know a lot about this subject so i return to /ohm/ to be enlightened by you fine folks if anyone can weigh in and offer advice then id be very thankful for it peace and love friends
  have a look at the truth tables on the article there an n input priority encoder does the exact same thing as an n1 input generic encoder for the case of a single input high and adds extra valid outputs for 2 inputs high where the generic encoder would be undefined
  ill take a look when i get home its been a few years since i made any significant board design and i might just have overlooked something
  if youre running an esp8266 youll need 200ma or more output capability ie 1w plus whatever youre trying to power with it  i see 25x25x12mm converters but they dont get much smaller than that  you might also have a look at    and be prepared to roll your own pic potentially related      so you want an 8wide 1bit adder which is not an encoder  pretty sure theres no onechip solution for that unless you build your own in a pal or cpld
  ill look into it its possible that im just confusing encoders with something else
wire up chip  connect red wire to 12v black wire to ground yellow to data  why is my shit getting so hot  it was because red is ground and black is vcc  fuck you chiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinks
  qaulity
  personally id play around with linkswitchtn2 or viper series ac/dc ics in nonisolated buck topology to get required current power output with minimal effort capacitive power supplies are shit to get more current from them they begin to increase in size significantly because x caps are huge      company ordered optocoupler drivers for some obscure use  one output is usb cable another is db9  db9 soldered in reverse  for usb  white is 5v red is ground black is d all soldered incorrectly  at least they are recycling by using discarded usb cables for stupid westerners
  soldering tiny laser  solder blob goes down one of the legs somehow spreads over the whole flat part shorting all legs  cant suck the solder thin layer  wicker doesnt work  tried scraping it with an xknife no dice  tfw going to have to throw 2 ir lasers away
  test behind isolation transformer for obvious reasons     same fortunately no one will built it
tfw thing stops working after you put all the heat shrinks on  fug
is it just me or has /ohm/ been even more retarded than usual lately
  not just you      thanks for nudging me to investigate the vipers a bit more the few versions that can do nonisolated buck dont look like they can do less than about 105vout so op would have to follow up with a postreg stage preferably in his case one that conserves voltage as current instead of just pissing it away as heat
by accident ive ordered 4 old ass twenty something pics pic16c620 the oldbois only have a buttload of pins and no adc my idea is to use one or two of them to measure 020v off my psu and output that to 7 segment displays making 2 ghetto voltmeters the way im thinking of doing that is comparing voltages while stepping down the reference start at the largest and go to the smaller ones has anyone tried something similar using that the largest resolution would be 08v/increment which is kinda shitty but better than nothing
  twenty something  twenty something pins and each of them have 2 comparators each
  viper06 definitely is capable of 5v and less output at around 200ma  other in this series as well viper26 viper115 etc they might support higher continous output power  output voltage depends on feedback resistor values    though i would probably go for low frequency ones 30khz and limit output current to about 100ma enough to run esp8266 without many issues provided sufficient bulk capacitance for wifi communications as at 4v or 5v output efficiency of ac/dc buck converters isnt exactly spectacular but for 12w designs id say just go for it and test though use of isolation transformer on first iterations is always a good practice to keep  still more useful than 20ma current of capacitive supplies    st provides a rather good tool for initial design for buck converters to get you started on design  but for 100ma outputs id watch thermal performance of smps ics maybe use bigger copper plane for pcb layout or some heatsinking
  as far as im aware feeding 20v into pic will kill it unless im mistaking something but vref should not be much higher than chip supply voltage    why not use opamp in comparator mode one input could be resistor ladder to get desired voltage dac and another would be voltage input from psu or just get serial adc
  a ramp adc would be faster and possibly simpler and give you as many digits as you care to wait for      i was misled by a lack of a sample design in the viper26 datasheet and/or bad fonts so cool  dat turnon spike doe id put the current limit up a bit higher than that
    yeah im retarded ill feed it off a 5v rail if i use a voltage divider to feed the input voltage ill have a 02v resolution scaling down 20v to 515/24  3125v    care to explain they dont have adcs or dacs in them    im trying to use the pics i bought them by accident and they are already shipped
  they dont have adcs  basically you use the pic to measure the time it takes for a capacitor to charge in such a way that this time is proportional to the voltage youre trying to measure i think it requires some samplehold wackiness but nothing too obtuse of course the actual voltage precision is dependant on the part values and possibly noise suppression
  ah nice   i think it requires some samplehold wackiness   i dont think so just some interrupts and a comparator interrupt
  if thats the case then no problem  using pics in 2018
  what is the problem with pics
  you will probably want to use an opamp integrator as your ramp generator since the pic wants a lowz source for its analog inputs pic related clock is 95 duty cycle 1v offset is to allow the negating integrator to zero theres probably a better way to do that but i cant be arsed on a friday afternoon      4 cycles/instruction for one thing the w register for another  i grant they are slightly cheaper than avr and have slightly better peripheral options sometimes
redpill me on ssrs they make mech relays seem like untermensch in every way
  yeah i was thinking about the opamp i have some spares atmega328 but they are expensive compared to a 1 pic im not doing anything super fast i think the fastest think ill do will be related to smps or a pic recording data and sending it to a radio transceiver a remote sensor
  insulation resistance it usually fails short and if you need to switch something very fast using relays doesnt seem smart there are other devices made for that eg igbt thrystors triacs ah and price
  expensive compared to a 1 pic  attiny84 14 pin likely has higher specs than most pics and cost perhaps 16 each smt in a 10 pack from ali attiny85s are even cheaper though only have 8 pins
   if you are american and can buy things from china mail services here in brazil are crazy expensive and now the jews are charging 15r a regular lunch for any foreign package regardless of tax and size anything remotely connected with this new maker bullshit arduinos and attinys included are 4x the price just because brs are jews     so i started using pics for stuff because they are somewhat common only some stupid techs that treat them like voodo buy them so stores usually have a stock of old and new ones    im hoping ill find a lucky store in ali with very cheap nanosother components i need so i can buy a lot of shit just below the tax limit and only pay for one package    end of rant
  american  im in australia ali gives you free shipping to basically fucking everywhere im sure ive seen brazilians on  but instead of going for the absolutely cheapest sellers go for ones with a substantial amount of purchasers the aliprice browser plugin helps greatly
  no free shipping here buddy 15 br monies for any package that comes in and mail service stated on several ocasions that chinkshit have 0 priority so it takes 4 months to get anything  aussie  anglo whatever also you are almost chinese by now so shipping is cheap
  ali isnt necessarily the cheapest place to get avrs without an arduino attached sometimes digikey is cheaper for example right now they have attiny84s in 20vqfn for 040 each in singles if you can deal with that small of a part so14 is 80 each in singles  compare to pic16f15323 in so14 at 071 each in singles      go for ones with a substantial amount of purchasers  this anon fucks      looks like there are a few fullline distributors in sao paulo they would be quicker if not cheaper  almost chinese  kek
  yeah sao paulo is great it is world class in the area of finding shit you need it has literally anything a shame i only go there once a year and again shipping here is retarded because of statal monopoly shipping things from china to here is cheaper than sending a package two towns lets say the average ic costs 06 br money shipping to here and i live in a capital usually starts at 25 monkey moneys but thanks for the tip guys and the only good part about all this shit is that working with these constraints really get your noodles warm
  15 br monies for any package that comes in  that is very sad but at least you arent venezuela  you are almost chinese by now so shipping is cheap  theyre not intrinsically related weve just got trade agreements      sometimes digikey is cheaper  if this is the case and they have a warehouse in your country digikey mouser arrow etc it might be worth getting a bunch of shit from there and riding on the sufficient purchase  free shipping dealio i think arrow have the lowest price limit for getting free shipping at least in the western world
anybody have any experience with fpaas are they actually useful or are they a bit of a meme
  question i cant find the answer to because it is too specific if i buy a 100ah 12v lead acid battery should i go ahead and treat it like a 50ah battery because most lead acids cant be discharged below 50 do the manufacturers take this into consideration when labeling their batteries by halving the usable amp hours on the label
  if its a deepcycle battery probably notif its a car battery who knows look for the datasheet in any case and see if theres an i/v curve on it from which you could estimate the capacity for intended use
  you mean fpaa instead of fpga just looked up an fpaa actually pretty interesting looking but nowdays with ffts and fast digital logic in an mcu i cant imagine anyone using one except possibly for radio frequency purposes
  chinks sell them for under one buck and they isolate completely that is their whole purpose as a relay
  they isolate completely  they have an insulated gate sure but its only a some dozens of microns of sio2 compared to 5mm in a real relay and qc and warranties from 1 noname chinkshit that needs a whopping great heat sink is a dealbreaker for me any day
  reverse current  isolated
  also if you are buying 1 relays who the fuck cares its just a low voltage low current thing the guy that asked the question didnt say at what power levels itd be used or in what conditions
  low voltage low current thing  then use a damn mosfet only reason to use an ssr over an appropriately rates fet or igbt is if its running on ac if youre switching lowvoltage lowcurrent ac then sure use an ssr but thats a very specific use case
  hey dude im not the guy asking or defending ssrs every equipement has its use
fresh bread      
tldr how do i fix muh leaky tap as diy is the best board on 4chan id like a little plumbing help  my letting agents are incompetent human trash and ive been asking to get a dripping tap fixed for 2 years  seems like it should be simple so how do i sort it out myself  i imagine there is a ceramic valve inside that just needs replaced is there a chance i could wreck something dont wanna fuck around with the actual tap fitting
let the water run for a month or two (((they))) will fix it when they see the water bill
no water bills its a flat standard rate
  if you cant see the underside of the faucet we all know what risk is if its in good shape it will all disassemble fine if they let it leak for years through the handle and its calcified together it wont be removed easily thats karma for waiting too long remove screws and use faucet handle puller if necessary vice grip the body of the valve and unthread the stems good luck getting them in town hope theres shutoffs for that faucet in case it takes a week
  your landlord gets a water bill he charges you a standard rate because he doesnt have separate meters for you
  my landlord pays a flat rate because water is publicly owned and is covered as a flat rate in property taxes
should mention its not leaking from the tap fitting the tap goes to a shower hose it was originally a waterfall tap which was disconnected because it had a dangerous glass piece  what is meant was that the outlet continually trickles   my thinking was i would turn of water and empty the pipes undo the screw in the tap handle this would reveal a valve which i could take out take to the hardware store and replace
well i got interested in /diy/ and im thinking about getting this to carve stuff in wood and metal  what do you think /diy/ is this good enough for amateur usage or should i invest in something else  
something happened to picture i was tryn to upload
  respect the duty cycle and it will be fine but who knows what the true duty cycle is on that chink shit
    its very very hit and miss with the offbrand chinese rotary tools some are champs and some are complete garbage that will be weak or outright die within minutes    just buy a black and decker rtx at walmart they are better than dremels and cheaper you know dremel and black and deckers qc is at least competent and that you can return it if you need to
  not living in murica   sob
  dremels arent even that expensive you can get a decent kit for a little over 50 so why spend 40 on a chinesium one is it worth saving 10 and having a 50/50 chance of the thing dying the third time you use it
    i got the top of the line dremel 4000 and i havent gotten much use out of it    my advice is get one of those types where the motor is on a stand and you only hold the implement driven by a flex shaft  trying to do detail work with the whole heavy motor in my hand wasnt easy variable speed isnt as important as salesmen will have you believe one with a couple of settings will be fine and as the other anon said pay attention to the duty cycle dont burn out your tool on its first use because you didnt read the manual
  you can get a decent kit for a little over 50 so why spend 40 on a chinesium one    are you referring to the black and decker rtx  dremels have become complete dog shit im not going to pay 50 vs 30 to get a crappier tool just because it says dremel on it
  i have this wen 30 on amazon im conscious of the duty cycle and it serves me well just wear a face shield the 5 at hf is good enough when using it because those little cutoff wheels and sanding drums just arbitrarily explode
hello anons i have posted this thread on /wsr/ but i have been told i would get better replies here  at school i have to build a lamp with a second function with a concrete piece  i decided to build a small mannekin with a lightbulb for its head the concrete part would be a small podium     in order for the mannekin for be able to move and do poses i need to be able to move its joints ive decided to build the mannekin from scratch and use flexible metal tubes for its joints the only problem is that i cant find these for of flexible tubes in any hardware or lamp stores i tried searching on amazon but i cant seem to find what i want im scared i wont be able to find the tubes and ill have to change ideas i dont want to buy a lamp already made with the flexible tube i want ill need a lot more than offered i dont have much money  my first idea was to make an already existing mannekin decapitate it and replace its head with a lightbulb but  a i might damage the mechanisms that make the other joints function by removing the head  b i might damage the mechanisms that make the other joints function by inserting the lightblub circuit inside the mannekins torso  c i cant afford to waste money doing this if i fuck up the machanism and end up with s useless mannekin      in short i need some help to find some flexible metal tubes that will keep its shape when messed with if i cant find any anything similar to this please tell me as quickly as possible so i can switch plans       thank you very much
  on /wsr/ but i have been told i would get better replies here    im the nigger who directed him here pls be nice if hes not a retard
this board is usually slow but is thorough be patient and tell us as much as you can so we dont have to guess shit
  flexible conduit
  microphone gooseneck
  well im not sure what to add    it seems show what i need but im not sure of the conduits will keep its form if you mess with it like in the op picture    microphone gooseneck is great but the large endings ruin the whole thing for me will i be able to pull them off without damaging the tube      im sorry for asking retarded questions and being inexperienced
  im not sure of the conduits will keep its form if you mess with it like in the op picture    if he means electrical conduits theyre way too big for your project the mike gooseneck is more what you need or something smaller
  i saw some that are fairly small in size though
  you could get some copper refrigeration line and put bending springs around it to keep it from collapsing
  ill try that
  corrugated gas tubing the shit that goes behind your stove or dryer
  just use this   its designed to do just that
    100 bucks worth of tube  can be delivered in 2 days  20 bucks and less  can be delivered after the deadline       aaaaaaaaa
cnc cutting fluid hoses they are plastic and you want to buy the tool for snapping them together     i know you are thinking metal but rethink with plastic or spray paint that shit afterwards
  how wide is that
  the 3/4 locline is pretty damn wide
  they come in a variety of sizes but seriously  you better get the tool for snapping them together i didnt for my project and it fucking sucked not to have it     to give you an idea of their flexibility here is a diy i saw a while back           arentt they 3/4 inches wide     the brand name is locline  but there are some slightly cheaper off brand ones if you have some time to wait can order them from china pretty cheaply        im sure youve seen them before they put them on everything now  gopros / camera mounts / iphone mounts etc
  wrong video oh well here is how you lock them together    
just buy a mannequin with joints that are already flexible drill a hole in its ass to put the wiring and youre done
  metal and gooseneck are the two keywords you should be focussing on your search heres what i found after 12 seconds with that information and an internet connection    good luck on getting exactly what you need
  i cant seem to find what i want im scared i wont be able to find the tubes and ill have to change ideas    im confused  the object of the lesson is to test your creativity  what will you learn by asking others to do your homework for you   if finding parts seems difficult maybe this isnt a class/career for you   you havent the funds necessary you have an impending deadline and if you get some flexible tubing what makes you think you will know how to fasten/use/apply it correctly   you dont know anything about the material youre asking about youll spend more time trying and failing to figure it out    best bet is to change ideas to something you are more knowledgeable about
i dont see why this needs to be a tube whats wrong with just wire
if you are using a relatively cool light look for plastic air articulated tubing
  there are multiple out pieces so you can make say the upper torso with that part
  i imagine he needs to run a wire through it and doesnt want it exposed
hi /diy/  can you help me build a table out of it please  i already have an idea but i guess yall can enlighten me with more ideas   ps  i can afford a table though but just wanted to recycle these into something useful
  you cant build a table out of 4 legs    make the red ones the legs span them with the red and black ones tape
  just wanted to recycle these into something useful    make dildos insert into rectum
    id pay 100 bucks a month to filter children like you
  take a bedroom door off somewhere in your home and glue these to the corners of one side voila
use the cardboard tubes as forms to cast concrete pillar legs with threaded tube at the centre build a wooden form of appropriate size to cast a concrete table top with threaded rod set in the corners assemble your fuckawesome indestructible table the end
wrap em with old carpet and make a cat tree
  send monies to ifuckyoungboipuccigmailcon via paypal
cut em up and make a wine rack
  you can make a set of pipes out of these
  just wanted to recycle these  sell them on cl for 5 each to someone who needs shipping tubes    or since they are cardboard you can literally just recylce them
  anytime i see tubes all i see them for is casting concrete
im adding 6 lights to a room controlled from a single switch should i do it in series or parallel
  sure
   series or parallel  a thread died for this    i suspect you have no idea of the question    parallel    what you posted is parallel even though the wires run from one bulb to the next  series is when the wires run through the bulbs that is never done    just make sure your service is rated for the total amperage and the switch is rated accordingly though these days with led lighting its fairly easy to say 12ga 15a still though think about what you are putting in
  i have to guess that you never decorated for christmas those guys in china never do parallel  when i was 11 years old i went down my basement and played with 120 volts i wired a sockets lights both ways using antenna wire   the most interesting thing was that the 100 w lights in parallel dimmed the further down the wire they were
  the most interesting thing was that the 100 w lights in parallel dimmed the further down the wire they were  thats because antenna wire is smallgauge and cant handle any real current and the lamps you were playing with were likely incandescent therefore they drew a fair amount of current google line loss if youd measured the voltage at the lamps youd find a drop as you went down the line id also suspect your antenna wire was getting warm    you do also know you were literally playing with fire when you did that right 120vac in your house is enough to kill you and you were playing with it with completely inappropriate wiring youre lucky you didnt electrocute yourself or start a fire
  120v deadly  sure and a 15v battery is deadly if you throw it hard enough    op you want parallel
    hi 53 year old i havent seen you around welcome to the group you seem to be very knowledgeable and will be welcomed by all
  i have to guess that you never decorated for christmas  and i have to guess you know fuck all about basic electrical wiring well no not really since you are comparing household wiring to christmas lights
dont listen to these retards series is what you want  all bulbs on black except for the last one returns on white
    my dad does this
  those guys in china never do parallel  thats because old christmas lights were 25v and relied on the voltage drop across each bulb to get the right voltage its a cost saving thing
  yeah this anon is right series is superior bulbs will last longer cause theyre not being driven as hard too
    this is an obvious bait thread op even posted a pic of the correct way to wire this shit and all the morons who replied with series are even more obvious trolls    mods need to do better moderation of this board and delete dumbshit threads like this    fuck you op
has anyone here ever built a crib before my wife and i are expecting in midjuly and id like to build this shit myself rather than getting some garbage from china    are there any good plans that anyone knows about ive done some googling and found some things but im not sure if you guys would have any better resources    something like pic related would be nice doesnt have to have the same features or design either the simpler the better just looking for a detailed list of supplies and good instructions
  no idea but good luck should be fairly straight foward
  i found some plans for this seems pretty easy just need to get a pocket hole jig
  is it a boy or a girl
  this looks like something youd lock a gimp in
  yeah that headboard looks like a lid lol  a head board for a crib seems like a bunch of wasted wood
    just be careful with treated wood finishing products so you dont poison the crotch fruit from the beginning    you can bet that the wood is going to in its mouth
  too early to know yet        i dont think it looks bad im open to suggestions i think it looks nicer than four of the same type and size walls      thank you i know i have to make sure whatever paint or stain i use is safe and i would absolutely try to use untreated wood
  the part i wouldnt want to make myself is the adjusting mattress frame you will have to adjust the height/depth of the crib three times before your child outgrows the crib entirely so keep that in mind    adjusting too early kills your back adjusting too late means your kid climbs out and does a backflop on the floor one night/nap
  can this be achieved by adding/removing box spring mattresses
  stop funposting
  my dad did ill try to hunt up the plans    sadly he died today so ill be a while but ill try and take pics
  thank you anon im sorry for your loss
  fucking f my man jesus
    thanks guys itll be a good way to remember him    will post after its all over
  sadly he died today
    shit sorry for your loss bud
plans are fine but any one sold commercially has to follow strict guidelines on the construction    height of the rail above the mattress the space between the mattress and sides and the space between rails    finishes need to be non toxic leaving only shellac or watercolor stains to my knowledge some woods are toxic and not very strong or have pronounced grain making them prone to breaking in a sharp end maple or beech are good choices and inexpensive
  this 
  fuck im glad someone at least posted this    op i wouldnt build your own little babbies tend to almost kill themselves on a daily basis by the most obscure and theoretically impossible methods there was a case fairly recently where a baby tried to crawl out of something similar because the bars were fractionally too wide apart got stuck and was dead by the morning its horrific and something no parent should go though     unless youre 100 confident and have taken every step or at least lots necessary to ensure your construction and design is safe id just buy one with the proper certification to ensure its met safety standards
  wow what an extremely vague scary shitty example so what youre really saying is that a very unlikely thing happened because shitty parents let it instead of doing their job people can think people can read and research a subject and theres no reason op cant do this himself if he wants to
  this is my post      this is not a vague problem my wifes friend works as a child safety advisor who deals with lots of baby products like child car seats cribs jollyjumpers etc here in bc and has worked for the insurance corporation of british columbia in giving workshops on how the properly use car seating with children    so many things go into a crib design
  dead dad anon here this guy is right the rules are not hard nor vauge dad followed ontario rules for his grandchild will post after funeral
  i didnt say the problem was vague i said your example of it is    something similar  fractionally    those are very vague statements to make given how serious the situation can be either you dont know the particulars or they dont apply but youre trying to make them apply to make your point
  i made one  i just used various sizes of furring strips for the bars and legs  if you want to spend a bunch of money then go fancy wood with nice grains and do a headboard like your pic  the only real important thing is the space between the bars and of course make it solid  theres exact numbers for the gaps but go smaller since i had my kid get his arm caught still and it sucked  you can find simple foam mattresses online and dont need those retarded box springs and shit  the only thing you have to worry about with the mattress is if its firm enough to prevent suffocation and not made of chinese shit that will contaminate the kid  the best part about going with the foam ones is you can make the thing any size you want  another thing youll want to do is make the base that holds the mattress height adjustable so you dont have to bend all the way over when theyre newborn and you can lower it when they grow up some you can lower it so they dont crawl out  and to go godtier you can look up the size of a twin bed like i did and when the kid is ready you can take the side off and build an extension for the base and turn it into an actual bed frame which is why you want the headboard like your pic
  id like to build this shit myself rather than getting some garbage from china    dont just look on craigslist and get one for 50 that is way better than anything you will ever make and will make sure your child doesnt die for a stupid reason    spend the time you were going to do on a crib into taking some parenting classes or something useful     source new father this shit is confusing and kids are weird and i dont want to make the same shitty mistakes my dad made
  its gotta be your first     heres the deal the kids gonna sleep in it for 3 yrs tops tops then move onto a real bed which the chinese crap readily converts into    nobody is gonna buy your homemade crib no matter how masterful a carpenter you are i saw you mention pocket hole jigs so this is a definite but    since you did mention pocket home jigs your wife is probably gonna pop out 2 more after this one neither is gonna look anything like you either because tyrone the mailman is their father    but theyll sleep in your homeade greg crib because babies dont have a lot of options     if you want to build something for the niglet build something hell get more use out of like a dresser or a postal scale
who else drinks the koolaid

  move to a new domain  astroturfing and shilling commences     kill yourself op
   to a new domain   and shilling commences    wtf are you on about
    what the fuck is this
  ave mentioned it a couple of years ago so i looked it up sachs is an odd duck egomaniac to be certain
  why dont you go to the link in the op to find out my fellow 4channer
  you know what hes on about and you know hes right did you put on an extremely shocked face as you posted to make it more believable
    you two play in traffic adults are talking
  generic as fuck
  its 4channel now
  such hippy shit    try jordan peterson
  ten bullets  not bullet pointed   shit list op x isnt even a number this isnt algebra
  try lean principles instead    
  ten bullets  most problems can be solved with one bullet     t /k/ommando
im more of sweat pledge myself
    im not even sure i get that pic is it saying that its ok to shoot more than once like anyone doesnt automatically know that is he saying that some people have to be taught that you can shoot more than one bullet
  in broader terms it means dont be scared to keep shooting until the threat is eliminated if you waste bullets its a few minutes of work out of your life but if they waste your life
  its means kill it until its dead the kill it some more
  broadly speaking it means to keep things in proper perspective dont cheap out if it risks big problems spend a little extra time consumables etc if it ensures that things will turn out as they should specifically with bullets the costbenefit is really lopsided there so double tap if practical even if the first is a headshot

how viable is living out of a car at least temporarily i think if i were to do it id opt for a van with tinted windows or blinds id be worried about people trying to get in if they realized someone was inside
  how much u think your gonna spend
  people live on the street without the comfort of a car so id imagine living in a car would be luxurious in comparison   what sort of things wouod you like to know about car living
  the best ways to stay safe any particular spots people look to park in best ways to stay cleanly etc
  ive never done this myself but heard that people get a gym membership at a place with several locations so they can have access to amenities if they want to move around    as for how to stay safe and where to park id guess car parks near shops would be ideal make sure youre parking legally as well    id recommend checking out some people on youtube look for a guy who spent a year living in a jeep wrangler theres also another guy and his gf that travelled the world in a mitsubishi delica van they both had sightly different setups but that should give you some good ideas on where to start why do you want to live in a car
  i dont but its good to know if i find myself in that situation sometime in the future just like knowing how to survive in the woods only urban
  yeah thats definitely not a bad idea not sure how it works in the states but in australia here you can get a post office box for mail to be sent to if you can do something like that itd be a good idea to have that set up in advance and have all your mail sent there
  ah thats smart we do have post office boxes for businesses though im not sure if you need an official address or anything i doubt it matters beyond the initial registration process if youre paying for it its not like theyre going out to check if you still live there
  like most things if youre a cute girl youll do fine if youre a non threatening and attractive boy youll get by if youre an unattractive girl youll have to find ways to manage unattractive and male act fucking psycho until its no longer an act youre stuck there dont worry you wont live long    areas that can ice over will make you miserable areas that dont ice over are already full of people in the same bad situation things dont get better but hey at least you arent paying the rent jew right youre sticking it to the man you rebel    get cheap knives at thrift stores fillet knives are intimidating in the dark they look like theyll break off in the attacker get a gun or at least suck off the guy that has a gun if you dont your urban camping vehicle wont be yours for long dont be the guy with the nicest stuff things get ugly fast    a vehicle can reduce your mobility if you dont always have cash for gas and repairs you still get treated like shit its difficult to keep up to date tags on the plates    anything is better than homelessness anything except that minor inconvenience youre currently facing that inconvenience is insurmountable just make the plunge everything will turn out all right and someone nice will find you and save you the end
  speaking from experience anon or just being edgy
  you may want to take a look at 
  you know why walmart parking lots are so huge its supposedly so people living out of their vehicles have a safe space to park
  if you have enough room to lay down and get a shower it is doable you will also want a po box remember to get very warm clothing for the winter and find a way to cook or else going to restaurants will be worse than just renting you could eat only food that requires no refrigeration or cooking but those items can be deceptively expensive and the cheap staples are usually cooked i also hope you find nice places to park getting harassed by the cops/theives in the middle of the night is no fun
  i think if youre taking classes at the same time where you have access to university or college amenities that would let you have access to showers and a microwave i mean if youre only really using your car for sleeping it might not be too bad
  theres a thread about this exact question here   
  its supposedly so people living out of their vehicles have a safe space to park    this is bullshit and you know it
  official address  youll need to prove your residence at an official post office location with something like a utility bill or rental agreement and id id assume the same goes for a mailboxes etc type store boxes are available to anyone wanting the service no need to have a business  opened one in 1999 with notasmuch as a please and a thank you and a couple simoleans  be 199917 and receive notice that i must now provide proof of residence to continue mail service  like wtf  heard something something terrorism  fml
can i diy myself a high quality pair of headphones id prefer something thats entirely analog but in the higher end range they dont have to look great where do i buy decent audio drivers im looking for similar quality to vmoda m100s or similar
  where do i buy decent audio drivers  thats where all of the work goes how is that /diy/ing yourself a high quality pair of headphones
  entirely analog     as if you have a choice
  use protective earmuffs they are made to insulate external voices and are perfect for earphones with no outside stuff giving problems you are good to go with basic elements
sorry im bothering you but /sci/ is full of autists  want to turn a 30000 gallon propane tank into a submarine  positive max pressure is 250psi 17atm  so filling it up with compressed air at 250psi would theoretically imply the submarine could operate at depths of 170m and beyond or how does that work
  you need a double hull stick the propane tank inside a shipping container your crush depth should be about 10 atmos after that
  forgot to mention for anyone who might not know 1atm  10m of seawater
  thinking crush pressure is the same a inflation pressure
  depths of 170m and beyond  lets see quick calculation   yup you be fine anon prob won need to worry about the beyond bit much tho pls livestream
  yeah the weight of the tank and added machinery will be definitely probably negligible
  he can just increase pressure on the inside to prevent getting crushed 
  filling it up with compressed air at 250psi would theoretically imply the submarine could operate at depths of 170m  it would but you might as well just scuba dive if youre going to pressurize the inside when you pressurize the inside youre absorbing nitrogen just like you would be while scuba diving and thus youd need to make decompression stops on your way up to avoid the bends having an honest to god pressure hull to maintain 1 atmosphere inside would require a lot more than your propane tank would handle
  make sure to use asbestos for the bulkheads and openings so if theres a fire youll be safe and mercury for ballast because its so dense youll need less of it than water for trim so more room for air safety first op
  and mercury for ballast  mercury is more dense than lead 1355 g/cm3 vs 1136g/cm3 so not only would he not have to worry about lead poisoning it would take up less valuable space
  honestly hoping someone in prison buttrapes madsen for what he did shouldve been given the death penalty for what he did to that journalist
  shouldve been given the death penalty for what he did to that journalist   should be given the maarjamaa risti teenetemärk the highest honor that can be bestowed upon a human aside from suomen valkoisen ruusun ritarikunta which i reserve for people who kill russians for taking out a fucking journalist kill all of those communist shits
  250psi would theoretically imply the submarine could operate at depths of 170m and beyond  the rated pressure pushes outwards against the tank its basically unrated for pressure against the outside of the cylinder it would probably withstand more than say a thermos or a sealed length of pipe but it would be unpredictable and may fail catastrophically at depths as shallow as 2 m
  reported to suojelupoliisi
  just dont stab any journalist in the vagina ok 
  op seems to be interested in countering the outside water pressure with compressed air on the inside in which case the only net pressure on the tank would be from the pwiressure differential from the top to the bottom of the tank and the weight of op and anything else inside that would of course be impractical for a number of reasons and technically tricky to pull off correctly but if op is competent it could work of course op is likely to kill himself via implosion bends or explosive decompression if he tries and if he uses actual air he would suffer nitrogen narcosis and oxygen toxicity at relatively shallow depths and 170m would kill him outright
  mercury would unironically be a good ballast tho
  not really its expensive and sloshy
    depleted uranium is much better than mercury all around which is why its actually used for ballast
  implosion or explosive decompression  how are these different
  decompression implies pressure inside the vessel reduces to meet outside pressure implosion the pressure outside is greater and gets in to normalise pressure difference
  i can see how the two differ as models in that explanation but not how it would play out in practice     are you saying implosion necessitates a breach of the compartment
  are you saying implosion necessitates a breach of the compartment    the navy has a term for that black hole implosion where the submarine is crushed to the size of a walnut and yet the hull is not breached due to american engineering prowess
  implosion  propane tank sub is at depth situation normal  internal air pressure system malfunctions pressure too low for depth  thin propane tank walls buckle under the water pressure collapsing inward and crushing op    explosive decompression  sub is at depth situation normal  sub rises to the surface but op forgot to vent the pressure as he rises  internal pressure too much for thin propane tank walls a place where op welded an internal bulkhead and neglected to anneal splits open  op is forced through a 1/4 opening emerging as a fine mist accompanied by a bang as the air inside the sub expands to 17 times its former size    that last part isnt exaggeration btw there have been some spectacular accidents
  kek imagine the cost and the poor fisherman who finds his body
  youre thinking of lead    and then when rations run low you can shave off sprinkles and sweeten up your moldy buns
  no im thinking of depleted uranium    its almost twice as dense as lead while being a few times as expensive its used where space has enough value to justify the higher price per pound mercury is both less dense and much more expensive while being a liquid
  if you pressurise the inside to 17bar you will die from oxygen poisoning at this pressure you cant survive as you either die from hypoxia or oxygen toxicity no ratio of o2 is survivable also nitrogen becomes a sedative at higher pressure
how should i hang things on my wall without nails or screws
yes
no more nails or evostik 528
command hooks unless by hang you meant mount and then some fancy double sided tape will do the trick
could i make a ray that heats stuff outside itself if microwaves work by the waves bouncing on the inside couldnt you channel the waves like this
  sure it can  disassemble the case and fire it up
  microwave ovens only reflect them for efficiency theyll cook shit good without bouncing
barrel  nope not how it works use a dish to reflect it into your target
disassemble the microwave and take out the magnetron make sure to not scratch the white beryllium oxide insulator  now add a firing system and aluminum foil dish around the magnetron
if you make it post pics
easy to screw up the aiming also microwave power drops with the square of the distance i think so hard to be useful beyond a few feet unless your really pumping power into it
  no something like this would work though  the black box is the generator the yellow lines are the output microwaves the red lines are the reflected microwaves and the blue circle is a mirror  the mirror should be parabolic but i cant draw a parabola
op is going to fucking sterilize himself kek
  can u fry a sat transceiver if you mount a magnetron to a sat dish focal point
congratulations you invented the horn antenna
to make a microwave heat ray it will take more than a dish youll need a waveguide    you lack the ability to make your own waveguide
  did you now that people have used microwaves to efficiently heat houses microwaves can be used so that only people are heated energy savings are huge but it hasnt caught on because it jams wifi
  he doesnt know about wave guides
  inverse square
bump
i also wanted to do this so i opened up a book on microwave antenna design then closed it when i saw triple integrals  but the short answer is yes you can absolutely make a microwave heat ray but without a good antenna the rays will scatter so quickly you will only get the results you want right at the opening of the waveguide even a horn antenna will probably not be sufficient   understand that microwave radiation poses the greatest risk to your eyes there is not enough blood flow through the lens of your eye to cool it down so you can burn your eyes very easily with microwaves
bye bye ops corneas
  yes its possible however youre going to need significant cooling on the magnatron and transformer    keep in mind when the microwaves radiate fre antenna they come out in a bagel type shape to picture this put a bagel on top of the magnetron and have the antenna in the center of the bagel  theres your ideal wave output    jamming wifi and shutting off wireless routers is more than possible    on second thought put one in the front of your car power it with an inverter when someone cuts you off flip a switch and see what happens
  thats a good way to melt anons eyeballs and fry the rest of the body if anon doesnt know what hes doing
  that may work but it just doesnt seem like a good idea to me
fourth post was mine an improved version  magnetron is at the very bottom of a container made up of the microwave reflection material  the container looks like a cone with a dish at the large end it is hollow and filled with hydrogen gas it also has a glass window at the cone tip
  infared will do a better job
  basically what the chinese do to america embassies
  
  a maser /ˈmejzər/ an acronym for microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation is a device that produces coherent electromagnetic waves through amplification by stimulated emission

so i inherited a record player from my grandmother sadly when i tried to play a record the turntable wouldnt spin the radio works and the speakers seem alright but when i turn it to phono and and turn the knob on the turntable to on the plate doesnt spin is there some sort of method to start this that i missed   what are some troubleshooting methods im very new to doing stuff like this and i cant find anything on the model of the record player  its a zenith model y906 it says on the back    what are some things that i can do to try and get it running thanks
iirc theres a retaining ring in the center  remove it and the whole table should lift off exposing the motor  have you tried spinning it by hand to get it going
  dont use the record players on those old console units they were not high quality and they will wear down your records much faster than a good unit even if you put a decent needle in them which will be very hard to source while nice looking they were not made with highquality components and they have very limited directionality due to the speakers being mounted so closely together just use it as a radio or wire an mp3 player or bluetooth receiver into it somewhere if you are lucky it will have rca ports on it somewhere if not and you feel like doing some testing it should have a wiring diagram pasted to the inside somewhere post it and we can maybe find where you need to add a connection    as for your issue does the table spin freely by hand if so it might be a broken belt or a bad motor is it stuck then something is locked up
  dont use the record players on those old console units      well that defeats the entire purpose of this thread op pbviouslty wants to use it or else he wouldnt have asked for help if you are just gonna offer advice like bad quality dont use it then fuckoff not everyone needs hi end equipment to enjoy the nostalgia of old equipment im sure the point op is making is he wants to make it work regardless of the quality so either suggest something useful or shut the fuck up    now as far as op is concerned open it up check inside to see if there is a belt most likelt thats the issue these things did not have direct drive like high end turntables do so thats probably the issue check it out let us know whats going on you wont be able to tell whats wrong by just turning knobs and staring at it for an hour unless you get inside and see whats going on
  it will literally destroy his records but hey you do you
   op for once provides a model number   this pompous faggot sperging out about belts  its a direct drive turntable numbnuts lrn2google    op if you hear the motor running you likely have a worn drive wheel i dont know how youd go replacing that if you do not hear the motor run its either siezed up or is not getting power if it spins freely check the switch in the bottom of the tone arm measure with a meter for function and supply voltage if you have one     and definitely this  records were cheap and expendable back in the day it was expected youd go through a few even if you got a modern stylus and cartridge im not sure you can balance the tone arm on that thing i wouldnt put anything i cared about through it
  yell into your grandfathers asshole
  its a direct drive turntable numbnuts  oh the irony its an idler wheel turntable smoothnuts
  seriously why is this site called /diy/ it should be called /difm/    damn you people are lazy and stupid
  its an idler wheel turntable smoothnuts  this  the motor shaft turns against a rubber edged wheel which is part of a gearbox which rubs against the inside of the turntable  the gearbox selects the speed 78 45 or 331/3 rpm    likely the oil has solidified on some of the shafts or the motor and gummed it up  also the rubber tires will probably be hard and slip against the metal parts they rub against  a good cleaning may be able to get it going again
  this remove old grease relube plenty of sites discussing what lubrications work best
a little off topic but i have an old record player and some records that i dont give a fuck about i was thinking of replacing the drive system with a single stepper motor that is controllable with an arduino i would likely put a smaller motor on the arm at the same time so the arduino can lift and lower the needle    the goal is to automate it so that the arduino would play samples from the record in a preprogrammed pattern making it an autonomous robot band member possibly in an entirely robotic band im thinking stepper motor because im likely going to want microsamples and glitch style music so i want pretty good resolution on the record    does anybody have advice on how to minimize the wonky kind of sound that im anticipating a stepper motor would have on the audio quality i would expect that the strong motion of a stepper moving to the next step is going to accelerate then deccelerate the record in a way that isnt going to be perfectly smooth so im wondering if there is a way to smooth that out while still keeping the precision that a stepper will offer if theres something that i can do then i would want to design it in early while im designing the pcb and gears and such    thank you in advance to all the people that are about to tell me what a shitty idea this is your feedback is extra appreciated
  play samples from the record in a preprogrammed pattern    you know theres software that can to this with mp3s you fucktard    why do you fucking morons have to use an arduino for everything when theres simpler less involved ways to do things you dont need a fucking meme computer to do anything you suggest shit
  interesting idea  microstepping a stepper driver like the a4988 will do 1/16 steps  if you use a stepper with 200 steps/rev18 it gives you 20016  3200 steps  circumperence of a 12 record is 12314 3768  3768/3200 steps  012 or about 30 micron for a step distance on the largest part   seems like that would be plenty good resolution 83 steps/inch  saw posts about another driver in the /3dpg/ general that would do 1/32 steps and was much quieter or you could gear it down for even higher resolutions  theres also currently an arduino general that might interest you
  theres software for that  i know    why use arduino at all for anything ever  because its easier to spend 3 and half an hour in front of a text file than to spend an unknown amount of time and money on a solution that ends up taking more parts and tuning just so i can sit in front of a text file for half an hour    i use arduinos for one off projects because my time is worth more than 3 an hour im sorry that you feel you have to design everything from the ground up but dont worry your time will be worth more than 3/hr someday    thanks again for the response
    being this butthurt because someone can do something simpler without a meme device
            thank you for the advice everyone i actually found out the problem a few minutes after i posted and thought i had deleted the thread guess it didnt go through     anyway i opened the back and undid the fasteners that held the turntable in place with the lightest brush of my arm the power cable to the turntable just fell off i was surprised by how easily that fell off and i pushed it back into the connector i plugged the stereo back in and started the turntable and it powered right up i assume all these years the cable was just barely connected and when we moved the stereo to my house the movement must have disconnected the cable just enough to no longer give power to the record player but stay in place  i took some twistties and fastened the power cable snug to its connection and overall the record player works great now    now that i know that the turntable works next step is to look into cleaning and oiling it up i suppose alternatively could i put a newer turntable in it that isnt a threat to my records for now i guess ill just play my duplicate records that im not too worried about     i was also debating doing more restorations to it as well like sanding it down and refinishing it and replacing the speaker fabric etc think i should do it or keep it original as possible ill post a pic of it in a minute
heres a shot from the front the speakers have this odd strawlike material woven into the fabric that covers the speakers over the years it getting all freyed and i was considering how to replace it
  wow are you like 12 complete with the you mad bro meme awesome    i am curious how you think you could possibly make it easier though you gonna design a pcb from scratch for a one time project go right ahead i spent years doing professional pcb design and i probably wouldnt be able to design a custom board to host a microprocessor in less than an hour not to mention whether you make or order the custom pcb its going to cost you more than 3     seriously explain to me how you would do this project simpler
   use arduino at all for anything ever  because its easier  if its so friggin easy why are you shitting up someone elses thread with questions about it  i put a period instead of a question mark because i dont want an answer
  like sanding it down and refinishing it  old english furniture polish no sanding    and replacing the speaker fabric  yeah it needs new fabric  try to find as close as possible a match to use for replacement
  i dont have any questions about how to use an arduino in this project my question was regarding dampening the wobble that will be produced by a stepper motor
  dampening the wobble that will be produced by a stepper motor  heavy platter
  cloth covers on speakers were common back in the day some places sell replacement material and it is normally pretty easy to replace yourself
  actually feed and wax is better         just get a can of semi gloss finish and apply with a small artists brush to the spots of missing finish knock it back level with 2000 grit sand paper follow up with feed and wax     a seller on ebay and i think hes on esty sells antique radio grill cloth he has several that are very close matches     regease the turntable and get it going order a new cartridge/needle
post what beer cider wine or mead bullshit youre fermenting
ive got 2 gals of mead im gonns bottle tomorrow but im fucking exhausted after bottling 6 gals of cider i siphoned off two to make applejack with and ended up with about 40 bottles is there some secret to using a handcapper that i dont know every time i need to cap a batch its a fucking wrestling match to get the thing to stay on straight i dont really have the space or desire for a kegging setup so this is how im going to deal with any homebrews for a while and im really fucking sick of it i might shell out for a bench capper but id rather not
  i use the emily handcapper
there is no secret but just spring for the big swing tops and be done with it capping is for peasants  
  im switching over to these
  how much is that setup
  the entire set up with the posts faucet co2 cartridge etc is about 151 i just use the 30 2l minikeg and prime it with sugar planing on using the whole setup with the 10l minikegs
      i like the weld on these better than the man can minikegs
  in the process of making freeze distilled blackberry brandy rn
brewed this neipa over the weekend hopefully it will be one of my last extract batches as i want to get into all grain    are the only items i need to get started on biab allgrain brewing a larger kettle a bag and propane setup  will be brewing 5 gallon batches most of the time and occasionally 10 gallons will a 15 gallon kettle be good or should i go up to 20gal  is whirl pooling necessary for biab
  you should get a wort chiller too if you dont have one unless you wanna do nochill method 15 gallon will be good enough i think keep some fermcap on hand to stop boilovers whirlpooling doesnt have anything to do with biab
  i have a 25ft wort chiller that works great for my 5 gallon batches im only going to brew 10 gallon batches a 23 times a year so i probably wont upgrade that will look into fermcap out of curiosity does biab beer taste any different than the traditional allgrain brewing
  it shouldnt but ive never done traditional allgrain
everything at northern brewer is 20 off
  nice might pick up a propane burner since one of the kettles ive been eyeing is excluded
  too bad all their shit is already marked up a stupid amount
i just kegged a spiced acorn squash ale that i had sitting in primary for 3 weeks when i brewed it i made the decision to not move it to secondary fermentation because i heard that the chances of off flavors were minimal when compared to the chances of contamination ive also heard that people only use secondary fermentation when clearing a batch    i used a whirlfoc tab during the boil and while the beer tastes good it looks like muddy water is there any way i can make my beer clear without having to move it to secondary
  get it cold and use gelatin to clear it
  have you brewed that beer before is it not supposed to look like toilet water after taco night i only ask because i brewed a spiced pumpkin ale a few years ago and it looked muddy even after i put it in secondary    i have never used gelatin before but cold crashing does a pretty good job of clearing up your beer if you dont know what that is you basically get your carboy as close to freezing temp as you can and all the solids in your beer sink to the bottom when you transfer to your keg you get a lot less yeast/trub/hops getting in and clearer beer     last you can try something like pic related  clear beer draught system my beer usually comes out pretty clear but i get really bad stomach aches from all the yeast so i picked up two of these its 41 and it replaces the standard tube it floats and draws beer from the top of the keg where it is clearer because all the gunk sinks to the bottom of your cold keg another benefit is that beer carbonates from the top down so you can drink a beer sooner than you would the traditional way i received them like a week ago and wont have a batch ready for another month or two so i cant say whether or not i wasted my money just yet
  this i stopped buying there after i saw how much the price of their kits would go up whenever there was a buy 2 get 1 free sale
  i remember you from that one thread
  nice krausen butwork on some proper sanitation by not keeping your eating bowls next to your fermentor
  lol i got some beano and that works with the pain when i remember to take it still have sewer gas braaps though
halfway through the boil for my honey and cinnamon saison braggot seems to be going well so far    i was going to add the main bulk of my honey and cinnamon after seven days fermentation to retain most of the flavour is that the right way to go also it is possible to use cinnamon powder either putting it in directly or maybe making some sort of tea with it or do i have to buy cinnamon sticks
  thats just the ghosts of the yeast
  add it at flameout for it to be on the background if you add it during secondary it will strongly taste of raw honey a lot of people consider this a defect but if thats what you want then go for it    i usually add a cinnamon tea just prior to bottling with the priming sugar cinnamon is tricky though since it will be too hot for the first few weeks
  also by tea i mean boiling two cinnamon sticks for half an hour
  i do want the taste to come through properly but at the same time i dont want it to be overpowering id heard that if you add it all at flameout you can lose a lot of that flavour during fermentation im doing a 21l batch and ive got 5x450g jars of honey for the recipe i was thinking of adding 1 at 15 minutes 1 at flameout and then the other 3 after primary    what do you think
  id swap it to 2 at flameout also whats the og i made the mistake of adding 3 lbs to an english summer ale during secondary and it was too overwhelming also i think it stressed the yeast too much
  target og is 1052  ill find out what it actually is in about 20 minutes
just tried taking the og reading but my hydrometer sunk straight to the bottom albeit a bit slowly what does this mean for my beer have i messed up
  you may have not added enough of a sample to the tube it needs to be like 90 full
  it means you need a refractometer
  what does this mean for my beer  unless you used oil to make your beer instead of water your hydrometer is busted
  what temp is your wort did it just come off the boil hydrometers are calibrated to water at a specific temperature and any other liquid would need to be at the same temperature to be accurate
made some finish poverty wine last year how can i improve this to make it marginally less gross
  what exactly is in it and what do you find gross about it
  probably sugar wine
    yeah it was sugar wine i followed some killjou recipe somebody posted on /ck/  its was very sugary and gave me a stomach ache like i just ate a whole loaf a bread it was really weak too could i use less sugar and something like orange slices
  recipe somebody posted on /ck/  dont listen to those dumbshits
  both sugary and really weak  i only see this happening if you somehow managed to prematurely kill the fermentation  if not it should have the max abv yeast can handle which should be 10 at the very least even bakers yeast goes to 15ish  can you post the recipe also a balloon isnt necessary just screw the cap tight enough theres still some pressure buildup while still allowing some gas to escape you can hear this
  if it was literally just sugar and water the yeast probably died out with no other nutrients in the mix
  the wiki page states you can make kilju with just these three ingredients
  try small amounts of yeast nutrient diammonium phosphate to keep the yeast active
  yes but depending on specific concentrations you might not have enough yeast to eat all your sugar and not enough nutrients to get enough proliferation of yeast to make up for it toss in some raisins also use gelatin finings and try to cold crash if it tastes yeasty
i want to try a saison and this recipe called for 6 lbs of sorghum ok no problem plus 4 pounds of other sugars is it supposed to be this heavy
  some saisons are heavy some are lighter but really only up to 7 according to the bjcp style guideline     on the other hand i see some people making a beer at 49 and calling it an ipa which should be minimum 6 according to bjcp    to me a successful saison is one that has a final gravity of less than 1000 that has more to do with how much the yeast will attenuate though and not necessarily how much alcohol is in the final product     i say dont be afraid to tweak the recipe if you want to the art of making beer is indeed an art and not a programmatic routine of following exact recipies if youre using saison yeast its still going to be a saison just make a good beer
  btw i should mention that if you follow that recipie to a tee you will likely end up with a beer in the 7585 range so it is a little high but not astronomically so
  looks like a recipe for your typical german bock beer in the 79 abv region
  definitely going to make it lighter to compliment the ginger and orange peel recipe also called for 10 week bottle conditioning and im pretty pumped how it could turn out thanks buddy
this is some belgian golden strong ale   gonna bottle it tomorrow
  ive got some in a 3 gal keg as well and about another 3 gal in another carboy  all the same beer   im gonna try and get another 5 gal brew going this week just to have some variety  maybe something lighter cause this shit is strong as hell   its gonna be a good winter
does anyone have any experience with clawhammers home brewing system pic related  despite working for pretty well known craft breweries the past several years ive never actually made my own beer if knowledge/resources/supplies wasnt a concern is 1100 way too much to spend on a homebrew kit are there any better alternatives
  ive never used it but i watch their youtube videos frequently and they make it seem like an easy system to use imo 1100 is too much for a beginner kit but if money is not an obstacle for you then go for it
  its a solid system for electronic brewing ss brewing also has their own brewing system alternatively you could just brew in a bag with brewbag 15 gal megapot and hop spider
hey guys idiot here would i be able to buy the 50lb sack of malted barley from the brew store and scorch it in the oven myself to attain different flavor profiles the 50lb sack is like 50 and the darker malts are all around 3/lb
i brewed my first batch of beer on the 2nd for the first 2 days the airlock bubbled vigorously like 5 times per second on the third day however it went back to about one every five seconds on average and irregular has my fermentation oofed itself could co2 just be seeping out the bucket rim
  no its probably just slowing down generally fermentation will be very vigorous to start before reaching an equilibrium and eventually attenuating as long as its bubbling its fermenting
  thats normal and can vary depending on the yeast strain when i use white labs wlp090 san diego strain fermentation is pretty much done in 3 days  day one bubbling like crazy and requires blow off tube  day two bubbles every 510 seconds  day three krausen receding and bubbles a few times per minute  the london fog yeast im using now has been a lot slower in fermenting and is still somewhat active after about a week
  im not sure how this yeast strain is supposed to behave its safale us05 ale yeast the recipe didnt include a target gravity but it seemed a little low for an ipa 1041 so this is all just augmenting my fears
  1041 is pretty low for an ipa and i switched to liquid yeast a long time ago i think us05 has like 500 billion cells which is more than you would need and explain the fast fermentation  did you brew extract if so do you remember how much went in might be able to figure out a ball park estimate of what your recipes starting gravity should have been if it was different
  i had i believe 6 lbs lme and 1 lb dme there was a fair amount of boil over because my stove was finnicky but idk that that would have significantly reduced the amount of wort the only other thing i could think of is that maybe there was some lme in the bottle when i threw it out is it too late to add sugar or some more dme if i did i would probably give it some extra time to clarify
  i can never manage too get all the extract out of the bottles either ive brewed a smash ale that had 6 lbs of lme no dme and it was around the same gravity as yours the fact that you had some wort loss could account for the loss in gravity from the additional 1lb lme but i wouldnt worry too much you seem to be in the ballpark i would let it run its course
  ok i will since fortifying it will fuck with all the gravity readings anyway i appreciate all the advice cheers
okay guys i have about 4 batches of beer under my belt i want to move from extract brewing to all grain what additional equipment would i need to do this i know id need a mash tun but would there be anything else
  just a bag really if youre gonna keep using your starter pot you can do 3 gallon batches with some fermcap otherwise wait for an 810 gallon pot with ports welded in to go on sale i got one for 25
  they use giant coffee roasters so you wouldnt be able to replicate the profile
thinking about brewing my first braggot   am i going to do okay with just plain pilsner malt and honey at flameout will be choosing neutral hops like hersbrucker or magnum for balance while trying to maximise honey aroma  will be fermenting it dry up to 10 abv
thoughts on mushroom wine button mushrooms are about 2 sugar by weight but should be enough for fermentation to occur yes
  completely new to this but interested in starting is there any links/books/videos i can use to get started
one gallon grocery store pasteurized cider  bayanus yeast  two weeks fermented two weeks racked  is this okay for babbys first
  theres a bunch of videos on youtube extract beer brewing is usually what beginners start off on but if you want you can start allgrain biab brew in a bag as it has simplified the process   extract    biab  
  thanks ill check these out
  feeding fungus to your fungus  i feel like there should be something wrong with this but the principles sound if anything itd depend on what kind of sugar it is you might have to make more of a mushroom beer but im not up enough on my biology to be sure
55 gallons of cider this year in various stages of the process i may bottle some tonight to clear up a keg for bulk ageing im trying out a new yeast this year bm 4x4 because it supposedly adds to mouth feel
  1000 hours in google        he still added 15kg suger for 1kg mushrooms with 4l of water so i dont see how its really different from mushroom flavoured sugar wine when the sugars in mushrooms are negliable
day 5 of cider fermentation and it shows no sign of slowing down also no blow off    59f ambient and 64f in the fermenter this is going to be a good batch i can feel it before cold crashing can cider be hopped i have some kent goldings which could compliment a cider delicate floral aromas
  all by brews never do anything aaaaaaa am i just too impatient i can drink half a gallon or more of sugar wine and hardly even feel slightly fuzzy
  do you take gravity measurements
  on my beer thats currently going its going to be weak as heck im the same guy from earlier with the 141 ipa
first time making wine im doing 1 gallon from great value grape juice lol its been running for about three days now and is no longer frothing like crazy   as for degassing would it be okay to just shake it all out of the wine its only a one gallon jug so i can give it a shake and stuff bubbles out would this be a good way to avoid excess oxidation while also gassing off the wine
ciders done    looking to do something wacky was thinking an onion wine to use for cooking    anybody done this
so i want to make some hard cider i need preservative free apple juice right or the very cloudy cider ascorbic acid isnt a preservative is it i cant find any glass single gallons i do have a 5 gallon
  ascorbic acid isnt a preservative youre fine you dont really need glass for a fermentor so long as you rack it out of the gallon once its finished the 5 gallon will work fine though obviously larger volume and greater chance for oxidation if youre not filling it
  never even heard of onion wine but looked it up and seems interesting would make a good marinade too i bet might try this maybe with garlic or something too
  wild rice beer or sweet rice wine mirin
  molasses beer with spruce tips    spirit of 76
first timer here whats the difference between this apple cider and motts juice how does it affect the taste or abv of the hard cider do i need to add anything when i rack the second time
  im almost positive motts has preservatives in it but if not the biggest difference would be that i think most things sold as apple uice at least in america are filtered whereas cider is not and theres an amount of particulate and sediment they can have i dont believe that has any direct effect on brewing with it
  whats the difference  maybe a little difference in flavor and abv in my experience not as much as youd think   do i need to add anything when i rack the second time  you shouldnt need to rack a second time honestly i often dont even bother with a secondary most of the time i just leave it in primary for a month or two cold crash rack to keg or bottling bucket
  just ascorbic acid and apple juice      oh geez i hadnt even thought of bottling yet i may try not racking to a secondary if its unnecessary
i tried mead from picrel and its looking good but i accidentally killed my mead yeast and used dry instant its like 40 hours now and fermentation didnt really start and i think about buying a new pack of mead yeast but im not sure if 2 diffrent types of yeast will couse problems  any help
  how did you kill your yeast
  too hot water  2 days and no bubbles and most of yeast is on the bottom should i try again with everything
  yeah if it never started up id say pitch some fresh yeast if its at pitching temp you dont necessarily need to activate the yeast either ive tossed in dry yeast and itll bubble after a day or so
  done but im also worried about the smell of orange but i will leave it alone and just wait to see how it will taste
i may have used to much yeast nutrient diammonium phosphate a phosphorus fertilizer in my hard cider after primary fermentation gravity checked out aroma was good color was a bit light but the taste was clearly dominated by the diammonium is there any way to recover this batch
ive been experimenting with kvass for the past month with mixed results trying to come up with a holiday taste for the festivities i used cinnamon sticks for my last brew but the results was way to bitter however it got better after adding more sugar after bottling and letting it rest for 2 more days any recipes you could share
  idk if i burned the toast or what but the one time i made this it tasted like cigarette ash
  its funny you say that because ive been getting that taste in other beers lately too like the sierra nevada coffee stout
  like ash maybe you didnt drain it well or didnt use enough sugar it could also be the quality of the bread i wouldnt blame it on the burned toast unless you actually reduced the bread to ash    for my next batch ill use half a loaf of rye bread and malted rye ill add piloncillo mexican version of molasses and use wyeast 1968 instead of baking yeast hope this will get me the taste im looking for
  i only added sugar prefermentation and used bakers yeast so it shouldnt have all fermented how much do you add post
  around 6 oz if needed also let it rest a few days longer after bottling to improve the flavor   my first batch didnt taste all that good after the second day of fermentation sweetsour taste but after 2 additional days the taste improved less sour and closer to bread still too sweet for my taste
  have you ever had ochakovskiy if i could get close to that somehow maybe a little more dry/crisp that would be fantastic
  yes only once theres no commercial kvass available in my hometown but when i lived in oregon a friend brought a can of ochakovskiy first time i ever had kvass but i was already interested in brewing my own before tasting it
in a couple days i need to dryhop my beer with pellets do i just let them dissolve or is stirring necessary will there be much sediment 2 weeks in
  just dump em in and close it back up
  solid copy thanks
  started my first cider today used pasteurized apple cider from the grocery store 3 cinnamon sticks and ec1118    when i was activating the yeast i accidentally brought it up to about 150f when i got the c and f mixed up on the scale took it off heat as soon as i noticed and pitched it once it cooled to a bit warmer than room temperature    its been 3 hours and it seems to have started bubbling through the airlock about once per 10 minutes so i think im ok but is there a danger to having maybe killed most of the yeast here    please review
  takes longer than 3 hours to get going fully
  its bad practice especially when you move on to expensive musts even though the yeast survived the heat theyre severely weakened and lower in number so you might end up with petite mutants    also wine nutrient is almost always necessary unless you like the smell and taste of sulphur
  you buy a muslin bag and add a sanitized marble along with the hops best long tern solution is an infuser like this you can reuse it and its easier to sanitize
  i am using pellets though not actual fresh hops
just got the new brewery up and running
  those kegs look really uncomfortable
  no difference
  theyre actually pretty good the cushions on them are thick so its great for sitting
  wont your thigh just rest on the rim though
    one day in now zero bubbling activity and lots of sediment at the bottom im going to pitch another ec1118 and actually read the right side of the thermometer this time
  update the new yeast seems to have taken and theres a bubble every couple minutes should be going full speed by the morning     is oxygenation important for cider i remember shaking the living fuck out of my first mead before pitching the yeast but i didnt do that with my cider
  oxygenation and nutrients are important for yeast in general yeast gotta live man
if a carbonated beverage came in a certain twistoff bottle then that same bottle could be used for carbonating homebrew right specifically 11oz glass perrier bottles
  yeah but theres a chance it could explode not sure how much pressure perrier bottles are rated for
  i use this to aerate and degas my beer and wines  creates a hell of a vortex and you dont have to worry about refilling an oxy tank or fidgetting around with a drill
  i did a google search and perrier is carbonated to 18 psi at 35 f the chart puts perrier at 33 volumes of co2 i think your standard brown beer bottle can do 35 volumes so its safe to say that perrier bottles can be used as a substitute   most beers at 35f are around 89 psi 24 volumes with that being said if you use perrier bottles you should store them away from light as they are not as good as preserving as brown bottles
  acetone
  ok thanks you my man on another note will dextrose and granulated white sugar produce the same priming effect by weight
  if using table sugar you would use less heres a priming sugar calculator you an change to metric if not in us      for example if you are brewing a 5 gallon batch ale want 24 volumes of co2 and are carbonating at 68f you would need either  table sugar 41oz  dextrose 45 oz  dme 6 oz
my first mead attempt on the left with elderflower using k1v1116 its at around 14 now and tastes quite nice already without aging but i think i syphoned it off too early so its been stuck at a gravity of 1010 for a few months now not really sure how to proceed right is a caramelized honey mead bochet using the same yeast
  what volume is that
  they look like gallon jugs ive got a similar looking pair of killer bee honey one cooked and one not i was gonna rack them today but i dropped my hydrometer and it broke ashamed i couldnt even keep the thing in one piece for a year
  they are indeed gallon jugs    i feel like im about to break my hydrometer every time i use it they do feel pretty fragile
  every time i spray mine with starsan i give it a shake just to get any excess liquid off and i feel like if i whip it too hard the stem is going to snap in my hand ironically i just butterfingersd the one i had and dropped it no liquid or active shaking involved
im a mead newfag here  a couple months ago i bottled my second overall batch first large batch 3 gal first was just a half gal to test and ive got a couple questions    1 at the bottom of all my bottles theres a lightcolored sediment how does one get rid of this stuff just rebottling would stir it up and take a bunch with it and having to pour through a paper towel once i get to the bottom ounce of every bottle is getting annoying  2 it seems like my stabilizers didnt work its only gotten stronger and dryer wangier as my dad puts it the longer its been since i bottled it i used the exact amounts specified on the stabilizer bottles and the scaleddown measurements worked perfectly for the half gallon test batch  sorry if these are stupid questions like i said i am big dumb newfag
  lightcolored sediment  this is kind of a side effect of home brewing the only way to get rid of all the sediment is to filter it a lot or leave a good chunk of your fluid in the fermenter with the lees  my stabilizers didnt work  wine stabilizer generally refers to potassium sorbate which is a compound that prevents yeast from reproducing any yeast in the wine will continue to go until it dies unless you used campden tablets along with the stabilizers which actually kill the yeast moreover the recommended measurements on wine stabilizers are for a completed fermentation its possible if you had too much yeast in your mead there mightve been enough yeast that there was still active yeast even after all the sorbate was bound    unless you did use campden and youre 100 sure the fermentation was done in which case i dont fucking know age it longer and see if that fixes anything
im looking at brewing software can anyone recommend something that is preferably free  anyone used beersmith or brewers friend are they worth the cost
  free software  cant go wrong with open source  
  brewtarget is kinda like beersmith but open source  beersmith has a 15 or 30 day free trial im not paying for it out of the principle of the jewy subscription model
  first time i see finnish jenkem
anyone ever late hopped here any tips or good articles on it  gunna be using simcoe denali  azzacca
  just toss em in
  so i want to make some hard cider i need preservative free apple juice right or the very cloudy cider    im currently making a dirty turbocider and the walmart 1 1l apple juice is fermentating just fibr
  late hop as in dry hop you can put them in a weighted sanatized bag to avoid transfer issues or if youre using less than an ounce per gallon id just dump them in and dont worry about it     i typically dry hop at 58f for 3 days then cold crash to 32f for 3 more before transferring off finings make transferring/packaging heavily dry hopped beer easier
    sorry i should have been more specific i was wanting to up my flavour while not increasing bitterness and was told to cut back on my bitterness so was wanting to try using little to no bittering hops and adding a hell of alot more at flavour/aroma flame out and whirlpool just unsure if i shouldtotally cut them out or use alot less you know make a beer for those who dont want to be kicked in the face with bitterness but still get them lovely us hop flavours im just nervous as i dont want to screw is up 12us gallon of bad tasting beer never makes for a pleasant time i was hoping to use denali and azzacca but also have some simcoe and centennial on hand also up my flaked oats and flaked wheat for a bit more body and mouthfeel
    im kinda in the same boat i pretty much always add hops right at flame out but i have recently heard that for neipas you want to add them around 180 degrees f for 20 minutes or so then cool down to fermentation temps  wont this create dms though
  it seems that way more so if you take this article as gospel  
stealth bump
i ran out of bottles while i was filling my friend said he could get me some more so i havent bothered to get them myself but he keeps forgetting and it looks like ill only be able to fill these last ones a week after i originally added the priming solution is there any problem in leaving it in the fermenter for a week too long
  increased risk of infection or oxidation but you may as well bottle the last of it anyway also you will probably need to add more priming solution to carbonate the remaining beer
  any idea how much extra and im sure theres a simple answer but im too retarded to know it so why would it carbonate in bottles but not in the fermenter
  why would it carbonate in bottles but not in the fermenter  too much head space in the fermenter would prevent the amount of co2 you want from staying in the beer and the airlock would release co2 over time  any idea how much extra  estimate the amount of beer left in the fermenter and use this calculator to determine the amount of sugar you need one gallon of beer is roughly 10 12oz bottles so for example if you already bottled 30 beers you can make a safe bet that you have about 2 gallons left etc     
  so with the amount that is remaining id basically do the whole priming solution from scratch will what ive already added alter the taste in any way or is it redundant
  do not add the same amount that you added the first time youll get bottle bombs
    so how much should i add then i know that i have 8 litres left started with 21 litres to which i added a solution which had 110g of table sugar
  now that i think about it you might want to add less sugar than what the calculator recommends since it normally takes 23 weeks to bottle condition and your remaining beer will be sitting around for only a week some sugar from the first round will still be there    for 8 litres the calculator recommends 40 grams of dextrose again you might want to cut this by half to account for sugar left from the first round     regarding taste i dont know for sure as this hasnt happened to me but i think any taste difference would be negligible your twice primed beers may be a bit drier and have slightly higher abv you can always do a taste test between the two and see if there is a significant difference
  slightly higher abv    well i dont mind that nothing wrong with a strong beer thanks
  dude just go play with lincoln logs if you cant read
is applejack gonna kill me if i drink half a litre of it
  yes
  is that fancy chart any right at all adding malt at boiling temperature surely would ruin the enzymes you want to split the starch into sugars would it not
   be alcoholic   brewed beer a few times   decide to quit the liquid jew   get into soda   try to make homemade ginger ale   suger ginger yeast inna 2l bottle   shakewebm   vent erry day so she wont splode   last one was kind of flat   lets let this one sit overnight   kids have sleepover livingroom full of teenagers   3am boom   soda seeping from cabinet   mfw my son cleaned it up
  that infograph is for malt extract brewing the starch has already been converted to sugars and is in the form of syrup   depending on recipe the specialty grains are added at lower temps that you would typically use for an all grain mash 140170f
  no unless youre a woman or a 10 year old
  yeah its a waste of energy to boil the mash water then cool it i just picked a random infographic to start the thread
got a sloe berry mash with sugar head fermenting since 2310 in the left tank berries are wild and handpicked quinces/pears/apples mash with sugarhead in the middle tank also fermenting since 2310 and a all grain sour mash bourbon mash in the left tank
accidentally pitched the yeast  150 f first time brewing in a while  misread the instructions did i kill them can i repitch or do i start over
  o jebus  yeah if you dont see any activity 12 hours in repitch
  should i strain and reaerate i skipped it before because i didnt want to strain the yeast out i pitched while it was cooling down    never whistle while you piss
  nah aeration is bullshit but if you pitched above 150 all you did was kill your yeast you can repitch with another pack and itll probably turn out fine
ive made a barleywine that has been in secondary for two months and im hoping to bottle in the next few months but i think the yeast has hit its alcohol tolerance so im now terrified to bottle im afraid of making bottle bombs or getting no carb because the yeast cant take on any more sugar
  i also need some info on what to do in this situation
  i would just prime it normally and not worry about it high alcohol wont make bottle bombs that comes from too much sugar at bottling  if you want you can pitch more yeast when you bottle but i doubt its worth the trouble
  if the yeast are alive but are starving then bottling should be just fine but if they ate themselves to death and you would need to add stronger yeast for additional fermentation then youre in trouble
  what is in it that makes it that color
the yeast is dead repitch what youre going to get is a wild ferment otherwise
  fermentation finished and i poured it to new container  everything smells like rotten orange  what i did wrong should i wait more or throw everything
bought a new house and movers damaged some of the stair case ledge they are really squeaky and about to fall out     what do you reccomend /diy/
    pop out the nails they used in the sides put in new ones use adhesive if you want
why is this a question is this your first house    youre in for a good time fren
  did you even get a stairfax report before you bought this place  whens the last time the stair step fluid was changed  have you replaced the hand rail fuses yet  basic stuff op
going to find another place myself even if it means having to learn a new language
its literally nothing you know that right
  while op is undoubtedly a drama queen it is still a split a separation of light from darkness good from evil and insert your own /mlp/ joke here  a wise oriental might instinctively know these things originally came together for a reason you cannot yin without the yang and all that shit unfortunately we dont have a wise oriental we got a greedy bastard one instead   itll just turn into /reddit30/ and /thebitsaboutobedeleted/  but the writings been on the wall since the moot fucked off and tbqh surprised it took hiro this long to come up with a plan that will destroy the site altogether probably
ill be wherever you go op
  no mutherfuckets he is right
  it took hiro this long to come up with a plan that will destroy the site altogether probably    my understanding is that the clean site will attract more ad revenue whats wrong with that ive always wondered why /ck/ couldnt attract food ads or /o/ attract automotive ads and i suppose either 4chan does not know how to sell ads or 4chan has such a bad reputation it was impossible if this new scheme works i dont see the problem as long as they keep the kiddie playgrounds like /pol/ alive
  youre undoubtedly a drama queen its literally just hosting the sfw boards somewhere else so he can try to get ad revenue which may or may not work you know how many 4chan is totally dying this time things ive been through how many have you been through
  as long as they keep the kiddie playgrounds like /pol/ alive  those boards that dont attract advertising revenue ymean well gee i wonder exactly how long hiro will keep them running for given they 95 of the stress and maybe 5 of the income but they are also 100 the reason most of us are here in the first place like i say if i want fucking /reddit/ then i know where to go already you cannot run 4chan on the basis of what advertisers find acceptable  that is the true path to hell imo
  good lord go look up what a blacklist is
  these things originally came together for a reason  the boards are natural consequences of one another as topics were discussed boards were created to host them    nobodys going to go to hiroyukis second nukes ground zero hardly anyone visited his scraped 2channel its sad that the experience hurt him so deeply hes doing the same thing again even though we on this site have already had this same stunt tried once before
  4chan is totally dying this time  every single update its  fuck this 4chan is dead im going to xchan
  actually wanting ads  not realizing that legitimate advertisers will want strict thought policing and moderation so as not to associate their brand with undesirables      weve never had the site literally split in two before though        tfw finally getting off mr bones wild ride
  fuck this 4chan is dead im going to xchan  this time the deadchan came to us    ill tell you why it is different this time yeah it is a conspiracy theory but here ya go 4chan had corporate sponsors for years you just werent aware of them if you wanna know when it started  look to when 4chan stopped jumping hosting services and stopped getting kicked off for cp and shit like that    it was also notable that during these years you could not purchase advertising or donate to 4chan do you realize how bizarre that is a chan that didnt need money didnt need donations refused in fact to take them    i know because i tried to do both multiple times for years in fact no advertising inquiry was ever returned whether it was via email post or irc i worked for a media company and was always interested in advertising on /b/ and other boards    i have a few guesses at to why im probably wrong but the fact remains that 4chan had protection from things that would normally swamp anyone else  cp gore school shootings being announced murders being shown blatant racism violence against women etc      this arrangement ended around when moot got his funding for canvas and a different noncorporate agreement was reached with leas moot leaving was the end of that arrangement mook has been left to deal with what was left i dont know any of the details of that transition or any real idea of what is happening now i suspect the site was handed / sold off to a corporate group that chose mook as their public face expect the nsfw boards to be spun off where they have enough inertia to keep going for a while i dont think the sfw boards will bring in the kind of ad bucks they want but who knows    i dont think /pol/ will be able to stay afloat and i think /b/ will be one mass shooting away from getting shutting down    but who knows
    /diygenerals
  ads good  implying he wont further bend to the will of advertisers  implying this wont become more heavily regulated and moderated so its ad friendly    you should realize why thats a terrible ideas in these modern times
  i never had any doubt 4chan was funded by three letter agencies to catch cp/crime sprees thats why we got the this is illegal call the fucking police report option    jlist was not actually paying the bills for all those years    i think pol will stick around with donations until they try to milk them too much and kill the goose then they will go to mind dot com or some other encrypted block chain service which is why the agencies should keep funding the pit
    glad that im not the only one who figured out that jlist ads werent paying for this fucking site for a decade     was funded by three letter agencies  im pretty sure it was corporate backed for research into a few areas including stuff like alias and other research i think the lea aspect was secondary         it was a perfect testing ground for stuff like this a group of pseudo anonymous posters  who thought they were anonymous   so you had enough background info on people like ip addresses sometimes tripcodes etc  and a tremendous amount of traffic to sift through ideally alias would/should have been able to pick out individual users after a period of time it was an awesome proof of concept i mean they could have just used some forums  and probably did  but 4chan would have been ideal    i wish i knew more background  like i have no idea what moots parents do or who they socialize with but i always felt that it came out of a few guys sitting around having drinks and someone being like well you know my kid is on these forums all the time  why dont we use one of those
  i wondered how 4chan survived these many years  /b/ is one mass shooting away from getting shut down  why would the government ignore something as powerful as 4chan
  it literally is something no matter how irrelevant you may think it is
  is anyone still on pol im convinced its 50 of bots and paid shills

4channelorg  this be the future you chose
  actually i just found the answer to this dilemma so mook wants to split red and blue for ad revenue theres really no reason you cant have a red version of /lit/ /sci/ and /diy/ 4channel for tykes 4chan for adults and you guys can finally do what youve been wanting to do for ages now post tits in /diy/
  you think lgbt will still masquerade as a blue board  
  was curious no not like that ta myself  if its on 4channelorg tho its declared safezone idk wouldnt be the first board id miss either desu but glad its there as /pol/ /r9k/ /mlp/ and the fucking rest should also be they all be our brothers in need forgotten who is abandoning who here now
  yeah i just dont see how you can have a degeneracy group for a protected minority and not have degeneracy in it because all they will do is scream discrimination if you try to make them all disney and family friendly etc
  fuck off with your spam kid you are that fucker that kept spamming the boards with this shit trying to drum up people for your shit alt chan seems you got banned enough that you realized you cant outright post links since it is advertising/begging
      it is literally a board dedicated to gender dysphoria and degenerate sexual orientation it shouldnt have blue board status
  that would be fun i think it was april fools where we had /out/ x /soc/ and i was able to post so many naked broads fishin
  blockers    oh moot is doing the split hoping to make revenue with ads
  moot    who
  the eightboard that 4chan forbids from even mentioning by name has all the boards 4chan has including diy
  sure but its also full of the sort of faggots who were such faggots they were too much of a faggot for 4chins
  every board 4chan has  plus a few extra  but we dont talk about those  fuck that for a figure of something at least here is black van man approved
  including diy  that /diy/ is deader than dead though
  thatd actually be perfect since we could just move right in but i dont really like that site
  webms have sound over there    fuck it im done
  moving pictures  noises  another damn millennial web20 fad anon  you leave if you like  just leave me here with my memories

  fuckoff grandpa with your sounless infierior shit    go save some high def shit as a jog and kys
  burn it to the ground
  literally no one would go to 4channel then jannie loving tight asses have never produced anything of value blue board enforcement objectively made /co/ and /tg/ worse
  right so youve got two 4chins one where you are not allowed to post anything dodgy its modded tf and is full of shit advertisements advertising shit    the other version same boards and you can post what you like and theres no advertisers to slow it down/annoy/spam you because edgelords full of    you see the problem with this particular dilemma answerer yet the actual answer remainsthere isnt a fucking dilemma in the first place 4chan should not be run for the purpose of capitalist gain it was never set up nor previously ran with that purpose and attempting to shoehorn it into some sanitized shadow of itself because advertisers its fucking lazyarsed bollox an utter poverty of imagination
i dont see how this could be anything but positive by getting all the /pol/tards and the 13 year olds in search of hentai on /b/ the fuck away from the halfway decent boards like /diy/ its the ultimate containment board its a separate site altogether if it doesnt spawn some kind of childish animosity that makes 4chanorg raid 4channelorg it seems like a good solution to the occasional seepage
  4channel for tykes 4chan for adults and you guys can finally do what youve been wanting to do for ages now post tits in /diy/  youre missing the point entirely when it splits my bet is that 4channel will have an older demographic /b/ and /pol/ are almost certainly over 50 under 18 nobody who comes to 4chan for something other than porn or some autistic meme obsession is a kid
  it wont be containment the whole point of the move is increased revenue so moderation will ramp up everything fun about the site will be slowly sanitized either purposefully or through an influx of newfags and well end up as nothing more than an eccentric forum with anonymous posting if you wanted a more civil serious format you wouldnt be here in the first place i really hate that 4chan currently has the only viable bluecollar boards    if it doesnt spawn some kind of childish animosity that makes 4chanorg raid 4channelorg  i wonder if hiro is drawing out the domain move in order to mitigate this
  its literally nothing you know that right  this fuck i remember when we used to be 4channet
  now it makes sense as to why /sp/ was completely and utterly destroyed by moderation its been happening for a long time but gook taking over took it to a whole new level    its such a fucking shame
  will be slowly sanitized    its the boiling frog fable they have been doing it for years
  nobody who comes to 4chan for something other than porn or some autistic meme obsession is a kid    if i didnt come here for the autism id go to some grey beard site the on topic conversation is vastly better also boring as fuck    the only tangentially on topic shit makes for a better board hell an occasional ontopic porn thread would improve the board
  yeah but this time its for real
  i really hate that 4chan currently has the only viable bluecollar boards
  /diy/ is legit one of the best boards on the internet seriously a hidden gem and its a hidden gem because its hidden amongst a bunch of vitriole racism and shitposting     fuck you hiro seriously fuck you
learn spanish and come to hispachan
  tell me your secrets and i will leave in a heartbeat
so i have to buy 4channelvip gold pass now too
  so how many of you will migrate  i think everyone just migrated today
  1488 origami incoming  fuck you truly hiro you fucking fool
  my understanding is that the clean site will attract more ad revenue whats wrong with that  implying this will make any difference whatsoever  implying you can ever hide the sites origin  every blocklist and filter in the world will adapt to the new domain within the week assuming they havent done so already
we all can go to 8/diy/ that place is dead as fuck and im pretty sure no one uses it regularly
  there isnt even a fucking link to /pol/ from the blue boards and my pass doesnt work there    if gookmoot fucks up 4chan we need an alternative quick
  oh my god the travesty if i were you id wait you cant get to fucking /pol/ youre joking right trolling us all hard
  there isnt even a fucking link to /pol/ from the blue boards    wait you cant get to fucking /pol/  there isnt a link to it from here  checking board links at top and bottom of page nope no link for /pol/ /b/ /r/ /s/ or any of the not blue boards    youre still free to go there just not from a link here
    just because you dont like it doesnt mean it isnt part of the website    i should probably call you a bunch of names to solidify my point the cancer will only spread to blue boards
no more cringy /pol/yps and literal autistic /r9k/ incel subhumans  whats the issue
  the cancer will only spread to blue boards  it already has  youre here
  i have a few guesses at to why  they glow in the dark
  they glow in the dark  terry live on
if i wanted to post on reddit id already be there
  im gonna stay honestly a split will be great too many fucking /pol/tards ruining /k/ /fit/ /ck/ and /biz/
  i see 4chan is redirecting to 4 channel now fuck this shit
most of haters here are not /diy/ regulars
  /ck/    its hard to imagine /ck/ actually being about food and cooking from the perspective of someone older than 14
  actually it would be kind of nice to be separated from the absolute filth and degeneracy  but at the same time i dont like the rainbow sjw lgbt politically correct virtue signalling numale faggotry that is the core of the new machine
  no one will leave just a bunch of drama queens screaming about nothing another month or two and these threads will die off and things will be as they were before
   realizing that legitimate advertisers will want strict thought policing and moderation so as not to associate their brand with undesirables  not actually true
are you guys still here    if someone read this where did you go
in high school shop class  brainlet never does any work for himself  picking what we want to build  draw out build sheet for this cool simple bookshelf i saw on r/woodworking  pic related  simplified it because i dont know how to cut joints into wood and did not have the resources to warp plywood  brainlet is too lazy to find a project of his own even uses my build sheet  constantly asking me what to do  at first i genuinely help him  quickly realise he is a lost cause   design is so simple i could have done it in half the time if i didnt have to constantly teach the retard what he should have already learned  stop helping him all together as even with my help his project looks even shitier than mine  makes every woodworking mistake in the book not predrilling sanding against grain eyeballing measurements etc  one day he cuts himself with chisel  another day he drills into the work table  today he actually was pre drilling for once  only problem is he was using a screw driver bit  decide to not say anything to see how long until he realizes  30 minutes later he stops  takes out bit  puts same bit in other drill  brainlet thinks the battery has been low for 30 minutes  there is now a giant irreparable dent in his project  chad kid in class finally tells him hes using a screwdriver bit  waiting to see what dumb shit he does tomorrow
  wow thanks for the post op keep us updated on any developments  are we sharing stories  kid in my class hammered a chisel into a drill bit while the pillar drill was running to see what would happen  drill bit broke and hit a girl in the eye  ambulance to hospital lost sight in that eye  covered up by school as freak accident
  was she wearing safety glasses
  she was the other side of the room and no only eye protection was full face masks for using drill nothing required for bench work
be in shop class circa 2002  one anon we will call mvp  mvp uses table saw one day to rip plywood for a bookcase  notices he doesnt have it tight to fence  mvp decides to pick up the plywood and push it against fence  kickbackcockshotmp3   blade kicked it into his junk then the other end flew up and hit him in the face  mvp banned from table saw for 3 months and must retake all safety tests
  i was in high school technical theater for 4 years and we never had a single accident aside from the time i fell off a scaffold  we had literal 13 year olds making stage thrusts with bandsaws and we never had so much as a cut while i was around
why do companies do this i saw the milwaukee m12 fuel hackzall for pretty cheap here thinking to myself its a bargain at 120 about to click the order until i fucking find out the size of the fucking saw its almost as fucking big as 18v saws from the other companies and almost the size of its own 18v one hander what the unholy shit is this the previous saw with brushes was like 15cm shorter   in the end i had to give up on this crap because the thing is fucking huge thankfully milwaukee was nice enough to not post dimensions of the thing anywhere on the site and expecting me to buy a oversized tool that doesnt fit my uses   in the end had to settle for the bosch 12v saw which is much smaller but also weaker still has brushes but at least its not the fucking size of its 18v brother       tldr milwaukee upgraded its 12v recipo onehanded saw from 28cm to almost 40cm in length making them as big as the 18v line and didnt mention it anywhere fuck them    saw in question
  wrong image
i hear ya op  what we want is a body saw with a 3cell battery stuffed up its ass and what they keep giving us is a sawzall gearbox hotglued to a pistol drill
is this a solid hackzall my dads been wanting it for a long time i think the kit at my home depot has the smaller version for 159 bucks with batteries and shit
  the fuel has good power but its fucking big at that point i would just get a brushless 18v sawzall or the 18v32 from bosch are the best choices what i see and arent much bigger but have way more power
  why make 2 gearboxes when you can recycle the 18v one and jam a 12v motor in it
  because its still stupid and the 12v part has no market anymore just buy the 18v
american phillips screwdrivers suck dick    literally breaks the screw    fuck you
  ph is just shit in general wera has that lasertip thing that makes it less shit but its still shit  replacing everything in my house with torx
  what are you cutting milwaukee cant compete with dewalts reciprocating saw 4 blade positioning system it allows for perfect flush cuts and just does what milwaukee cant so mil wacky crapped out that pos to try and compete
  dewalt isnt usually a consideration here but it was mostly for wood and nonferous metal its cutting ability is less important than its versatility and ability to enter tight spaces which deterred me from the m12 fuel  from what i see of the dewalt range all their recipo saws are also huge
  the 12 is a toy the 18 can be replaced with a 20v dewalt   look at the ridgid fuego if you want it to work really good in a small spot
  the hackzalls are still smaller than anything dewalt puts out in 20v and have narrow blade boots to get into tight places you cant get with a full sized sawzall     the m12 fuel model was developed around the same time as the m18 model its a little chunky and probobly shares a lot of internal components but it really just comes down to which battery platform you are working with whats important is that they still keep the onehanded cutting form factor which you cant do nearly as easily with a conventional reciprocating saw and is still half the length of a fullsized model
where i live i use them to clear downfalls on trails
  the top pick is the before red line is the trail bottom pic after a 12 rough cut lumber blade
  they werent little twigs either
      how long did it take you to clear those limbs
  2 days cutting them was easy but dragging the logs out of the way was the tough part
  why in the fuck wouldnt you use a chainsaw
  weight the blockage was about 6 miles down a trail that is 1000 feet up i parked below mess at sea level and hiked/crawled up thats why we use the hackzall cause the fit in the bottom of a backpack i probably carry twice its weight in water
  i got this neat little tool called a stihl 044 you should pick one up and try it not terribly expensive runs on gas instead of constantly dead bateries can handle logs 10x the size of those twigs and would have that all cleaned up in under 2 hours
  m12 or m18 how many batteries did you need to bring the batteries probably weigh as much ss the damn chainsaw
  wait until the day you have to carry a fuck ton of tools and barely use any real amount of juice    like for me it doesnt take much to cut conduit and screw boxes to metal studs i can get by for 2 days with a 12v impact and bandsaw before i need to swap out batteries i dont want to carry the 18s all day the 12v impact literally gets stuffed in my bags so i never have to put it down
  m18 and one battery
  i think the whole point of the hackzall is easier one handed use good for plumbers and shit
  my gripe is that the m12 fuel is almost as big as the m18 fuel the brushed m12 was much smaller
  kaizen foam    wow what a faggot
  may i ask why one does that how do even know of downfalls 12miles away from a street
    i use one for work    they are great i cut up a 3 metre long hardwood electrical location cabinet with tin roof on two batteries
  how do even know of downfalls 12miles away from a street  mountain bikers last time i was there it was about 6 miles away but then its about a 15 to 18 minute a mile trail so i didnt want to waste time walking
  how many batteries do you carry cause i know using my saber saw to cut trees depletes 4amp batteries in like less than half an hour  youre not using the right tool  a sthl ms170 is light af
  a sthl ms170 is light af  
building a camper and im trying to run the cars electronics from a power outlet instead of the battery whenever its plugged in something like    plug in car  power gets routed from outlet  battery removed from circuit to prevent drain    i want to do this with minimal modification to the car which i am certain is achievable so far my assumptions are that the two leads on the car battery itself should be split into a switching circuit of sorts where if power is coming in from the outlet no power is drawn from the battery and vice versa    how can i do this without killing myself i feel as though this is a very commonly done thing but i cannot for the life of me form the proper words for google to bring useful results
  get a battery charger/tender you can either clamp it straight to the battery or install one of these deals and hardwire that to the battery and plug the charger/tender straight into that so you dont even have to pop the hood
  i dont want to put unnecessary strain on the battery if i have an electrical outlet available the goal is to switch power sources from battery to outlet automatically like when you plugin your laptop
  bwahahahahaahahha why 3 figures for a trickle charger that only works if you have a charge at all of a few hundred millis these things are only good if the battery doesnt get used for 6 months and its lead acid like on a motorcycle in the north    next up hurr durr go solar     or you can use a isolation switch and a 10amp 12vdc supply like normal people or 2 batteries and an isolation switch one for engine one for accessories this is a common scenario for this stuff op google n lurk while the posts come in smrt people would also meter their accessory draw one guy just uses large caps just for starting the engine and a lamp battery for the radio and trickle feed the caps skys the limit
  an isolation switch isnt what i was thinking and a second battery would drain just as fast as the first battery if i am running heater/ac at night
holy shit man do not touch anything electrical or related youre liable to start a fire and kill someone else provided you are old enough to drive a car but missed some technology in school lemme tell you this in order to have power available you need to learn about dc/ac inversion before you go plugging your gameboy into your cigarette lighter
  not sure if i get exactly what your trying to do here     you want be able to plug your camper into mains a supply and be able to charge or at least power your car from the mains supply in the camper id suggest a switchmode power supply inside the camper connected through the auxiliary pin in your trailer plug that is wired to the cars battery
  8/8 bait m8
  easy if you have things in the back that you want to power from mains or battery but i wouldnt power actual car things from mains if you can help it you need a relay the common goes to things you want powered the normally closed to car battery the normally open goes to the power supply input power the relay from the mains input and so when you plug in the mains the relay switches from battery power to mains power there will be a short power interruption as it switches use double pole switch neutral too also you need a 12v power transformer too because your car is 12v and the mains is much more than that
goddamnit here you go fuck this post the answer is here   
  ehh you can get a medium strength charger for 50100 but it didnt sound like op really wanted to do it the proper way with isolation and this and that    so i jumped in and told him how to half ass it
  a relay thats exactly what i was thinking of thanks man    im sort of concerned with tunneling all of the cars power through a relay though luckily my starter motor is wired separately to the car battery so that is isolated    will a standard 30a bosch 5pin relay be rated high enough to for the job
  yea tenders have fuck all for amps and require a voltage on the terminals it wont keep anything charged while loaded would of been funny if we could of watched
  mains is ac battery is dc    dis ginna be gud
  im the op from the camper van general thread    no one can answer your question without more information    most campers have the 30amp 120v plug that goes to a charger on the battery bank generally found near the front by the engine   this way the 12v appliances still work and then an inverter runs the outlets     some newer campers can switch the outlets to shore power so there isnt the power loss being inverted 2x    if you want your lights and radio to work while the car is off this is the best option    in my camper everything is 120v except the radio and cab light so i bought some dpdt middle position off switches that change the power source    flipped up the inside power comes from the electrical cord into the plug flipped down the power comes from the battery bank via an inverter    you should add a deep cycle auxiliary battery to the camper hooked to the cranking battery through the starter solenoid and have the charger hooked to the deep cycle battery    this way you dont ruin your car battery but dont have to do a bunch of specialty bullshit thatll cost double
  dude fuck off im well aware that i need an ac to dc converter that is the last concern i am having at the moment      i dont think you are qualified to answer my question at all if the information i have given so far is insufficient none of the information you have given me pertains to my question at all    i dont have a battery bank im not trying to run any 110v devices im just trying to plug my car in whenever i find an outlet and have all of the cars electronics run from the outlet instead of the starter battery
  maybe u should be concerned with your poor communication skills terrible concept of electricity but more importantly deciding on what it is you actually want
  maybe you shouldnt get so assblasted because your solution that had nothing to do with my issue was unhelpful
  hey asshat here is exactly what you want
  i hope you saved it
buy an rv converter it will turn ac into dc so you can run your car electronics and most have a built in charger so you can also charge your battery
  if i am running heater/ac at night  what kind of heater and ac in a car works without the engine running
  just use magic thats basically what you want right magic
  and have all of the cars electronics run from the outlet instead of the starter battery  grab a battery maintainer something like a 6amp onedome lights and radio dont use that much power and the maintainer can easily keep up with that draw
  heater and ac will work without the car on though not anywhere near as efficient the system is meant more to circulate air at night rather than actually doing the job of heating and cooling      the issue is not how to convert 110v to 12v the issue is how to take the external power source and have it replace the cars battery when it is connected the car battery should be completely removed from the circuit whenever the car is connected to an external power source the relay seems to be the best solution so far but i wager there are prebuilt solutions as well      that still has the car electronics drawing on the battery wearing it down overtime the car battery is critical to its operation better that unnecessary stress on it be avoided
  youre an idiot  heres what youre asking for now go away
    also enjoy your car fire
  heater and ac will work without the car on though not anywhere near as efficient the system is meant more to circulate air at night rather than actually doing the job of heating and cooling  excuse me you do know that both systems are run by the engine right the fan will turn on but wont do dick youre better off just putting a desk fan on the passenger seat and using a space heater for when its cold
  i didnt give you one i see reading comprehension is not your strong suit either
  op is retarded so he probably owns an old prius
  add together everything you want to run and size the relay based on that  use a fuse with lower rating than the relay to keep it safe  dc rating is higher than ac rating because of zero crossing so dont use a 30a ac relay if its 30a dc but the other way around is fine  if you are having trouble finding big relays find something you know is huge like a starter motor relay or look up industrial contactors is what they are called in power panels
what i have in my work truck itll power most tools  but i want to upgrade tonthe 3000
  this is perfect for op all he needs is the inverter and pic related plug the inverter into the cig lighter so its connected to the cars battery and 12v system and then plug the 120v extension cord into pic related and plug that into the inverter
  an inverter plugged in to the cigarette lighter can only handle about 150watts
dont forget to have good insulated gloves and heavy duty insulated alligator clips for when you steal electricity from a random light pole
hey /diy/    i suffered some minor flooding in my basement a while ago i went fucking nuclear on it using undiluted disinfectant to nuke the area noticed this on a recent inspection  is this mold or dried up cleaning material salts very powdery
do you have a microscope
  hard to tell if thats on wood or concrete if its on concrete its just mineral crap from the flood i have similar deposits from a flood in my own basement white crystal stuff that turns into powder if you touch it
  yes its wood on concrete
obviously mineral deposits you blind retards
salt damp
  taste test would be beneficial in this instance
thats salt which is formed when bleach evaporates
just to be sure id paint the wood with antifreeze ethylene glycol itll soak in and protect the wood old boat builders trick keep kids and pets away  yadda yadda yadda

can someone help me out in how to hack this account on instagram ziahariaho
dont know if this the right board to post this but it seems like the best fit  a few days ago i had the idea of creating an exoskeleton thats only powered by stored mechanical energy no thermodynamics no hydraulics no electricity so far i only looked into trying to develop a framework of a joint such as your elbow or knee ive come up with a very rough idea on how it should work but i encourage anyone to contribute a good reference could be power armor from fallout    the power source has to be something that can hold a lot of potential energy acting as a energy bank for multiple purposes the best thing ive researched so far is a large industrial clock spring/constant force spring that spring should drive a gear which can be directly connected to a joint axle or pull a wire/string/chain to another gear connecting to the joint axle    somewhere in between there could be some kind of mechanism that exerts force in both directions of the joint if thats too complicated then two clock springs in different directions works too    at the joint axle there will be a gear receiving energy from the spring that will rotate the axle in the appropriate direction maybe this part can be two ratchet gears in opposite directions so that one force doesnt conflict with the other somehow there needs to be a pawl that lifts to let one gear move while the other pawl is also blocking the other gear kinda like a seesaw effect i think this part can be triggered your arm since is more sensitive and uses little energy   now heres the part i get stuck on in order to have precision movement and allow the frame to exert appropriate force there must be a resistor that scales depending on how much force is on the trigger resting both pawls locked in gears small force lots of resistance large force little resistance i think its best if the resister is best if it doesnt use friction so theres less overall maintenance but idk how else to do it
wow someone call darpa hes broken the code
  maybe but im not sure a clock spring will hold enough energy to last longer than a battery
  now heres the part i get stuck on in order to have precision movement and allow the frame to exert appropriate force there must be a resistor that scales depending on how much force is on the trigger    magnets also i dont see why you need gears driven by a potential energy bank if both sides of the skeleton have equal tension on one another then it should just be like normal human motion just more torque youre not going to get both speed and torque out of a system like this although you could certainly build up momentum and run faster you will get more aid and torque though it would be look more like the fusion suit a hard exoskeleton with potential energy anchored to it
    also gonna add that ive had the exact same concept as you in the past most exoskeleton models ive looked at seem to show that springs and potential analog energy are probably better for the human body as it is directly driven by it some guy made a pair of exoskeleton boots and can run to like 40 mph on a garage spring granted gravity and his weight is doing most of the work but thats a better solution than big heavy batteries no using what is already there to its full potential the suit would be the battery if you take what strength the human has place the human a suit that would protect the skeleton and then simply put a 21 or whatever1 ratio of counterbalancing elastics then all it would take to drive the forces is just that guiding the force in whatever direction you move in the forces involved are counteracting each other so to speak imagine a hinge with a rubber band glued to each side each side wants to be pulled down but is counteracted by the other the result is that the hinge simply has more potential        use the force against itself
i havent even considered magnets for some reason i was thinking of this like da vinci style ill need some time to think on it as for the tension energy is only applied when you arm moves one direction or the other it acts as a trigger so when your arm moves the frame moves with the arm until pressure is released or at rest depending how much force is on the trigger resistance decreases which means more torque on the frame as pressure increases and visa versa speed isnt a factor in this case maybe for the legs but for the arm its more about strength i know its complicated to read this as a post but trust me if i knew how to do graphic design this would be some much easier to contemplate
  reply to 
  i understand how the human can be the battery but what youre suggesting is making the human body more efficient at some point it will reach near 100 efficiency then wheres the energy gonna come from that enhances performance beyond the human limit what im suggesting is an alternative to batteries so that is cheaper maybe slimmer and can be use in more personal activities
  i understand how the human can be the battery but what youre suggesting is making the human body more efficient    no the suit is the battery the human is the driver and yes to some extent youre correct in that it would make the human more efficient however im thinking more along the terms of a gear ratio set up a trade off of speed for power   lets say we have an elevator and this elevator only goes up and down when you pull a rope thats attached to a pulley above with enough pulleys you can lift you and the elevator and only feel 5 pounds of force yeah its going to take forever but youre still doing work you could have never done before just make a suit that can change gears all the human has to do is drive it and you dont even need an external power source the potential is already raised high so the release is high
  ok i get what youre saying however how you change the gears to adjust torque/speed in natural movement sure in moments where you have time to consider the ratio its fine but in a fast paced situation you wont have that time its a great idea im just trying to refine it     ill think on that and maybe when i get that figured out ill consider and external energy source
  bigass flywheel
  good luck turning against the axis its spinning around
  what would be a boon in some situations
inb4 op breaks all his limbs backwards from a simple miscalculation
  i would never want to wear a bigass flywheel spinning at thousands of rpms for several reasons one of them being that inertia is a bitch and youd have trouble actually moving around the other being that any mechanical failure is going to release all that energy either through friction heat or by fucking shredding itself and you
 op spends thousands of dollars and hours on building this   can do slightly heavier bicep curls for about 2 minutes   all you gotta do is wear a 40 kg backpack full of gears chains and giant springs constantly poised to snap your joints
  itself and you  dont forget anybody nearby too
  part of it is just better biomechanics for movement and a sturdy shooting platform look at high end artificial legs the design and materials they use and figure out how to strap it to your legs    once you have a 2x longer stride and can run and walk 3x as fast and far build a nonpowered chassis on that    build it so you can easily twist turn and reposition legs while keeping load on the hips then build torso on that    torso needs rail systems for body heat radiator multidirectional electromagnetic propulsion system energy storage computer and armor    put helmet on the torso in such a way that you maximise mobility with modular placement systems for o2 hud comms and such that it can support about 20 pounds of ballistic transparent aluminum    only after you have a functional nonpoweredmovement chassis should you contemplate powered movement

  you also need attachments for a pack to haul gear
      as long as there are restraints on the motion of the skeleton i dont see what problems will arise lets say you have a knee joint and you make the exoskeleton only able to be a certain amount of degreesthen it will only bend to whatever degree you set it at you put physical stoppers like steel with some rubber bumpers maybe so that the joint literally cannot bend past a certain angle if its stronger than the muscles then all that will happen is the muscles will break sure it may give you a good elastic whip and you may end up lopsided and stuck in a certain position but because the exoskeleton cannot bend more than its built to do you wont get injured the worst case scenario is that you just end up stuck or impeded    and this is the case with just about every exoskeleton that has been built so far there is always a fail safe or physical stoppers that prevent damage from happening if the metal body is built to only mimic a human range of motion then that is exactly what it should do a human cannot turn its head 300 degrees like an owl so neither should the exoskeleton
  2/2    in fact troy hurtubise solved this problem years ago with his grizzly suit design which completely negates the majority of blunt force trauma and it doesnt even have a hard exoskeleton granted his was meant for only blunt force trauma and not anchoring muscles to    
  like fucking which situations
    i would never want to wear a bigass flywheel spinning at thousands of rpms for several reasons one of them being that inertia is a bitch and youd have trouble actually moving around the other being that any mechanical failure is going to release all that energy either through friction heat or by fucking shredding itself and you  well what do you think a giant clock spring will do if it escapes its housing
  all real unpowered exoskeletons are made to do a specific movement ford uses them in automotive assembly it helps the wearer pick up a heavy item and hold it in position just that one movement to allay repetitive motion injuries theres no universal suit that can do many different motions    
  can only move forward and backward moderately stronger than the average human extremely heavy possibly incredibly dangerous to either side should the flywheel containment fail    op would be like a reallife juggernaut but shitty
  this but multiple make gyroscopic precession part of the motion design like on satellites lets you turn at assisted rates and probably can act to stabilize the suit like a segway if you do codejitsu to it  spinners encased in every hinge joint not one tron style disk on the back
  could you make something like this for farming workers
  everyone is still missing the reality that exoskeletons are made for one specific task the range of motion spring or pneumatic bias is balanced for a specific load   an exoskeleton can help a farm worker load pumpkins on a truck by helping lift 10 to 15 pounds isolating bending torque to back muscles a farm worker would need 70 or more exoskeletons to do all the different daily tasks and help putting them on and technical maintenance people to adjust them to fit fit of prosthetic equipment has to be exact in biomechanical range or it can severely injure the wearer by stressing joints and tendons  3 or 4 degrees off natural rotation over time can lead to crippling pain or joint failure   its not as easy as it looks even a simple 4 bar knee brace like a lenox derotational brace can exacerbate an existing injury if not fitted correctly
   powered by stored mechanical energy   electricity  fucking why it is going to be very very very hard to build an exoskeleton that uses fucking clockwork   lot of potential energy  then dont use springs as they have quite a horrid energy density    ge tried doing this in the 1960s with their hardiman exoskeleton it didnt work its going to be very hard to control torque purely using a mechanical system because you want variable amounts of torque youre probably going to need a cvt for every single joint yikes    no shit sherlock windup springs have an energy density of about 00003 mj/kg and lithium ion batteries have an energy density of 046072 mj/kg  
  main gear controlling the arm breaks  the arm starts spinning faster and faster grinding his shoulder joint into dust until the suit rips itself and him into pieces
guy with a masters degree in robotics here exosuits are cool but ultimately misguided aside from the energy storage issue the tech to issue commands to your suit so that it matches up with your own movements means it will be just as efficient to design a fully autonomous bipedal robot
  see      
  holy fucking shit that thing is awesome is the only reason it wasnt public because it failed
  it was public you probably havent heard about it because its old     commands to your suit so that it matches up with your own movements   the hal robotic suit uses electrodes to sense nerve activity alternatively you just need high enough torque control bandwidth   just as efficient to design a fully autonomous bipedal robot  im interested in your argument here aside from your issuing commands argument which i see as moot    gear ratio set up a trade off of speed for power  you cannot trade off speed for power with gears you want an amplifier not a gear    this is a completely fucking dumb idea youll never be able to compete with electronics for control while its dumb it would be fucking awesome to make a completely mechanical steampunk exoskeleton since were not trying to do better than exoskeletons already out there we got a lot more design freedom if we assume weve got a steam engine for a power source thats running all the time we can use torque amplifiers a torque amplifer is a mechanical device that takes in an input rotation and increases its torque this input rotation angle will be matched on the output just with more torque you do need to supply a continuous source of rotation to power the amplifier nothing comes for free after all       so we could make a rather simple exoskeleton by having the human step into a frame where each joint is connected to the input of a torque amplifier the outputs of each torque amplifier then drive another frame that matches the motions of the human    there are also mechanical equivalents of the transistor  
  you cannot trade off speed for power with gears    the fuck what do you think a transmission does a gearbox with a worm gear you can increase the load capacity with less space also self braking and only the driver controls the motion the worm gear  anyway the other info you provided is useful but i dont see how a torque amplifier performs differently than a gearbox you still have to trade power for speed or vice versa its why you can haul more in the slower 1st gear and haul less in the faster 4th gear you could try hauling starting in 4th but the force will destroy the gearing
  you dont understand what power and torque are rotational mechanical power is torque  speed a gearbox ideallythey dont but bear with me conserves power such that power in  power out torque1speed1torque2speed2 so we can increase speed by decreasing torque or vice versa a torque amplifer doesnt conserve power like a gearbox does we can have more power going out than goes into the input we increase torque without decreasing speed it doesnt violate conservation of energy because this additional power comes from a third input
  what do you think a transmission does  embarrassed yourself there mate power is torque x speed
  i understand the distinction completely i was questioning the statement you cannot trade off speed for power with gears i though you meant power as how much you can lift not power source  so no shit if you apply an external power to another thing powering something it will obviously have more power altogether this is almost a redundant statement my original proposition was a suit that would have gearing so that you would be able to lift more over time as opposed to just lifting more in general   give me a lever and a place to stand and i will move the earth    oh no you caught me misinterpreting a sentence what will i do now
  anon when i speak of power i mean energy/time this is how power is conventionally defined    more over time  unless you have some crazy ratchet mechanism where you swing your arms back and forth or pelvic thrust like crazy you wont be able to lift more load to the same height as you move your body   more power  its not easy to apply more power so a torque amplifier takes in a shaft rotation angle we want the shaft going out to have the same rotation angle but we want more torque applied to the shaft when it turns to this angle it is not possible to do this with just gears
  the jaws of life super hero suit shove both hands into the narrow crack bite the transmission ring with your teeth pull head back to put it in gear start pelvic thrusting     its all right i am here
  industrial type spring on the bicepeg a trucks suspension spring would probably work just stress it down with a crank system have a bar at the end with serrations on one side to drive a gear attached to another bar supporting the forearm button near the palm for a multiple stage release system should be relatively safe as long as its built rigidly enough to only move on one plane not exactly a full exoskeleton but itll allow you to lift things way easier and its purely mechanical
   a giant pelvic claw would be much better
  i could see it working for carrying things all day or something but as for assisted movement youre going to be getting less out of it than you put in unless you plug it in once in a while maybe if solar gets better and motors become more efficient you can put one on your back and itll work well
whats the worst diy project you have ever done    lets get a thread going
  dont all those fittings cost more than a new cheap head
  shit u right
  say what you want   it works
  not if u had them laying around and just need it as a temporary measure   perhaps they live somewhere where shipping takes more than a day or two or has no stores close by to buy a replacement  i think it is a good idea to get you out of trouble for a short time
  what does it do though
  the standpipe will not take the form of this washer draining the sink so aptly installed allows it to drain slowly without overflowing onto the floor
  looks like hes buffering so that he can ignore how clogged his drain line is    water is heavy bro doesnt look strong enough for when it actually clogs and fills all the way up
when i was younger i tried a diy generator which exploded and cracked through the walls while i was in a different room getting a tool i forgot pure luck that i didnt die mustve rolled a 20
  aluminum soda can around a cracked exhaust pipe between the engine and the muffler using high temp epoxy it actually worked pretty darn well so i guess it wasnt a bad diy
  why not just run it straight into the drainage hole
  bong out of metal pipe with nitrous cracker in the middle and two levers idea was to take a hit of weed close levers nitrous charge it then open up one lever having the nitrous shoot it into your lungs     every hit tasted like weed mixed with epoxy and bondo and if you opened it too fast it would probably burst / freeze your lungs  but it never worked properly to begin with
  dare i say it
  my newbalance box is below my laptop
  s    that poor bastard
  you missed the whole point   the reason you drain your washing machine into the sink is so you can take advantage of the garbage disposal to grind up the food leftovers that were left in the pockets of your laundry    in your pic theres no disposal under the sink so your drain is still going to get all clogged up with unground food
  how poor do you have to be to not be able to afford a room with its own dedicate drain line just for doing your laundry
  i dont see the problem
  gee billy how come your mom lets you have two ptraps
  can uh can i get excited about repeating digits on this board      tru dat
    i duct taped mine to the pipe so there isnt a geyser of water theres even an unblocked standpipe like 5 feet from its location and it would still blow out like that come to find out that it started blowing water up and out the stand pipe on the roof im just glad it had its own drain and wasnt connected to everything else the main problem turned out to be a crusted pipe somewhere out in the yard before it reached the trunk line who ever had installed the pipeline used thin wall pipe for 1 joint of the entire length and it was nearly flat well ushaped we only discovered the problem when soapy water started coming out of the yard evidently the snake just glided under the crushed section but the crack was too small to let the washing machine water through fast enough in the mean time before that got fixed i duct taped a vacuum cleaner hose to the washer hose and snaked it out the hole in the wall for the dryer vent then into an clean out access for the french drain i placed panty hose over the dryer exhaust during that time so it wouldnt get lint all over the room that lasted a week before everything was fixed and returned to normal    so you may need to check your stand pipe and other pipes for blockages      trees are too close the roots may fuck something up later on      whats the worst diy project you have ever done    i make lots of things out of trash
   the worst diy project you have ever done  i make lots of things out of trash    i turn parts and pieces that had value into trash
  the other reply had pictures but there are multiple kinds of cargo container and virtually none of them work sub ground level the best you can hope for without crushing is a retarded hobbit hole
  when i was a kid i wanted a koi pond in my backyard my dad said sure go for it without realizing it would cost  for everything    spent all summer digging a big hole then my parents got divorced and my mom wasnt on board with the project and spent the next 5 years slowly filling in the giant hole with topsoil and whatever yard waste
  i ruined a bunch of small electronics after trying to fix them i only had my dads old soldering iron the tip was as big as my pinky i didnt have any flux and i was working with really small horrible chink circuit boards and wires i eventually bought a small soldering iron and some flux it is so much easier when the solder actually flows and sticks to your wires being able to heat what you want is nice too
  i sometimes do that during prototyping
  same sort of thing happened to me as a teen i wanted to make a basement but part way through the dig my parents got divorced and i had to live with my mom somewhere else and couldnt finish the job it stormed enough to tear off the rain protection a pond formed later it was stocked with sunfish you could fish out the kitchen window a 3 years later it was finally filled in with 6 dump truck loads of dirt lol    my experience probably turned out better than yours
  i guess that explains why youre such an attention whore
i spend so long wondering if i could i never stopped to think if i should
  what kind of bidet is that
  /diy/ brand
  ehh i think its more about laziness i never did have the determination to finish the pond digging sucks
  universal enema attachment  buy it again
  it cleans your skin asshole and colon now thats efficiency
  wheres the vibration function
  looks like hes buffering
  i just why would anyone think this is a good idea modulus and tension are literally high school level physics its basically a tin can  its only designed to hold stuff its literally called a container not a supporter
  how poor do you have to be  most places where people had not the serendipity to be born in a developed nation
did this for my bday after i got laid off i didnt undercit the trim so i just tried to cut the lvf like a fucking mongoloid my caulk jobs are always shitty i shouldnt have even bothered with the vent bec there is no acess between the 1/2nd floor its a shitty ballast light that takes too long to turn on it was the only housing that would fit even then it still doesnt the towel rack guide was useless and kept being slightly off untill i made my own pilot holes never scribed the base boards so they come off the wall ever slightly good learning experince though
  i cant get a picture of it because its seal now but i had some damage to outer paneling from a hail storm a few years back insurance didnt cover it because i dont have gutters lol decided to replace the wood with fiber cement board to make the house brick the house is mostly brick only the kitchen had wood paneling dont ask me once we got the wood paneling off we found where the old termite infestation was and that the water damage had been creeping up the rest of the wood from outside for probably years nothing had to be completely removed and none of it was loadbearing but we had to sand out a bunch of the wood to clear the rot    a gallon of rot stop/fungicides/etc two treatments of wood hardener 4 cans of bondo and about 10 tubes of weather seal epoxy later my walls are are in one piece and my electric bill ended up being noticeably lower since theres also insulation in there now
  when you get a new cheap shower head you can disassemble and reuse all the fittings assuming its a temporary measure it literally costs nothing
  that plumbing is some dr seuss looking shit
  isnt that a prefab bunker thing though
  how is that your worse it worked in the end did you understand what op meant
  really literally
  condition like new
  kek this sounds familiar i broke my foot earlier this year and was so bored that i recaulked my bathroom      you ever see the prices on those high end vibrators fuck me im thinkin about buying a slightly used one for my girl when im not around
  kek
my sink repair that i posted here in 2017 was pretty horrible but it still functions fine    the sink bottom rusted out so i patched it with plexiglas
  realplayer did nothing wrong
  the other one is clearly reinforced
  thats hilarious
  ha i get it
  sometimes i forget about my pocket tots gawd
  jesus christ
onahole holder the friction from the sock attatched to the tape roll keeps it in place
ops mom
  say what you want  it works  so did this  i finally rodded the drain
  what was the purpose of burying it
    lol
  its got some extra steel welded on    also if you just fill in with cement in a couple of layers it will be fine its just a really expensive concrete form then
right one was my gpu for a year
  to any of you pecker heads reeeing at this as if its a standard shipping container it is not this is a reinforced container
  frank
  sold seperately
    not frank
  he doesnt have bins full of random plumbing fittings in his garage    why are you even here
  thats not bad its just pointless
  the main drain is at least 2 and should have no problem handling the washer output the drain pipe is even lowered in diameter twice before it makes it to the sink theres literally no reason for the sink to be there
  plumbing in a rental in the freezing rain in 6 inches of water used over 130 in sharkbite push fittings used 6 brass ball valves as hose couplers    theres 4 ball valves in a circle comming off the main line    tfw qhoever buys it next gets a leak
  i wtf
  anon i got a fucking 30pk worth of cans and buy bulk hose clamps good on ya
  reeeeeeeeee
  as popr as you want if you live outside of town mine drains of the ground idgaf
  czeched and lol
  that gives me an idea i got a buddy named ahab because he impregnated a white landwhale if i reporposed a 21 gallon harbor frieght compressor to use a stub out pope on the roof as a blow hole will it fuck anything up when he comes over i will yell lan hoe an trip a 2 inch ball valve
  not if you dump a bunch of rock salt down your drains fuck roots and anything else growing
  ahahaha    same
  dammit tripfag that sucks
  6 loads the fuck anon if those were 10wheelers thats like 90 tons
  i fucking lost good work sir
  im in ffucking tears
  just take out the water hammer arrestor and crank it on
  bullshit libcucks and their fucking nother earth news shit    i read it online so it must be true  dig hole  go inna coffin
  lets /diy her one on here not even kidding order a vibrating motor off amazon or epoxy a sinker on a motor shaft and and find an old phone charger    lets get busy bitch
  technically this is osha approved
  it cant crush you to death just sitting there
  and still can never fucking find wtf you need    speaking of shit /diy here is a flaxible radiator hose i bought to make a piss trap under my new shower pan a 1 1/2 sink drain pipe fits oerfect into the ends 1 end goes to the 2 drain in the pan and flex drain hose going to 1 1/2 pvc    my wife  why do we need all of these fittings  you cannot even begin to comprehend my final form    before you faggots ree ima silicone the shit out of it and its a greywater drain on wellwater the foundation is on a fucking 20 thick sandstone platue so idgaf
  i honestly thought you could do that when i was a kid
  oh and the fucking city hadto shut it off because the shutoff is fucked and if i break it then its 250 to fix it cocksuckers didnt shut it off all of the way i was reeing coveredd in water and freezing my dick off getting a facial with ever fitting    no bueno
  should put electrical tape around the base to cover the screws so it will meet code
  this is half of my clothesline supports it broke last winter after being overloaded so i stuck it back together using some liquid welder    problem is i didnt slide the clothesline reel back onto the support bar so now i just have this useless shit hanging off my house
  ive done this before
  quote of my life
  i did once and i got yelled at 
had an old 66 catalina  carb linkage broke right outside of detriot middle of the night shit neighbor hood all i could see was eyes n teeth from the darkness  rigged it with kite string and ran it through driver side window  drive to ohio with my had outside of car controlling throttle in 10f winter storm  rolled up window to use like cruise control when on the highway
  rolled up window to use like cruise control when on the highway  drove to california from arkansas in a new 1965 corvair corsa  had a stick the right length to prop between the accelerator and front edge of seat  redneck cruise control
  ha nice had 62 plymouth fury with 318 yblock and push button shifting rust holes big enough to throw a cat through without it ever touching metal driving from bama to nc hit brakes and pedal straight slams to floor  scrub off enough speed down shifting to avoid wreck coast to stop lines so old rusted out to rear drumsmiddle of nowhere so take needle nose and pinch off rear lines so fronts can still make pressure drove it like that for the next 5 years was a 300 car
have norinco m305  the threaded gas lock is loose about a quarter turn when its lined up properly  the solution is to add a shim so the threading is lined up properly  dont have the patience to wait three weeks for a 20 cent part  search junk pile for a washer or something  no luck  what other thin metal do i have in the house  grab aluminum foil from kitchen  guestimate how much layers it needs to be thick enough  still not thick enough fold the aluminum in half  that does the trick it tightens at 12 o clock like chairmen mao intended
  i thought i could be ave and take apart my old mans makita cordless drill driver and i must of broken or chipped something off on the gear selector lever and now it cant go into 2nd range so its stuck in first also the two halves of the plastic shell didnt want to go together so i used a nylon mallet
  and now it cant go into 2nd range so its stuck in first  the two halves of the plastic shell didnt want to go together  sounds just like ave to me
  whut  isnt he good at diagnosing the innards of tools and what not
  yes but hes often been accused of being the reason a tool wont turn on after taking it apart which is like a 1/10 occurrence
  kek the plastic man talks out his ass nearly as much as me
  3 tons a day is easy and thats only a month poor kids often have nothing to do for most of the summer so the math still nice perseverance
  next time use a sharkbite shutoff and leave it on while you connect it up
  isnt he good at diagnosing the innards of tools and what not    depends on what you consider good  if reading the country of origin on bearings and reading what type of plastic the case is made out of is good and helpful to whether its a worthwhile tool then yeah its good nevermind he doesnt use them before he takes them apart and then half the time they dont work right if he does manage to put them back together      accused  he is the one who puts the videos out there anon
  pecker head reporting in    those little sticks of angle iron welded to the outside will do very little to reinforce against the types of forces the earth will apply to those walls once its buried    thats like putting a garbage bag filed with air inside a shopping cart then submerging it under water and expect the wire basket of the shopping cart will protect it from the crushing pressure of the water that contacts every sqr inch of the bags surface rip
  use 2 folded pillows anon l2 fap
  they do look welded to the outside of the container but id only trust it if the areas between the welded reinforcement struts were less than a square foot each
  my dude wtf
  my life
  based and springpilled
  shit im gonna do this now
roof on the car was rusted to nothing then vinal blew off at high speed leftover couple bucks worth of molding drywall mud old newspapers some paint left over from the fence bone dry and high speed capable for a three years now    thank you all for the ideas and the humor
  roof on the car was rusted to nothing then vinal blew off at high speed leftover couple bucks worth of molding drywall mud old newspapers some paint left over from the fence bone dry and high speed capable for a three years now  no way
  youd believe if i mentioned that ive been parking under a lemon tree for twenty years but i did not want to make myself too identifyable
  post current pic i believe you just wanna see it
  this was some douche on reddit who wanted an underground party bunker he did get it buried and lived long enough to post pictures not sure if he was crushed to death later it only had something like 1 ft of dirt on the top
  when i was about 11 one of the welds on my bike frame cracked i tried to essentially splint it with some strips of metal and hose clamps
  have garand  have shoestring   will not admit to ever combining the two
i was living in a condemned house with a few friends one day decided to learn to throw a hatchet threw hatchet at the kitchen wall all damn day most of the wall was gone someone decided they needed that wall to look like it was still there for some reason   bought a big roll of duct tape and scavenged some paint that was close enough in color literally made a wall of duct tape and rolled the paint on it actually looked smooth and the idiots couldnt tell
  oh god i havent laughed this hard since /b/ was still funny
  ahahaha
    oh lesson learned i cut all that shit out and got a junk fridge full of plumbing shit     never again
  i cant fucking stand that cuck
  lol    be me  shitbox limo to bros wedding  gather everyone for breakfast  was 3 cabins full of people pile in  take off down the dirt road doing about 40mph  t intersection and a basedbean field  brakes to the floor  everybody walk the dinosaur    fortunately even hung over i had enough brains to stand on it so we didnt get stuck make it back to the road and cabin/bean field owner is on his porch wondering wtf a dozen rednecks are doing rutting up the place
  hey whatever gets the car home right
  americans literally stuff food inside their pockets then forget about it
  the latest one with the impact driver was a royal shitshow
  and then half the time they dont work right if he does manage to put them back together    the best part is people pay for this
  i am a techno dumbass i am afraid i will post ever picture i ever took i have done that kinda thing before you wouldnt be able to see much from the pic because it looks fine
    wallpaper in shower    how/why 
  its thick plastic probably it was a common choice couple of decades ago as it was very cheap and easy to install
  i mean that zip tie is stronger than a master lock
      dig hole  put non permeable surface  put water  put little baby koi for 5 each    thats what i dud whats so expensive about a koi pond in america
  people go nuts and over pay for fucking carp
  3rd world shithole dwellers litterally obsessed and incapable of forgeting about my freedomland for 4 seconds
      i dont understand the issue ive read tons of articles saying you can make cellars or underground bunkers out of shipping containers as long as you reinforce the top and put a retaining wall or cement on the sides
  reinforce the top and put a retaining wall or   cement on the sides  i wouldnt use unreinforced concrete and for the roof youll need to make some trusses that extend at least a foot up or down to give it the strength to not bow in from the weight above it be that concrete or soil and at that point theres no reason to just ditch the shipping container and pick something that wont rust to shit and leak when in contact with wet earth or curing cement and is made to go underground like those large pipe sections be they corrugated galvanised iron or concrete not to mention the fact that undamaged shipping containers arent exactly cheap especially if you want one and dont live next to a port
  at that point theres no reason not to just ditch the shipping container
  pick something that wont rust to shit and leak when in contact with wet earth or curing cement and is made to go underground  this guy gets it  i dont understand the shipping container fad youll spend a couple grand on the container a whack on freight or fuel and another couple grand making it a serviceable space or waste all your money by crushing it under tons of earth and sand doesnt help when you live up north and the freezethaw will destroy a lot of this stuff  hurr its designed to withstand shipping itll withstand freezing  not if you drill holes in it it wont you gotta install hvac so you dont suffocate install water install electrical insulate the walls etcthats too many points of failure i do not understand why people spend thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours turning a bar stool into an armoire for the price time lifespan and likelihood of being crushed to death just do it right from the beginning and actually build a proper underground structure
  think is started back in the early 2000s when some architects realized that at the time shipping container frames were cheaper and stronger than wood frames for homes theyd cut out the side panels and build the house siding around the frames   of course then the cost of used shipping containers inflated and made wood frames cheaper again and a bunch of diy types forgot the part about cutting off the sides and tried to use them where support was needed
  it would be good if there was a sort of premade steel frame you could buy that fills this niche
broke a vac line in my 80s impala while replacing the fuel filter tried to tape it closed and ended up breaking the nearby tjunction of vac lines i very carefully held the whole mess together with electrical tape backed it with newspaper and drowned it in spray plastidip     it worked for months but as i found out last week when checking my oil and seeing that the rubber had failed it turns out the vac line system is completely unnecessary to the function of the car
  this ffs why use something totally unsuited to conversion
  yall mutherfuckers just wait about 12 hours when i get up to 88 miles per hour youre gonna see some serious shit
  kek    was snugging up valve cover bolts chasing an oil leak the other day and must have unhooked or busted a vac line    tfw 3500rpm stall converter in town  tfw 45mph and break em loose to hit 2nd gear
  hahahahaha
  was this on the sloop van by any chance
i need to drill a wall but it has this sign can i ignore it
if that has a delta membrane behind it then it is probably a bad idea i think you can get special fixing inserts and sealants designed to be used with tanking systems though
  go for it
dont live your life by signs op
  this  drill your glory hole you magnificent bastard
take the sign off then youre okay to drill
  this is what i would do whats the wordt that could happen
  i bet theyre hiding gold back there or some other precious items
  if you cant drill a hole in the wall how did they get the sign screwed up its a con ignore it
  being this stupid
it sounds like more of a suggestion
  why do you need to drill it
oh look    
  why would a truck frame be heat treated thats just stupid   is the whole frame made from spring steel even more stupid
at least i learned what a delta lining is today  
hmm didnt i just see that thread on /g/  you might fucking die so go right ahead
    is the whole frame made from spring steel even more stupid    they are designed to flex and flex a lot all day long    its only commuters who think that stiffer  better when it comes to trucks
  
  british  so this is how they fight humidity
  are pickup and car frames heat treated
  my back says truck frames dont flex much you right tho anyone in oklahoma knows if your shit didnt give a little the fucking roads would murder your truck
  other anon probably knows better than me but unibody cars are so much different than old school body on frame    modern pickup trucks flex a lot though you can probably find some youtube vids of newer trucks on those proving grounds that test suspension articulation and you can see them flex at the gap between the cab and bed
  well i used a rosebud and a sledge on my frame last week oh well it never leaves town anyway
  huh ill be damned
    
idk can you
hello every one  im from francea country that has never heard of hope or winning and neither did i until god spoke to me through the voice of jordan peterson  now i want to spread the hope in france and i want to translate his lectures in french but i need a subtitle editor which size isnt to big for my shitty pc yeah i know im not speaking that good english so why should i  cause i believe   i need your help guys europe needs you 
  i want to translate his lectures in french but i need a subtitle editor which size isnt to big for my shitty pc    maybe someone will answer but this might fit better here

these idiots in here are barely smart enough to flush a shitter you dumb ape
ive got a kit i need to finish lots of machining required
  ahaha
  how far can steam travel i want to turn a small block chevy into a steam engine without suiciding myself
  i want to turn a small block chevy into a steam engine    have fun warming it up for an hour on a cold morning
  yeah sure you do
  hey now theres 2 or 3 of us that can at least do an oil change of course it generally takes us 3 or 4 days and we end up having to walk bus or get a rental during that time but we do get it done eventually
  jeez i guess it depends what your talking about if youre talking about before it condenses then that depends on the temp of the pipes but if youre talking about pressure then it depends on the width and length of the pipe but you might want to have the boiler closer to the engine to minimize more moving parts heat loss and places of failure
  i didnt mean to sound like im bragging i was just looking for some inspiration from others as most of my projects are becoming very similar to style and effort
that would be neat im kinda trying to convert a generator to push start trying to learn more about engines
  you should use a single cylinder two stroke engine instead much easier to convert you get massive torque from steam so you dont need an engine that big unless you are literally trying to move a train a coiled tube flash steam setup removes the danger of explosions and is better anyway
best resource ive ever found    
this engine took me 4 yrs to build and it runs great i take it to all the conventions and car shows
lets make a conversation     hey op why did you make it   do you plan on using it to run anything if so what   how efficient is it on compressed air   can you run it indefinitely as the compressor recharges  what was the biggest kink you had to work out during its construction     i am genuinely interested in this
  kys
  do you have youtube vid of it running looks very interesting    or is this a ruse
  or is this a ruse    while it might have moving parts it does not look like an internal combustion engine so many things are not functional like the starter motor for one not to mention the plastic exhaust
  i made it this summer i had nothing to do since i did not have my license yet and wasnt able to get a job that worked with my parents schedule  i do not have a way to test its torque or hp but ill guess its about 04 hp or 5 efficient    the biggest challenge i faced was what type of valve worked the best for my skill/tools i ended up using the valve case and slide design and i had to use the lost foam casting method for every moving part of it    i planned it to put it on a cart but the torque was way lower than i anticipated    it needs a lot of work and my skill level is limited to the tools that i have which are just basic hand tools and a couple power tools    if youre interested here is the youtube video of it running  
  i planned it to put it on a cart but the torque was way lower than i anticipated    its very cool conceptually nice vid
  kek its a water pump and recreational it aint going to run if its under 80 degrees outside anyway
  lol thats why i have 8 cars    they all shitboxes but my best friend and my dad have heated shops and lifts    omfg its so nice to not get raped my misquitoes and roll around in snow changing transmissions
  no idea im new as shit and my dad bet me 100 i couldnt run a small block without gas we got like 300 of them    dads a fucking redneck genious dude bought an 80s model ford one of the first with fuek injection came running in the house like its christmas     it idles by itself and i didnt have to pump it at all    runs away mumbling shit shit shit under his breath i ran outside with him excited vecause he was i was like 6 i dont know wtf a fuel injection is    asked hin why he was all butthurt    straight faced as shit looks at me and says hotrods are gone now    from that day on hes been buying every chevy car and c10 from the 70s and 80s he can    dude has a pasture full of novas and shit he wont turn loose of for nothing    kek
  kek
  i want to put a gasifier on my old truck
  i want to buy and old truck and gassify it
  kek its a pain in the ass having to start a fire to go get a pack of smokes for a fuckoff truck its cool tho
  i did a few years ago from a coke can
  your old man sounds based af bet hes a blast to chill with sounds a bit like myself    tfw hoard every old/unique/cheap vehicle or equipment i come across     just hauled home my 5th idi powered ford a few weeks ago
  what the fuck is the point of this though why dont you just modify your compressor you ape
    im sorry i said that its cool that you could make that op
  sodoes it work or not
  oh yeah put it in a go kart very fast
  so just like any other chevy
  only on /diy/ do you see this kind of maturity and self awareness its why this is the best board on 4channelorg
  its alright my creations are kinda basic but i just love engines and making them is my favorite hobby  btw im new to anything that has to do with engineering so these are more of just trial and error builds
  some company did this decades ago it did work they died cause they couldnt keep up with demand
i am a brainlet how do i start making stuff and connecting wires like you guys do i habe to buy a raspberry pi or arduino only technical knowledge i have is new starting the laptop when ot hangs
    wrong board the really cool tech guys are all on 
  this is diy just point me to the rjght direction
    i already did /diy/ is the wrong board for you you will find your kind of crowd on 
  thank you based anon
  spend a few grand on tools and meters and the rest will follow
  he bought a fucking klein multimeter    the stupidity just never ends with you does it    spend a few grand on tools and meters and the rest will follow    nope i guess it doesnt i didnt think id ever see a gearfag gloating about cheap tools but here we are
  make a reasonable goal  learn technical information pertaining to that goal  buy tools and materials to complete your goal
  im halfway convinced the klein and southwire meters are made in the same place    and whats wrong with the klein is it supposed to be either 25 aliexpress meter if youre poor otherwise you need a fluke i havent had any issues with either of them and ill buy a damn fluke one day when i actually understand what im doing with the things when i bought the klein i thought you could measure the amps going through a circuit by sticking the  lead on the  terminal of the battery and the  lead on the  terminal i learned from my mistakes after a couple blown fuses
  start lurking on the arduino threads  also /ohm/ general
  whats wrong with klein multi meters  i just bought one nothing wrong with it
  im halfway convinced the klein and southwire meters are made in the same place    southwire is a fucking lowes house brand its not a real brand and i wouldnt doubt a cheap shitty lowes house brand being identical to the klein     is it supposed to be either 25 aliexpress meter if youre poor otherwise you need a fluke     you bought a 20 aliexpress meter just with kleins name on it       whats wrong with klein multi meters    nothing if you enjoy paying a lot more for a name  you can buy a unit for the same price and get a much better multimeter with more features same build quality same warranty because you arent paying the klein and lowes shelf tax    remember that even fluke boards are made in china now only a few manufacturers so its up to picking the features you want at the pricepoint you want klein is one of the bigger ripoffs when you get right down to specs
  kek the response i expected    the price difference isnt as big as you make it out to be there are basic klein meters for 3040 that are close to a no name amazon meter for 25 the 70 meter like i got those same features would be about 40 on an amazon meter but the klein ones have some decent features like the drop protection and you can be a little more confident that klein isnt trying to put their name on a meter that will give you false readings right out of the box whereas unitekcity from amazon doesnt care about their brand so much since it wont be around in two years    and that southwire wasnt really a bad deal it was 80 and it reade dc amps there is a unit that will read dc but its tiny and made for lower voltages and currents so you cant really compare the two the only clamps that would read dc current for significantly less money were very questionable brands    i understand theyre not fluke meters but theres a reason i didnt order off aliexpress gives me more peace of mind having testing equipment with a real warranty and return policy from a brand that will still exist in 18 months    speaking of meters i grabbed pic related the other day good ol craftsman 6 for some extra long leads the clamps and the mini hooks
  ok i didnt know what a disappointment even fluke is china crap  well this is my only digital meter atm so i was planning to buy another one eventually ill look at unit next time  i really wanted a fluke but got frustrated while comparing all the different models so i went with the klein mm700 because it sounded like a good one for hobby electronics
  meh hes just talking shit units are one of the better less known brands but they arent even that much cheaper than the kleins the ones where you really save money like the multitude of 40 1000v true rms meters on amazon are of questionable origin and i would not want to put 240v into those leads    there was some anon a week or two who had a cheap meter supposedly rated to 600v and i think his leads fried when he started touching 110v    
  yeah im not worried i only paid about 40 for my klein mm700 and it had like 90 4 and 5 star reviews
  oh damn where did you get that price from those things are normally 100 at 40 you would be hard pressed to find even the shittiest chinese brands that claim to have the same features
  kek the response i expected    so you knew you were overpaying for literally nothing and you did it anyways    but hey at least you can brag online about spending thousands of dollars on tools amirite
  i have a klein mm600 and its really not bad at all nice big display nice backlight feels solid and even measures microamps unlike most fluke meters under 400 except those chinese market ones with no warranty lol
  how many pairs you splicing  bout 2 or 4 my man  you are a little baby watch this  ms2
  i got it off of amazon i just reviewed the order info i guess i actually paid 9997 lol  sorry i was being retarded idk why i thought it was 40
  whats that
  3m ms2
  3m ms2  super splicing module        all them splicings   dang thats kinda cool
  mm700    i like it so far only other meter i have is this little analog unit ive had for damn near 20 years    i suppose im going to need at least one more digital handheld meter soon but eventually id also like to get one of those digital bench top meters
  its not overspending if you value having a brand you can somewhat trust i would say the extra 20 was worth it so i dont have to second guess every reading i get    so buying a fluke must be a huge fuckin waste of money right      maybe think about a clamp meter for your second handheld one im already thinking about a third but i would really like a scope
  i would say the extra 20 was worth it so i dont have to second guess every reading i get    but they have the same boards and same quality control    so buying a fluke must be a huge fuckin waste of money right    any actual ee will tell you that flukes are straight garbage and are only popular because retard electricians like to drop their meters 20 feet onto the concrete   so if you actually want accuracy and repeat ability they are a waste of money because you are buying a big overbuilt plastic shell    its like you did literally 0 research before you bought the damn thing
  0 research  this is untrue i did research it was poor research but it was research nonetheless    same qc  this is debatable i understand that a few of my doll hairs went to the marketing joos and home depot but even coming from the same factory klein is likely to have better qc than shintek because they actually care about their brand
  i said to buy the unit because they are the oem who badges all the other meters
  those are straight but they arent significantly cheaper than klein or southwire for the same options
op about getting started in electronics  this thread is a good example of why tripfaggotry is cancer
  i have a wish list im up to 1000 for a benchtop 2channel dmm 4 channel scope and a 3channel variable pwr supply
  i have a wish list im up to 1000 for a benchtop 2channel dmm 4 channel scope and a 3channel variable pwr supply    scope pic related    2 channel dmm or 2 dmms not too expensive depending on who you listen to very few people need to know anything to huge certified precision in my opinion quite often you just need to be able to measure a change that you have made    3 channel pwr supply why could you get by with a single channel power supply and maybe a 30 buck atx pc power supply for 5 12 33 voltages
  that is about eca3ctly the scope im looking at im sure your right i could prob get those 3 items for 800 or less  only reason i was looking at the 3ch pwr supply was its only another 25 or so more than some of the 1 or 2ch ones in the 50 to 100 range    for the units im looking at approx  scope  400  2ch dmm  300  pwr supply  120
  5 12 33 voltages  yes thats pretty much all i need for 90 of what ill be working on    i have no wife no kids no debt no other hobbies that need money spent on them 75k/yr income 50 of which goes straight into savings usually   i figure i dont blow money on typical useless crap like most people cant hurt to spend a few grand on some decent tools even if its just a hobby its my only hobby that requires money at the moment
    i think you have more money than i do so go with your original plan nice equipment is nice    however will you want a function generator a frequency meter logic analyzer etc    one can never have too many tools pic related is about 10 bucks and competes well with high dollar devices
  i figured id add those things too eventually that little logic analyzer looks like a sweet deal  it may sound like overkill for a casual hobbyist like myself but once i get to the real work on some of my planned projects i will legitimately have a use for them
my boss asked me to test this new liquid pressure sensor we just got being the curious dumbass since never used one of these i opened up its protective cover and pressed the soft metallic surface of the sensor     now it got small indentations instead of the smooth grooves it used to be and the measurements is kind of wrong was my action responsible for the wrong measurements or it needs calibration
  side view
  just ask accounting to deduct 500 a week for the next ten years
how the fuck are you employed
  its ruined replace
 boss asked me to test this new liquid pressure sensor    his boss probably meant shove it up your ass and plug it in
yeah you ruined it good job
anyone notice how idiots who break things and come here asking for help are always incapable of taking a nonblurry photo
  how much are you paying the girls at the shop to do your nails
  he said test it not take it apart and poke it with your finger you ridiculous mook    you probably destroyed it and it looks like it costs 4 digits at least enjoy your job search after youre fired
  its fucked you over ranged the diaphragm it can be calibrated again to be of some use but it will never work like new    what kind of pressures are you measuring with such a soft dp cell
  what kind of pressures are you measuring with such a soft dp cell    max  forcing a huge dry turd out  min  diarrhea
  are you assuming ops gender
  r u 
  of course
  needs calibration  up your ass  you fucked it
  test the maximum water pressure capability of the sensor to destruction problem solved
its totally fuckered needs to be cut up and have diaphragm replaced     t qc for a transducer mfg
just blame it on a manufacturer defect worst case is they buy a new one
  this its new theres still time to save your sorry ass
calibration tech fag here you are hosed slightly over pressured yeah sure you can get it back into tolerance finger in the diaphragm it is boned
  finger in the diaphragm   boned  blue board anon  watch it
  being the curious dumbass since never used one of these i opened up its protective cover and pressed the soft metallic surface of the sensor    im curious too opie and what i want to know from you opie is are you curious enough to read did this new sensor you just fubared come with documentation and did you bother to read it to satisfy your curiosity i am curious because this is kind of important if you plan to be any kind of technical person in the near future
          i also work around transducers aircraft biz  these are the only posts that arent complete bull shit but i disagree with all but the suggestion that it was already like that thats how we do that shit is probably just the seal i cant see good it can also be calibrated and if you are fucking with water how close dose it have to be fucking digital bull sucks i like gauges
  test it    tell the boss that whatever machine collecting data is fucked    spend an hour or two trying to solve it    then tell the boss that the machine is actually fine but the sensor is actually fucked from factory but you assumed it was working well because it was new     that will sound believable    ah fuck we have to get a new sensor  but at least its not a huge bit of equipment like it could other wise have been  good work anon
  test it  tell the boss that whatever machine collecting data is fucked  spend an hour or two trying to solve it  then tell the boss that the machine is actually fine but the sensor is actually fucked from factory but you assumed it was working well because it was new  that will sound believable    no dont do that    just tell the boss you fucked with it so you get fired and someone with a brain gets the job
  yeah its wrecked for sure
  come with documentation  warning do not poke the diaphragm
  tfw the documentation for my drill didnt tell me not to insert the bit into my urethra    now i have to spin round as insert my dick into my wife
  t guy who attached his flshlight inside a blender and dicked it
  christ almighty why is this thread full of babbling retards
    thats the diaphragm that pushes on the force transmitter if it isnt deformimg evenly it wont anymore the linearity will be fucked the zero balance is probably fucked as well might still be useful but only at full capacity
    probably just the seal     also tell me what aircraft you make systems for so i can make sure to never get on one
  i too shall refrain from purchasing aircraft from this manufacturer

  while were here my boss asked me to test the diesel generators on this nuclear reactor being a shellacinfused vodkinski i removed all the graphite rods and pressed my dick into the coolant intake now its full of dicky air and the rods are all wonky was my action responsible for the death of thousands of liquidators and civilians or does the soviet union intrinsically fail as a concept
  side view
i faund dis     
    do 3 know to never poke or tap the sensor diaphragm to alter the output  it used to be commonplace among users in the know to tap a pointed object such as a pen or pencil against different parts of the sensor diaphragm to adjust the sensor output in theory tapping in the center would shift the output up and tapping on the side would bring it down while this works to temporarily adjust the sensor output it also disturbs the bonding layer behind the diaphragm causing the sensor output to drift the output might start where the user wants it but it will not stay there    not only is poking the diaphragm an unreliable method for calibrating a sensor its hazardous for the sensors health the diaphragm could be damaged very easily poking or tapping the diaphragm will also void any warranty if your sensor does not have field adjustable settings potentiometer screws for zero or span or electronically adjustable input and output settings then contact your manufacturer for calibration instructions  top faking lel
i found some similar to the one in your pics    go to jew bay and lookup 420ma smart water level sensor liquid level transmitter water level sensor    they range from 42106 burger bucks so you might not be all that fucked    no clue how those work and no idea if they are similar/compatible to the one you have

  it is very likely that you fly with shit that i have had my hands on almost everyone i work with is more retarded than me we know how to deal with the shit we fuck up we practice fucking shit up all the time i could teach you a thing or two about what you think that you know its easy to sit in a laboratory setting and say that is acceptable and this is not we gotta make that shit fly
  cut your nails you disgusting fuck
  tests new sensor on specific boss request  rnd replaces it with an ali special bestest value sesnir hopes no one notices  gets fired
just own up to it offer to pay you may get fired you may not if you do on your next interview you tell them about the expensive lesson you learned on you last job     it will turn out far worse for you if down the road it gets found out that you tried to hide it have fun explaining that on future job interviews
  nah owing up to your mistakes is wrong in todays corporate culture never do it
  todays corporate culture  tell them you are undergoing gender reassignment surgery and cannot be upset because hormones then tell them you fucked up sensor   aah sensor why thats zero problem anon rly

  fuck i was flying to seattle while this motherfucker was in the air    worth the hour delay desu    saw a plane crest the clouds probably another diverted plane but i hold the hope in my heart it was /ourguy/
  as a fellow aero engi please god shut the fuck up youre giving me and everyone i work with a bad name    everyone i work with is meticulous as fuck and i have incredible respect for my coworkers  my mentor built a plane for the navy that in its first offshore combat experienced 14gs dial was maxed in a 90 degree vertical pivot with afterburners and all only reason pilot survived was because he was a hundred times the man youll ever be and instead of just making shit fly he prided himself on the very best work he could do fuck you
  yeah i know who you are i was shutting up just fine until i saw that you replied to me now i am chomping at the bit i will try to keep silent keep your good name
seems like you can get some cheap ones dont worry anon
  are you sure thats not the self destruct control for the nostromo
  hmm some chatter in the machining there
  oh he built the whole plane    interesting
    op is bosss boss kid
  boss asked me to test this  test confirms delicate instrument will not withstand handling by morons
  i dont know you but i want to post photos of your mentor reaching under a mens bathroom stall at ohare airport cuz we all know what he was up to
  14g maneuver  its not balls to the motherfucking wall nuclear war with russia time  like the computer would even allow him to stress the airframe like that  pilot doesnt have brain damage    maybe you shouldnt have poked the diaphragm of the sensor then the g meter wouldnt be broken

the bike is pretty scrappy anyway so it doesnt need to have that nice of a paint job its currently an ugly blue colour    i was thinking of painting it but im worried about where the brake pads touch the wheel it might end up removing the paint over time    i was also considering just sanding the coloured anodized layer away i dont mind the bare metal colour    any advice what type of paint should i use
  mask off the brake track you want it to be bare metal also wrap tape around the spoke nipples so paint doesnt get into the threads which might make it difficult later to true the wheel
  if i did mask off the brake track i would have a blue line running around the wheel since its annodised blue    if thats the case i might just sand everything down
grease the spoke nipples for easier masking than tape
  grease your nipples  lewd
  i was also considering just sanding the coloured anodized layer away i dont mind the bare metal colour    try a scotchbrite / any abrasive pad
i need a solution to keeping people from walking through my side yard my house has an empty plot next to it essentially a vacant lot that is our side yard its clearly not just an empty lot since i have a garden and such around but people cut through it i dont want to have to set fence posts or pay a contractor to do it and i dont want an obtrusive fence anyway    so any ideas on keeping people out i considered a low brick wall but that would be incredibly time consuming
a fence nothing else will work
  landmines  a pit bull  armed guards  dont be retarded just put up a fence
  plant some thorny bushes in a nice hedgerow
  rose bushes  natures barbed wire
      theres a few larger trees at the edge so theyd be hard to put a fence around    i might go with these        i was considering yucca plants too
laser detectors on the edges arduino water sprinkler  bonus for a webcam broadcasting all that
  yucca plants  strangers in yard  just call ice already
    theyre b l a c k
  get a hive of aggressive bees its a win win they will keep the assholes away and you get free honey
  do you know how much it will cost to buy a fence made out of rose bush
id put up a motion activated sprinkler you can just say its to keeps pests out of your garden
  california law states that sexual predators must post signage indicating where they reside    put up a lgbt flag too itll be funny

  or you can just say it is to deter trespassers getting people wet is not excessive force by any standards      anyone wearing jeans will walk right through them without even noticing most likely if you are in a location were black berries grow they will do the trick you can have an impassable thorny thicket of tasty berries in a season if you are in black berry country they are easy to get for free as well
  hmm not op but i wonder if theyll grow in se michigan
  they will
  theyre b l a c k  put up sign

hey /diy/ im sorry if this is a bit offtopic but this is one of the only actually reliable boards for any help with anything i work as a maintenance technician at an apartment complex in the midwest ive been there about 25 years and its been a solid gig they hired me with no experience and now i know my way pretty well around basic plumbing electrical and electric furnaces and residential acs trouble is we cant seem to hire anyone the pay is solid you get a free apartment its not a bad job im not sure if corporate is just bad at it or its really that hard to find anyone we just got back up to almost fully staffed but now im almost sure were about to have a tech fired which is good he deserves it but i cant keep being on call 50 of my life anyone know any good ways to find people for this kind of job or a quick cheap way to get the right person hvac certified they really dont even need experience we can train them on the job corporate just has to sign off and forget about them any and all advice is appreciated and while youre here if anyone has any apartment maintenance stories or experience they wanna share go ahead
hvac certified at a minimum means they have an epa 608 certification which is a quick test but the reason no one wants to work their is because they pay shit compared to actual hvac work
  i forgot to mention epa is obviously needed but thats something you can either get through us or pay 30 bucks to get easy as hell it doesnt pay as well as actual hvac work but you also dont have to really know what youre doing and when you do you can move on to higher pay the free apartment is a pretty great perk as well
ask to interview your own candidates
plumbingelectricalhvac  these qualifications routinely require certifications and experience wait you can train them on the joband you had no experienceyall are wacked glad not renting from yall
  an apartment complex in the midwest  narrow it down a bit  ive been doing this for 25 years  i maintain 52 addresses  just me  a move with less work and more pay sounds nice
  the only way to learn trades is to pay for a degree and then 700 additional certs
  dont forget the 7000 hours as an unpaid intern
  t forget the 7000 hours as an unpaid intern    where do you live in dickens england around here you take a class on how to tell red from black and white then get hired at good pay as an electricians assistant if you want to become a licensed electrician you take the advanced course in how to tell red from black and white then work some number of years with another licensed electrician and then you might have to take a test on that redblackwhite thing and you get your license     nobody works one hour for free
  then you might have to take a test on that redblackwhite thing    a little google tells me that you have to take a test some of which allows you to consult the code book and some of which does not for nc which has a reciprocity agreement with several other states the test must be pretty tough given that one version takes 3 hours and the other takes 6
  the test must be pretty tough given that one version takes 3 hours  allowed 3 hours  if you finish in 30 minutes youre good to go
    live in canada take a 1500 electrician course  shortly after applying to course they tell me my entire tuition is covered by some government scholarship to help more people get into trades  4 year apprenticeship first year is 60 of journeyman rate 2nd year 70 3rd year 80 4th year 90  back then just out of high school 1st year apprenticeship job and my pay was 16/hr great for 1st job out of highschool  finish up apprenticeship and made closer to 40/hr after 5 years    can confirm didnt work a single hour as an unpaid intern didnt really like it though quit after 5 years and work at a grain elevator for half the pay now but enjoy it a lot more 
like others have said anyone who has the skills that you just listed at any real level can make way more money doing them elsewhere the rest of people dont have too much interest in working on stuff with their hands for a living if you are in the usa i can also add to there being a total lack of people working trades of any kind its a short labor supply
  have the hiring manager post a job opening on a job search site like indeed or whatever works in your area make sure they list the qualifications needed and maybe even the starting pay you would be surprised at the amount of people looking for a sweet maint tech gig plus they can get interviewed and you can select the best candidatenot trolling
  i can almost bet my 3rd testicle this is in indianapolis indiana either way i could bet that evn though the pay is decent most tenants are section a or 8 whatever its called so u can conclude the ireputable nature of the tenants
  so u can conclude the ireputable nature of the tenants  ive stopped taking housing authority tenants unless theyre old as in past retirement age or actually have a legitimate disability
i wanna get my dad one of those hobby starter kits for christmas heres the factors  hes got a bad back so he cant be hunched over a desk for very long or really at all something he could do in his lap while hes sitting on the porch would be ideal  his eyesight isnt great not terrible but not great its tough for him to read regular books so he just reads stuff on his kindle with the font kicked up a couple notches so it cant be anything that requires really good eyesight  it has to be cheap i want to be able to get a full starter set with everything he needs to do a project for 50 bucks or less    any ideas

people dont have hobbies because theyre uninterested lazy and unmotivated    trying to force someone into a hobby isnt possible ive tried many times i myself have many hobbies all picked up myself
maybe he could widdle wood but doesnt sound like it and he would probably think youre dumb for suggesting it
triple post but maybe a 3d printer or 3d printer pen
  tell us more about your dad profession interests skills outlook 
  the main goal of this is im worried hes been in kind of a funk since the accident that messed up his back im hoping that if i get him a hobby kit even if hes not interested in that specific hobby hell give it a try or at least remember that hobbies are fun and look into something he is interested in
rock tumbler
  hes a computer engineer of some kind im not sure of the specifics but i think he makes supercompute clusters he used to be big into bicycling but thats not really an option anymore he used to do woodworking but in his own kinda weird way he never made like a cabinet but he did once spend a couple months making a perfectly smooth wooden cube
  sounds like something is limiting him from what he wants to do best bet is to integrate him socially in something he cant help but love    ask him if he wants to visit for a few weeks and teach your kids something involve him with you and your church
  get him involved in rom hacking if hes a software guy or fpgas if hes hardware how nerdy is he
  oh shit we used to have one of those ages ago thats a really good idea    i dont have any kids or a church
  make some kids its very fun at most stages
  i am genuinely trying to put my life together at least in part to help my dad but thats a longterm project and im thinking about christmas shopping here
  ask him if hes hardware or software
  how did he mess up his back how bad is it

get him a bosch m or p series diesel injection pump and a reseal kit  tearing down and rebuilding diesel pumps is a nice hobby all you really need to start out is a bench and a pump
  seconding ham radio    you could always intoduce him to maymays and the chans
  we told you that stupid assed walking wheelchair wouldnt work
    or really at all something he could do in his lap while hes sitting on the porch would be ideal    shotgun

  only the first stage or two the entire rest of the process is an acquired or not taste  stick to practicing      i gotta vote no on the hackrf its dynamic range is shite
  hes got a bad back so he cant be hunched over a desk for very long  buy him a bag of weed and a playstation
get him into knitting its oddly relaxing and its related to computers in a way
  violence robot
  get him a task desk that can hold electronics stuffs at eyelevel and an electronics project or 3

what does /diy/ think of my homemade metal guitar
  are those frets actually in key if so breddy gud
  yeah i used an online calculator and made the bridge adjustable for intonation purposes
ugly as fuck though looks like the fret board is way to wide
im gonna need a video of you playing it
  how long can it sustain notes  how deep is the tone  what kind of pickups you used  can you compare the sound of it to a factory model stratocaster les paul etc
i need to hear this trash op
  neat project  but i am suspicious the intonation is going to be wrong on at least a couple of those frets the spacing on some of them looks fugged
  what kind of hands do you have it looks like only wolverine could play that
  but i am suspicious the intonation is going to be wrong on at least a couple of those frets    intonation is only right at what ever fret you set it at generally the 12th and open not possible to get perfect intonation across a fret board they look right to me but it is hard to tell from that low resolution picture         not sure what you people are on about fretboard/neck look fine certainly narrower than a classical    nice work op aint my style but it has more going for it than the 8427 flavours of strat out there
  intonation  look closely you can see some fret spacing is off  normally frets will only get smaller spacing as you go up the neck from the head towards the body    i can see some frets spacing this is not the case on op guitar
    starting at fret 12
  yeah i have to admit that the scale is a little to long making chords difficult for my beginner hands but i assume they would be anyway
    no video as i cant play but heres a shit recording   
  the pickup is a shitty 5 telecaster pickup i was going to make my own with a hard drive magnet some steel slugs and some really thin wire i did 3 prototypes before i realized that hard drive magnets are magnetized axialy instead of having a north plate and a south plate like i thought
  ive seen jack white make better looking shit from his 12 yr old gfs peppermint feces
  would you believe me if i said that was for semitones
  are you planning on backing your strings with a fretboard  i think this guitar would look cool furnished with a dark fingerboard and maybe some chambered paneling for the body  are you hoping to play with this guitar or is it for display
  what does this even mean  obvs frets are in semitones but whats your point with the higher frets
  wide fretboards are typical of shreddy guitars because it gives you more space for all that acrobatic shit that metal players like
    cooooooooool  interesting sounds
  youre retarded dont answer shit you have no idea about
  shredders want smaller frets so its easier to transverse actually
  my guess would be that after getting a certain distance up the neck you checked your distance and had to make a correction
  think of the neck on a jackson guitar jumbo frets  or on ibanez rg
  jumbo frets means the actual fret the metal bar is big not the space between 2 frets
  this is exponentially wrong
  plenty of shredders like wide necks so they can get more room for bends/vibrato without interfering with the neighboring strings    the only thing wrong with all these posts about what a shred guitar is and is not is that there is no single definition of a shred guitar it is a style of playing not a type of guitar and different practitioners of shred like different setups
very cool man as long as its not a rust magnet i wont wear plain white tees with this tho
  plug dat bitch in i wanna see sparks
  its metal af bro
  if youve been seeing wider fretboards youre probably seeing something with more than six strings
  at what point does it stop being a guitar and start being a harp
  how much does it weigh and do you have an electrical grounding point on that casing

  i can only imagine its using an electrode or two that is dissolved into the water as you run the torch and after changing the water so many times the electrode simply wont be there anymore since its got a 60day guarantee i suppose the electrode has to last a while weird shit in any case
  that as seen on tv stuff always seems to end up in the clearance bin within a few months so im gonna grab one to rip apart if i ever see it sitting on some back aisle for 10 for 30 though i would rather buy another pair or klein pliers

  any chemistry inclined folks want to tell me a better way to produce hydrogen peroxide sustainably without expensive meme catalysts that can be poisoned read as titanium/iron/nonprecious metals/etc catalysts are ok or without fermenting and distilling absurd amounts of milk 
  well you could try to extract platinum from an automotive catalytic converter
  high surface area for the gas phase means it will be easy to poison and very hard to reactivate salvaged cat converters would have more use to me doing what they were designed to do
  i meant actually extracting it and casting it into a usable form
  came here to say this
bought a new battery for my scooter today and i was suprised to see in 2018 that they would sell the average american a container of sulphuric acid they try and make it as stupid proof as possible but still    oh jesus i was just reminded of anon who oxidized the fuck out of all his tools by working with acid in his shop hopefully i dont come back to a pile of brown and red dust
  it would never be economical also all the literature i can find says the cats used are rutheniumoxide coated titanium more than 3x expensive than silver  i am but a simple chemical engineer the magic of catalyzed reaction paths are a mystery to me so i dont know how to determine what catalyst alternatives would be viable and can only go based on what the research says works   there are some mit niggers that allege to have a principle based methodology for catalyst analysis but those (((antifreedom faggot kikes))) have only done it for five lanthanummetal oxide matrixes and in reality all it is is just ordinary trialanderror electrochemistry    tldr  if a catalyst costs significantly more than titanium i am not interest in using it and will gladly make an absurdly inefficient and bulky setup instead maybe in 5001000 years when we are using star lifting and particle accelerators in barren systems to produce all the meme elements and the memes cost 5 a pound instead of 50000 a pound ill give them consideration
  just google the msds of various brands of drain cleaner and then distill it

  op in his shack
  that guy is an aviation spotter look at the radios stop trying to insult us with the wrong hobby idiot
retarded neophyte here  just got my first sdr ive been playing with it all day chasing random frequencies around the fft graph    started realizing about an hour ago all of these transmissions sound the same and theyre all selfsimilar no matter the frequency band  im almost certain its some sort of interference am i right  if i am how can i figure out whats causing it and how to stop it  pic related
  do you live within a few miles of an fm radio station looks like the same harmonics i get from a mexican music station in the am broadcast band fucking interferes with 160 meters all the way up to 60 meters for me     you might need an fm bandpass filter
  no he is not he monitors sw broadcast in the middle east youre just mad cause his shack is cleaner than your
  you might need an fm bandpass filter  this nooelectric has a decent one for cheap id suggest picking up one of their baluns while youre at it i went through the same ordeal with my rtlsdr v3 until i got these two items
  the closest station to me is just shy of 7 miles i do notice it gets stronger the closer i get to the fm band    how can i tell if something is a spurious signal/interference and an actual intentional radio signal
17 meters has been really active today ive been hearing europe all day long here in new england on my sdr donglefirst time ive seen that band so busy
    theres this tower of sorts about 2 miles away from me its within my line of sight though i think its a cell tower im not sure if it would have any effect    theres also highpower electric lines about a mile from me      im on their site now are we talking about the flamingo fm
  those lines you see will remain narrow and constant when an actual transmission occurs youll see a wider line and the wave form will bounce around more
  i have never heard activity on 17 lovely cw signal from cz at 18071
  are we talking about the flamingo fm  yes   not sure what your plans areor what other equipment you may have but if you want to explore more youre probably going to eventually want an upconverter and the am bandpass filter as well
  
  i bought the rtlsdr v3 too im just a hobbyist doing a computer/electric engineering degree so it sorta goes hand in hand with my major not sure if ill get too serious into ham radio but ill probably at least get my license    ive been looking into an upconverter already since apparently the rtlsdr cant detect shortwave radio signals i think im definitely going to get the fm filter and ill probably get the am filter too i just dont know what all more i need to connect power them and such    i wish i didnt live in a condo so i could put a decent antenna on my roof for now im stuck with the default rtlsdr kit antenna
  i have never heard activity on 17  i hear locals on it every once in a while but ive never heard europe irelandbritainscotlanditalyfrancegermanand lithuania were all nice and loud this afternoon
  not sure if ill get too serious into ham radio but ill probably at least get my license  thats cool i respect anyone willing to put forth the effort involved in getting licensedpersonally i have no interest in speaking over the airwaves so i never bothered but i do tend to feel slightly ashamed about not having one its a great hobby and there is tons to explore in fact theres so much going on tech wise i think the community is not as close as it once was basically all of these different modes have fragmented the circle jerk that ham radio used to be and because of this a lot of people are getting the false impression that the hobby is dying i think the reality is that its growing but its now spread out into more varied formsgood luck
  more people got licensed last year than any other year in history theres currently about 1 million actively licensed ar operators in the us including convicted felon tim allen     t ve
  more people got licensed last year than any other year in history  this would explain some of the insane pileups ive been seeing on certain bands i had been chalking this all up to people simply being assholeswell i guess its to be expected when theres only so much bandwidth to be had
  a big reason for the uptick is the lower cost of the chinese radios making the hobby more affordable and the other reason is doomsday preppers     not that baofengs are decerted from part 90 im not sure whats going to happen
  once the consumer hypnosis is over you will learn what to expect from an 8bit radio with a dynamic range of about 50db without filters both notch and band pass and a good attenuator you will be haunted by the intermodulation products of your own dongle
be me  electronics and antennas are cool  i bet being a ham is fun  get license  nothing but old fucks talking the weather or unlicensed faggots hogging the repeaters for their commutes  check some local net its old people talking about electronics and antennas like they have never seen a resistor before  talk to a ham at work he wont shuttup about all his qc cards and other faggy shit     god ham radio is possibly the gayest hobby i have ever witnessed
  39775 are talking about guns
  i mostly listen in to hear people getting hostile with each other it amuses me that we have these old timers and traditionalists bitching about the filthy talk on 80/75 meters but everyone ignores the fact that contesters get on there and transmit with no regard to the fact that people are already occupying a particular frequency i must have seen this happen at least a dozen times last week during the pennsylvania qso party there were death threats being thrown around at one point obviously if youre out there throwing out your call sign you shouldnt be starting shit with people especially when your name and address are easily looked up on the internet listening to 80/75 is becoming a lot like visiting 4chan
  3995 late at night is a mix of /pol/ and /x/    hilarious
  consumer hypnosis  please elaborate
  yep i was amazed at some of the crap these old guys were saying youd swear they were 4channers last night i listened to a rant that went on for about half an hour consisting almost entirely of the words asshole and pedophile apparently somebody out there doesnt like joe
  nobody likes ac1dd joe k1lem gary the guy calling joe a ped or k9rsy dave the drunk dick
  lol i knew somebody here would know what im talking about
  theyre probably more infamous than the 435 repeater ac1dd is why george noory stopped transmitting on the bands and k9rsy drove art bell from the hobby as well     if smith would get off her ass and enforce the rules on those 3 fucks fines seizure whatever ham would be fucking 1000 better
    yet another step closer to phone mode skimmers becoming a reality  it wont be much longer now and it wont be much longer after that until the band police and serially offended realize they can larp as the nsa and ruin most all ragchew potential on the hf bands too bad vhf and up where range is more limited is mostly dead outside of contests especially if you want to use a mode other than fm
dahdidahdit dahdahdidah    i made myself a fugly iambic key
  unrealistic expectations induced by shiny commercial propaganda
  commercial  propaganda  if by commercial you mean the other hobbyists and with propaganda the hobbyists hyping up the misuse of a cheap tv dongle then yeah  why so paranoid
  oh i figured a 30 sdr wasnt going to be top notch by any stretch of the word  im just too much of a novice to know the limitations i wasnt expecting a local radio station to be able to universally interfere with the damn thing  still much cheaper than the alternatives though ill deal for now
  good read  managing hf signal dynamics and preventing overload with the rtlsdr and kiwisdr receivers  
from what im reading about balun/unun antenna adapters you dont make a loop but just use an open length of wire    now according to  one of the optimal lengths of wire for an unun antenna is 53 feet seeing as how i live in a condo im going to need to be inventive with this    does it need to be 53 feet and straight or will it work as long as its 53 feet and mostly straight so i can route it along my window frame outside or along the gutter etc      thanks for the link this is all making a lot more sense now
  are you transmitting if not you really dont need anything other than a wire no matter the case you will have significantly better reception if you get the wire out away from the house you will be plagued with noise otherwise
  no just receiving  unfortunately im beholden to the hoa so i have to keep the antenna clandestine would trees interfere with the signal
  this
  look up an endfed antenna i think youll need a 91 balun i think they might even sell a kit on ebay or amazon
is this an actual broadcast or interference it sounds like rumbling with intermittent squeaks
  im thinking its another intermodulation artifact i found another just like it    i installed the fm and am bandstop filters and theyre helping but im still getting a lot of these spurious signals
  the united parcel service runs acssb amplitudecompanded single sideband digital voice and data for their network right at 220
  oh so its just an encrypted voice signal
    its qrm you can see the harmonics on both sides as clear as day its off frequency as well
ive uploaded something about antennas to the dump space    light weight  ftp//borgmoe/pub/end_fed_half_wave_antennapdf  medium weight  ftp//borgmoe/pub/all_about_antennaspdf  heavy weight excellent book  ftp//borgmoe/pub/practical_antenna_handbook_5pdf    and heres a podcast for people who like to listen  ham radio workbench hrwb044basic hf antennas highly recommended      image hoacompatible endfed antenna
  if youre looking to how well your sdr works in the hf bands id suggest parking on 4724 usb for a while its the us air force high frequency global communications frequency    they have been chatting almost nonstop for hours now it will let you check your hf reception well
  nothing but then again this is stock im going to need to get an upconverter
  it would be possible to avert this slightly by playing around with 80 or 160 meter nvis at lower powers at around noon plus or minus a couple hours so that the d layer keeps your signal from going to far so long as the person youre worried about listening in doesnt live within a couple hundred miles of you only issue is the lack of activity during those hours because thats a bad time to be on those bands so youre probably going to have a hard time finding people to talk to theres also always cb if you want something shorter range with a similar experience to using the 80 meter band
  ive uploaded something about antennas to the dump space  thanks    a lot was lost when the old ftp went off line did anyone save the contents
  trees wont affect it much you may want to try something like a clothesline or flagpole antenna ive never had good luck with wire antennas run inside or next to the house
can i cover my power bricks and power plug strips with foil to reduce local interference
  you could try ferrite chokes all of my laptops power supplies are so fucking noisy noise floor drops so much when i unplug them all  and turning off leds
  i actually spent a good 15 hours disassembling an ancient desktop power supply to get a recently sized choke for my radios antenna cant say ive noticed too big of a difference    it looks like my laptop chargers have chokes on them but they look pretty small do you know where i could buy large chokes capable of fitting a power cable like the psu one pic related
  ebay amazon or aliexpress or you can rip them out of electronics i have all these on my hf receiver and it doesnt help
  in the near future you will receive automatically generated qsl like cards adorned with pictures of things like the ultimate wackermobile and signed the radio police for iding 10 seconds too late
  how about adding some to other cables too
so im remembering that my copypaste popsicle stick condo wasnt grounded correctly because my guitar amp always buzzed when i tried to play could this housewide miswiring be contributing to my qrm problem how would you even correct for something this big if so    i also notice that in the upper military air band i get extremely strong emi directly correlated with what is on the screen of one of my monitors turning the monitor off reduces but does not eliminate the interference this makes me think the qrms coming from my graphics card would covering the interior of my computer case with copper foil tape help reduce this
  i have others on my laptops power supply but that does nothing i have an ic7300 so i can watch the noise floor drop when i unplug the laptop power supply ive tried a few different ps all seemed to be the same i know my laptop is low end and older but i see videos of people using computers next to their rigs all the time getting a bit confused here
  indoor antenna poor grounding
desu im starting to think all this money im dropping on fighting emi might be better spent just getting a better receiver than an rtlsdr
  all the antennas are outside it might be the grounding i know i have electrical issues in the house in some places when i walk around with a cheaper handheld i get terrible interference just sets the radio off
  terrible interference  maybe someone uses plc and poisons the mains wiring it looks like pic wideband emi
    wtf do i do with a ifr 1600s    goddamn the interface sucks an hp/tek/anyone interface 10 years older is better    at least it has a af/rf gen 1ghz spectrum analyzer 1mhz wtf bandwidth scope dmm
  plugged in
  unplugged
  i get interference like that if i use the dvr out on my ts590sg for me its a local am radios station fucks with me in all bands up to 20 meters
someone gave me a 91 unun and id like to make an end feed antenna for it resonant on 60 30 and 15 my g5rv doesnt tune up on those bands whats the shortest wire i can get away with for that
i managed to get a 5db reduction in floor noise 50 to 55 by wrapping my rtlsdr in foil and then grounding the foil to a metal window frame
if i just want to mess around with sdr is any cheap ebay rtl2832  812 fine
  
  sure but this is whats gonna happen  
  commercial propaganda  theres a word for that anon its called advertising i understand youre trying to sound smart and redpilled but please stop
    alternatively you can get a better antenna
my fav
  do you have a net an you could put that glorious contraption on
  i actually spent a good 15 hours  you got powdered iron core and not a ferrite one  its kind of pointless unless you placebo will do
  how does one tell this difference
  son of a bitch no wonder it didnt do anything
the legendary wullenweber seems quite straightforward with monopoles and screens the epic krug has a few more gothic elements on the screen what are the functions of this    if i had the area i would have built a cdaa    
  i like making antennas and trying many things with vhfuhf propagation    but most people arent worth talking to i get more out of sending memes on sstv
  this    in 1970s every faggot in town was all about cb because it saved phonecalls general chitchat about radios and fagshit  in 1980s the very same faggots went for 2m or 100 watts on 27mhz counting pathetic qsls and bragging about equipment and tubes and shit they never used and never knew how they worked  in 1990s those who werent sick about cb banter were all about buying some gigantic radio shack in order to have some hurr durr international banter  by early 2000s everyone in town stopped talking about radios and ham and shit  2010s a very few oldtimers came out again and organized a hamfest that is a chink market selling chinese trinkets to hurr durr ham radio enthusiasts who only had 2nd hand uv5r shit    last guy bragging about a cw qso someone in early 1980s  last guy using a homemade antenna someone in early 1980s  last guy keeping his shack on at least one hour a day early 1990s  last guy telling me something like omg this also does 50 mhz yestrday i bet hell never actually use it
  there still doing there just breaked
  what does this even mean
  if you want native resonances then it is about 28m the halfwave length for 60m impedance at the end is in the kω range many people suggest a transformer with a 61 to 81 turns ratio for a 50ω coax feed theres an interesting equal impedance point for all three bands at about 935m which could be a suitable feed point for your 31 transformer if you want to transmit you still may need a tuner and you will always need either a good rf ground connection or a counterpoise there is no single pole antenna system
been away for a while  digging out my old stuff  cant find my mic pic related  anyone know where i can source one cheaper  its alinco dr140tq  rj45 style plug    thanks
  i always assumed there was a way to put other connectors on but im not sure about that
anyone working on any projects currently building a few ladder line jpoles to give out to some new members at the next meeting   im wondering if i should put them all inside pvc with a bulkhead connector on the end and give them out that way but im not sure if everyone would have the space to put that up
  i might have to but im trying to avoid that  radio also has a wonky volume knob  maybe im better off buying a new used rig
  you take it apart yet
  no i think its the potentiometer thats bad the knob doesnt seem removable  im gonna see if i can find more info on it
  id get a used yeasu or icom in the meantime and rip it apart to fix once you do hopefully you can fix it
  i also found my vx5r got it charging right now how itll key up  im kinda to poor for new gear right now  babies are cute but expensive
  i hear ya im saving to buy some land but ive found some awesome deals on gear and older hams have helped me out  being part of a club can be real great
  yeah when i was younger i was way involved  ive moved now and theres no club in my area
  good action id say pvc tube for stationary/outdoor naked twin lead for portable/indoor hanging from a tree or the ceiling theres also an open stub version mentioned in the arrl antenna book pic left and the open stub slim jim variant with a closed connection at the top of the twin lead
  most of the cool cats have moved on to the digital modes and kept up with technologythey get their gear from ebay or other internet marketsthey converse online   the majority of old fucks you see at hamfests are people who are trapped in the 1980s and think there is nothing more then fm/ssb phone
  got any info for a diy 144/440 antenna  im thinking maybe a dual jpole  input/suggestions
how active are you guys local repeaters its rare for me to ever hear any conversation besides the morse code identifier every few minutes
  i have two dozen repeaters and on some i have never heard anyone and others are usually active at drive time and have evening events/nets
  ive been monitoring again lately and the 3 i can reach and dead quite its kinda sad
  the fm ones are a ghost town around me the linked dmr ones always have something going on though during rush hour i actually run in to busys trying to access our local site     here is the live netwatch of a few networks       
ive never run dmr  googled it didnt seem to help my understanding  got a link
  you can use direct sampling mode on your v3 to receive shortwave 
  this is a little dated but i guess it is a start it would be better to have a local guy actually demo it in action to really understand what is going on       its digital radio 2 slot tdma so 2 users can use the same frequency at the same time it also supports text messaging and with ip linking you can easily link repeaters together its very much like trunking radio where you have talkgroups which are kinda like chatrooms on an irc server when you connect to a repeater and key up on a specific talkgroup the repeater will start broadcasting that 1 talkgroup for you     so bob in nyc can be on talkgroup tac310 and jimmy in philly can also be on tac310 and talk to each other though the network if only those to guys are on the tac310 talkgroup then only those 2 repeaters that they are actually on will broadcast their conversation the rest of the repeaters in the network wont carry their traffic and be free to carry other talkgroups also your radio will ignore traffic from other talkgroups you are not tuned to     so your 1 local repeater could have access to tons of different talk groups around the state country or world if you program your radio right you wont even have to worry about selecting repeaters the radio will roam like a cellphone from repeater to repeater automatically you just select the talkgroup and go and with tdma 2 guys can use the same repeater on 2 different talkgroups and not interfere with each other     there are also local talkgroups that do not go out on the network so you could talk with someone locally and not have it be heard statewide simplex is also possible
  this definitely helped  thanks you
  how does one tell this difference  color marking  yellow with a white stripe is a mix 26 it has low al value and as such the winding will have low inductance and youll get bad attenuation of hf/rf noise
  arent those colors totally manufacturerspecific
  whats a good starter radio  i see some used stuff and some stuff made my yty
  arent those colors totally manufacturerspecific  most manufactures adhere to the common coloring scheme  even chinese do that sure thing not every manufacturer but most of them do  i
  check the faq it covers this briefly either a crystal radio or rtlsdr
  rtlsdr is receive only isnt it
    after having a th9800 i would stay away from tyt    greatly disappointed by the lack of features that youd think would be obvious that other radios even chinese brands would have    thing had busy channel lockout enabled all the time with no way to disable it the radio had no vox function they frequency steps for 900mhz recieve were lacking they could have extended the band to recieve broadcast links and maybe have wideband recieve for that but didnt
    did they decert all baofengs    we kinda dont need certification anyways    it is more of a technicality for sales like dot certification for car parts    is it an extension of trade war with pr china
    i like fm for the voice quality    dmr makes you sound like a drunk microsoft sam    i wish stuff like the icom 1200mhz data radios would have became more popular    we have so much ghz bandwidth that can be used for data that nobody gives a fuck about    you have a hard time telling half the people out there we have spectrum above 2m    they think 70cm is only for short range repeaters and even mentioning using that it can be used for simplex is so alien to them
  i remember when 2 meters what poppin  club i was in even did sstv on 2 meters every saturday night    fast forward i pull out my radio 2m/70cm totally dead minus yesterday one did comms for a marathon  cool
  we kinda dont need certification anyways  a ham radio license is not a carte blanche   welcome to the twilight zone
  correct
  dmr makes you sound like a drunk microsoft sam  the 90 chink radios like the tyt md380 sound bad on dmr but they are very popular on our networkyou just get used to it after a wilethe higher end tait motorola kenwood etc stuff all sound fine and that really isnt surprising since dmr is a mature product in the commercial lmr radio world the chinks and hams are still new to it they are sounding better with each revision though  another cool thing about dmr that wasnt mentioned is it supports ipv4/ipv6 networking in the latest spec i have yet to see any amateur networks play with that but i am sure it will come i know txting is popular at least now   we have just about all of lower new england covered and linked on 70cm dmr some states have statewide portable coverage  2m is a fucking wasteland all the repeater pairs are taken up by boomers with their old analog repeaters that do nothing but id every once in a while with that dumb 1980s robot voice they are worse then domain squatters just sitting there unused like zombies taking up spectrum and tower sites       whats a good starter radio  tyt md380 is what everyone starts with to get their feet wetthey are so popular they are now on amazon prime they suck but they work and since they are so popular you can easily find a codeplug local programing to copy in to yours form someone around you i run old xpr4000 series motorola gear kinda a pain to get in to but i like the sound and build quality
  so how can i program my baofeng uv5r so that i can have all frs and scan all of the frs i didnt wanna end up scanning every channel to bad i dont make any since  be me want to scan all the frs freq   but not have the other channels be scanned  their is so many freq for the frs was wanting to see if i could hear anyone using a walmart walkie talkie but still have my baofeng to use  radio reference is a bit confusing only shows like 3 freq for my local emergency crew however my dad has a damn scanner that can scan all of the freq like wtf
  use chirp but that thing scans so fucking slow
  thanks for the info  im in massachusetts and theres basically no activity in my area so im looking for somewhere to get active
  i head up to the cape a few times a year i thought it was strange that they have a bunch of frs repeaters   id like to put up a 2m/440 yagi to hit the mainland
  idk if youll find much more action  only action ive heard was a town on cape running comms for runners   youd probably have to hit boston or providence to find some life
  there were to that were pretty active i think it was closer to the beginning of the cape because i was having trouble making it with my hand held need to put an decent antenna up there
  massachusetts  nice i talk to dudes in ma all the time they are   connected to the national dmrmarc system   for live activity see    their website has everything you need to get a tyt on their network 
  i guess i should save up and get a new radio  looking that way anyway since i cant find my mic and my radio is ancient  i saw a tyt model escapes me but it also did 144/440  is tyt really junk or would it be worth investigating in something like that so i can work different modes
  is tyt really junk  yes but they work on dmr and are super popular so finding help would be easy people even made hacked firmware to make them suck less if you want to get your feet wet in digital and dont want to deal with used crap they are the cheapest way in the only major issue i found with the tyts is i could never get them to work simplex their timing sucks and they need to listen to another signal before transmitting to get in sync their drifty timing is where that drunk microsoft sam sound comes from getting a fm only 2m/440 rig will just lead to you getting board and dropping the hobby quickly imo analog above 50mhz is dead and not coming back
  its a tyt9600 144/440 anaolog and digital modes    so dmr is the upgrade of irlp when you had to use a million tones to get to someone  is that even still a thing lol  im gonna have to do some more research i guess
  so dmr is the upgrade of irlp when you had to use a million tones to get to someone  no its a digital mode and a bunch of other protocols its something that was around in the commercial world that hams adopted i think it took off big time because it is an open spec icom yeasu and kenwood gimped digital ham radio for years with their own patented and all incompatible digital modes like dstar that greed is where a lot of hostility to digital comes from with hams   and speaking of ma i just remembered about pave paws you _need_ to get a dual band radio because 440 is restricted in parts of mass you cant get by with just an md380 440 only radio pave paws is a radar system in eastern mass and thats why there are no high powered 440 repeaters there also something with otis afbs radar
  its a tyt9600 144/440 anaolog and digital modes    should be no problem
  ive never heard of that  also never actually run a repeater so idk what kinda power theyre running  i always figured 2m was more bang for your buck since you still had some atmosphere advantage
  i think near mass they dont use 2m digital because of some interference to military bases
  ohhh now i gotcha  makes sense the navy has spots all over the state  duxbury and the navy just came to some kind of agreement to expand cell service in the area  navy wasnt having it for years
  its 440 ham is secondary on 440 to the military   really only an issue for repeater owners   
ham is dead
  yeah i remembered there was a reason i wanted a dualband dmr  i have the hd1 believe its made by retrevis but it reads ailunce battery life is incredible and pretty easy to navigate
  i have the hd1  i never heard of it but i just googled it and it looks solidlike a clone of the newer moto xpr portables does that support dmr tier 2 thats required to get on the big networks iirc
i normally monitor the merica channel maybe ill catch you fags there
  ill have to look i monitor 91 most of the time
  ill have to look  it must if your on 91 thats on that big ass brandmeister network
  its world wide i think 310 is the other big one  where are you pulling these pictures from
387300 is /pol/ right now
  that pic is just from brandmeisters website   the other ones are from  and 
  brah already used chirp i dont get how i could scan from all of the frs starting with the first freq to the last freq for frs be pretty damn dumb to have to add each freq to a channel
  kek i just tuned there and it sounds like they are signing off for the night ill check back tomorrow
  wish i had my antennas up worked on them today but it got dark before i could drag them back up    ill have to check it out just getting into dmr a bit confusing but its pretty neat    im pretty sure thats exactly what you need to do its all just frequencys channels are there just to make it easier for people    /pol/ needs a freq
  /pol/ needs a freq  69007000 is always full of no id pirates
  i live pretty close to a lot of hams and i havent modded my radio yet  that would be a pretty big yagi
  yagi   a simple g5rv wire antenna and a tuner can go anywhere 80m and above
  nothing my other wire tennas cant do
iss has been talking to kids pretty often wish i had an antenna to talk to them that would be pretty neat
  wish i had an antenna to talk to them  they are on vhf/uhf its not hard to make a simple antenna for that     also the aprs digipeter is always on that is really easy to connect to   
  very short passes wwwheavensabovecom tells you when to listen
  i just usually have the scanner on and i can hear it come by theres a guy that lives a few towns over that does sat comms and he has an antenna that reminds me of a tie fighter really neat to watch it move i dont think i would ever be able to afford something like that much less put one together  wish i could talk to the guy but hes a giant cunt
  an antenna that reminds me of a tie fighter  weird can you take a picture and post it here
    sounds more like satellite or moon bounce
  ill try its pretty far in the middle of nowhere    im guessing it is pretty sure its 2 phased yagis  it just looks fucking cool i cant imagine how much the tracking systems cost im too stupid to build my own quite a bummer im not too interested in satcomms but talking to the iss would be really neat
  im no expert but my understanding is moon bounce is a little easier but a good stepping stone  theres a guy near me that does all that even has a club for it he help a local school contact the iss a couple years ago  its pretty rad but i dont have the time or money
elecraft k4 when they have retired old kits due to being unable to source old parts and this will only progress i think k1 and k1x are gone k2 is not that much promoted i guess that is the next to go    and i guess k4 will have to be capable of 2200 m operations
  thats pretty awesome seems like a lot of work to set all that up though
any of yall know their way around hardware and specifically cabling    im looking at installing a cellular repeater in a remote site behind a hill or two i havent measured it yet but im looking at probably close to 400ft of cabling length to run out the top of the house up the side of the hill and then up a 40ft tower on top im looking at 7/8 heliax hard line which should get me a cable loss of around 68db at 1900mhz  the thing is the kit comes with about 100ft of lmr400 it will work fine with the heliax right i just put on n type ends and connect it up like normal or am i completely retarded   otherwise to clear the hill i need about a 100ft tower
  well dang i went out and surveyed the site again and im not going to get signal im not even getting the 2100mhz from the tower no matter where i go i mean the kit could pick up the signal maybe better then my phone but its not going to make something out of almost nothing i also measured the run to be 525ft   that leaves me with a different carrier and now i can just focus on 700900mhz but at least i can go with a less optimal location and use a lot less cable may even get away with lmr400 hopefully
  do you have a direct line of sight los in that case you might look into optical links such as ronja    i live near a giant power distribution site with countless sources of nose i also have a los to a 600 m tall mountain top that might be interesting for a qrp setup
  wait so is there a way i can convert the rf to optical like fiber and then back to rf
  sure it is all just data transfer data digitally and you are golden
  even in the cable on the way to the antenna because thats where i need to extend it i cant reverse engineer the unit that does the signal boosting    i did find exactly what i need they make them for cell towers so they can run fiber up them instead of large cabling but i cant imagine it would be cheaper than 15000
  ethernet cables are used to transmit digital data sure there is an analogue signal that can be measured but the interfaces encode/decode between digital data and analogue high speed data for the physical layer    most use unshielded twisted pair and 300 m is quite feasible
hi total brainlet here i found this article about a hombrew antijamming antenna     and i have a question would a setup like this reduce interference on transmissions that are not being jammed would this improve signal quality at all
  improve signal quality at all  if so then including the quality of the jamming
  yes a containment frequency      never mind the equipment manufacturers its those xmbe merchants and their patents that ruin the ability to legitimately homebrew digital gear without a 40 preprogrammed pic or whatever
  sstv  not sending memes in waterfall
in en82 using shittier 1m whip antenna and plebtier hackrf one with a broadcast am trap ft8 on 40m was hopping during greyline hours first time ive been able to pull any hf with this rig      its just highly directional the wider the angle between the axis of the desired signal and the axis of the jamming signal/noise the better a directional antenna will serve you      1bit graphics  2018  how many layers of meme are you on
  same grid here without that am trap do you pick up that fucking mexican radio station about every 1000 khz up to around 30 meters
  trap out i heard it at 31009khz just now loud and clear didnt see it up the dial but the hrf1s lo doesnt go below 5mhz anyway it acts like a mixing product maybe you need a few more ferrites  trap in i see nothing on waterfall hear only the faintest shadows of it  pic related my trap is just a 4thorder butterworth highpass filter at 35mhz ill worry about 80m once i can pull in 40m comfortably  btw pen knife and copper adhesive tape on fr4 is a comfy way to do smd 9/10 would build again
  i only get when i have the drv on ts590sg set to ant out for my panadapter if ant out is off i dont get the signal i wish i knew how to resolve that
  how many layers of meme are you on  all of them here have some more bits  
  ill try its pretty far in the middle of nowhere  is it large enough to be seen on google maps
  are you me
why is this thread still here
  because your fathers a turkey baster and your mother smelled of elderberries
another antenna book  ftp//borgmoe/pub/antenna_toolkit_2pdf
it really puts the screws to my thumbs trying to buy a used radio when everyone is knocking 20 bucks off of msrp and i can buy a new radio for 500 bucks and have a perfectly functional radio  i have to be blind or does no one else have anything in the same price range as the alincos
the falcon 9 has been lifted upright at launch pad 39a under gloomy skies at the kennedy space center liftoff is scheduled for 346 pm est 2046 gmt     eshail 2 carries the first amateur radio payload to fly in geostationary orbit    
  i recently got this bad boy was looking to get a receiver as i enjoy listing to shortwave but i couldnt pass this thing up one of the best decisions ive made    geostationary orbit  where will it be above hope im home in time to see liftoff man that would be really neat to see in person
  i recently got this bad boy  what advantages does it have over the elecraft range elecraft has a comparison chart that might just possibly be a little biased in the selection i dont know
  where will it be above  2530e
never change 3860
hey guys total brainlet here    i like to listen to stations transmitting on the longwave band but the reception on any portable i could find is absolutely horrible    i am planning to build a loop to improve reception but i dont have a variable capacitor i was wondering if it would be possible to build a fixed ie nontunable loop for a specific frequency i would like to have three or four different loops for different frequencies so i dont have to tune them    is this doable or am i just retarded
  are you confined to an apartment or do you have land
  i was wondering if it would be possible to build a fixed ie nontunable loop for a specific frequency  yes that is possible mind you it is also possible to use a fixed capacitor with a variable inductor
  if you are building a loop then why not have a go at building a capacitor its just two metal combs/fingers that slide in and out of each other but never touch must be to find some tutorials on it its very simple idea
  not him but loop antennas can involve high voltages and for that reason people prefer to use vacuum capacitors
  hes not transmitting rx only
  not op but would two blank fr4 pc boards pressed against each other make an appropriate and workable cap for a qrp tx loop
  as an alternative you could build a channel selector with half a dozen trimcaps selected by a rotary switch which you tune once for each channel and forget
sorta related question  got a cb radio in a car standard euro frequencies  i need an antenna that wont stand out needs to look sort of oem  any helical or something i can buy
anyone have experience with rf grounding afloat im installing an icom m802 with a backstay antenna for my dad but the atu is in the lazarette and i cant find a metallic throughhull in the aft the previous grounding solution was apparently a now badly decayed mess of copper strapping connecting to anything metal on the boat but id really like to avoid the time and expense of running a bunch of copper through the hull but my dad wont bite on a dynaplate even though the boat is being hauled and wont let me just run a strip through an aft hatch and into the water when we need the ssb
  just buy a variable capacitor from ebay theres tons of them pair up a couple of them if needed
  thats actually a great idea not op by the way but thanks
ac1dd is being a total faggot on 3860 right now laura smith need to be fired for not fining this guy

  come on someone with a tx say something about imitation crab meat
  i would but my wire is covered in ice and i cant get my tuner to drop below 31 on the swr it amazes me how many people dont realize that that voice is joe
  god i wish that was me
3910 theyre discussing cp pics they sent each other wtf
hey guys so i have a question i recently got into radio frequencies with arduino i picked up rtlsdr usb dongle a while back i wanted to actually capture my cars key fob i looked up the fcc id that is inside my key fob and i am curious do i listen for the preamble or do i listen for wake  dead time  preamble  sync  encrypt  fixed etc    here is the link to what i am talking about      is there a easier way to read radio signals in binary from a audio file audacity seems like what everyone uses but to be honest it doesnt work for me
  reading over this thread slowly getting enthused about a new hobby  says i can talk to iss i assume crew members    please introduce me into this world do i really need to get a licence usa what are the ramifications if i dont can this all be accomplished for less than 100 if i build it all by hand
  i live in an apartment so it would have to be put indoors      okay so i opened a cheap am/fm radio i had laying around and it has this inside thats a variable capacitor right do you think i could desolder this and use it
  this radio was absolute dogshit and i think i know why one of the three legs of this thing was broken this was supposed to be soldered like the other two but it was cut in half by who knows what    could i still use this for a loop antenna or is it totally broken
  better check how it works with a multimeter with capacitance function if you dont have one you might check the area for a ham that might assist it takes just seconds to check    you really want to know the max and min values for the capacitance
  thanks a lot for your help anon just another question as im really curious about this    the cheap chink radio from which i got the capacitor worked like shit it had a selectivity so bad that a single station covered like half the entire mw band    according to this article  the ferrite antenna should be connected to the c4 and middle pins however on this radio the ground cable of the ferrite antenna was connected to the c1 pin which according to the article is reserved for the fm antenna     could this be the reason why this radio was so shitty i cant believe that the chinks that designed this radio made such an obvious mistake
  how do start completely legal pirate station without being triangulated
  dont broadcast if youre emitting your locatable period
  hard to tell my guess is that the subsequent intermediate frequency stage had too wide bandwidth    if that one am station was local it might have swamped the bandpass filters in that case you might need a notch filter to reject that one station      transmitter are normally easily located it takes specialised skills to avoid that a far better solution is to make an internet radio that makes it easier to attract a wider audience and old broadcasts can be made available as podcasts
  nsa/fcc have stations that can triangulate a broadcast in a matter of seconds
  i dont think they are interested in petty pirates the fcc has outsourced part of the snitching to the arrl oo official observer service  
  hak5 has a bunch of videos about this on youtube
  and shannon has some huge milkers
  id just like to say this is post 225
  i ended up buying a doorbell from the store and mess with that first also hak5 its ustgoing to be about yard stick one and using gnu radio or rf cat or whatever    i will figure it out slow and steady
radio related but not ham related how much use does cb ssb see ive been monitoring channels 3640 on both lsb and usb for the past few days with an rtlsdr with the squelch set about 2 db above the noise floor and havent even had the squelch open and the scanner software stop theres generally quite a bit of normal am activity on the other channels around here though
bored of ft8 and cw already need some new digital modes to listen to any suggestions preferably on 80m
  have you mastered high speed morse yet
  the only time ive found people on ssb was shooting skip on the east side of the rockies i live in the west but as soon as i passed colorado channels 3640 were lit the fuck up with people from all over the country and south of the border forgot if it was mostly upper or lower sideband think it was both though that kept going on for a few hours cb is so much more active on the east half the country its fucking dead everywhere im at unless youre offroad talking to offroaders or catch the truckers going through and not many of them use cb anymore i keep it scanning while im driving all the time never have picked up sideband chatz around me i have a 63 antenna sticking out of the roof of my car hoping when i get my ham license i can at least adjust it and get good 10 meter chat maybe that will be more active
welp i guess contesting this season is over
bump
  erm why
  yeah i kind of agree but this is partly imho because they eliminated the code requirement partly because its too easy to just buy everything and everyone wants moonbounce nao  that and the mystique is kind of gone because you can talk dx on the internet like its nothing
  distributed low power transmitters that randomly cycle on and off  but why every tinfoil faggot on earth has a youtube channel
  i dont think they are interested in petty pirates  historically thats been the case but in the last few years the fcc has been cracking down on illegal stations in a big way if the lpfm initiative wasnt made of fail and aids this wouldnt be the issue it is
id just like to say that this is post 237
  i have this diy 60s kit shortwave tube radio given to me by someone it works and picks up one or two am stations at best is something like this even good enough to pick up any interesting signals
  anything from the 60s is probably going to have dead capacitors and weak tubes if it hasnt been restored but if its working fine you could listen to all sorts of stuffbut being a regenerative set it a bit tricky to learn how to tune if youre a noob     
  neat ill check that out so far it works fine i check out the internals caps seem to be okay even though they are wax/paper tube  kind  worst case i either salvage the vacuum tubes or give it to a radio bro
  nicely done been using an airspy hf and actually had to take my filters out my biggest issue is antenna now
  one more thing im just using whatever internal antenna the unit has do i have to use a fancy outdoor antenna to pick up the good stuff
  you can probably use an alligator clip attached to that antenna and just run a long wire outside
  small untuned rx loop sdr users haunted by local qrm and overload problems should give it a try before anything else details at 
      cool ill try it out this weekend would be nice to pick up some interesting stuff
on wednesday spacex is launching a shitton of small satellites on the ssoa mission included in this is fox1cliff which will have an amateur radio repeater onboard also flying is pwsat2 if you can receive frames from it you can win a contest     launch thread is up on /sci/ if youre interested  
  whoops 
  local qrm  can confirm nulling out the shack computer feelsgoodman  overload  cant really confirm or deny my loop has an amp on it      ragchew about death metal on 39675 rn
  also there is a contest to listen to the eseo signal you can win a shirt 
  loop has an amp on it  interesting is it a symmetric amp can you post the circuit diagram
  yes get your license stiff fines and other penalties if you dont and get caught even if you dont get caught youre going to stick out like a sore thumb and nobody will want to make contact with you    100 could go a long way with some ingenuity    im blown away by the sheer number of my fellow massholes ive seen in this thread any of you lurk 2m/440 repeaters in the state any particularly active ones seems like nearly every one i can hit near my home or work is dead but get some decent contacts at the xyls place
  yep this one built with 2n3904s connected to a 2turn loop of 22awg stranded hookup wire
hot news    ftp//collectivecomputersorg21212/books/cyberpunk/tech/ is back and all the files are there from what i can see    please make backups in case it falls off the net again
  plymouth county here  i monitor a couple 2m/440s 90 dead  ive heard a weekly net and some running event
  thank you
what kind of batteries do you guys have your hf transceivers running off of  i have a bit of extra money now so im thinking of upgrading from my baomeme to a proper hf setup im purely interested in ham for the shtf so the rig i get has to be able to run off the grid ive looked at some of the qrp transmitters like the yaesu ft818 but people are saying that qrp is a terrible first transceiver since its so difficult to work with low power
  graylock is active
  thanks but i dont believe i have the capability to hit that from my area yet
  ive gotta agree with this about 90 of activity i hear is weekly nets its a damn shame that theres repeaters sitting there idle with nobody even bothering to put a call out let alone return one
  seriously  ive monitored for hours at a time ive called  havent got a single contact since i got some of my stuff up and running    now im studying for general and thinking of trying dmr  maybe ill have more luck elsewhere
  car batteries are fine and widely available postshtf  outboard hf amps can be homebrewed or built from kits
46 to go
  so does anyone build analog receivers/transmitters anymore or is everything sdr    when i was a kid i was going to get into amateur radio even got taken to a couple arrl meetings soon as my paranoid mother found out id be talking to strangers over the radio that was the end of that didnt stop me from trying to build receiviers and transmitters out of junk parts from old tv sets though all tube
      soldersmokecom            sparkbangbuzzcom  the easy 10 transmitter has never failed me
kawaii
  simple way to double the operating range

  monitoring
so i recently decided repair an old gypsy guitar from my grandmas attic   ive been sanding the fucker for the last few days because the thing was initially finished with some sort of oil which became shit after 20 years in the attic luckily my grandfather was awesome and took the strings off before kicking the bucket so the neck is in relatively good shape  anyways the tuning machines are a nightmare pic related  the b and d keys are bent and it looks pretty shit is there any way to get them back in shape would baking soda paste make it shiny again  what do /diy/
  yes and no it would be very difficult to bend them back without destroying the buttons especially old plastic buttons as those look to be and removing them is iffy since they may never go back on tuners of this age rarely work at all well i would wait to string up the guitar and see if they are even worth messing with just because they turn well without strings on them does not mean they will turn at all once they have the string tension pulling on them    they are cheap tuners meant to go together quick and easy not really meant to be repaired
  here is what id do if i were you    id take 0000 fine steel wool and squirt the whole thing with wd40 and scrub the thing until its all shiney    rotate the gears and scrub in between the gears careful not to leave strands of steel wool in the gears    when youre satisfied that everything is clean and everything is turning great take compressed air and blow it dry    after youre done all that glob a little bit of pasty lube into the gears and work them into the gearing system    boom good to go for many years
lift the tabs and the covers will come right off then you can steel wool brasso whatever to clean the parts the entire assembly will come apart  the shafts can easily be straightened hell you can remove the plastic buttons by heating the shaft and pulling if need be same for reinstalling them  failing anything these style of tuners can be replaced similar styles where used on old harmonys and teiscos and the like nowadays they get tossed on those cheap kids acoustics at wally world
  generally the old plastic buttons will not go back on once you remove them the hole is no longer undersized but the same size as the shaft they often deform as well since the are in contact with the shaft for the entire time you are heating them up instead being stuck on a hot shaft that is immediately allowed to cool down
does anyone know where i can buy newsprint paper to print zines/comic books
  i think it usually comes in those giant 2 ton rolls
go to any local newspaper and ask if they have scraps or waste paper you can have hell just dumpster dive behind the building
im trying to figure out what to make out of some of my scrap supplies i have  several sq yards of tiling  30 lbs of pla scraps  55 gallon drum of used motor oil   5 gallon water jug full of half eaten rubber bands  several truckloads of wood scrap from boards to beams    what should i make
  why are you eating rubber bands theres no nutrition there
  i dont understand what youre asking
chop up the wood into cubes to make reclaimed wood cutting boards  melt down pla to use as glue to glue it together  use rubber bands to hold it together while glue sets  give it a nice finish with a few coats of motor oil to add that nice shade of brown
  i use my pallets that i cant burn for that and sell them on etsyany other ideas
filter oil to remove solids use to lubricate stuff instead of can spray lube keep a rag so you dont stain your doors and hinges black i started using used oil for lubing everyday squeaks feels good not having to buy spray lube for a squeaky gate or door paint a coating on seasonal tools so they dont corrode every time you need a little bit of slip go for the oil youll be surprised how well it works
   gallon drum of used motor oil    ashes to ashes  dust to dust    put it back where it came from
  are you the asshole that sold my mom a toxic cutting board she wound up in a coma in the hospital for 3 days fuck you op
  dont do this  it will create mustard gas
  build a giant wooden horse that you can ride on and shit used oil on your enemies
    not leaving your doors and gates squeaky so no one can sneak up on you    only i know the technique of opening them up with out squeaks so i can sneak up on people
  make a dog house
what is this type of clip called if you squeeze the ring part the two ends pinch something
  fish clip
  spring band hose clamp    kek
spring band clamp i think
      but retarded bepis tier op said you squeeze the ring and the ends pinch     i think you two are right and op is beyond help
  its the shitty oem clamps you cut off with dykes and replace with better hose clamps
  but retarded bepis tier op said you squeeze the ring and the ends pinch    sorry i meant to say if you squeeze the ring the ends come apart in its normal/neutral state the ends stay pinched    op
  rippy tippy squeeze n clippy
you mean something like this but in metal i know the type but i dont know what they are called
  fish clip
    yes thanks    op
ive been thinking of constructing my own house using a shipping container or three as a base  has anyone here done this
  i built a container house out of wooden pallets
  use 4 a box layout so you can have an interior courtyard thats private
  i built a wooden pallet out of containers
ive been thinking of constructing my own shipping container using a house or three as a base  has anyone here done this
  so far as i can tell its not any cheaper than wood and nails house any particular reason you want to use containers
  it sounds like a good idea to me i had thought of that myself once as to why because they are made of steel
  the steel container will be the foundation  im not sure i understand  fyi if you will be doing any living in any of those steel containers enjoy your heat stroke
  1 ants wont eat it nor termites nor rats     2 it will survive a tornado     3 he wont have to deal with a retarded framers     4 life free of moldtm    101 and when he is tired of his house he always can get a dollar for the cost of the scrap metal    welcome to 21 century gramp
  fyi if you will be doing any living in any of those steel containers enjoy your heat stroke    nothing that 6 inch of insulation outside cant take care of     go for it op
    oh look its this meme again
  there does seem to be a fair amount of legitimate reasons for container houses it also makes it a lot easier to do yourself as you dont have to try and lift frames and trusses and shit
  wow that sounds genius i cant believe no one ever thought of making buildings from steel
    your pic  survive a tornado
  shipping containers a though     now image how your thin shit shed would look like if we put it beneath the mountain of metal and goods from pic related    containers are chad of construction deal with it
imagine kowloon walled city but with shipping containers instead of concrete houses
  comfy
  yyeah containers are ttotally strong guys  just look at this picture  ignore the crushed containers at the bottom but look how not damaged the top containers are  the edges of containers are enforced so they can stack  they are not structurally solid 360    they can work if you put efford into them though
  im no expert but would it not be a good idea to live in a cylinder shaped shipping container rather than a square shaped one
  i guess that would really only work for subs though where the pressure is all around most of the time pressure on the top only would squash it
  heres inside of my pallet house
        heres outside
  what if you lived in a triangle shaped shipping container with   pointy end up  some kinda iron collartie reinforcment of the sides  one beam going across would probably not be enough to suffice though you would probably have to have a more complex arrangment
  also if you gonna bury this thing you may wanna consiter reminder i am no expert  frost line  air ventilation  will you be installing a toilet and if so how is the plumbing gonna work  im not sure if you will have to worry about flooding or not but if you do and you build in the wrong place you might have to worry about drowning in your own house
  also will the feds even let you
  actually looks pretty cool anon
  it can and will rust over the years  you can still truss it to shed water or snow   you can still install furring strips in place of framing to hang drywall inside    youre not saving money you dont have to deal with anyone if you /diy/ so whats the point
  its literally cheaper to build with traditional framing and it will last longer
  heres more
    roof inside
container houses are more than legitimate   more solid than wooden houses   no ants nor termites   no knowledge in structures needed only a list of donts dont remove a complete side without ipn   same price    the only con i have with that is ceiling height even for high cube too low for me
    rust over the years    corten steel makes its own thin rust layer which protects it from external threats
      rust over the years    corten steel makes its own thin rust layer which protects it from external threats    also insulation from outside will remove any risk of humidity attacking steel pu foam
  rust  this is largely preventable and is still easier to deal with than mold and wood rot
  ive heard shipping container buildings actually cost more after all is said and done that regular houses due to extra support needing to be added when holes are cut for windows or doors ect
  touch the walls to hard  house rolls away
  it depends where you live in europe you have to build a solid house no american wooden  paper sheet thin  walls you must also call an architect to make plans and structure calculations  if you dont diy yes it costs more if you diy where you couldnt have diy a brick house it way cheaper doesnt need architect and workers
  in order to get decent r value you will need a massive insulation blanket from the outside     so no place for rust here    also marine proof steel will probably last at least 100 years even if put into salt water and shit
  ignore the crushed  crushed    two out of 200 all the other are leaning almost horizontally without even breaking their joints under the pressure of the others     containers withstand even the abnormal loads and perform fantastic especially when used on purpose     containers are chad deal with it
  heres inside of my pallet house    nice house cletus
  ahh yes i always hit up my shipping container constructor certified friend whenever i need a small gig or to help out another friend i cant wait until i get my container certification then ill be helping hundreds of people build their new homes
    noice  those signs add so much sophistication      google for seabox containers choose some with living interiors options check the shipping price
  i contained a pallet in a wooden ship
  
  in a shitty thread about a meme subject this is one if the better answers it would be one hell of a dark shady courtyard unless you live in a place with direct overhead sunlight but could be a useful space to situate plumbing etc
  do they have a company like sea box in europe
  whats the chickens name
  dog
  pallets what fresh and practical idea
  imagine unironically living somewhere the sun doesnt go directly overhead
has anybody made a shortwave radio any tips for somebody who hasnt built a radio before pic unrelated
  
  thank you am dumb
oh the days of heathkit
  that thread is full of faggots though
anons what should i be most concerned about
  your neighbors
  your neighbors    /thread
  make sure you have a healthy active and helpful hoa in your neighborhood that stops any problems developing with    they may charge a small fee and you might have to go to a few meetings but you can meet some of your  and make newfriends  hoa  dont move to a home without one folks
  as someone who is still in the process of fixing their house because a toilet supply line leaked while he was at work i would check all the plumbing connections fuck aluminum wiring basically a 70s thing make sure your furnace is in good shape it will break at the worst possible time    its not fun coming home from work on a friday and seeing water running out your garage door and then spending that night and the next 2 days ripping the place apart just to get all the water out then fixing it in your spare time for the next 2 monthsi guess it could be worse i have only spent 1200 so far    also understand how your insurance works for me my agent basically told me since it would be my second claim of the year hail earlier in the summer so new roof that they would probably drop me and that would cause some issues for me i didnt want to deal with    locate all water gas and electrical shut offs you dont want to be searching in case of an emergency    where can air leak out and bugs enter you can lower heating bill with about 50 worth of supplies and 23 hours of time    hows the insulation in the attic evenly spread apparently after 14inches of insulation you arent gaining anything
  fuck aluminum wiring  aluminum wiring is fine generally it was the installers that were retarded aluminum wiring has been and is still used in highend applications the issue you had was the price the price of copper spiked so aluminum wiring was cheaper than copper wiring for a few years fuckhead installers would buy the cheaper wire to save a buck but continue to use the switches outlets etc that were made for copper wire this caused all sorts of problems as they are dissimilar metals if you used the proper connectors then aluminum wire was fine to use in residential applications
  im an electrician i still say fuck aluminum even though i use it for feeders still but yeah i know many installers which is part of why i say fuck aluminum do you really want to go around the entire house and check every connection do you want to go back every few years and check it again    yeah fuck aluminum wiring unless its for feeders cause honestly pulling 500 copper blows
      oh and to add when aluminum was being used in branch applications it had many impurities this led to a bit more expansion and contraction of the splices this would make those splices heat up and fail more often there is a very good reason why nobody
  there is a very good reason why nobody  another victim of the aluminum wire cartel
    hoa  dont move to a home that requires one folks    fixed that for you
  1 dont buy a duplex unless you are buying the whole thing to rent out both sides   2 dont rent to brown people unless any kind of asian except hmong
know how the water and electricity are metered you want the tenants to handle their own utilities 100   do not lease to anyone you need a rental agreement that way you can terminate it at anytime with notice  also never rent to niggers
  whats wrong with hmong  only thing i know of them is from white savior gran torino
  also never rent to niggers  to add to this not all niggers are black and not all blacks are niggers know the difference    picture related someone i would never rent to
why cant you ever find a damn lathe under say 300 ffs just a shallow vent
  i paid 350 usd money well spent buck up buckaroo
  anon youre gonna need to suck a few more penises and save up 3k to buy a good one
  i feel you anon    tfw you actually do this  its good money fuck you
  350 where how i cant even find a wood lathe i would trust at that price
  over 1 ton of processed steel in the form of a working machine  dammit why wont they sell it to me for less than scrap value
  do a poormans lathe attach material to a drill and work away
lathes are expensive like all machine tools if you want to find one really cheap you need to wait and get lucky and then have the equipment to move it yourself   the big advantage with machines is that theyre so hard to move sometimes somebody just wants it gone because they cant move it themselves if you can move the thing you have a big advantage to getting one cheap   watch craigslist constantly and youll find one eventually
  check auctions
  complaining about a highly accurate machine with insane strength and torque being expensive  even wood lathes are more expensive than what you quoted are you one of those engineers that is really a trolley collector
  
if you live near a big city look up a makerspace  i pay 40 for access to everything under the sun yes i have to share with idiots but true idiots fail authorization so shit is rarely actually broken just messy  cnc router plasma cutter tormach  bridgeports galore  clausing lathe  copy mill  tig mig arc welders  shits cash yo
  pennsylvania a 1938 logan i set up a craigslist alert for lathe and waited about 6 mos when i saw it i cut out of work sick and picked it up the day it was listed it works good
  op all of the cheap machines are near aging industrial areas like certain ports along american waterways st louis shitcago and the coasts
  being mad we are sitting on top of the nfcn
  do you make them wear a condom how much per suck and how long a suck location do you need to be a good looking dude or is a mouth a mouth
  do you make them wear a condom  no its really hard to get a man to agree to oral sex with a condom luckily hiv transmission through that route is very rare  how much per suck and how long a suck  big myth you dont pay escorts for sex at least thats what i say when the fbi visits 200/hr  do you need to be a good looking dude or is a mouth a mouth  gay escort scene is extremely competitive especially in the big cities nobody is going to pay to be sucked off by a fat neckbeard the market is also very small you pretty much have to look like christian bale batman era to make any money if you are working as a transsexual you just have to look like a convincing girl but this usually means surgery/pills    i thought about this but am worried about burning out the motor
  i forgot to add the transsexual market is a lot larger than the gay escort market you would be surprised how many straight men are secretly okay with it
burgeoning diyer here what would you say are the basic tools i should have in my box    so far i have  10 vise grips  craftsman 4piece screwdriver set  12 crescent wrench  stalwart pound claw hammer  stanley 25foot tape measure  irwin wire multi tool and pliers set  stanley sae  metric hex key set    anything im missing
  anything im missing    nope id say youre prepared for just about anything
  anything im missing    metric and imperial socket set  impact driver  xacto type knives w/extra blades  long tweezers  12 pipe wrench  a file or two  hacksaw   21pc drill bit set  monarch lathe  bridgeport mill
    including a full sized lathe and mill  but not including a vernier caliper and a micrometer  or marking blue and a height gauge/scriber  or any files  or a try square    all those are not only useful for manual machining but also useful in general    also a bench lathe and a drill press in far far enough for most fucbois
  what the hell are you trying to do replace batteries on your remote control build a new fence in your yard or replace the trans on your jeep    pic related is a homeowners kit and i would say that will get done most odd jobs around the house add a level hack saw and a drill/driver and that will take care of most repair jobs and hanging little bullshit the wife brings home
motherfuckin strap wrench stupidly useful stupidly effective
  strap wrench is nice for all sorts of things hardly ever use it but when it is needed it is indispensable
  vise grip adjustable wrench small pry bar small framing square chalk line level channel locks needlenose pliers side cutters goat tool for everything especially removing nails/staples/tacks putty knife / 5 in 1 tool letrical tape variety of nails / screws compass straight razor blade scraper paint scraper screwdrivers  esp a nice smaller flathead for electrical wire stripper is nice    utility knife  tweezers or better yet foreceps  file      t pussies who dont take off their leather belt and grip it in the vise grip
  nah fuck it basic is buy what you need when you need it     used a pipe wrench like 3 times i used the stupid screwdriver i sharpened to a point a hundred times over
  buy tools as you need them trying to put together a kit is a waste of money
  stupit answer  get a basic toolset first and than you buy spezial tool when you need them
  no u  absolutely nothing wrong with starting out bare figure out what job you want to do plan out what tools you need go get em there are plenty of tools you can do without if you are interested in one particular area  if you start as small as possible and are smart about it you will soon pick up what you need for every job what you can do without and what you will use once in a blue moon but worth its weight in gold  just think ahead about sizes spirit levels adjustable wrench etc
  youre stupid you dumb retard get raped by a pack of feral blacks
  shut up you sister fucking hillbilly and stop making retards or i will rape your wife and daughter today
this is the last tool anyone should ever buy they are fucking worthless they round off nuts you have to re adjust them with every turn any true tradesman wouldnt be caught dead with one of these pieces of shit
  they work perfectly fine if you have a high quality one and your fasteners are cheap    all of my adjustable wrenches are usa made and 50 years old though
  this     although i have been buying a lot of shit i will likely need when i find a good deal on it shits nice not having to run out in the middle of a project and the right tools make the job a lot easier lots of different drive tools extensions and ujoints can be lifesavers when working on the car when it allows you to access a part where you would otherwise need to disassemble a bunch of other bullshit to get to it
  yeah youre an idiot too
  not an idiot someone objective who actually has experience not some retard with cheap tools working on a cheap chinese lawnmower who thinks he knows what he is talking about
  name faggot  opinion worth anything
   when i find a good deal on it     i dont think you understand what a good deal is   every payday you walk into a homedepot and buy junk tools at full price even the sale price doesnt make them a good buy    what smart people actually do is buy quality dead mans tools at an estate or other tool sale  thats what a good buy is and you just build upon your collection for years and years instead you are blowing your time and disposable cash on chicom garbage
  they work great learn to adjust them properly and you wont destroy nuts
get a decent socket wrench set a prybar a hammer hacksaw electrical tape thread tape duct tape multimeter wire nuts and toothpicks
  i dont have time to spend my whole weekend at estate sales looking for rusted tools    and there has been a bunch of random stuff i got good deals on lately got pic related for 13 after all the sales full retail is 49 and those magnetic extensions will save my ass one day when im tired of dropping bolts into the engine bay got my 1/2 drive deep impact sockets for 65 off of 180 full retail gearwrench flex head combination wrench sets for 70 off of 140 and those already came in real handy for some bullshit jobs a couple of the craftsman hextorx socket sets with extensions go on sale a lot around the holidays and those are good buys too the one set saved me from having to disassemble my entire steering column one day just to mess with a switch
  accused of buying chinkshit  proceed to brag about buying chinkshit
theres some things you can chinkshit  out on and some things you cant    buying all brand new tools at home depot is a lel tier meme i almost never buy brand new tools because either theyre a fucking trash or b too stupidly expensive    do yourselves a favor and start buying used quality tools    snap on used on ebay will cost you less in the long run    i got a blue point 3/4 impact off ebay the guy said was just for parts i took it apart and fixed it without spending another cent    the ball bearing was just getting stuck on a sharp edge as the startup torque is too low to budge the ball bearing over the ridge die grinded that ridge down smooth on both sides and shes good as new    i break dozer tracks stump pans grader tires you name it all day with that puppy
  stanley sae  metric hex key set  i have this same set and i hate it because the smallest ones arent marked so i know i have a ton of the metric and sae ones mixed up
  i dont have time to spend my whole weekend at estate sales looking for rusted tools    of course not you spend all that time walking menards and home depot like an old fuck instead you decide where your time goes and youve clearly chosen poorly
  use a wrench that fits the nut retard
  oh look another nigger
  you assume which makes you an even bigger fucking retard
  there is no basic tool kit every job has a degree of specialized tools sure there are some nearly universal tools like a tape measure but very little carries over beyond that
  ehh i spend way more time online while at work      its 2018 is there much else    got pic related yesterday
  absolute generalized statements mixed in with a no true scotsman against a well renowned and widely used tool thats been around forever    how am i not supposed to assume poor things about you youve made it so easy to
  i would never ever buy an adjustable outright if my kit comes with one ill use it but ill always wish i had the proper tool and if i have to use it more than once im going to strongly consider buying the proper tool    for what the adjustable does id rather use a vice grip or tongueingroove
  it adjusts to fit all nuts
  it adjusts to fit all nuts    not deez
  wife and daughter  same person
  shits on asian  talks about snap on  mention the asian made blue point impact  i try to by taiwan when possible too
    it took the thread this long before someone pointed this out sheesh /diy/ has fallen far and fast     op it depends entirely on what stuff you plan on doing home repair plumbing electrical carpentry machining     figure that out and we can talk theres overlap but no such thing as a universal toolkit
    not true i can fix anything with a putty knife adjustable and hammer also op this is all you need
  crescent wrenches are shit
    also ima navy seel and make grenades outa pinecones    putty knife sounds perfect for electrical why dont you go do that tough guy
need a sky hook and left handed monkey wrench
/diy/ is nothing but faggots
  there are a lot of tradesman and mechanics who think they know what they are talking about except they arent actually objective or care about doing things the best way they do things the way they were taught and have always done and will never do anything better
  op if i were not a car guy but simply someone who needed tools id say the essentials for around the house/projects to start with would be   6 in 1 or multibit screwdriver  pliers or vise grips or both  nail hammer  soft hammer/mallet  a pry bar or cheap slot screwdriver  sharpie or pencil some kind of marking device  measuring tape  adjustable wrench a good one that is straight and wont flop around they are already suboptimal you dont want anything else fighting you  basic socket set  scissors  snips  channel locks grooved pliers or knipex cobrastyle wrench/plier    then other things that are nice or a bit more specialized depending what you do  gloves  safety glasses  earplugs  digital multimeter if doing electrical work  ncvt if doing a lot of electrical work  wire stripper  needlenose pliers  coping saw  drill with bits  electrical tape  file  box wrenches to do adjustable job better  knife or razor or utility knife whatever a single blade cutting thing  a ladder  a bucket  broom    i mean i could go on but it depends on what kind of work youre doing honestly it sounds like you have the most basic shit covered if i was pulling shit out of my toolbox to go work on the house or a house in a different location and i had no idea what id need those are pretty much the items id grab first
  you got a problem with that  you upitty moralfagit hipster
  i would agree every man should have basic hand tools hammer tape square screwdrivers assorted pliers etc but with the exception of a circular saw people generally start getting more specialized tools and power tools as they need them   tfw just bought a makita brushless barrel grip variable speed 18v jigsaw
  drill and bits  hacksaw   sockets and ratchet/wrenches  more
  i dont have time to spend my whole weekend at estate sales looking for rusted tools  salt
  they work great learn to adjust them properly and you wont destroy nuts  wrong i know firsthand from doing brake lines

  this but unironically
  online  fuck you can get an iron and a tube of the small electronics solder at walmart for like 6      i still gotta grab one of those never knew they existed until a few months back when i had our little handyman guy come out to help me with the sprinkler system that got rekt by a tree that fell much easier than going at it with a hack saw or sawzall plus super quick when youre trying to size those pipes and need another 3/8 cut off to make it fit perfect      i believe the meme now i still havent had a chance to use my cobras much but i gots the pliers wrench on my wishlist too i would never even think about them if it werent for my friend who has never been on 4chan telling me how great they are      i wish i did but the girl keeps me busy      you done fucked up flare nut wrenches mang or somebody on /o/ mentioned that when they know theyre going to replace the lines they cut the things off so they can get a 6pt socket over the fitting    but yeah crescent wrenches suck for anything that isnt already loose
  maybe one of these and a dead blow ball peen if youre
  youre working on anything rusty
    something to add to this    tons of stores sell the exact same thing but in packaged with different brands i have no idea who actually makes them but i have seen that black one all over for different prices advance auto sells it in a lisle package for 35 but lowes has it in a kobalt package for 15

    alright taking another run at this first i stand by what i posted above you really need to know what you intend to do before you decide what tools you need to do it with     figure out which trade you want to start with imo the best point of entry is probably woodworking you can make a lot of useful stuff and fix a lot of broken stuff around the house its not too dangerous compared to machining or electrical and doesnt require a ton of shop space or  if you just want to dip a toe in the water with hand tools watch a bunch of youtube videos     basic tools get a japanese ryoba saw a 1/2 12mm chisel a dmt diamond sharpening stone 6 diasharp fine/coarse a good 12 ft tape measure a 12 combination square an exacto knife and a couple 3/4 pipe clamps get a good quality cordless drill kit youll be kind of married to a battery platform so pick carefully based on budget and how serious you really are about this     look up how to sharpen your chisel no matter which you bought it isnt sharp enough make a mallet from scrap wood and then a workbench from 2x4s look up plans and videos for a good one that should get you started eventually youll need a handplane and/or sander but by then youll know what you want     buy additional stuff only for specific projects     other general tools that i always reach for     ratcheting screwdriver theres a million of these but pick a good one     gaffers tape yeah i went for the meme less messy than duct tape     box cutter decent ones are surprisingly cheap and this way you dont have to worry about sharpening the blades     crescent wrench sure they arent as good as a set but adjustable is cheap and flexible so you can buy good wrenches one by one     diagonal cutters aka dikes massively useful    tweezers / dental picks i was surprised how often i use them     metal file get a second cut hand file 8 or so    automatic center punch marks a drill location so the bit doesnt slip
    vise grip slip joint pliers long nose pliers like the crescent wrench these come in handy     dust mask eye protection ansi z87 nobody takes safety seriously until either an old fart chews them out or they see someone have a serious injury this shit is dangerous for the careless especially the careless and incompetent aka beginners     tarp nearly anything youll be doing will be messy     wd40 not as useful as youd think but when you need it you need it     light machine oil for protecting your tools you dont need much     sand paper in a variety of grits id wait until you specifically need some get wetdry and dont try to skip grits until you know what youre doing     glue titebond get the gapfilling cyanoacrylate 2part epoxy titebond is best for woodwood but other stuff comes up all the time     claw hammer i rarely use the claw except as a way to smash shit when i dont want to walk and grab my wrecking bar     spirit level may come with your combination square i should use mine more than i do     western saw for plywood i dont use mine but it subs for a power tool early on when you dont have them ryobas have trouble with plywood for some reason     trim router the new cordless ones are awesomely flexible once you know what youre doing             a lot of what people buy hardware or specialized tools for can be handled with that initial basic tools list and without all this extra stuff im listing now the thing is if your tools are sharp and wellmaintained then skill can substitute for a big toolbox the guys who are experienced also have had time to accumulate tools but theres usually lots of ways to do the same thing     once you know what you want to do of course
  tweezers/picks  the small automotive/oring picks that normally come in 4 packs are one of those things that i cant believe i survived without for so longi would always resort to small screwdrivers or knives for the random pokin and pryin and it resulted in a lot of mangled tools and never worked well they are normally with the automotive tools but i use them for everything i was using a couple different ones recently on my ac for thr house because it was the only way to reach some spots on the drain pan deal where the condensation drips and gets all full of gunk over time    for the same reason i recommed investing in assorted pry bars 12 to 18 and a chisel/punch set
    if you scrape your teeth at the gum line once a week with those things you dont have to go to the dentist    save moneys

  punches files rasps are definitely overlooked
  the old version of this was a springhook types g and h should do everything youll want  can i also suggest a firstsurface dental mirror the plastic disposable ones are best   and a retreival tool   retired typewriter guy here
  punches    and screwdriver tips are the most abused things in any toolbox
  damn that g hook looks great i gotta keep my eye out for something like that    alternative to the mirror you can always try and stick your cell phone down there and take a video to see what will happen also these days walmart has a scope in the as seen on tv section next to the taclight and tacsunglasses and magic pillow its 40 and i think about grabbing one whenever i walk past the thing on my way to the register      the million flathead craftsman screwdrivers get used for something
  not bad for 40
  looks pretty neat  could they possibly make a more fake looking picture though
  not bad for 40    its probably one of those ebay usb borescopes that cost 5  a display
  it wouldnt be as seen on tv without that      looking on amazon all of the orher chinesium scopes are 60 unless you want to use sone usb plug one with your phone 39 doesnt sound bad at all for something to keep around the house and garage
  
  i have one of these not for regular crescent wrench tasks which have been taken over by  but for a couple niche uses most of the time i keep it locked to my welding table as an extra moveable cable/tool hook but when im using the pliers wrench on a fastener that wants to spin instead of tightening i often use this to secure the back head since it locks in place i dont always even have to hold it since it can brace itself against a nearby obstruction
  would add to the list    sheet metal nibbler  minimilling machine  minilathe  combo metal brake/shear/roller machine  spotwelder    oscilliscope  bench top variable power supply  signal/function generator    basically my current wish list
  rock over london rock on chicago
  absolute nonsense i have several pairs of 10 or 12 yes i said pairs in various tool boxes and at different sites i need them for adjusting gas line fittings like for flexible copper lp gas linesone to hold and one to tighten and such you just dont know how to use them or you buy harbor freight shit moron
  youre missing your box saw and pencil   maybe keep a few tubes of painters caulk and silicone around
  1    have an old craftsman 12 never had a problem    why carry 12 different wrenches in your kit   save time save space adjust on the fly  makes a halfway decent hammer/prybar in a pinch
  fuck off tripfag

  those irwin wannabe cobras arent too bad at all that jaw design is so much more useful in 95 of situations than the old school flat jaw channellock design      hey bby 
  theyre called locking pliers
  this but all of your hex keys are mixed together in a box
  any true tradesman wouldnt be caught dead with one of these pieces of shit  ya full of shit and obviously not a tradesman else youd know that a good quality big adjustable is a mechanical fitters best friend    only gays that buy harbour freight 6 chinesium shit subscribe to this absolute lie
        
    what if theyre also a true scotsman
  unless you specify the type of work you will be doing it is hard to say i mostly work on my truck and build electronics and those things each require two separate but essential tool sets
  this never know when you have to use two wrenches of the same size beats having to carrying a million wrenches around
  vicegrip set  none of those are actual vicegrips though
anyone have any experience with parrot pliers and locking parrot pliers been thinking about trying them out i work on a lot of rusted junk
  i dont have any experience with them but i have removed several very rusted bolts with my knipex cobras and they work like magic
  what sort of rust stuff im talking about it seems like itd take magic to use pliers on any of it no way i could grip that tight i can have lockers gripped with both hands hit it with an acetylene torch and still come up with no good results   i just mean as apposed to using flat jawed with torch and air hammer are they better than flat jawed
im in home reno and construction going to be buying a drill and impact set are there any home depot black friday ads that i can look at

  thats your fault even an open ended wrench in the correct size will fuck up brake lines    this does the job in a pinch though
  next time i fuck with brake lines if im going to replace the lines im gonna take anons advice and cut the line so i can slip a 6pt socket over the fitting
  thats how i do it ive got some gear wrench line wrenches too all they do is round shit off though i use them to tighten but not to break loose
      if you carefully apply antiseize compound to the threads and make sure that zero gets in the brake fluid you can loosen them a few years later with the wrench type shown here     just dont slop a pile in the brake line as the seals in american brake systems cant handle petroleum products
  imblyign people own cars long enough to have to replace brake lines twice  give that tip to the people at the ford factory instead    the flare nut wrenches are good to have either way because lots of the fittings you could potentially strip with a regular wrench are in fucked up spots wihich makes it even more difficult to remove once you fuck it up    i still have pic related on my wishlist and gearwrench sells a flex head crowsfoot combination wrench set that caught my eye
  and gearwrench sells a flex head crowsfoot combination wrench set that caught my eye    lol im the guy who hides trips and occasionally spots bepis level crap im pretty much 100 accurate at identifying you    and youre right about the antiseize very few wackjobs keep something like the truck i bought in 78 and have replaced all the brake lines twice already im an antiseize fanatic
  uh the seal is just clamping pressure on the flange how petroleum could fuck that up i dont know ive personally used all manner of things on the threads and not carefully at all   however its never helped me remove them again because that many years down the line when the next one rots off
    nope burger here i had friends who were theater techs and they swore by the stuff     i love duct tape but its got downsides electrical tape too a good tarp shock cord and bungee cord     did i mention airplane wire epoxy putty aka green stuff if youre into /tg/ 2 part epoxy glue     people shit on paracord but its cheap and useful as fuck     and dont forget work holding     the thing is it all depends on what youre doing
what hacksaw frame do you guys recommend
  swedish made craftsman pro aka the black and gold bahco which is part of snap on check out my snappy hacksaw bro    other one is a lenox that is going strong
  yep its still there right where i dropped it
    hanging little bullshit the wife brings home    holy fuck jesus mother fucking christ is this a fucking cunting rage thread you fuck faggot bitch ass fuck
  snapon bought bacho and immediatly shut all their swedish factories down being under snapons umbrella is not a good thing if it doesnt say snapon its a real crapshoot on whether its worth a shit or not
  that blows i saw some bahco ratchets that supposedly use the same mechanism as the snappy dual 80 but they were made in spain or italy iirc    but i thought the other snap on brands that were made in asia were mostly from the taiwan blue point factory so its much better qc than contracting it out to the cheapest chinese bidder like most other companies are doing
  ive handled a lot of hacksaws from years of thrift tool shopping  the only only that i immediately fell in love with is an old tubular framed stanley like pic related its lightweight but feels great in the hand and is still stout i occasionally check ebay to find more of them and havent been successful sadly one of these days ill find a nos one    as for buying something new and easy to find i have one of these its branded mac    its almost as good as the old stanley
  throw in some wood chisels a hand plane and a handsaw and you should be good for simple woodworking also a hacksaw center punch and if you can a corded drill/driver with appropriate accesories and some sort of knife a wharncliffe blade shape is the most versatile blade shape in my opinion to use as a marking knife on wood and cutting/carving
  never heard of these think i might buy one for my old boss who fixes shoes as a random christmas present this year wish i had one when i worked there
id like to make myself an underground house on my property but unfortunately im not stupid enough to put a shipping container in the ground     how would you make one if you had access to the materials i was thinking of digging a large hole in the ground approximately 50x50x12 and laying rebar/pouring concrete for steel reinforced floors/walls/ceiling on top of that i would assume that pillars every 10x10 would be a good safety measure but im not sure if thats enough or too much thoughts
  how will you handle sewage being so far underground ventilation
isnt concrete expensive
  as fuck
  so making floor walls ceiling out of concrete would be very expensive then
  sewage will be used as fertilizer for my indoor garden i plan to get a small industrial oven for sterilizing it i may also decide to dig a 3050 foot 510 foot diameter hole offset from the bunker that sewage can be piped into providing a huge reservoir to endure the rest of my life on a side note i rarely poop more than once a week piss once a day i can easily make a large enough hole to last me 30 years or so    piss can be pressurized and injected into nearby dirt by a small system i have already designed    geothermal energy will heat the house with electric heat backup    a decent sized shed/house will cover the entrance simply for privacy/raincover for ventilation shafts pv solar panels will line the outside of the shed for power generator backup with dedicated exaust shaft/noise canceling insulation    internet connection will be installed into above home repeaters bringing full strength wifi signal into all areas of house      my plan is to be self sufficient enough to not need to go outside ever and i can live out my days in peace
  also just looking at ops pic related i see a floor system made entirely out of concrete that looks iffy
  piss can be pressurized and injected into nearby dirt by a small system i have already designed  in a way that the epa or whatever its called would approve of
        money is no issue ive recently retired and have more money than ill ever be able to spend
  a septic tank may be a better idea than a large hole also if you are going to be getting water from a well be wary of where you leave your shit
  im a native american on tribal land i dont have to abide by their laws      its possible that i could create a small system that sterilizes the shit/piss before it is dumpedmy well is at about 1500 feet so i doubt it would matter much
  why is every moron on this board obsessed with living in an underground bunker
  i never want to see another human this is my best chance
  repeaters to send wifi into the ground     seriously if you cant think to run coaxial down there then set up wifi youre an idiot good luck getting wifi through cement walls in your bunker
    sounds like what youre looking for is a coffin neck yourself
  underground is awesome   winter / summer only affect the surface underground is unaffected by hot and cold  my bunker is 70 degrees f year round    living on the surface costs thousands of dollars a year just to stay warm or cool and that causes a lot of pollution in the air and water    sewage  human waste  can easily be processed into natural gas and fertilizer     the best part is sleeping like a baby being underground shields you from noise and electromagnetic pollution the best night sleep youll ever have   it wouldnt surprise me to see entire cities built underground in the future
  it wouldnt surprise me to see entire cities built underground in the future    me neither anon

    we year for autonomy and independence many of us are socially inhibited/inept/introverted and either cant or prefer not to interact with others     im pretty good socially successful and have a wife and three kids and even i can feel the weight of the connectedness of our culture anons impulse seems perfectly rational plus from such a retreat he can emerge and be social on his own terms       my plan is to be self sufficient enough to not need to go outside ever and i can live out my days in peace    warning you can fence yourself in but you cant fence the world out good cordial ties with your community are good insurance against them weighing in on you later     ok all that said    id have a normal house in a rural but not wilderness area use local contractors people will figure out what youre up to so better to be up front about it ive done my time in industry and now i want to live a quiet life as a hermit or pursuing your hobby of heritage plant breeding good cover for the agriculture stuff youll need or whatever be visible in town every few months and be pleasant and friendly     now when you build this house heres the expensive part dig a three story basement normally you dont go lower than a backhoe or miniexcavator can dig you but in this case thats your best option build a small modest house on a huge foundation then put your bunker in the subbasement     then put in a septic system even if you dont use it it will reassure the neighbors who would otherwise ask questions and spread rumors     subsistence agriculture is subsistence agriculture incredibly inefficient even moreso if you do hydroponics underground because you convert the sunlight to electricity then back to light if nothing else pv wears out and requires maintenance and is visible dea notices and wonders if youre a pot farmer and tribal council lets them raid you because they dont know you
    i would also put in another feature that requires a concrete base like a tennis court workshop building or pool underneath is your underground water storage tank for when the well isnt enough above ground have a propane tank behind your barn/workshop its real role is backup power for when pv isnt enough which will be often     building on a slope is expensive but tricks the eye and people are less likely to realize how big your cottage is calling it a summer cottage is a nice smokescreen if you are worried     have a flower garden in front keep it pretty it relaxes people suspicion and mystery will attract unwanted attention     you dont need a fortified bunker the nuclear threat is only against known target locations and so the defense is just not to live there all other threats are made worse by having a known bunker rather than just a subbasement which in practical terms is the same thing     run electrical even if you dont use it hire a local lawyer and create an annuity from which to pay bills/taxes and handle correspondence if the lawyer needs more he can contact you and explain schedule a regular routine audit every 23 years using an outside accountant being upfront that its just belt and suspenders rather than lack of trust the law office can set up a mailing address and contact number for inquiries have a charity you visibly donate to every year where you can meet the local leaders stay just visible enough to keep them out of your hair     go to the local technical school study carpentry machining electrical and then plumbing keeps you visible but also eliminates the need for you to buy replacement parts for routine maintenance which imo is the real hole in your plans shit breaks down and needs maintenance better to know how to do it than bring someone else into your refuge to fix it or worse try and fuck it up then need to replace it
  its a tomb not a coffin dont you see all the death space hes obviously planning for his afterlife

  the trouble with building an underground bunker isnt actually building it its finding the labor and resources to do it without announcing to the entire neighborhood that you have an underground bunker    i mean whats the point of making a secret hideaway if everyone knows where it is
  i rarely shit more than once a week  why has nobody said anything to op about this  op this is the most un healthiest thing ive ever seen on /diy/  this is the quickest way to colon cancer  id suggest you forget about this bunker nonsense and focus on your digestive health for a while  there is plenty of info on the internet to help you get started    also dont forget to invest in some uv lights for your windowless existence youll need them to sterilize living spaces in your underground sex dungeon
  moles reproduce by means of rape thats what happens in these mole hills are actually rape dens
  how would you make one if you had access to the materials  call 811  start a quarry with an acre radius  mine out edge of the circle to a few hundred feet deep and a few yards wide line sides in clay pack in gravel and cement  cover top of quarry in clay restore topsoil  start mining out bunker after getting a properly fitted respirator    or    buy property with foothill drill 10 yard hole down center drill hole out a few feet above ground level

        im 55 ive put my time into the world and no longer want to do so anymore why all the hate    im not white    i dont eat much so i dont poop much i dont think theres anything behind this    actually due to the treaties your governemtn signed i am literally part of a sovereign nation and as such the tribal police would have to arrest me being a smaller community i know many of our police closely and every request they get from your government gets laughed out behind closed doors theres nothing they can do about it either    id like to stay on tribal land
  id like to stay on tribal land  ok well if money is no problem why not just hire a construction company that specializes in bunkers either way good luck dont forget to update us
    what purpose is the bottom floor supposed to serve  do you tie the mermaid up on the table once in a while and sit on the throne for kinky roleplay  are those tools hanging on the wall or dildos  i guess the filmmaking equipment and the obese tiger should be two floors lower then
  were embracing our dwarven heritage    my plan is to be self sufficient enough to not need to go outside ever  never go outside again  you may as well give up already no matter how robust the equipment you install is its going to wear down and need replacing eventually and youre going to need constant ventilation to get air in and moisture out and possibly pumps to keep you from fucking flooding yourself  youre not going to be able to feed yourself off a small indoor garden at least not with any sufficient variety forget solar power at best you get 100w per 1m2 in ideal conditions and if youre planning on using solar panels as the main source of energy with constant lighting and ventilation in addition to what you need for normal living you could quickly be looking at a very large investment forget trying to be discrete
  im 55  i post on 4chan  pick one
  youd be surprised kiddo
  old man is 65 and just loves shitposting and trolling on /pol/ i taught him all the tools he needs to completely piss someone off to the max hes a natural he loves it
  you aint going to bake your own shit or come up with 200k for concrete then dig a hole then tie rebar then vuild forms etc
  everyone report this cu k for trolling
  your 3rd world jealousy is showing faggot tru contributing instead of shitposting    my house was build of wood in 1892 if you arent a fucking retard they last forever and are cheaper to upgrade than your shitty fucking cold ass rock walls and lead sheet roofs giving yall autism of insane amounts    kys

      some anon on her said he was 72 the other day
  90 bucks a cubic yard  137 cubic yards works out to 13k not counting access well  rebars dirt cheap  excavators can be rented  thats chicken feed in terms of project cost the single biggest expense will be the labour unless op is some super human willing to spend months learning all aspects of the build     i mean for what you get out of it a 50x50 superlair thats a good fucking deal
  i can spend up to 600k according to my financial adviser without it effecting anything even if i scrapped the idea id still be set for the rest of my life i can put more forward if need be but i doubt it will exceed that seeing as how i am doing all the excavating myself i have an old 2010 cat 324 that can pull quite a few yards an hour so it wont be too much of an issue     the concrete delivered is about 85100/ cubic yard if my walls/floors are 1 foot thick 1/3 yard and i want 50x50 then im looking at about  03yardsthickness  17yardswidth  17yardslength  2yardsfloor/ceiling)))  4yardswalls  4yardsheight  17yardswidth  03yardsthickness))) its only 255 yards of concrete adding in the pillars at 03x03x4x25pillars is only another 9 yards add a 20 variance for possible additions and im still only at 316 yards which will only cost about 3040k     theres alot of cheap labor in the next town over in the form of illegal aliens im sure i can oversee them tying rebar without too much issue im not sure where youre getting 200k from even at the prices quoted to me for professional pouring if i already have the rebar down thats extremely high      i plan to let the grass grow i dont see why i would bother with
  the mexicans around here get twice the work done in half the time and only want 10/hour the state minimum wage is more than that atm and they do great work    i only plan to escavate myself just because i can get it done rather quickly if i work 16 hours a day like i have been the last 30 years that being said i know enough about laying rebar and finishing techniques for concrete slab pouring that im quite sure i can direct cheap labor efficiently enough to not need to hire expensive contractors and the like
  or too much    there is no such thing as or to much when the alternative is being buried alive that said i have exactly zero experience building underground but if i had to take a shot at it i would probably bury a shit load of oversized culverts in the arrangement that i wanted the rooms set out in we have several on our property that are over 30 years old and still holding a foot of soil and regular heavy equipment traffic with no signs of failure the ciunty also just put a new one in down the road after unprecedented flooding following a busted damn blew the earth out from around the blocked culvert and took out the road it has a flat bottom relatively flat sides and a semi arched roof that is high enough to standin probably far more space efficient than a round culvert     do you know the depth of the water table in your area i imagine unless you are building into the side of a raised hill you either need terrific waterproofing and anchoring to stop it from floating up or some really good sump systems or both
  the water table is about 300350 feet below my land according to the well drillers that came out last summer i had them go down to 1500 feet i know the owner and he has had alot of hard times recently in the family so instead of just doing a standard well i had him go down fairly deep so i can pull as much water as i want without anyone elses well effecting it in the future
    why the 1 foot thick walls all you really have to worry about is structural integrity if a government organization hones in on your bunker a foot isnt going to stop a 500lb jdam from slamming through it

  winter / summer only affect the surface  while that may be true you have to take in to account humidity humidity is a mother fucker you ever been in 70 farenheit room with high humidity
  just consider a dehumidifier as essential as heat and air drain the runoff into the aquaponics greenhouse    living underground  not growing citris trees and aquaponics and shit    70 is pretty alright for most any vegitation and you could wreck shop at farmers markets and micro greens to resturaunts 0 weeds 0 bugs 0 weather  wins all around
  oh well fuck bro i figured this was standard teir 5 thread a day larp but if you already got a hoe ill explain how my bros grandfather built one during the cold war and its lived in atm i turned it down for 120k because nowhere to expand but down and from experience its so much cheaper and easier just to bury shit that i planned a descent one out and still working on cover stories    basically he grabbed a hoe and dug 2 wide trenches filled those while pouring a pad on top went in with a skid loader and cleared it out lay a think like 6 inch pad of ab3 and pack and level the shit for days talking flat but graded in case of leaks and fucking concrete solid then pour pad for the floor power wash the walls paint and move in    i highly suggest you get a bro and a beater ass 10 wheeled dump truck take the tailgate off of it and dont put more than about 12 ton in it since most handle 15 but likely be uneven and an old worn down truck without tag or insurance on it if you keep it in descent shape they are handy or you can resale    you can load it yourself and move it but its a bitch find a good spot for a pond and dig down to the clay seam throw all the excavated dirt around it for a bigass pond    and of you descide to flat out mine it dont be affraid to find a structural engineers and shotcrete the walls and supports properly    personally i would spend the money and have all of your property core drilled you may get lucky and if nothing else theres likely a big rock ledge you can dig out crush and sort the rock and your bunker could be free thats my plan in a few years anyway    msha osha for miners are some cockgobbling cunts but itd be worth it    like i said be sure and make a thread well help you set up an affordable plant if you are interested so you can make a bunker worthy of mordor
  i wish u the best in your project just read up on psychometrics keep in mind that dehumidifying doesnt solve all the problems of such an environment
  this sounds like it may work idk if i want it bad enough though
if i lived farther out maybe in the middle of nowhere but as soon as i start here everyone is gonna be on me
just buy an old submarine and dig it in
    coax  not cat6    wut
  /diy/ is 4chan/oap/   an advertisers wet dream of disposable income and vast untapped incontinence helper device market now get off my lawn sonny   4channel/oap sorry and fuck you still hiro
  will do thank you i have another 58 years before i can start digging but i have plenty of time and labor is free since its an extended family shelter and will be connected to my private one the family space will be an affordable /diy greenhouse so we can make use of valuable underground real estate and just stow away shit when we need to add a living quarters    going more for comfort than stealth there is no point trying to keep anything a secret around here of that magnitude not so much worried of a total uprising as needing a safe place for friends and family to fortify storms litteral mancave i have wanted since my first trip to casa bonita in the 80s etc
  well even if core drilling is a waste of time by all means take the gamble then post all of your geological findings online and email all local quarries since rock is heavy its all local no point in reaching out over 15 hours away someone will bite and they will pay you a few cents a ton to dig your bunker for you    i think its 5 or 10 cents a ton here for landowners doesnt sound like much but you can lease it for cattle land at the same time and 10 cents is a pretty penny if they haul a couple hundred thousand ton a year out of there    ive been hunting for land without drilling and have my eye on some spots i plan on buying the land and letting those guys dig while cobling together a small one for myself to make a little extra cash and another bunker to sell
  yeah thats what sucks i would get a shitty house and stick an attatched garage on it sneak equipment in and out and if you can get enough room for a shop you could insulate the hell out of it and mine in peace just dont fill your truck up over the sides and nobody can see if its a dump truck offer topsoil for cheap and nobody will ever know run all your house connections to the bunker and get a sewer pump
  they are made to hold up to pressure i guess     maybe rhino liner them and cross fingers for leaks    plus they cramped as shit     not a bad idea tho bro
  probably a cox cable fuck
  elonmuskdoodlejpg
    retards and their wifi if you are going to do it right ran the damn cabling cat6e in the bunker fiber from the modem to a switch in the bunker
  doesnt matter what material you work with a project like this would be insanely expensive and unachievable unless you were very wealthy     its a neat dream though just wish op could admit he wants to build the batcave and not make up silly stories
  it would only be expensive if you hired contractors that basically dont do anything but direct people    see 
    nothing wrong with burying shipping containers as long as they are     laid upside down the roofs are welded but the floors are open so you need to weld steel sheet/plate between the floor structural bearers  properly braced from the inside and outside  waterproofed with a rubberised membreme     i was going to do this shipping containers are a great base to start with
  drain the runoff into the aquaponics greenhouse    aquaponics is pretty much the worst possible way to be self sufficient youll be buying shit constantly to keep the system fed and in balance anon has clearly never done aquaponics himself or he would know this
  as long as he doesnt spill over im happy for him
  meh theres was to mitigate cost me and a bro are drilling a gas well and converting junk equipment to run on the natural gas then the only investment is running equipment 24/7 when we want to add a room
  lol
  or im not a faggot neet retard and dont try to grow 900 conflicting varieties and know how to run a ph meter and not let my fish go belly up    it isnt rocket surgery    clearly you have never done it only watched fails on youtube     go back to your cartoons and masturbation the adults are talking
  no you do want to use a round culvert its stronger and you use the space under the flooring you have to put down as storage and for utilities
  youre thinking about this wrong he isnt preparing for nuclear war hes just becoming a mole man he can just ventilate the place well he can setup a heat exchanger and condition the incoming air
  on this site in this thread i hate to break it to you anon but adult conversation is definitely not on the menu not here not today not ever
  run coax down to plug into the router whats the point of having to run coax to router then cat6 down to the living area so whenever your modem craps out ya gotta go go up 80ft or whatever what if somebody breaks in then they just destroy the router or cut the cat at least with coax you can run it underground from anywhere and have the tap inside your bunker where nobody from the outside can find it
  you need to buy burial rates coax the same you buy burial rates cat6
  do you not have a job or somthing why do you think most stuff is built out of concrete
  op this is the most un healthiest thing ive ever seen on /diy/  im pretty sure this killed dino tendies
  it wouldnt surprise me to see entire cities built underground in the future  racoon city
    opossum city
  he could except depending on the air temp and air pressure air humidity has an i fluence every degree counts as unimportant as you may think
  if you really have the cash hire an engineer/plagiarize and or adapt one of the higher quality bunkers from sweden they are pretty solid on the bunker preparedness front    most important thing on your end beyond finding a quality engineer/architect would be working out your price range/target population the more people you want to protect the more it costs at the same time you need numbers to actually do anything if you ever have reason to actually use it for its purpose having a few friends/minions to do the shit work and help you not get shot is a very good idea
  its going to be my house and i wont allow anyone to live with me ive found a decent schematic for one that is 3 stories / 3300 sq feet that im working on pricing for
  my plan is to be self sufficient enough to not need to go outside ever
  be dead morlock  scoot out of the protagonists way while being dead
  sewage will be used as fertilize    poo is not great snon its full of heavy elements that are bad for crops piss is good if diluted
are you christopher walken in blast from the past
sterilized poop would need good soil bacteria and fungus added to it for organic growing but once it got full of life you wouldnt need to keep adding more
  nobody said anything about it being secret you retard
  pics or it didnt happen
  at best you get 100w per 1m2 in ideal conditions  no its 200w per square metre so a commercial solar panels generate 48kwh/m2/day  depending on the household energy usage could be something like 2040kwh per day its cheap as fuck to buy a couple of solar panels and a battery for off grid installations   solar panels  batteries would be a perfectly viable option for anon in his bunker providing he consults installation over the phone
  plus they cramped as shit  yeah for you and 40 other dudes in a small sub  if it was just a family thered be plenty of room
  buddy look up living in a nuclear sub specifically all the reasons it sucks you are setting yourself up to pay a fortune for that
  so a commercial solar panels generate 48kwh/m2/day  4800w/200wh 24h  i googled a bit and you were right about the output newer solar panels have an efficiency of about 21  still 200 watts assume perfect conditions and perfect angle and you usually dont get that 24 hours a day
  isnt concrete expensive  lol anon do you think theres an inexpensive way to build an underground bunker  concrete is the cheap way to do it
  waterproofing a submarine  i would think that the previous owners would notice any leaks
  thats not the problem its that your holding poop in for 7 days its literally rotting and fermenting in your ass
  or maybe thats why they intend to be previous owners
  i saved this because of the porn studio and the mermaid lagoon    op have you considered giving up meth
    i am impressed
  consult over the phone    nigger do you know what a wire is and how to do basic math
  not everyone who posts on 4chan is human
  i love you
    fiber
  you know not of our species as fermented human stool is beneficial to our growth   speak not of this mans health he is a food source
  boomers are basically niggers of generations
what is the best legal way to treat shower sink and laundry greywater for gardening and hydroponics assume i use organic biodegradable soaps
  legal would depend on where you live which you didnt mention    any soap youre going to use on yourself or your cloths is going to be organic and biodegradable so again a nonissue    best way to treat this water is trap the solids and foams with a septic tank this doesnt have to be a full on 2000 gallon concrete tank you can do it with a 55 gallon drum with a properly places outlet
  grow your face muscles bro
  oregon coastal range middle of nowhere    using a compost toilet for feces    i want to to outlet greywater to a series of large holding tanks or concrete lagoons in large greenhouses these will contain a layer of finished compost on the bottom for cattails reeds shellfish fish frogs snails and other freshwater flora and fauna    my primary concern is sterilizing the water of microbes in food clothes stained with feces diapers or period blood reusable menstrual pads   and microbes from washing food like fish eggs and meat    the ponds are places to put charcoal and finished compost to be nutrientcharged by aquatic critters and detergents for later growing and to get detergents into the soil and out of the water some of the ponds are used as sources for hydroponics they are open to air except in winter    it doesnt matter if solids hair or froth are in there i just need to kill harmful bacteria    should i run the output through long thin transparent tubes and make sure it gets a few minutes of uv light    i have holding tanks and ponds fed by rainwater from the roofs only legal way to harvest unlimited rainwater in my state an array of pumped hydro energy storage water tanks a battery array solar hot water heaters and hot water storage tanks and photovoltaic arrays to charge batteries and run pumps to send water uphill
  greywater processing is pretty simple you just change what you are using in those drains buy and use safe for plants products thats all however most people dont have access to such products so tiers of lagoons are used with various plants to help clean things up id rather just use products that wont harm things in the first place and to make the lagoon filter thing theres usually not many laws for greywater disposal in this sort of case since you are merely reusing it before finally disposing of it probably via evaporation or as hydroponics runoff into normal sewer    blackwater on the other hand only has a limited number of things that are legal most places for reuse it is going to be composting or biogas methane generation the later being more technical but you get more out of the product yet the latter may also be illegal in your area
  organic biodegradable does not mean you can eat it nor does it mean it is good for your plants organic doesnt even mean much neither does biodegradable  but if you must filter it with multiple stages using sand and carbon then distill it by turning it into steam and then condensing it be aware it will not be 100 clean and you should avoid using it when you have been hot and thirsty as you will not get the same minerals and electrolytes  the human diet is full of chemicals from many sources you are best not letting this waste reenter your body and garden you are better to still clean and then use this water to grow nonedible plants or something
    did you even read what i posted    i need a way to kill microbes so i can reuse this water for hydroponics and the detergents as fertilizer for the same    the soaps and detergents we use are literally edible and completely harmless baking soda vinegar citric acid washing soda and soap which is edible oils/fats and sodium hydroxide aka lye  last i checked salt hydrogen and oxygen arent pollutants    in the future read before you reply or dont reply at all
build a big sand and gravel filter instructions are easy to find
  oregon coastal range middle of nowhere  youre not in a desert why recycle water
  im posting and you cant stop me have you tried only using home made soaps that way you know what youre putting in the water and you might have an easier time figuring how to get it back out what are you going to use the water for
  are you retarded   greywater for gardening and hydroponics
  did you read anything i posted this isnt bleach water were using just things that are harmless and i want to kill microbes    just admit that you stopped teading when you hit a word with more than 2 syllables      will sand kill microbes or is this to remove the soap and solid matter      that is exactly what we are doing are you illiterate i posted that above
  we cant make ponds or cisterns with any water except that which falls on a roof we got around that by putting roofs on ponds and everything else we could get away with we have four openwalled garages honestly very comfy a wrap around porch greenhouses outdoor lounging areas with roofs it helps that its all one floor abd built of rooms connected with hallways and inner courtyards which also have porches    that said we want to reuse water we have and we dont want to waste what is essentially fertilizer in our greywater
  the roof water only pond thing is oregon law btw    we need a shitload of water for our pumped hydro power storage
  how do you get around the contaminated water from the roof bird shit dead insects etc
  i imagine you need to have the ability to flush cleaners to the sewer whenever you clean the shower
  the gravel and sand filter out the solid matter the microbes are killed by a different method over time a wide range of beneficial microbes start to live in your wet sand these naturally fight off the pathogens in the water so the filter works but its not technically the sand doing the work    make sure you build it properly and dont exceed its flow limits though or it wont work because the beneficial microbes get washed away faster then they reproduce    for reference if you want truly sterile water you need to distill it theres no point in bothering though even water from your tap has a certain amount of harmless microbes in it a properly made sand filter will probably be even safer overtreating water can actually make it more dangerous      a sand filters weak spot is chemicals which shouldnt be a problem in your average gray water
  dont bother with greywater for those purposes use it for an orchard
  we run it to a pond then filter it once before it hits a cistern and then again when it hits the house      we use vinegar and baking soda to clean the showers vinegar gets soap scum off the tubs baking soda helps with dried on stuff      thanks for the info well add this to the line between the greywater holding cistern and the greenhouse ponds      is that legal
  hit a word with more than 2 syllables  ill never stop teading and i dont even know what teading is have you considered reusing your gray water you could probably use it for hydroponics if you are interested in that sort of thing might want to find a way to screen out or kill microbes though try making a thread on /diy/ if you want some help with water filtration
just pour it on the ground the dirt will do the rest you retard
  we use vinegar and baking soda to clean the showers vinegar gets soap scum off the tubs baking soda helps with dried on stuff    what about if you need to use draino if a problem arises
  we use snakes for clogs how dumb do you think we are also our pipes are 1 graduation bigger than required minimum
  how dumb do you think we are  well you are too dumb to realize insulting people isnt a clever ruse to get helpful information you describe a setup using a man made riparian habitat to create a primitive tertiary wastewater treatment and then start insulting people like we owe you help    i love those sort of systems they are low tech cheap to sustain and the waste product is great for mulching however fuck you i can be just as much as an asshole as you and i will continue to be exactly that so back to responding to your attitude how do snakes fix clogs i have a ball python named snakey mcsnakesalot and a slow shower drain i put him in the shower more than once but the drain doesnt drain any faster i really think draino is a better solution for drains than snakes it has drain in the name how stupid do you have to be to use a snake
  use a uv lamp or an ozone generator and run the water through itll kill everything in it assuming you do it properly
      seconding orchard irrigation  it is certainly a safe and practical thing to do    dont know if oregon cares    epa says  gray water is reused onsite typically for landscape irrigation use of non toxic and lowsodium no added sodium or substances that are naturally high in sodium soap and personal care products is required to protect vegetation when reusing gray water for irrigation national science foundation nsf international has established a wastewater treatment task group on onsite residential and commercial gray water treatment systems they have developed a draft new standard  nsf 350  onsite residential and commercial reuse treatment systems this standard encompasses residential wastewater treatment systems similar to the scope of vsf/ansi standards 40 and 245 along with systems that treat only the gray water portion for more information visit the nsf website
  interesting     since you already have ponds why not consider sending greywater to a pond or a settling tank then planting water hyacinth   when you need to use the water let it run through a series of 10 inch whole house wound string filters then a uv thing like the ones used for home reverse osmosis systems youll need three filters 10 1 and 5 micron and a prefilter for sediment
  water hyancith is too invasive i prefer native plants or at least slow growing foreign ones with useful characteristics do you know of an aquatic plant that breaks down nitrates removes salt from the water and provides a home for freshwater organisms    i thought about creating an artificial alwayswet/yeararound wetland greenhouse by making a maze for the water to snake through and planting cattails what plants and trees would break down or capture nitrates secrete salt that deer can lick and do well in this environment      what fruit trees can break down nitrates and secrete salt what ground cover should i use if any if i wanted to water plants that drop things for pigs to eat what trees and other plants should i use      lol calm down      uv bulbs i understand but pumping o3 into the water is too much too many moving parts
hey /diy/kheads long time no see i have a roofing question    tldr whats the proper way to patch fastener holes on a roof left behind from a roof anchor    im planning on fixing the gutter system/adding a ton more gutters on my parents rental property adding drip edges and a rainwater collection too its just single story and most of it can be accessed really easily by ladder but on some parts the grade is pretty gnarly both parallel and perpendicular to the house and using the ladder seemed sketchy as hell it looks like i can get better access to some parts via the roof and id like to not die or get permanently disabled over essentially a 1000 job so i guess that means ill be using a personal fall arrest system i see that people usually just nail/screw them on top of the shingles for temporary anchors but i dont want the roof to leak after im done fooling around so whats the best way to patch up the holes left by the roof anchor would it be enough to use roof sealant/caulking/mastic or should i pull the shingles and install flashing under them in addition to the above or fuck just pull the shingles first and put them back after im done
what pitch is your roof cant you just walk it
  shh gdhjdgjdgkej
id imagine pulling the shingles would be the best way some dumbass decided to shoot a few nails through the shingles over one of our bay windows and cover the heads with some sealant which cracked a few years later and started leaking
  id imagine pulling the shingles would be the best way    people who actually work on roofs use something like a mud blade to carefully lift the lower half of the shingle enough to put the roof jack or anchor underneath the shingle when youre done just lay the shingle back down and as long as you didnt tear or break it its fine    actually removing a bunch of shingles is a pain in the ass not to mention that quite often its impossible to match them if you damage one or more
  just throw your life line right over the house and tie it to something on the ground like a tree or a car
  life line runs up one side of roof and down the other  ties to trailer hitch of shitty beat up s10 with 17 natural light cans rolling around in the back  mariachi music blaring  distant sound of people joking in spanish  microwave in passenger seat so they can make lunch   toilet paper trailing out the door of the porta potty in the wind  did i miss anything in my stereotype
    okay sounds good my dudes i might still slather on some caulking over the nail holes and to make sure the ones i disturbed stay down      you gotta walk on the roof to put on the anchor anyway
going to buy 3 acres on the water its just forested land  i have a list of things that ill need to do it im open to suggestions on what is missing in my list to whom it may interest   if this is the wrong board please let me know     the following is the list  land  truck  trailer  electricity solar and wind  tools  outhouse  food  weed   fence  boat  water filter  woodstove  gasoline  ciggs  livestock  livestock shelter  internet  bear spray  gun  flashlights  beehive  fridge  car insurance   seeds  miscellaneous  generator  pay loan 5 months
if youre going to use wind or solar id recommend doing some research into which is more viable in your area and you will need a battery bank charge controller and inverter    youre looking at ten thousand to get something like that in place that would be able to run a fridge 24/7
  im starting with a aprox 550w system and it will cost aprox 1800 fully upgradable interested to see if ill be able to run a small low power fridge/freezer
  a small fridge that you would find in a hotel burns about 90 watts at 120 volts i know because im in a hotel and i just checked for the day it would require 2100 watts at 120 volts  for solar panels you can safely assume that you will get 4 hours of the rated wattage per day so a 550 watt system is barely able to cover a tenth of the required power assuming its 12 volts   im not anti alternative energy im just sharing my conclusions based on the research i put into it when i tried to get into it the only way its really viable is when you have somewhere constantly windy or constantly sunny and even then the cost of buying in is more than a new car
  they have fridge/freezers that run 30 watts will that change things also i will have a gas genorator to charge batteries
  its basic math on how much that will change things instead of only having a tenth you will only have a third of the required power    using generators to recharge the battery will work perfectly fine as long as it is done when you need to deep cycle batteries lose a significant amount of their service life when they are used below 50 of their capacity so if youre not diligent you will pay for it
    you can buy kits for around usd56     cabinet with a standalone 3 in 1 system regulator charger inverter    will power an average 3 bedroom home add more solar panels to increase source kws
  got any pics of the area might be worthwhile to see what youve got available to you
tractor   doesnt have to be big or new something with a front bucket and maybe a backhoe attachment if you can swing it even if its small youll find ways it makes your life easier for reference if you get a 40hp tractor youll be able to run most equipment thats not full on crop production with the amount of land that you have you could get away with one thats in the 30s hp range and not be wanting
alaska florida finland    no cabin or tent     you gave better starting info than many but still not enough      distance to paved road/town
   for the day it would require 2100 watts at 120 volts  nigger what
  this get your units right     however i need about 21kwh a day on averagr fridge laptop monitor speakers oven lights and even heating water for the shower included if you get a few hours of good sunlight a day it will be enough you can always upgrade later to be on the safe side
  no pics   its in nova scotia ill be living in a trailer while building my first house from a larger trailer steel frame  ill have access to dirt road but ill have to make my own road down to the water quite a ways
  specify tools what tools how many whaddya need to get done    what livestock will you be having are you gonna sell some of it or will you have just a couple of chickens or yourself and maybe a pig/goat or a cow also are you hunter or a fisher    how selfsufficient on food will you be aiming  30 60  how about on energy these are important questions
  tools are pretty basic nothing that i wont be able to go buy on a whim i will make a detailed tool list though livestock will be chickens and maybe two milk goats cats and dogs as pets i might hunt or raise rabbits i might hunt deer although i dont really want to kill one i would kill a coyote and eat it i will be harvesting and salting fishes like trout bass mackerel and whatever else i come across going to buy a book on edible plants and will learn to scavenge for seafood along and in the shores   as for energy im pretty certain i wont be able to hook up to the grid without a large money investment so ill most likely and plan on starting completely offgrid with a gas generator for emergency
  i wonder if an atv would suffice
  if that is your plan and your budget will be below 40000 then be atleast halfway decent in crafting stuff then you might live aight  good luck in your project anon
  to be honest im going into it with only 22k minimum i will have to find ways to make money after the first 5 months or so be it start my own buisness or just get a job my master plan is to work during winter and farm during summer
  beehive    they require a lot more work and knowledge than most people realise unless youre already a beekeeper id suggest offering a site to an actual apiary theyll give you some honey and/or cash each year and if you hang around while theyre working theyll most likely be happy to answer your questions most beeks are lovely buggers if you really want to do it yourself join a local club
  thanks ill keep that in mind for sure im definatly not a bee person im afraid of them because my mom brought me up to be afraid of them lol i especially hate wasps kind of embarrassing
a trailer    small tractor vs 4wheeler    maybe an old jeep that you mount a wench on you dont have to tag or insure it if you keep it on the property maybe the trailer could be big enough to tow it on     a gf/wife or even a platonic housemate a second pair of hands in the woods is a huge help and could save your life in an emergency    maybe a second cabin for hunting or fishing buddies you can get cash from them or labor in exchange for weekends    coldframe/greenhouse you can add it to your house and get some solar heat    cistern / well    lake or river     propane fridge heat stove and dryer     stack of good books on homesteading and related
  a second pair of hands in the woods is a huge help and could save your life in an emergency    otherwise no one will know you got your legs trapped under a heavy log at the woodpile until someone comes out to the overgrown compound to deliver a tax notice and finds the corpse / partial skeleton with all the meat chewed off by your own hungry dogs
  maybe an old jeep that you mount a wench on    keep in mind this is a blue board
  ill be on a freshwater lake ill try to get a gf once i set my self up there as for fridge i was planning on getting a mini fridge/freezer then upgrading my solar aray and batteies so i can run a deep freezer books ill have covered   whenever im alone ill have my phone on me or ill get one of those panic button gps things
so i recently bought an arduino uno and i blinked a led to test it  what other cool projects are there which ones have you do yourself
shove it up your rectum
  not to shit on your thread but i really hate when people do this    i have x what can i do with it  you dont get a tool without having a use already in mind i wouldnt go out and buy a power hammer and then ponder about what i can make with it i would already have an idea of a few projects that would require such a tool then purchase the tool     you have put the cart before the horse if you have bought it without a specific purpose in mind then you might as well stick it up your ass as  suggested because otherwise its just going to collect dust     however you could always make a sentient ai that turns into a fascist
    jaded cunts both of you    arduino is a perfectly legit topic to discuss nothing wrong with a noob making a thread to starting learning what other people like to do with it
  theres nothing wrong with asking for help on a project or tinkering with an arduino the problem lies in the i have x what do it seems most arduinos and rpis gather dust because people just buy one without rhyme or reason and then cant find something to do with them or have no motivation    op find something youre interested in and see how you can automate/control/manipulate/whatever with an arduino i got into ucs because i like lighting
i made soap with mine
  shove it up your ass but since thats been suggested already you could attach a microphone with an fft library and make an audio spectrum visualizer     inb4 how do you make an addressable led matrix thats multiplexed using only the 13 digital i/o pins available    
attach a wifi shield and a bluetooth shield onto it and then slide them inside your rectum
if you get a relay shield you could attach motors and different appliances to it before inserting it into your rectum
  jaded cunts
i installed an rf shield on my uno3 now i can open the garage door by tightening my sphincter muscle since its inside my rectum
  attach a flex sensor to your penis hook it up to an arduino with a gsm shield and have it text your mom every time you get hard
  nothing wrong with a noob making a thread to starting learning what other people like to do with it  yes there is if you have this thread every fucking day google it
hey guys i bought an in implanter not sure what it is but what do you think i could do with it it wont fit in my rectum
  start stretching
  you could get a network shield and use it as a rectal firewall
  remote switch    
you guys suck balls
  goatse is your goal not what you should be hoping for initially
i used my arduino to make a motion sensor alarm  thus everytime a turd passed by my butt crack lit up since it was in my rectum
  you could the use a dac to generate a frequency that passes out into two probes allowing you to utilise the dielectric constant to measure the relative moisture of your rectum
  fpbp
    samefag
  not op but that was my first project w the arduino shift register led levels for input intensity be it temp light or sound
  someday microchips will get so small we willl be able to shove them up our phole instead
  thats not what this is or even what this board is for this thread is specifically spoon feed me creative inspiration come on anon this aint pintress make hackaday a search engine or even a topic specific subreddit these are all tools with the purposes op is looking for you are confused with where you are    this is 4chan spartan kicks you into a half buried collapsing shipping container filled with immitation crab meat and bad dragon products
  i need a good source or some ideas what to make some small enclosures for small hobby projects    what you guys do for enclosures
  that thread again well at least it is not a rpi one
  i like to use my rectum personally
  hoarding yeah mostly hoarding containers and things made from materials i like plastic metal wood leather cloth and rubber anything i can cut bend melt glue braise/solder rivet or stitch   drill nibblers reamer and files are your friends along with blades saw and razor    rubbermaid tubs from the snack and sandwich section are easy mode along with painting over gutted thrift shop items the size you need
  okay i get the idea this sounds good i just need to go into scavenger mode and keep my eyes out for anything that can become an enclosure  thanks
  one other idea is your rectum
could i use one of these to measure temperature and when it gets above a certain point supply power to a peltier device to cool it and when it gets below a certain point reverse polarity to heat it also could i add a bluetooth transmitter that would send sensor information to my phone with one of these
  i rectum you could
  i i guess i mean you could probably fit all that inside your rectum
  trying to regulate the temperature of your rectum
  does reverse polarity heat them up
  one side heats the other cools  reversing the polarity makes it swap sides
  but thermocouples work by having two different metals so just flipping the polarity doesnt flip the internal structure of the thing
  two different beasts
  what are peltier coolers and thermoelectric generators are all just arrays of thermocouples
  flipping around a thermocouple or moving the heat source from one side to the other will cause the polarity of the voltage generated to reverse it works the same way when a voltage is being applied to create a temperature gradient
  to heat something up with a thermocouple you put current through it in the same way as if you wanted to cool something down because the thing acts as a heat pump that decreases temperature on one end and increases it on the other afaik flipping the heat source will cause it to act as a generator or heat engine not as a heat pump forcing current though in such a mode is not something im sure of but likely it would produce heat wastefully on both ends
    oh and rereading this it seems youre referring to a heat engine/thermoelectric generator while the original post was about using it as a heat pump/thermoelectric cooler and reversing the current being forced through it as a means of heating things up with it and/or causing it to still act as a heat pump but opposite directions
i do a lot of work with outdoor electronics and they need to be calibrated for temperature and humidity so im slowly working on a rugged handheld battery powered unit that measures and displays ambient temp humidity barometric pressure and contact or ir temperature readings and displays all the data to an lcd pretty excited about it ive toyed with arduinos in the past but when i discovered a need for something like it i really started learning more about the functions and peripheral boards for it
  sounds like a fun project i love any sort of ruggedized electronics
  this
  i dont understand why people get their dicks hard over shift registers when you get a shit ton more functionality out of an eeprom
  i started to 3d print mine  its cheap as shit and i can do them how i want with slots for pcbs and backside mounting plates  it also looks more professional than abs with bad aligned drill holes and curved edges from a saw  contrary to popular belief pla hold up even in vehicles during summer
could attach a gps and servo motor a few wheels and you can have that bitch find and insert itself into your ass
  no one wants to set 5k arrays with dip switches and/or are too dumb and/or lazy to program one with an arduino but yeah they make multiplexing a dream
  they make multiplexing a dream  this
lole this is a project im working on right now
  the hell is that
  whatever it is its on
  i can read co2 pump and 2 h2o pumps along with product pump and possibly water pump ii and those motors look a bit like peristaltic pump armatures the thermometer would also suggest some sort of chemical mixer but i dont think co2 would work well with peristaltic pumps due to the pressure
  anon built a breast pump that can simultaneously pump her feminine benis at the same time
  exactly anon im using one pump to extract the co2 out of the reactor its a really small desktop sized one      nice try fagger
  reactor  what are you reacting
  i didnt know shit about ics so i started with the shift register because i saw people driving long ass segment displays with them for the same amount of wiring and setup of a 4x7 segment display with srs i was able to drive an 8x16 segment display with 4 eeproms fucking magic
get a few cheap servos and do this for halloween  
  what are you reacting    science fair volcanoes
    i bought weather station meters from sparkfun and wrote a ruby script for my beaglebone to read raindrops and wind gauges values worked like a charm until i accidentally fried the beaglebone just before installing it on the roof my other spare boards either hadnt decent adcs or werent easily pluggable to the ethernet  so i had to resort to an arduino i bought around 13 years ago to read weather data and send it over a serial port for an old beagleboard i had sticking around talk about killing an ant using a shotgun
  i am on a couple of different projects right now    usb keylogger with wifi  this was one i sidelined for the longest time but got it working its 99 complete just need to tweak the code debating whether to implement alt  numpad combos for those special characters    another one is a 125khz reader/ duplicator i already have the reader working just waiting on the rest of the hardware to come in
  whats on 125khz that youd be reading or duplicating rfid
  yes sorry i forgot to include that i bought a old hid reader and attached arduino and came across a library on github for it
  christmas came early this year  i just got this pile of stuff  what should i do with it
    oh nice haul simiar to what i bought a while ago curious what is everything you bought
stuff i acquired
  that thing would explode a cow

  you must already have a project in mind why else would you buy all that shit
  i plan to build a night light
  holy shit dawg
  what should i do with it  well since you askedin the rectum it goes mike
i want to make a progressive bar shift light like you see in an f1 car for my motorcycle its kind of hard to look at the tach when getting on it  inb4 shift by ear faggot  i can with my car because ive had it 14 years not so with the bike plus it looks cool
  lost      this    thats a slippery slope before you know it youre the next mr hands or whatever he was called
  peristaltic pump  i knew i had a gif of this somewhere such a clever design        kek the only correct answer
  hey theyre towing your van id be mad if i worked at autozone too better start stretching now while you have the chance
  not shoving 32 pin dips up your dick
  faggot alert
  whats your point
  what can i do with an abestos board  head on down to adafruit and look at all those projects you can do over there
  youre a head bobbin cock gobbler
  oh yeah  wwell your a sloppy goober doodoo head
  i would agree with you in most cases but an arduino is one of those exceptiona where you just buy some shit and experiment with it i did too and by learning as i went i am now able to do some pretty cool shit with it including an outdoor light which switches on based on a preloaded timetable with sunset and rise times making it independent from gay light sensors and leds attached to the undersides of stair steps which can be programmed with a wall mounted light switch i wouldnt have been able to do this stuff if i hadnt made some purposeless blinking led shit beforehand
  checked  nice use of the arduino
  anyone did a ambilight with one of these  is the quality acceptable
  easily possible quality would be perfectly fine
  i saw somewhere that it would update too slow making it looks like it updates at 15fps  is this no longer the case  i have an arduino but its a pro micro so not sure if it has the required interfaces
  oh thats the live tv thing nvm idk
  make it alternate between two leds
  i built this thing for my master thesis last year had some good fun doing it      also kys
  i wouldnt have been able to do this stuff if i hadnt made some purposeless blinking led shit beforehand    i wish more people realized this on this board then again maybe they do and its just the opinionated loud mouths that piss in everyones cornflakes      i remember this its impressive but im wondering what you could apply that to in the real world i imagine rocket engine gimbals might work in a similar manner
  no fuck you
    okay so i got that pile of stuff last weekend finally used some of it and made my first babbysfirststepsproject    i made a blinking led using a 555ic  wooooohooo  its green and it blinks    super basic super simple for /diy/ vets i know but its my first thing i done like this in a long time i have no ee training or education but i find it very interesting and fun but learning as i go starting at the beginnings    eventually once i learn the arduino a bit i want to get into simple robotics data acquisition onboard plc and semiautomated drones that will be the real fun stuff for me someday
  parts list  green led 20ma 332v  2x 1k ohm resistors  470uf 10v cap  3vdc pwr input is two aabatt in series  ne555p ic
  cool anon 
arduino is noob   love these threads especially the guys who forget they had learn to blink an led first actually quite fond of arduino it got me started and i still use them for the get it done projects have begun to progress to avr now as need more power and other packages
  you must enjoy lady adas feminine penis
  not if he buys them for 150 from ali
    cleaned up the layout a bit  i had extra jumper connections in there i didnt need
  is ali the goto place for components  ive never bought anything off there before  most online stores i look at i look at arent any cheaper than amazon   digikey and mouser look more like who id prefer to buy this stuff from but prices are up there    is ebay any good for electronics components
  i do chinesium nanos
  i m p r e s s i v e 
    aliexpress  hory shit i just looked at the prices for electronics components  is this for real literally pennies on the dollar compared to amazon and other online places
    its the way to go if you can get free shipping that is stuff takes like a month to arrive sometimes as few as 10 days though so you kind of have to plan ahead theres a big sale thing going down on 1111 check  for more info the infographic is over a year old though you can buy something for 1 and get free shipping to your door which is economically unfeasible without a sort of subsidy and/or trade agreement and apparently the chinaus trade agreement is collapsing a little so you may not be able to get free shipping on your chinkshit in a few months time if you live in the usa ebay has similar stuff at pretty good prices though with a different selection and from the chinese sellers you get the same free shipping theyre far better for old vacuum tubes and neons and other more obscure parts but ali will probably always have the better selection of cheap massproduced ics and peripheral boards plus theyve got a pretty good return policy there are other stores like taobao and alibaba which tend to have significantly better prices with the catch that alibaba is almost exclusively for bulk purchases and taobao can only be ordered from by a chinese agent    when it comes to buying on ali there are typically dozens of the same product being sold by different sellers and id advise going for the ones that have the most purchases over the ones with slightly cheaper prices if there arent many results at all try changing your search terms ensure you read the listing thoroughly and sometimes youll come across listings with very high or low prices that ask you to contact the seller to have them sell something specifically so make sure you dont accidentally buy one of those you can install aliprice third party plugin to your browser which will give you price histories for all listings on aliexpress to make sure you a sale isnt just a price ramp followed by a return to normal buying on a mobile gives discounts
  okay thanks for the lowdown i have a pretty long shopping list as im just getting into this stuff  so i want to buy a whole shitload of basic components and such sounds like ali could easily save me several hundreds of dollars over the next few months
  masters thesis this was one of our final year projectsdid you implement a pid controller and what board did you use  i remember a the project had to be done using a stm f7 soc no noobduino allowed
  you could probably do that perfectly fine with just opamps if you had some sort of analogue feedback system
  2 pids for position control  used the arduino due cortex m3    care to show me the project you made
  implying you wouldnt take that feminine benis every which way from sunday      adafruit is good for beginners because it gives you every thing you need to complete their project including instructions and support   its more expensive but some people here forget that guidance is included in that price and hate on the place
  so fucking what i detect a mad cager that cant ride and now is butthurt about it    pic related of what i would like to do
  adafruit/arduino usa is poison they build libraries that are not modifiable for actual use their documentation sucks beyond blink they charge 5x the price of the hardware but more importantly they are thieves the arduino concept was from italy until they stole it and setup shop with the exact same name bunch of two faced sjw assholes is what arduino is but no ones knocking down their monuments
  they build libraries that are not modifiable for actual use    explain how open source code cannot be modified
  i bought this to add network capability to the uno
  network board  post ip so we can control your robots
  i still use them for the get it done projects have begun to progress to avr now  still use them  have begun
    maybe he means arduino is c and avr is assembly    who knows
  i meant when he says i still use them i had an image of an old man dusting off a box from his attic and reveling nostalgia of years gone by when he was a whippersnapper  the twist is the reveal that he is just getting into using bare avr and arduino years were only yesterday
  however you could always make a sentient ai that turns into a fascist    no you cant arduino memory cant handle anything like that you simply loaded the lcd demo file and changed the text get out
  i hope this is bait
  kek i cant tell if this faggot didnt get the joke is trolling or is just plain retarded
your benis will be assimilated
  is that who i think it is
  the answer to that would depend on who you think it is
  the underage b version of lady adafruit or whatever shes called
this thing operates on ir and we lost the remote all i need to do is turn the thing on and off and to activate the electric heater  i have difficulty reaching the controls due to a bad back injury and would like to make a replacement  dont even care if its bulky with wires sticking out
  getting a replacement remote is possible but somewhat unlikely making a remote is less likely than that since you dont have an existing remote to demodulate and figure out the right signal to send its probably not possible to add something into the circuit to turn it on and off at the press of a button for the same reason youd need to emulate the unknown received signal after the photodiode so instead id go for a latching relay inline with the power socket and have a remote or long wires leading to a button on that does leaving it on at the front and turning it off then on at the wall keep it on in which case you could buy one of those 10 remote plugs and leave it at that ive a friend whos trying to make his own but its turning out more expensive than what you could buy looking on ebay for a replacement remote is also a very valid alternative if you know what youre looking for    if youre lucky you could look at the circuit of the heater see what ic its using to demodulate the signals and find out what signals you need to send it from its datasheet ie what frequency what order and rate of binary pulses
  you dont have an existing remote to demodulate and figure out the right signal to send  i figured as much doubtful id find them online either  does leaving it on at the front and turning it off then on at the wall keep it on   im not sure but i dont think so ill double check though    im probably not knowledgeable enough but i think it would be possible to just make my own remote with known codes and either hook it up to the circuit board or even make my own its such a basic operation you need to toggle the overall system power and then power to the heater which im guessing uses a relay
  i dont have any experience with messing about with ir remotes but its entirely possible that they all use a similar set of codes of course they cant be the same since then turning on your tv would turn on your heater and ac too but you can buy those universal tv remotes
        would it be possible to buy an ir transmitter and have it go through codes until the unit turned on also does the manufacturer state what their ir code may be
  sparkfun is even worse i wasted a lot of money there because i hated mouser/digikey/rs unpredictable lead times switched to adafruit then stopped wasting money    yet its true that not a single part from them was ever doa or a cheap chink clone    arduino was successful in early 2000s because there was literally no other board with a working ide letting you do things like digitalwritepin1 arduino guys were more tech nerds than marketing experts yet they managed to survive ages past the forest of ino clones and even starting the usual italian drama sue me  no u    the next step was obviously something that could run linux i clearly remember ten years ago the available boards were 16 or 32 megabytes ram then the beagleboard came out a 256 mb ram the original model was 128mb quite well equipped and a new revolution started just like the arduino the beagleboard success was mostly due to hobbyists blogging about their projects 256 mb were  still are  enough to run a full fledged linux box including https and a database as usual a lot of similar boards came out someone sporting more memory some other sporting a hard disk connector no real innovation    in fact with a very few exceptions most projects were no more than the usual nas the usual multimedia box the usual home server to date they still have to learn the first lesson if you strictly demand real amperes and strict 5v you wont go much far if it accepted anything between 6 and 28 volts youll get absurd amounts of automotive and batterypowered projects nope you have to buy adapters and other adapters and extra adapters    then it came the english parochialism the raspberry pi touted as an uk product omg that obviously stands for quality and cheap it was never the cheapest in a few years became the hurr durr new arduino always a couple generations behind the beagleboard always failing at accepting anything other than some amperes at 5v
  with a little extra trickery yes afaik ir receivers and transmitters send ac ir instead of dc they have a frequency of so many hz so the receiver can simply throw a filter on it and get out only the desired data and no ambient ir fluctuations much like morse code receivers so by reading/testing the values of the passives on the receiver you should be able to figure out what frequency theyre tuned to this narrows down half the guessing in the dark though standard frequencies would probably be easy enough to find for the rest the codes themselves youd be better off scouring what existing documentation on other products exist if you cant find it for that manufacturer if you have a phone with an ir blaster you may be able to find an app that can turn the heater on at which point it should be fairly easy to backtrace what code was sent and just throw that into a tiny mcu
  afaik ir receivers and transmitters send ac ir instead of dc they have a frequency of so many hz so the receiver can simply throw a filter on it and get out only the desired data    i didnt know it worked like that anywhere i can read more about ir
  its not something i learnt from existing products but rather something i realised i had to do when doing something similar with a normal ir receiver the ir from sunlight fluctuates by a huge amount over the day so you have to block that with a highpass filter meaning your signal has to be at a high enough frequency the ir from indoor lighting is also quite significant and it oscillates at 100/120hz so you typically have to go a ways above that though in my case we were designing a pulse oximeter so we had to filter out the 100hz fluorescent lighting with a lowpass and filter out the slow ambient changes with a highpass resulting in a bandpass filter that let through anything from 01hz to about 10hz
  designing a pulse oximeter so we had to filter out the 100hz fluorescent lighting    oh wow never would have known that could interfere with a sensor on the finger     i learned a lot just from your post   are you an optical engineer
  physics student it was a class project had everything from filter design to digital signal processing and fast fourier transforms it was a fun paper
  i wish i was smart enough to be an engineer
  me too
  because they dont document what resources they use its learned through the blogs
hey guys im building some automated instruments and ive stumbled onto this      does anyone know what are those things at the bottom are they the electromagnetic relays the dude mentioned in the description ive looked them up and couldnt find similar examples where something would mechanically move just like those things in the video
  solenoids
  solenoids  negro youve made my day  this is great cause ive been looking for relatively cheap ways of making hammers for percussion stepper motors were a bit weak and this looks perfect  thanks bro
  you could use the solenoid to activate something else like hydraulic or air powered
  you could make a weather station or a cheap alarm system  for your rectum
    be american  need alarm system to protect your butthole  gg burgers
  only if youre in jail
  not the anon you are replying to but i thought the same thing
  but i thought the same thing    im too old to follow this part of the thread but i dont think that pic was limor fried who is someone you would recognize from a mile away and have nightmares about for at least a month afterwards
    after actually looking at the pic i guess it probably was her before her final metamorphosis into her adult stage
  her chin gave it away from the pic
not sure if this is the right place to ask but will an arduino leonardo based input device be feasible for playing vidya  i want to make custom controllers for games would the leonardo be fast enough to receive and send inputs or should i look into another piece of hardware
i want to get an arduino or a raspberry and use it to manage an amplificator and listen to music
  sadly this is the worst thing you could do for audio
  why  the story made short is something like this   buy a hifi  tiny silly part breaks  the whole thing stops working  buy another one  same thing again  im tired of being jewed buying the whole thing i have 4 speakers i can use i ws thinking on punchasing an aplifier so i can plug whatever i want to it an if something breaks replace the part instead of everything  and to manage all that a little computer i was thinking on a raspberry/arduino but if that wont work i will go to some low end pc  truth be told im not putting much effort in this project at the moment as i hve little time and money to fuck with
  what would the mcu do though
  allow me to use the thing and play music if i want to pick a song or skip something
  dont need an mcu for that just use a dfplayer module standalone or something similar
  dfplayer module standalone  i0m afraid my knowledge is too limited and i cant understand what you tell me im googling that stuff but all i find are electronic component images  will search more about it
    its got a microsd card slot up to 32gb a 24bit dac left and right outputs and positions for buttons you can send serial commands to it from a micro but why bother if its already got pins for button control feed the output to a stereo classd and youve got a pretty good player i havent tried the thing and have no idea what its audio quality is like though if you want a screen then just buy a chink mp3 player and wire the output into an amp
  i will consider this and bother this thread no more if some day i finally start the damn thing ill post the process here
  how is sparkfun worse
no picture of it but one of my favorite projects so far was a table tennis scoreboard i used two big pushbuttons similar to the ones found on dartmachines for input i used shift registers driving the four seven segment digits to display the score of each player that was before i knew that the max7219 was a thing once a player hits 11 points the score of each goes back to 0 there is also an led for each player to indicate who is serving
  noob reporting inlook what i have created    one step closer to building the perfect animu robot waifu
  where the fuck can you find documentation on the beaglebone blue
  gozimasu
i know a guy that made an arduino submarine he drive it around in a blow up pool its crazy    for a good beginner project my dad replaced the tennis balls in our garage with a stoplight looking thing distance sensor  strip of multicolor leds are all you need
  also worth noting that the chinese arduinos use the same software and everything as the real ones my dad orders like 10 for the same price as one genuine one same goes for sensors and stuff that stuff is all over aliexpress
  now do it in hiragana
  the only problem with stuff on aliexpress is shipping order now for delivery between january 8th and march 19th
  at least for the pi you can get the mag pi magazine which is loaded with projects every month
  why do women in stem need to look poisonous
so im thinking of experimenting with connecting multiple atmega32 units together max distance aprox 6 meters and 4 nodes during prototyping but probably hitting closer to 40 when i start building in earnest    im looking into using a canbus for this purpose to reduce cabling needs as the standard needs twisted pairs of cables for transmission would a standard cat5 cable work for the purpose i cant really think of any better alternative that is also sufficiently protected and easy to cable
  what are you building
  what are you building  started modeling an a10c pit in fusion 360 and currently prototyping panels
  underrated post
  dumb answer yes cat5 works for canbus better answer for low level shit with a lots of noise you can find cheap shielded twisted pair cable online
  thanks ill probably stick with cat5 then due to the fact that i have multiple spools of cat5e in my basement
  im looking into using a canbus for this purpose to reduce cabling needs  do some atmegas come with canbus now i know that the cheap stm32 boards have it built in two actually for the stm32f103  would a standard cat5 cable work for the purpose  dont see why not
  do some atmegas come with canbus now i know that the cheap stm32 boards have it built in two actually for the stm32f103  stm32 do dunno about avr    in the grand scheme of a project like this the additional cost of the canbus hardware is negligible and im not sure if i want the overhead of learning the stm32 architecture right now either but the only real requirement is that the master node needs to be an avr due to the library dcsbios used to interface with the simulator
i want to hook up two different sensors to my arduino but they both need to use the scl  sda inputs on the board  can i use a4  a5 as another set of scl  sda inputs
  fucking kek    hey op  ardumower
  boot on the ground
  if its i2c then its a bus and the devices can share the same pins as long as you give your devices different addresses usually a combination of setting some pins v and gnd add some pullup resistors and you should be good to go then run i2cscanner sketch to see whats what    im running a lcd backpack and 4 i/o expanders off the same sda/scl pins on a cheap arduino nano clone
  you actually dont need pull up resistors for an uno/mega the sda and scl pins have them on the board   i2c is fucking badass imo you can hypothetically run like 1024 peripherals off two pins from your arduino
    i ran the i2c sketch and was able to get the address of my bmp180  address 119    when i run the scan on the ds3231 precision timer all i get is gobbly gook but the data sheet indicates it has an address of 1101000    i dont know how to turn that into an i2c address though
  you can hypothetically run like 1024 peripherals off two pins from your arduino  that sounds awesome but im having trouble getting the addresses
  1101000 is binary but the address you need to put in for wireh is hex try 0068 or x068
  use this to find the addresses for all of your components if youre not hooked up right you wont get anything   make sure your peripherals are getting powered up right some are 33v and some are 5v     make sure you put your address into your sketch in hex as  said   and it should really be 0068
  i2c is fucking badass imo you can hypothetically run like 1024 peripherals off two pins from your arduino    yep its a cool interface so easy to get stuff working and you can get it to run at 400khz instead of the standard 100khz like so if your devices support it most do nowadays    twbr  (((f_cpu / 400000  16 / 2     when i run the scan on the ds3231 precision timer all i get is gobbly gook but the data sheet indicates it has an address of 1101000  i dont know how to turn that into an i2c address though  1101000 in binary  0x68 in hex so something like  wirebegintransmission0x68  wirerequestfrom0x68 number of bytes to read here  or even   wirebegintransmissionb01101000   etc  might work mind you someones already made an arduino library for it so try that
    okay ill try that next thanks
i am planning on making an automated watering system based on the uno i plan on using 2 solar panels giving out 4 volts stepping that up to 12 to charge a 12v battery that will power the arduino and a 12 pump at first i will use the arduino as timer but i want to see if can do something with the a humidity sensor
  how about a moisture sensor    
  yeah i meant that but at first i wanna see if it will be able to recharge it self and then expand upon it
    btw should i use lipo/liion or stick with a lead acid one 
  offhand idk which would be best for solar charging and storage
  the moisture sensors based on soil conductivity are cheap and easy but a bit shit the electrodes corrode after a while look into capacitive sensors to avoid this problem
figured it out they made can integrated avr for the automotive industry for both the 8 bit and 32 bit chips going to get those as they cost roughly the same as their normal atmega versions but save me 5 dollars worth of can controllers/transceivers per unit and takes up less space than fitting those
  lol just noticed the at90canx chips all seemed to have like 2k or 4k minimum order but its all good atmega16m1/32m1/64m1 line has a can controller too and is just your normal atmega otherwise
  ehh bugger they dont come in dip format so i guess ill do the prototyping with an external controller/transceiver and change when i convert to pcb
  will they give you some free engineering samples to play with if you asked
  lead acid is waaaaay easier to charge just throw a blocking diode in and youre done lipo/liion need cv/cc charge circuits and theyre more expensive even nmh make your power circuit exponentially more complicated expensive than la    yup i read someone used a bme280 inside a cup upside down burrried and the soil and it worked a lot better than those chinsey adafruit probes and for something like that you should cover all of the other subterranean parts in silicon or nail polish to keep them from corroding to shit
  or rather theres standard breakout boards available for both qfn and tqfn might as well use that so i dont have to redo the bom afterwards i sure do notice my lack of experience in this field havent touched a soldering iron since university thankfully i did have classes on electro engineering so im not completely green      will they give you some free engineering samples to play with if you asked  doubt it cant be bothered either due to time constraints i noticed it was only the cheaper at90canxxx ones with huge minimum orders the atmegaxxxm1 were available in singles they atmega ones have like a third of the message buffer size tough but its ok for the nodes only the master that interfaces with the simulator needs a big one and i can shell out the extra few dollars for the more expensive kind there
  what kind of screen/shield is that if any  the standard lcd screen requires like 20 wires and takes up all signal ports for any other devices
  looks like an oled of some kind
    looks like the generic 128x64 chinese oled  they cost like a dollar
  the standard lcd screen requires like 20 wires and takes up all signal ports for any other devices  you need to use a controller noone in their sane mind does 1 to 1 pin connections for an lcd
so i rethought the watering project i am gonna skip the battery entirely and use a moisture sensor the unit will operate only during daylight and it will use the sensor to tell when watering is needed
  check youtube for videos on running an lcd/oled with i2c you can get the display with the i2c backpack included so you know they work     might want to hook up a supercap or small la battery so your arent constantly rebooting the controller every time the open cell voltage from your solar gets above 5v then immediately shuts off when the system kicks load on or just plug it into your wall
  i bought a sparkfun mpu9250 breakout board turns out a power trace is too close to the magnetometer i was getting heading accuracy twice as bad as the heading accuracy i get using a hiletgo breakout board  so i can confirm sparkfun bad
  have fun spending the rest of your life in guantanamo bay
  remember to include instructions how to charge the capacitator
hey guys i am working on project using esp8266  pic related    i want to communicate with the esp8266 using my android phone     i did some google searching and i see people saying doing post and get to communicate with it    is this the only way or is it the best way
godammit ive been working with rf modules in order to transmit information from one arduino to another since communication is asynchronous i need some method of ensuring the receiver reads the data correctly data occupies 4 bytes  in one method i added a prefix with a pattern that does not match any combination of partial packets and all is fine 3 bytes at 255 but theres a catch im using a joystick with 6 buttons and im assuming that the user cannot press them all at once otherwise the very first information byte can be at 255 the two lowest significant bits of the first byte are used for one of the axis  in order to attempt a strategy that allows me to use said combination of buttons i also tried an additive checksum just one extra byte but for some reason the son of a bitch gives me a lot of errors due to ambiguities from overflow does anyone here have experience in this crap
  nvm il just shift some bits and always have the latest bit of the first byte at zero i just find it strange that the checksum method kept giving me crap
  no what are you wanting to do it matters
  download file from spiff on esp8266 change settings like in general and wifi settings parse file and view it on my phone    stuff like that if that helps
  is this the only way or is it the best way  basically with a wifi module you got the tcp/ip stack you can do whatever you want to do with it that you can do between computers using a rest api makes sense for most normal situations where you dont require a constant connection otherwise you can just run a normal socket if you need constant connection or use an  server that is configured for a permanent connection    tldr post and get is perfectly fine use sockets if you need a live connection
  sockets ftp post etc watch where you put the loop its all meant to be written asynchronously
  that garbage is going to kill you plants use one of those for the prototipo and for the real version get a capacitor moister sensor
my sisters dog is darker than the night itself and its hard to keep track of her visually   what do you think about an led collar that automatically turns itself on and off when via a light sensor that way i can just open the door to let her out when she needs to go to the bathroom at night without needing to switch anything on
i made a thing   bme280  20x4 lcd with i2c backpack the library for that backpack was a nightmare to find but it was 280  voltage divider battery monitor    also you can put it in your butt
  do this one op
  also you can put it in your butt  i think you know what to do op
semi related has anyone here used a strain gauge  any type precise enough to track muscle movements
  any type precise enough to track muscle movements  subtle movements like tightening muscles no idea  actual limb movements definitely the power glove in all seriousness did just that and it does actually work a lot better than you would think its just that the title backwards compatibility worked like crap and its generally a shitty way to play games the one custom coded game for it that was released did actually work great
  toilet cam
  i want something more precise though enough to maybe track finger movements from your wrist or facial movements
  enough to maybe track finger movements from your wrist  that can be done    or facial movements  thats in the realm of cameras and machine learning algorithms
  bumping for dog collar help    based power glove the 90s was a great time to be a kid desu we still had imaginations and played outside and tech was just coming into its own including portable gaming    what are you working on
  nothing i just want to know if something like that exists could be useful in the future
  what help do you need for your light up dog collar   plastic coated led string  arduino nano  photoresistor to analog input  cover the electronics in silicone caulking for water/abrasion resistance    do i need to write the fucking code for you
  another pile of boxes appeared at the door  oh no what could it be
  looks like its a bunch of stuff
    so anon are you the arduino version of bepis you buy lots of shit but never do anything worthwhile    show us your cool blinkies
  maybe i dunno  got a few ideas of things i want to build dont know how to program arduino too well yet though not much time to work on it right now  so far i made some blinking leds  got my lcd to display  and was able to get sensor data from sensor to arduino and to the lcd display  if i get a long weekend i plan to do something more
  hi guys i bought an arduino because i saw something on reddit what can i do with it
  hi gais im here to parrot memes because im so smart than everyone
  it is possible
  dude and arduino with any of the available microcontrollers on it is actually way overkill for a controller i doubt any mainstay controller pre 2005 had a controller in them it was just wirings and an encoder    so yes you can build a controller with a leonardo
      semi related has anyone here used a strain gauge    i used one to measure how much a steel beam was bending in a physics class they are very precise and sensitive to any kind of bending    but you have to think about the application while it can detect movement is it the best option or could you do the tracking in a different way
what would i need to have a realtime display of the speed of all four wheels on a full size car
  vehicle speed from speedometer  convert miles into feet  divided by tire circumference  hour x 360   feet per second
  speedometer
i see an interface like this that is common in movies tv and games     would a setup like this work best with a raspberry pi controlling multiple arduinos for each piece of hardware    for example if i was making a starship would the oxygen system be controlled by a simple arduino surrounded by radiation protection and cooling
  is everything on a spaceship controlled by arduinos   no nigga what the fuck are you even on
  arduino micorcontroller is captured alien space technology from the roswell crash in 1947  took 75 years to get it released to the public thanks to the hard work of people like like david icke richard hoagland and whitley streiber god bless them brave heroes uncovered govt hidden secrets and lies
  arduino is a layer of absolute aids bullshit software abstraction on a microcontroller  it would never be used for anything by anyone who knows anything because it hinders development and features of the bare metal  a space vehicle probably would use a robust version of a microcontroller or fpga to control each subsystem however multiple systems on a single chip if it makes sense isnt an issue systems can go down individually if it relies on input from a sensor that goes down the controller doesnt have to go down to fail a system  if you take cars as an example you see how we believe is a safe and robust way to do things ecu to control the engine and then over the years extra computers from obvious things like abs central locking/alarm and increasingly to why the fuck is that a computer like fog lights or indicators they all communicate typically through canbus which is interesting in itself because like all half driven systemswhat is the technical term fuck))) it has an inbuilt efficient message priority system where one message in a collision always makes it through    the most simple system in your scenario is the controller because all it does is monitor ironically it probably takes 99 of the system to display the results on a fucking monitor vs actually gather the info from other systems
    could this read help you beeing less crabby         for op if youre into music hooking up an old 50100 pedalboard to a midi interface with the arduino is like 5 to 10 times cheaper than store bought depending on pedalboard size im having a lot of fun with this shit  
  wouldnt it be more cost effective to put an arduino in radiation shielding rather than build a hardened microcontroller
  youre missing the point the arduino ide and the way it operates as a controller is the problem get something that runs python or find/build a purposedesigned controller so you can get away from the ide actual aerospace process controls work more like plcs than arduino
  okay let me rephrase the question is it better to put your favorite microcontroller in radiation shielding than to buy an extremely expensive radiation hardened one
built a night light  wiring circuit was kind of tricky but i got er done  sips
  i mean  
  very nice anon
    thanks for the help but what i need is to track the speed of each tire as the vehicle brakes when wheel bearings wear out on my truck the antilock break kicks in the thing is if only one bearing is going bad it triggers the whole system on all of the wheels then its the guessing game about what bearing is setting it off its a pain the mechanic has a machine thatll do exactly what i want to make it tracks the speed of each wheel while braking and they can use it to isolate the problem bearing id rather not buy the unit because like most other automotive electronic diagnostic equipment its horrenously expensive and is only used for one thing tracking wheel speed i figured id make one myself to keep my hands busy during winter a better question to ask would be what sensors would i need for this and can i make them connect with bluetooth to eliminate the hastle of wires
  maybe you could use the existing abs sensors  i think theyre proximity sensors that detect a kinda toothed ring on the hub  wouldnt need to figure speed just know when one is a lower frequency than the others
  this could work if you can tap into the signal youd have to trace the sensoroutput/wiring harness to find the right wire  i think its some kind of analog signal    otherwise to make your own sensor array mount your own sensors on the wheels send the signals to a data logger that converts said signals to tire rotation speed    you could use a detector/emitter pair or proximity sensor or a hall effect sensor  set it up to get a sensor output pulse once per tire revolution
  although the abs trick will identify the problem bearing youre retarded in thinking you should just replace the bad one do both sides and worry not a manual inspection of the bearing will tell you which one is which its just labour intensive     you probably have hubs instead of bearings making it mega expensive but i can tell you if one is going the other isnt far behind of course it will fail when u need it most
  just replace all of them its like 15/wheel and itll be less labor than rigging all of this up
how do i turn my arduino into a realtime current/power meter for 230 v ac current    do i need a fancy module or is it possible to translate a signal from a wire wrapped around the lead a few times
  for voltage you could technically use a voltage divider with nothing but resistors for current you can use a shunt resistor and measure voltage drop across that thats probably the most straightforward way for a diyer sketchy as diff though and that only gives you apparent power which is like 30 of the equation
  i used a rpi to implement a rfid front door lock much easier than getting keys out just swipe my wallet or phone and the door is unlocked
  speaking of rpi im about to consider buying two yardstick ones and another rpi just so i can make my own version of rolljam    but none the less lets see if someone can help me with radio frequency    so i ordered these off of amazon theyre transmitter/receiver at 315mhz which they do work at that frequency according to sdr      i went off of samy kamkar digital ding dong here      to write my code also i was being autistic with the code it use to be cleaner but my autism kept going crazy on me        hardware i used is a arduino uno     pic related is two signals top is he original signal from the doorbell bottom is the signal from my arduino    some how its leaving a huge gap in between certain signals earlier i cut up the noise just to compare in audacity and my signals bit period as i call are near identical if anything its 0001 off which for a cheap doorbell im sure it wouldnt make a difference    i can barely find any documentation or any good info about these receiver/transmitters    is there anything i can do to fix this or what can i do any libraries would help with this that actually work with transmitter/receiver
  i forgot to mention not sure if this makes a difference but the three times i get those huge gaps in my signal i noticed my   delaymicrosecondsus  last  bitperiodlowdelay  spits out 150 three times could that be the cause of it
  ok i figured it out it was the negative values of 150 i was returning i went into audacity and checked the delay inbetween where the signal was stretched and all came to 320us and added this in and now i can ring my doorbell    code  if i  0  ushur  lasthur  bit_periodonelowdelay  150   delaymicrosecondsushur  lasthur  bit_periodonelowdelay   else if ushur  lasthur  bit_periodlowdelay  150   delaymicroseconds320     /code

i accidentally bought a lot of 50v3a rated diodes in a fair since every diode brings down voltage by 07v im planning to build some insane bridge/divider      fake and gay  you wronged the erroneously wrong wrongest part about resetting linestart 0x80 every 20 characters      noice  pics or it never happened      because they are just attentionwhoring  also theyre mostly gay      a while ago i spent an insane 150 bucks for a canbustousb converter for a car bought in 2006  no fuckin way to use canbus the only working thing was the obdii interface wtf  yes i tried adapters and resistors between can and can no luck      top kek  leave it out to the usual sparkfun  adafruit      i used udp packets because sockets suckets and i dont want stale requests floating around selfcontained 504 bytes safe payload instant shipping no need for connections hurr durr get post reee my first 4 bytes in the packet are contain a request serial number so i can send it many times until it gets an actual reply android side you will have to add some jni c function to manage udp data      im still searching for a sulphur sensor because i read that farts and poo smell depends on the sulphur gases it would be nice to have a large display in the bathroom meet the eww monitor  your last fart sent my sensor off the charts      a cheap obdii interface  basically youll give at commands on a 9600 baud serial port      space things use a 200 mhz mipslike processor because its currently the only thing that is radiation hardened low temperature resistant and seriously field tested  yet a single bit failing somewhere in a superverifiedhardenedthing renders a 15years space mission a huge fail      you need one of those ac sensors that output a 0to5v value you can analogread  performance will be ugly 1024 levels means if you top to 5 kilowatts you will have a 5 watts resolution
  daaaaaaaad  get off of 4chan youre embarrassing me
  weight is an issue for space applications so better to use a radiation hardened device than encasing something in lead or a steel box or something like that you could maybe use the weight saved to put an extra sensor package or two in orbit instead
  this could work if you can tap into the signal youd have to trace the sensoroutput/wiring harness to find the right wire  i think its some kind of analog signal  maybe its already available on the can bus in your vehicle youd have to work out how to do packet sniffing to figure out what data is being sent though and filter it out from everything else being sent
    good places to start thanks guys     when i have 1 bad bearing i just replace them all it takes 5minutes per with the press to take it all off and put it back on im trying to figure out if theres a consistency of which bearing wears more if theres a pattern id like to figure out why ive driven on a bad bearing for hundreads of miles itll still roll if the bearing craps out while im driving im just making a hobby project around that involves my mechanical knowledge and helps me expand into coding/electrical im not going to say its a practical application but ill learn along the way and have something to do besides playing with my dick all winter
  something to do besides playing with my dick all winter  doing things other than playing with your benis   weirdo
  generally the sensor array and wiring would be fairly simple  the actual placement and mounting of the sensors to your wheels would be the main challenge of course
  thats where im wondering if itll be easier to use the obd and find it through the code or to figure out how to set the sensors and run wires to collect somewhat usable data id rather not monkey around too much with the truck itself if i want to use the obd i might as well just use a laptop to read everything right is this still a good project or should i just make a backup sensor with lights that guide me back to hooking up to trailers
  weight is an issue for space applications  yes but what if wasnt as much thinking more of building a cost effective ship
okay got some sensor data displayed  think i might have fried my 96 oled so back to the 20x4 lcd    question is how to force the output to display leading zeroes on a two digit number    for hrs min  secs for example when they are less than 10 i need them to display as a 03 instead of a 3
  ifmin10 serialprint0  serialprintmin
  what kind of turtle purse is that
  tfw this is like 80 of why i dont have an engineering degree  if only there were more latina baristas trying to become engineers i couldve learned something
  i get an error    min was not declared in this scope
  question is how to force the output to display leading zeroes on a two digit number    use sprintf to create a string see printf doc to learn how to format the string    pic related has an example like you need
  since youre using gpstimeminute to get minutes   assuming commented out code works  just insert  if gpstimeminute10 lcdprint0  before  lcdprintgpstimeminute)))
  apparently im too dumb to understand this string stuff right now but thanks though ill have to study and experiment with it for a while
  that worked  thank you anon
  learning string formatting pays off rather well
  i dunno i just got my arduino and was poking around and shift registers came up they seemed useful so i got a couple ive since got a handful more of ics for driving leds and displays and stuff but i had a lot of fun with shift registers and im glad i know how they work now
collecting a bunch of bits and bobs  buttons switches lights just all kinds of goofy things  tfw plan on building a useless panel or box thats just covered in said switches buttons and lights for my niece    wont do shit flicking switches blinking lights maybe a buzzer on it so my sister will hate me itll be fun though
  frost that jar build a joule thief so it runs on dead batteries
i wanna make some prosthetics like this ones    for people in my third world country but sensors are expensive as fuck feels bad man
  they seemed useful so i got a couple  mate ive got 50 164s and 50 595s you can never have enough
  an arduino just for a light sensor  jesus christ not everything needs a mircocontroller
  one possible solution a photoresistor in a wheatstone bridge going to an opamp if the opamp cant power the light directly have it bias a transistor to power it
  dont just coat this in silicone thats just asking for it to become a chew toy one that will break apart and be swallowed
  now that you know how those work a good project is building/coding an eeprom programmer so next time you want a whole fuckton of logic outputs you can just plop your chip into a premade breadboard doodle a couple lines and youre done seriously eeprom can do everything your shift register does but better and faster if nothing else making the programmer is fun
  seriously eeprom can do everything your shift register does but better and faster if nothing else making the programmer is fun    take an example like his 4 digit display up there which will need 32 logic inputs using the 595 shift register i can drive this display using 3 logic outputs and 4 daisy chained 595s     what eeprom would you recommend to do this better and faster and how many logic outputs are needed to control the eeproms id love to get away from the 595 shift register if its as inferior as you say and when you say faster are you referring to development or actual operating speed
  hey anon try to order from somewhere else if factory moq doesnt suit your evaluational use case although i always got engineering samples on request but that may have changed over the last decade
  im still searching for a sulphur sensor because i read that farts and poo smell depends on the sulphur gases     hey anon my first thought was a diy way to gas chromatography on asking google about it i was informed about a diygaschromatographhtml on a blogspot by nerdytoad does it look viable to you
  farts and poo smell
arduino questions    sketch programming related i think    lets say i plan to build a handheld device maybe about 4 wide 8 long 2 thick  approx guess using an arduino with 3 or 4 onboard i2c sensors like precise timer temp altitude pressure speed  direction and lcd or oled display maybe multiple displays with an array of buttons switchs to control select various outputs to display    so lets say i want to be able to take the various sensor data and have the arduino sketch calculate different things from it or make it selectable to display in different units with maybe push buttons toggle buttons or rotary encoder switch    i presume i would need a bunch of if/and/or/else/when statements in the sketch in order to make it calculate convert display different things based on my input and a whole bunch of functions which include the data conversion calculation commands    does this sound like the right approach i feel im almost getting into plc territory but still the idea is probly more than simple enough for the arduino to handle just alot of programming im guessing    what do ya think
  i presume i would need a bunch of if/and/or/else/when statements in the sketch    yes and just stop where you are and do one thing at a time first get the display to work then use one button to learn how to do if/and/or/else/when programming     then add one sensor and develop a good display for it     repeat until you are done pic related is an avr the chip in arduino project where i started small and eventually went crazy with sensors to measure lots of things on an old truck at one point i was sending the data to an android tablet via bluetooth to plot things like engine temperature vs time but then i realized i had gone overboard
  but then i realized i had gone overboard  nah overboard is an upload to a cloud instanced that lets people see a dashboard of your egt and timing advance go nuts anon
  the only issue with that image is that you havent cleaned it up moved it to a pcb and kept going youre basically just beginning to eek out what would be considered useful data for a system like that      this shouldnt be that much programming but details are a little thin in your post just go for it and youll find out about how much work it is
  the only issue with that image is that you havent cleaned it up moved it to a pcb and kept going youre basically just beginning to eek out what would be considered useful data for a system like that    i only made two one to be in the truck while i play with the other one and ive eeked about enough water temperature with overtemp alarm trans fluid temperature with overtemp alarm low oil pressure alarm left headlights on with ign off alarm mph tachometer total miles trip miles total miles since last fillup enter gallons and it displays miles/gallon thats a lot of eek to me    the board layout is comically bad because it started with 3 7segment digits and i realized i needed 4 the other board looks less retarded

  yeah ill look into that
i was looking to upgrade my old school fireplace with a fireplace insert well some fires rolled through the area recently and did a shitton of damage to local homes i was not affected but i know natural disasters like that can greatly increase the prices of building materials what about something like a fireplace insert which is generally not installed in new construction    also does anyone have any recommendations of models or brands to look into i am looking towards a wood or pellet burning model as running a gas line to that part of the house would cost a ton of money
why dont you go to reddit or quora and ask this question
a wood stove ffs
  i was not affected but i know natural disasters like that can greatly increase the prices of building materials what about something like a fireplace insert which is generally not installed in new construction    this might sound crazy but call the store and ask

buh bye now
holly shit
  how could you give your brother the ol spicy ice cream
wasabi isnt even hot pussy fag nice job here mods
  if /g/ /biz/ and /jp/ are anything to go by the mods are protesting the split by letting the place fester there has been ongoing gore and porn dumps on all of them that stay up for hours and hours
bong here i have a bathroom floor similar to pic related if i want to replace all the fucked floorboards with something other than floor boards what would /diy/ recommend i would even rip the whole floor up and replace the lot
  that looks like subfloor did someone already do half the job and say fuck it and stopped    personally i stick with tile or linoleum for bathrooms water damage is less of an issue
  the problem i have is that the tongue and groove is nonexistent and so each board moves in relation to its neighbour when i walk on it so lino will just get fucked up i dont feel comfortable putting tiles down on a movable surface either what about 18mm osb
  i was thinking of covering it with pic related from international decorative surfaces as it is waterproof
  18mm either osb or ply would be typical but without adding extra bits of wood in along the joins between sheets perpendicular to the joists the edges will deflect  probably you should check the joist centers make sure they are close enough for 18mm sheet if its 400mm or something then no problem otherwise you are fucked because good luck finding somewhere with 18mm unless you are down south i suppose probably have it down there no problem  doesnt need to be much 2x3 or 38x6363 cls should do  if its bathroom or near a kitchen sink or something you should really be getting something rated for water i cant be bothered looking it all up but plywood has ratings for both the wood and the glue separately and no retailer anywhere in the uk will tell you what any board is rated to bq stock metsawood boards and you can check the ratings of metsawood products on their website but good fucking luck getting any lazy cunt to tell you what board is what product number email customer services they say ask in store well fuck you too  osb is osb3 for the most water resistant but its not exactly marine ply and its actually the only rating ive ever seen anywhere even in proper merchants so thats probably what you end up with  you do get tongue and groove chipboard for lofts but of course i hope you know its garbage  i redid my bathroom floor a while ago and the boards were all fucked but something stupid like 28mm i thought great idea ill replace one or two with decking boards which worked actually great for a temporary thing but its 18mm hardwood exterior rated whatever the fuck that means ply because i just gave up on the standards     here it is bs en 314 is the glue and bs en 636 is the veneers      used to be called wbp water boil proof   you might still find it sold as such
  if its moving then reinforce the subfloor with a strong underlayment before you put a covering on it like 3/4  osb    oh you thought of that    carry on
  reinforce the subfloor  yeah and dont forget a step ladder to climb up onto it ffs
  wow thanks for a very complete answer anon yeah i was looking at the osb3 in bq and no i cant find anything bigger than 18mm the joist centers are 483mm 19 inches but if i need to i could add crossmembers to support the osb i thought about using offcuts to brace the joints and theyll be close to a wall where noone will be standing on the floor marine ply is about three times the price of osb but is probably much more rigid and water resistant
  my floor was fuckin gross i soaked the place in bleach and laid 1/4 plywood all over the house stained and like 6 coats of varnish    if high traffic one or 2 coats of finish a year vut it doesnt look horrible and was chesp
  marine ply is fucking sas stuff its designed to literally live underwater  if you can find en3143 en6363 it should be a little extra but nowhere near marine ply  but of course if you are putting lino over it its not going to see much mater because its covered hopefully as for tiling i think you have to seal it first anyway but im no tiler  probably you can put down whatever you want and then paint it with polyeurethane varnish  you are supposed to seal the edges anyway
thanks for all the answers im going to copy all the data here and see what i can find ill even check some local wood merchants as they will likely know more about what they sell than the staff at bq
  ive never considered finished plywood for flooringinteresting it looks unfinished in my opinion but doesnt look horrible with a darker stain
  the problem with plywood is the seams without tongugroove joints each seam pulls up with age which you can see in your pic    its plenty durable but itll look like ass in 10 years way better then youll get in 2 years with a bare wood floor though
  that floating soap dispenser is triggering the shit out of me
  oh god i hadnt noticed that the pic was more for showing what flooring would be going on top of the ply/osb    just another quick question would i be better to nail or screw the ply/osb down im leaning more to screwing as it would make for easier removal if i ever have to pros and cons
  that looks terrible
  nails are faster screws will actually hold the wood down
  that makes perfect sense ill go with screws
could be worthwhile having a think about a self leveling floor compound fill in the worst gaps in the boards with acrylic sealer and put a primer on them to prevent them from taking up moisture from the levelling compound    ensure boards are screwed down too once youve put the compound down you can tank the room and put tiles down
i was presented with a problem to which i have no clean way of solving so maybe someone can help    theres an apartment building with lets say 20 apartments each apartment has its own electricity meter and they are all located in one place outside of the flats problem is the people who connected the meters with distribution boards in the apartments arent marked so i dont know which meter measures which apartment is there any way to discover this without breaking walls or going into the flats themselves
    if its an existing complex then whoever sent the bills last time around knows   if its a brand new construction then whoever wired it knows or is at fault for not labeling them and so they will have to solve it at their expense    how the fuck does this situation arise op
  is there any way to discover this without breaking walls or going into the flats themselves    what kind of fraud/revenge are you trying to commit
  go out to the panels and make a note of any that arent moving at all  go back inside and turn off every appliance and unlpug everything the new one that isnt moving is yours
      im not trying to commit a fraud or revenge a friend asked me if i can find a solution to the problem thats all    the construction is new people already moved into their apartments im not sure if they paid their first bills yet this situation arose because this is eastern europe and nobody minds rules or regulation especially with electricity since so few regulators understand it or actually care about it not to mention they meters probably werent marked in schematics
    i thought of something similar like that i was thinking to just flip off the limiter on the board and check which meter isnt moving but that would require me to enter the flat which is apparently not allowed anymore friend didnt tell me why i think this is the only solution but maybe someone has a different idea
  you cant enter your friends flat or he cant enter it intrigued
    neither me or the friend has access anymore maybe im mixing terms but when i say flat i mean individual apartment not the building this is because the apartments were sold long before the building was finished so people moved in the second the building got done and we arent allowed inside their property anymore
  umm did your friend buy/rent the apartment did he get evicted or was he just squating there until they were built
    haha no my friend is the investor who had the building built and then sold the individual apartments in it
  he should be able to contact the contractor and find out the info or raise hell with them to come out and label them
mfw finding out about squatters rights  wtf is wrong with your country
    what this has nothing to do with squatting
  i imagine easiest will be to hook up some high wattage consuming equipment on a quiet part of the day and see which disk will start spinning like mad those small electric heaters should be enough since theyre portable and suck out the life of power plants like nothing else does

  shut off the main breaker to each unit one at a time and note which apt power goes out and which meter shows low/no power consumption  repeat until all 20 units identified and label meters accordingly
wait for night when the majority of apartments have their lights on flip the breaker on each meter and monitor which apartments lights go out
  get your friend to plug in as much load as he can heaters lights whatever go to the meters call him and wander down to the meters turn everything you can on dryers tvs toasters kettles all the lights check which meters disk has gone full retard have him turn everything back off and confirm the disk has slowed back down done
  someone mentioned squatting and my google searches took me downhill from there first time on the chans
  the construction is new  contact the electrician that did the install
  contact the electrician that did the install    in the us you should be able to plug one of those rf tracers into an outlet and use the matching probe to find the breaker and corresponding meter i dont know if they are available where you are      also cant you just ask the utility where the bills are sent for the meters kind of like  said
      for some fucktarded third world reason op says that he needs to do this without going into the flats
  i smell an italian op
  since you cant enter any of the apartments you could try this  go the building in the evening  pull meter out  when the tenant comes down to figure out what is going on ask them their apartment number  label meter   repeat
easy just map it out
analog meter  kys
  why does he need to know not his building anymore
anyone make one of these before i was thinking about getting 660nm led light strips and making like a light box with them but this is the first time i have tried anything like this and the red light devices are expensive for poorfag me
  what is the device intended for im interested
it is used to heal certain ailments and rejuvenate skin there is a ton of evidence behind it for those two claims it cuts inflammation some think it can increase iq but that is totally unproven      
  there is a ton of evidence behind it  im interested in reading about it do you have any links
heard it is good for balding
  get proper wavelength laser diodes  get proper wave length leds  3d print helmet  wire it up to a micro controller so the lasers flash for maximum broadspectrum rejuvenation    thats the best i can do short of holding your cock and building the fucking thing for you
  id build it for him too but then theres me  id even use it to help my skin
although ascetically pleasing they create little more than a semiannual maintenance hazard ive tried various style of gutter guards and cleaning cannot be avoided at least in california where we dont have enough rain to regularly flush small debris
  yes
i say pick trees or rain gutters but not both
  there are installed systems that carry a home lifetime guarantee they actually come out and clean it when it blocks up no squabbling they send a guy and he cleans it
  rain gutters keep water from being deposited at the base of your home where it can then fucko the foundation   having an overhang that extends further beyond the foundation is the better option for multiple reasons  a stone foundation coupled with an extended overhang are paramount to a 200 year home  ignore the false stone foundation on pic related its the roof i want you to see
  i have a concrete foundation and no basement before the gutters the rain would cause moisture to occasionally blister the stucco     in hindsight it seems like more trouble that its worth but this is my particular situation
  cleaning cannot be avoided  big deal  make a shop vac attachment out of some schedule 40 pvc and a couple of 90 sweep bends  stand on ground vacuum out gutters    i do a two story house on a steep slope this way no need for ladders much quicker all the slop ends up in the vacuum not dropped on the lawn
  make a shop vac attachment  stand on ground vacuum out gutters  i have to own another piece of equipment just to use it several times a year    im just saying if you dont need gutters dont get em
      you know they have leafproof gutters anon
  since ive a slab foundation and no frost line i dont bother with gutters i placed crushed asphalt beneath the eaves so the runoff isnt a problem and grass promptly grows through the asphalt
  yes     i was plesantly surprised with the vinyl gutters i bought go up like a dream and after 4 years no signs of wear usually by now metal gutters have to be renailed and they tear up the fascia because theyre heavy
  have fun with your shitty cracked foundation because you let water under it all the time
  sounds classy
  at least in california where we dont have enough rain to regularly flush small debris  bong here we have plenty of water but it doesnt flush the guttering you still have to go up there on a ladder and clean all the silt out
  leafproof gutters  i guarantee that they are not
  i have to own another piece of equipment just to use it several times a year    got your christmas lights up yet
  which is why the better brand has a lifetime warranty where they come out and service it for you
  not christian
  i installed a system called gutter helmet way back when basically a drip edge that directs water into the gutter but leaves and stuff just falls over the edge  my friend has a piece of 3/4 gas pipe with a u on top and fitted to a brass nozzle makes cleaning gutters out fairly easy provided you like getting soaked with the crap that flies out wear a dive mask
  how well does it direct water into the gutters during heavy rain though seems like it would run right off
  ive seen people put a circular piece of wire in heir gutters before no idea if it ever worked though
  i have gutter shutter same basic idea there is no runoff it works mine is about 15 years old and the valleys are the weak spot they may have fixed it by now
  works by using surface tension which keeps the water kinda stuck to the metal  not shilling but this is them    i also saw someone use drain pipe the perforate correlated stuff in the gutter guess it works by keeping an open space but i think it would hold some water and breed mosquitoes
  yes but i dont need to get on a ladder for that i can justify having a dedicated stick with a nail in it just for the purpose of hanging the lights
i wanna make a hoverbike
  meat grinder
  right  these things are stupidly dangerous and the videos always give me sewaty hands
  360mm edfs coming soon anon ill post a kickstarter when the prototype is done currently bogged down with blade stress calculations
any commercial radio fags out there  ive been installing radio equipment trouble shooting and programming for the last year now just wondering if this is a good job choice i technical high school training in electronics tons of radio certifications should i keep working in this trade go to college or find a better paying electronics based job
  limited ceiling in terms of income     possibly become an electrician then with your radio background you could specialize with a big company or do your own thing fat cash     not having a dual ticket is like becoming a drywaller shit job low wages and half the guys that stick around are mental midgets with no future anyways
work for major police dept or better yet a sheriffs office the radio guys in my dept make 80k a year and do basically nothing theyll never be fired cause the county literally relies on them way too much its the one part of our budget that has never been cut
  its a liveable wage decent money for something more interesting than a desk job      limited ceiling in terms of income  this but you can make a living on it  electrician  should have some of that skill anyways both ac and dc circuits as well as automotive    big company or do your own thing fat cash  contracting can be decent money but its a lot of work too not only do you have to be a technical jackofalltrades but factor in accounting/adminstrative/sales/marketing duties too starting your own company adds in hr employee and commercial space duties    cellular and broadcast are where the big money is twoway/paging is a small niche service and every business wants motorola performance on a baofeng budget      police dept or better yet a sheriffs office  id an hero before i went this route   i know it varies state to state jurisdiction to jurisdiction who builds out/maintains the equipment and backhaul but no way would i want to work with a local agency again
  think what prev anon was correctly implying an actual qualification as electrician is gold worth  not even running your own co just working as freelancer etc i do/did lot of stage tech and av work could have got into some very cushy numbers with broadcasters and sheeit cannot as no electrician quali employer needs it to be insurance covered 100 etc  despite the fact its 95 nothing more than plugging or pulling some admittedly large plugs  tldr trust me that get qualified is some fucking sound advice
asking 4chan for career advice    kek my dude
  this police sheriff or state patrol ive seen these jobs advertised occasionally looks pretty sweet
  what kinda phone is that on the far right top i cant find it on the moto site  looks old school dumb phone dumb and bad ass
  sl7550 dmronly radio designed for hospitality hotel/restaurant and educational facilities where a radio is too industriallooking    theyre not bad but theyre lowpower dmronly no analog so no interop with legacy systems and the battery life kinda sucks   sl300s have a little more power dmranalog and much better battery life for about the same price

always dreamed of building my own home  nothing fancy or elaborate just something simple that i made with my two hands to live cheaply and distance myself from the massive financial stress renting/mortgages bring  no real construction experience outside of basic maintaince skills such as painting patching drywall etc  fine dining chef by trade have been working in it since childhood  can litterally make anything food related from pasta by hand to cheese to butcher anything charcuterie products etc  couldnt even think of where to begin building a home as simple as an aframe  spent my life building a skillset that has nothing to do with my drean    is there any hope for me /diy/
there are some classes that teach how to build with clay and earth but that can be tricky to get permits and all the plumbing and electrical instalation may need a licensed pro depending from where you are
  is there any hope for me /diy/    i would say no not really   mortgages arent as scary or oppressive as you think and home ownership is pretty nice    reality is its not cheap or easy to buy land and build a house to live frugally  if you actually have that urge to create nonfood with your hands i would say just channel that energy into metal working or woodworking or some other /diy/ hobby    home ownership is a nonstop list of things to fix youll get that experience just by buying a house it may not be the house you built from scratch but its yours and you know the good work you are putting into it
  start doing and less saying
  id always known it would be an uphill battle if i ever did try just with the legal/permit side of it but its not so much needing to make something nonfood its always just been a home ive wanted to make even if it was just some shit cabin its something id always wanted to do since a young age as my grandfather did it and i remember him always talking about how it was the greatest expience of his life  1507983  i promise you i am doing a lot in my life i run a multimillion dollar buisness and work a minimum of 13 hours a day of manual labor 6 days a week and my day off consists of meetings and hours of paperwork if i had the time to get a second job in construction to learn i would have    but thanks guys id thought it was farfetched to start this late into my life just hoped there was some chance or way it would be within reach
  its something id always wanted to do since a young age as my grandfather did it and i remember him always talking about how it was the greatest expience of his life    build a detached garage in your back yard  it can be done for like 56000 you can take your time and do it as you see fit learning as you go    once you are done you will have bought all the tools and gotten enough experience to really understand your capabilities of building a house you are essentially building a 1 room house    it can be a long term goal
i would start with the foundation personally
  thank you greatly for the advice ive actually considered something like this to build some type of mancave/bar but never considered it as a better starting point
  just had a convo with a friend who knows a girl that builds small 800 sq foot houses in taos nm its like a small hipster town but she said the foundation costs like 2 grand and then builds the houses herself it was brief with not many details but maybe there is a way to look into it online she apparently only makes 15 grand a year but was able to buy 3 large houses and rents them out owns a strip of land near a river and is going to build the small houses on it
try one of these
    its not easy  there are people that have done it with some skill the link below is to a couple that did it in 120sq ft and documented costs etc  personally i would think buying an affordable used rv then parking it on some rural land that youve purchased would be a good start  youll also need a truck good enough to drive from your site to the nearest building supply and or walmart  live in the rv on the site whilst you work toward building your cucksheeruh tiny home this will allow you to take your time and do things correctly   just remember a stone foundation and extended overhang from a pitched roof is a must if you dont want to rebuild the structure in your lifetime  
  youre fucking kidding me with this tiny house horseshit right
  click the link then click on pics or photos or whatever they called it and just look at what two people can do with 120sq ft  cost a lot less than 2000sq ft and can be built much more quickly than a larger home  also you can still keep the rv onsite as a multi purpose room or whatever
  wants to build whole house from scratch  doesnt want to try a cuck shed first to make mistakes and learn the processes  you kidding me start small broseph no sense in learning that youve been framing wrong after building 500 linear feet youll kill yourself or more likely just build a really shitty house if you try to blow your whole load on your first time out
my pops has has been working in carpentry and construction for about 40 years now and he built his retirement house i helped him and i would say its definitely doable  we built on a half acre plot that we cleared out ourselves   legal issues were easy since the plot sellers knew that people would use those plots for houses and gave a checklist of who to contact to get what permits  i didnt know dick about construction at the time but i helped my pops build the foundation frame floor walls and roof in the summer of 2012 we worked 8 hours on weekdays sporadically and 1014 hours on weekends not including about 3 hours if driving each day in a lot odd ways it was weekend project until we had enough built that we could live there and get more done on weeldays     the physical aspect wasnt hard at all i only had to follow instructions but theres nothing that seemed impossible even to a semiunskilled 18 year old i was being directed by someone who had built several houses in his life so maybe thats the trick    note that i had some carpentry experience at the time i had built kitchen cabinets and hotel bedroom furniture from raw materials to painting and finishing    if you could find a reliable mentor you might be able to get build a small extension to a home or a garage after that you might have the skills to build your home or cabin

i am fucking tiired of life and am depressed every single fucking dayyyy i hate people surpassing me afterall thast just because they arent depressed why the fuck does my life have to be like thisss like wtf man
  
read somewhere that if you inhale from a tank of helium your body doesnt know the difference between oxygen and it so you sleep and doesnt hurt  still check your friends before doing it
  this is 4channel you sick fuck
  exhaust fumes    i once almost died because of that it was an accident because i left my motorcycle on in the garage and after 30 minutes i fell down and hit my head i woke up 8 hours later puking and feeling like shit then my dad dragged me out im pretty sure if the bike would had been running for longer i would be dead shit is painless do it op
i made a big run on blogpost in /out about /diy a geothermal greenhouse of a around 60x10    if anyone has any input id love to hear it here or here 
ill need to do some rust repairs in the bottom of the car but i dont have a proper place for the repairs how can i lift the car enough to get under it to weld some patches
  4x jackstands
  isnt jackstand just the same thing as putting something under the tires when the car is lifted also the only jack i have is a scissor jack so that isnt getting the car too high off the ground  also also the bottom is so rusty id be worried about lifting it from anywhere but the reinforced jacking points
get some 2x12 and some 4x4 and make some ramps or straddle a ditch
these are crib blocks made from 2x4s  good luck
  those look exactly like something id need how do you get the car up with them
  jack up and slide in the block one at a time
dig a hole and drive over it
flip the car over you wont have splatter raining down on you and its better for lighting arrangements
  if you have to ask this question you arent qualified to do any welding on an automobile frame
  no a jackstand is a lot safer to be under buy yourself a good hydraulic jack so you can get the car high enough and four jackstands lift it up put the jackstand under the lift point put it down on the jackstand repeat for all four corners each stand should be able to handle half the total weight of the car to be safe alternatively find yourself a ditch somewhere lay out some thickass planks and park the car over the ditch then just lay in the ditch  pic related is a jackstand
  im very familiar with those sort of little brick ornaments and this image makes me nervous
  you can get a cheaper 2 ton hydraulic jack and a pair of jack stands in a kit for 5080 but the jack wont be real heavy duty or lift super high but you can get a 2nd pair of stands for 20 so you have 4 total and get enough room to at least move around under there if you put a block between the top of the jack and the car it will give you a few more inches but be careful    harbor freight has coupons and sales on their jacks all the time it is a worthwhile investment even if you only use it once or twice a year the 3ton rapid pump will lift around 20 i believe and theres always a sale to get it around 70 then the pairs of 3 ton stands are 25 but go on sale for 17 every other week so another 35 and you can have 4 stands a solid jack and 4 stands for just over 100 is a great deal and it will be much faster and safer than the alternatives
  this just dig yourself a mechanics pit
  if the only jack you have is a crappy scissor jack then you need to start by getting something better really op
ill just leave this here
  scaled up long wood boards at least 3 feet long each stack until half inch shows  do this for each wheel and drive onto it
if you cant figure out how to get under a car you surely dont know how to weld
  find a tall curb and drive 1/2 the car over it  2x4 stands  24in jack stands from harbor freight  rent a lift for 20 an hour
  get a highlift jack a lift mate wheel attachment accessory pic related and make some wheel blocks out of dimensioned lumber like 2x4s as shown here  theyre a lot more stable than jack stands which is especially important if youre lifting it high enough to work under
jack stands
ill just leave this here
i am not gonna tell you how to do your business but you might want to just make friends with somebody who has a proper lift ask around somebody will know somebody    getting something done on the cheap isnt really worth dying for
    i love those kegs
    this guy is totally right but my favorite memory from hs is when a friend burned out his vw rabbit in a drag race not smart he had to change the engine and rented the a frame only to put the new one in     so he scrabbled together all the jacks he could find and figured wed lower the old engine to a pallet then jack up the frame and slide the engine out     anyway he asks all his friends and me and this girl are the only ones who show up she was an incredibly hot chinese girl toughminded good values petite incredible body genius intellect good at dd the total package real china not commie she loved her freedoms never put up with bullshit never wore makeup she had one of those rare faces that didnt need it     so hes buzzing around the car making sure the contraption doesnt feel over while we cranked all the jacks into place and then slowly lowered them down she worked for a while then started rubbing my shoulders while i jacked the card down after a while she was sitting behind me feeding me lemonade and rubbing my shoulders while her perfect legs were wrapped around me she was wearing a white t shirt and short shorts i can still see the engine grease on her ivory white skin fuck     never tried anything because i was chickenshit manlet i looked her up last year phd engineer still hot still hard core fuck
    it would be quicker to just find a hole the right size to drive over
  ive built something similar out of 2x4s for changing oil a pair of stilts each under a front wheel gives a couple inches clearance and just enough to fit comfortably under for my purposes i just drive up them i suppose you should be able to do the same if you build steps
  still havent done anything about it you want her go get her
you can thank me later
  ill just leave this here  new guys first effort at operating the lift
  bullshit ill bet she was a horse faced jungle asian like all the white manlets are in to
how much of a boob can one be to consider using wood under tires to life a car than jack stands at specifically designed lifting points of a car    dis a troll threadand its a funny one at that    my fear however is that someone lurking is stupid enough to listen to the trolls
  your like that guy in zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance who did not want to make shims out of beer cans because it didnt cost enough money
  jack stands are for changing tires crib blocks are for doing work under a car theyre stronger and more stable than jack stands so if the tires are available for use as support points theyre better
  jenga
  this is why customers have to sign release forms
  this also op  do not use cement blocks or bricks to raise your car  seriously jacking up your car is nothing to fuck around with that one actor who was probably gonna go alist from the new star trek series got killed working under his wrangler it can happen to anyone 
consider removing the interior and do as much welding as you can from the inside
knows to to weld  doesnt know how to jack up a vehicle
  knows how to weld
  4x jackstands  that works its also a great way to die look up the statistics
can weld  cant figure out how to raise equipment    they let sois weld now
  look up the statistics    decent jackstands used properly dont fail what statistics of people dying while using jackstands should i look up    inb4 pics of garbage jackstands and/or jackstands used stupidly
  used properly  im sure everyone who got crushed by their car while using jacks thought they used them properly
    so thats the comeback which part of jackstands used stupidly is hard for you to understand are you a product liability attorney the kind who ruins products for the rest of us
    he wasnt under it he got crushed against a fence because he left it in neutral
  that one actor anton yelchin from the new star trek series got killed working under his wrangler  it was a jeep grand cherokee not a jeep wrangler  he wasnt working on it he got out of it and due to the funky shift selector he didnt realize it was in neutral   it started rolling and he attempted to stop it by getting behind it and pushing backit was rolling backwards  he died due to being pinned between the vehicle and a brick pillar
  he got crushed against a fence because he left it in neutral    and that should be the whole point of this thread think when you raise a car think hard jacks and jack stands are designed to be wonderfully safe but if you dont really understand things like gravity you can get killed    t lowered a truck in neutral and it rolled onto me only stopped by my ribcage
    alright get off your soapbox i was just correcting that other guy
  alright get off your soapbox i was just correcting that other guy    sensitive much i was agreeing with you
  4x jackstands    dont be a pussy be a man like mr varg here      1x stand on a tiny wobbly wood block on soft soil and a kid playing around it    this is the power of survivalism
    yep scary as fuk
  tiny wobbly wood block  soft soil  the wood serves two purposes  1 spreads the load  2 offers better purchase  also theres still three wheels on solid ground mercedes benz uses the same jack i only wish my nonbenz cars came with those cylindrical openings at the lift points way more convenient the jack is simple yet genius and incredibly safe when the vehicle is properly chocked its intended purpose is for changing wheels but never seen one fail
  get floor jack  raise car as much as jack can raise  put ramps or wooden blocks under the tires or use jack stands if you need to remove wheels  release the car from the jack  done    if you need to go much higher than that you need to put the jack under the same wooden block you used for the wheel raise the car careful because the jack moves forward when raising and backwards when lowering and put more blocks under the wheels or jack stands until you are satisfied with the height you reached    make sure you get big fat wooden blocks so they wont rock all over the place when they are stacked while you work on the car
  tiny wobbly block spreads the load    its barely larger than the jackstand foot lol it will sink into the soil at an angle and the jack will slip off the moment mr survivalist encounters a well rusted nut that demands a bit more force    theres still three wheels on solid ground    ok now you are just trolling
  ok now you are just trolling    if you know how to chock them and if you dont chock both sides of all three then the car is massively stable and will not go anywhere except up and down so jack the hell out of it then put a jackstand under a suitable place and you will be safe i prefer to never go under a vehicle if the wheels are off and you seldom have to but if you do use multiple jack stands or blocks

ive been trying to fix this fucking thing for a month now    first the screen was broken because my dumbass dropped it 2 storys then when i put the whole thing back together the thing was stuck in a bootloop so i flashed the stock rom on it again    now i find that the fucking proximity sensor thinks your face is on it all the time and the speaker probably isnt working because of it     ive glued this thing together already with the glue sticker provided how do i fix the proximity sensor and what glue should i use to get it closed again
make sure the proximity sensor is clean and obstruction free    use doubleside tape for closing it
alright these mutherfuckers are pissing me off my house is clean all cracks and shit sealed still finding mouse shit and catching the little fuckers at record numbers    enough    so sick of baiting traps and tossing mice its fucking gross and i want those cocksuckers gone    i want to build a 5 gallon bucket mouse trap but not drown the poor little pieces of shit i also dont want birds of prey or snakes in my yard so ive descided that the best way to deal with these faggots would be an air chute like banks have i want some sort of sensor to trip when one of the little faggots falls into the trap and launch him down a pvc pipe with my air compressor down to the pond another sensor there will trip a pneumatic piston which will insta gib they ass and dump them into my pond    quick death fish food no more setting traps just peanut butter a can once a week i may as well shove it in a greese gun a automate that to i guess
  all cracks and shit sealed    nope keep looking imagine that mice can levitate become 1/2 inch diameter whatever i killed one every day or so until i finally found that tiny spacing in the middle of a bundle of water pipes    check every place where pipes or electrical wires enter or leave i got lucky with the last one when i surprised micky one morning and saw where he ran to
fill with liquid resin create massive rat tower    
this is unrealistic the sensors arent the problem but the pneumatic tube/potato gun is     youd need a sealed container if you were going to launch them like a potato gun something that cant happen if the mice are able to get in it or youd need to pull a vacuum on the tube side and have two large quick acting valves in order to suck it in and then open the other side to spit it out    more realistically you have a large nest inside your house so sealing cracks isnt going to help any rat poison youre able to buy wont work for shit and end up just feeding them id suggest large glue traps and put them around the corners of your floor youll have the majority of them in under a week keep one or two more glue traps out over the next month to catch the stragglers
something like a catapult or trebuchet would be much easier to manage than a canon all you need to do is tie the bait to a string and hang it over the bucket then just rube goldberg the rope so it activates the trap
  i fucked up this morning heard a noise in the trash can looked down and saw a mouse i put the lid on and just threw the mutherfucker ouside pisses me off the fuckers
  i wonder if that is considered art and worth money or if peta would rape me
  sigh    thanks anon
  howdy neighbor    mouse hits the front door      not a bad idea the neighbors have 2 porch cats and a 3rd hangs out over there hmmm
  get yourself a cat cats are cute
snap traps are cheap and they are effective    dead mice dont come back in or make more mice
  have you thought of just buying a bag of cat treats and leave around your house or something
  nope keep looking  this  there is some sort of fluorescent powder that you can spread around bait wait for the mice to come in and take the bait then use a uv light to follow the tracks
  peta would rape you and then find a way to euthanize your dead rats a second time just to make sure they meet their hypocrisy quota for the month
  something like a catapult or trebuchet would be much easier to manage than a canon  bull fucking shit it would i could manage a cannon with a single pic id need much more hardware to automate a trebuchet
  you would need to rearm it everytime so its not efficient anyway  or dig a very deep hole in the ground put a trempoline inside and do the bucket mecanism with a can over it
  you would need to rearm it everytime so its not efficient anyway  just keep the compressor turned on
  you could make rat charge by setting some wadd in the tube the rat falls into then rotate the tube closed which might decapitate a rat then the wadding will push the rat out when you pressurize it
  just the scent of a cat will cause mice anxiety    get a cat he will live to solve your problem
  this and watching a cat fuck with a mouse is far more satisfying than launching a mouse with a potato cannon cats torture mice in ways that made the ss seem like teletubbies
  kek nailed it
  and sometimes absolutely useless i have two little cute but useless furballsshitmachines afraid even of birds
the problem is you are not killing them  mice can reproduce at a very high rate  you need to kill the mice unfortunately or they will keep coming back
  lame need a mouse holocaust barrel to tube to a wood or gas stove    mouse falls into bucket/barrel  sensor triggers  mouse gets moved by tubing and dropped into a stove  sensor triggers  stove starts up    keep the stove outside so you wont have to smell the fuckers
  im currently borrowing three cats from a buddy and when i move in a few weeks im building a fucking heated cat mansion next to the barn i just got 5 fucking 3/4 ton chevy pickup loads of free carpet    they actually tried to use white carpet its 3 years old litterally carpeting the ceiling and walls along with wtf else i find    how to prevent ringworm on 5003 cats
    true but i buy 3 seperate 2 packs because for some ungodly fucking reason i manage to get my fingers and break over half of them in a fit of autistic rage    got some pretty fucking effective plastic ones with teeth tho    no mice today and none of them half tripped without a little furry kek in it    i think im finally on top of it but idgaf    no i really want an automated mouse canon for the cats
  yeah my wife has an unnecessary aggression towards cats tho im afraid she might murder the poor bastards    we keep a 22 pistol with birdshot for faggot barnswallows
  omfg anon this is perfect     these little cocksuckers invaded my home now im going to invade theirs with a fucking 12 guage
  automated trebuchet    fuck the mice    make it happen
  doooooooood yes
  neen researching gatling guns all day well get it figured out
  lol
  theres a cat lady in town that feeds strays    every few months ill chuck a mouse in the varn and any that run will be dropped off in her yard
  garage door sensor wired to a relay and servo 12 v system not gonna spoon feed you if you cant figure it out honestly you probably shouldnt mess with it
mouse problem in neighborhood  neighbors too dumb to spay their cats  kick them out for pissing on furniture and doing unfixed cat things  yards littered with dead mice  mouse problem solved  fucking love those feral bastards they play with the neighborhood dogs running back and forth with sticks our own house cat took care of our interior mice there was a rat problem from old roommates who also took said cat but new roommate hunted them down with a co2 bb glock no more mice outside to come in because of the ferals
    this op you just gotta know how to turn a cat into a mouser get a big boi black cat thatll blend into the dark and train him with a real fishing pole with line and a rubber salamander/mouse on the end no hooks obviously dont let him catch it make him work for it make them run and run and yank it away from them when ever they loosed their grip a lot of people make the mistake of halfassing the play time with cat which makes them turn into shit hunters because they always expect the prey to just give up or come to them  my boi and gur catch the little fuckers almost everyday and the boy has a special stalking spot near the oven where the mice love to hide i see him there every morning waiting for them to pop out hes practically a living mouse trap
  this is true cant get one thats too young though momma cat has to teach them or they wont be particularly good at it murdering them they end up treating it like a toy still dead though but it may take a few tries   my cat killed a mouse in the house and made the kitchen look like something out of texas chainsaw massacre tore it in half looked like it kept trying to run for about a yard before it died i had no idea micr had that much blood didnt even eat it  cats are miniature tigers
  this too its good to give them practice thatll be harder than any real mouse to catch gets their strength up best mouser i had i taught him how from a kitten
  exacty what happened with my rescue stray treats it like a toy but its entertaining cause she breaks their limbs doing it for slow torture now shes learned to pounce
  instead of a pneumatic air cannon why not consider a bucket trap like in the pic only upgraded to automatically flush the drowned rats to the pond once a day and refill itself
  bit excessive lad
look up mousetrap monday on youtube for an appropriate final solution
   i also dont want birds of prey or snakes in my yard  this is why you have rats one snek will fuck over the rat population of a few acres
  i have a bucket trap i dont fill it with water i just wait til i hear scrabbling in the buckets and take a walk out to my neighbors cat had kittens not to long ago i put a lid over the bucket and give it a shake to stun the mice before tipping the bucket over and watching the cats go to town
  i used to catch them in sticky traps and then shoot them in the head with a pellet gun if you already have a pellet gun then this is a really cheap way to do it
  you have to actively train them to be good mousers strays and ferals are great mousers out of necessity my grandma had this big fucking barn cat that killed snakes and the occasional owl she said she has seen the damn thing chase a fox across the field that thing tolerated people but didnt really want anything to do with you unless you had food
  my grandpa put a trap like your pic in my barn then my dog got in the barn and drank it was a really sad day keep pets in mind when using that as a trap
  dogs are generally retarded and more useful as tools cats have far more self preservation instincts
  op all you need to do is get a small lever to activate a taser put the bait on the lever  the power source should be a tritium battery bought online homemade ones are just crap
  how about a small trap like ops pic related but filled with bleach when triggered a small cup above it would drop a single drop of ops piss  mice either drown in bleach get pissed on by op or get gassed by the reaction of the piss with the bleach mustard gas
  nigga you dont need to automate anything youre making the problem much more complicated than it has to be
  garage door sensor    genious    air cannon incoming    fuckoff mousecucks pay rent or get the fuck out
  get a cat they scare off mice get 3 cats to be sure i own three and not a single mouse within a mile radius
  arguably the best post on this board atm
  this shouldnt have worked but i pass it on     i had a rat problem two years back i live near some stables so it would be fairly impossible to completely eradicate the problem all gaps are sealed but rodents are houdini of the shithead world so i caught a big asshole in a rickety cage trap i set up    it was 3am i had work in two hours and i was in a strange mood so i picked up the cage and took it outside into my yard facing the back end of the stables put down the cage got two tiki lights and pitched them near to the cage got my dangerously more competent than me springer and opened the cage and yelled this is what you get if you come here this is what you get   screaming rat and dog doing this thing where it whacks its head against the floor only lasts a second or so the dog actually doesnt fuck around  leave the cage out in the yard and the torches burning for a day    no rats no mice since it shouldnt have worked its probably coincidence but there is the fact that the stable owner said they dont have a rat problem any more either
  the pneumatic tube/potato gun is unrealistic  i disagree by making the cannon a squeezebore you guarantee that even the smallest mouse will be ejected with no issue larger mice may end up a little worse for wear however but dont worry theyre selflubricating automating the breech is likely the next hardest problem id advise a sleeve valve with a small electric motor that runs as long as it detects mice via capacitive sense pads in the bucket/funnel and in the breech itself you can then have a little distributor running on the motor to fire the solenoid valve at the right time        bleach  ammonia gas chamber is also a good idea but arguably messier than the oil/water trap itself
i had rats in the attic for months and the bucket trap only got one of them  put an ozone generator up there and they left pretty quick it also cleared up odors from rats killed with regular traps
  gassing is the only way to go after all
  thanks for the tip
  many thanks anon    have most of the tube built and the pneumatic crusher parts are due tuesday
  this thread is 60 posts deep ive seen the ss mentioned the holocaust and gas chambers but not a single mouschwitz joke god damn bunch of newfags up in here i dont have high hopes for this place now seems its not the master of its new domain    mostly joking great thread op even if you are still a faggot automatic mouse launching gatling gun webm when
  this damn air cannon wont stop squeaking
  dont use poison  lure owls
  my dogs are self trained rat hunters    eat shit cat fags
look up the schematics for any generic paintball gun that is the foundation of your build in factyou may be able to use the guts of a cheap paintball gun as the action for your guninstead of paintballs you are going to use pingpong balls the trigger needs to be inside the barrel and very sensitive to get the mouse in the tube you will need to make a funnel that feeds to a very light yet robust self sealing one way door for bait i think you are on to something with the grease gun full of peanut butter power that with air too so that it ejects a small amount each shot dont feed directly off air compressor feed off secondary preassure tank so you can have multiple shots stored in compressor dont worry about killing the mice if the shock from being lanched doesnt kill them the landing will a killing device is overcomplicated     good luck and god speed post lots of pictures
  very sensitive  electronic trigger  no worries id use a photodiode with a highpass filter and some ir light so when it detects a change in luminosity dark mouse against white bucket it will trigger a solenoid valve im pretty sure thats how commercial motion detectors work since its a method that doesnt require an entire array of light sensors such as whats within a camera
    i dont have the materials or knowledge to build an electric trigger so i wouldnt feel right recommending one to op that said if op could do it it would almost certainly be better than a mechanical trigger
soo ratcha you need too think outside of the clanks mice like cheese like crackers like banks keep some fondue that fuckin spiced with snow queen spice fo feell me shizzam
  wat just happened
  in other words repurpose a garage door safety switch
fuck i gotta go check that bucket i put in the attic two years ago
  hah
semirelated
    i am so sorry
  what the fuck language is this
  im sure i can if it can stop a garage door then firing off a sprinkler valve should be a walk in the park    oh hey little furball of canceraids come on in     chink chink  boof  squeak    i wonder if i shot it at a hawk if we could play catch
  thanks anon doing homework now
  oh i will pneumatic piston should be in today for the squish plate i guess now its getting a silicone seal made to lock in and release the pressure chamber    4chan space program is back baby    i wonder if i could repurpose co2 cartriges fill them with helium and an altitude meter when it starts dropping fire off a few helium balloons for the mice and 1 for the electronics and helium filler apparatus itself then it could float down safely and i can find it in a field with the baloon    if i could make it reusable we could have a weekly launch
  not enough to keep from getting caught in one of those armbreaker racoon/opossum traps     rip neighbors kitty
  bruh get some cats as soon as we had one they killed or ran off all the mice
  f
    in all fairness if you want to get rid dogs just leave antifreeze out   most cats wont drink that shit    idk man dogs just annoy me and its nearly impossible to train them to protect you and still have a dog friend
  if you do this do not let the neighbors find out most people seem to like dogs more than their own children and will physically threaten you for doggocide attempts
  a fucking 12 guage  just gas the damn je i mean mice mate its more efficient
  the house i just bought was previously occupied by tons of cats  im currently working on getting rid of the mice that were there at the same time
  fucking kek good advice anon my buddy has a knocked up black cat
  a 12 guage is always the answer always
  i thought about letting the black snakes play but i got chuckens and ducks and rattlesnakes are fucking everywhere so ill bait a minnow trqp whenever im home
  will those old single ones with a square dart hole do it
  sad    i will anon
  niiiice
  incomming    found my 5 tubs of pvc fittings and a couple tater cannons    protip do not use acetylene    i stuffed it full of rags and tried to shoot my bro    the mutherfucker douched him with fire rags shouldve used new i guess blue the back off of it and shot the gun into a cop car    fortunately it was the pasenger side and copbro is chill used some black house paint and a rag can hardly tell theres a dent in it even looking for it
  mousewitz    fucking dead    tfw dogs wont stop mauling my shitter pipe
  i love my mutts tho and new antifreeze is non toxic
  i know i would id akin it to the same reaction if you punch my wife probably not even get mad just borrow a backhoe and dig a hole
not op    allergic to cats  sealing everything i can find    what bait and traps work the best
  then you drink it    i dont know what hell kind of antifreeze they sell in your country but no its not
  do you have more animals in the house  because if you do they are going to die    combine cheese milk and cement combine it well and put it at night try to do it at night  put it in place where you think mouse are or where you have trap it more
  those mice will be sleeping with the fishes
this is a thread for any domicile that moves    post your campers rvs house boats pop ups vans pickup rigs etc    i finally finished the interior and took her out on her maiden voyage    the heat/ac works well and the toilet is a godsend for the middle of the night
  sorry about the flip
  k
no oven
a lot of people have some notion you can fit everything youd find in an rv in a camper van and thats just not the case    i can put a toaster oven on the counter but an oven would have taken the available storage from adequatefor2peopletocampcomfortably for a week to notenoughfor1    this thing has a double bed 3 cubic foot fridge heat air vents 10 outlets solar panels and the van charges the solar batteries and also vice versa    i am very satisfied and forgot the toaster oven this weekend
  that looks so fucking goofy
  i know ill add a white stripe across the side once i finish the body work tying in the white topper    im 64 and can stand up with inches to spare inside     goofy yes but uber comfy
  op im buying a school bus thats been converted to an rv this weekend i plan to live in it full time with my fiancé any hot tips
  if i was going off grid i would have put in a gas heater and evaporative cooler instead of heat/a/c    make sure youre solar controller is rated for wayyyy more amps than you think or itll go out and if its a dcinverterac system make sure to take into account the starting watts as well as running watts of your appliances and gear to know if your inverter can handle it    aaaaand outdoor space is way more important than indoor space figure out how best to utilize the bus to make an outdoor usable space    i got my awning off an old popup  i stage all my food and stuff at the door before i get out     it really depends on the conversion and what you really expect to get out of the bus
  i think painting the whole van a lighter color will help    careful of the doors when getting out   im 64 too and my vans internal height is 5 something  just enough to clear my shoulders but the sliding door is much shorter making it a very big hazard for my head when stepping out
  im not gonna spend more on paint than i did on the van    id like to but itd be absolutely retarded
a friendly reminder from /out/ to just get the fucking ducato
thats nice op cozy as fuck
  consider the good old rustoleum and roller method you can do the whole van for 30     for a nicer finish you want a better paint like majjic or valspar tractor  implement with 10 penetrol as an additive your paint fill flow out smooth as glass still under 50 for everything
  thanks      if he knew anything about auto repair all that stuff would cost 2500 even if he had to buy a welder    i had to run new brake lines replaced calipers pcv hose plugs all major a/c components throttle body and i only have about 2000 in the van itself right now     ill weld in a patch panel on the rear quarter replace some bearings some seals do some body work and ill end up with a van in pristine condition    its always more productive to research and do the work yourself    yes you might have to redo a couple things but youll still be half the cost of a mechanic and body work is more like 1/10th the cost to do it yourself    not to mention you might actually learn something
  i didnt consider that but then what does finishing look like    and how would that even hold up going 65mph down the highway
  keep renting basedcuck
  it holds up fine   thats the type of paint they originally used to paint train wagons and most automobiles right up until the 60s   its still used to paint cargo ships and private boats     the only drawback is it takes at least 4 hours to dry enough to touch around 24 hours until you can sand and a couple of months until it fully cures reaches final hardness but after those 24 hours it can be used as you would a normal paint job  a well done paint job can last decades    the finish with plain old rustoleum is decent when viewed up close if you use the right roller black foam hidensity with chamfered edges and almost flawless if you use a nicer paint and an additive like penetrol that extends the dry time so brush marks can level out    many people like to wetsand apply multiple coats polish to get a mirror finish type 50 paint job in the google youll get a lot of results         the above is a good starting point  theres a lot more stuff i can tell you if you decide to do it
  you can fit everything youd find in an rv in a camper van  not in a minvan you need a full size
  a literal toilet in the kitchen
  can confirm that decent or even nice results can be gotten by someone with ops skillset a lighter color will certainly help in warm sunny conditions    very nice work op be proud of it you rock    what did you seal the top with
  whats your opinion on pop up roofs ive long been a fan but i gotta admit i dont know as much as i would like about them
  some people just arent cut out for /diy/     there were more posts in that little saga but i dont have screens and i believe in the last one she actually broke the engine attempting to run plant based oils instead of diesel because she wanted the van to be vegan
  its an e350 xlt and no way id rather have storage and a hotplate/toaster oven than an oven      show me your better camper van that you spent less money on and you can have my attention      its 3 layers of frp or fiberglass    the first is mat the second is cloth and the third is gel coat     the top of the topper is 1/4 thick mdf with 22 spans and i at 275lbs can walk anywhere on the topper without issue      theyre preferable if its your daily driver but if i wanted to tent camp i would have saved myself a few grand and bought a tent      bahahahahah thats about right    the only successful conversions of people who want to live in one full time are almost always mostly done by someone else
  i meant pop up roofs rather than rooftop tents but i got you afaik its possible to only set them up when you need to stand up so their major drawback is being less insulated then
  insulation security the moving parts on the vehicle frame compensation for operation with the top down    they are super cool but you get better use out of solid walls if you want to go long term
  youll want to install curtains op otherwise people can and will stare inside
heres some advice i have about doing electrical in your van  keep as many devices and appliances running on 12v dc as you can an inverter will draw additional energy and a high capacity inverter is very expensive  you should use pairs of golf cart batteries instead of car batteries for your auxiliary power as they will handle frequent cycling better you should have at least two pairs if you have room for it  if you can afford to do so have an autostart system installed to start the engine whenever the auxiliary batteryies charge falls below a certain level
  having your toilet in your galley  anon has a point you should really keep the toilet in a recess
  roller shades already in bro      let me tell you how to do your project now that its completed    wutjpeg    i wanted to go all 12v but it would have seriously increased my project price     so far top to bottom i have less than 5k in the whole thing with more than half of that being van repair solar and topper    the only things that run are the heat/ac 250 and the fridge 80    to go 12v the climate control would be 3x and the fridge would be 2x    i have 4 12v 35ah solar batteries because they were the cheapest sealed agm deep cycle batteries i could find and they work well    ill post my costs later today
  id want to be able to leave it in gear having the engine fire up in the middle of the night  nah low voltage cut out perhaps    im rather partial to three way fridges of which i have a few they can go cheap second hand when someone rips one out of an onsite caravan
  this baby works just fine    i considered having my cousin salvage some 12v stuff from his yard but if i sell it i want it to be as comfy and hard to fuck up as possible     the inverter kicks out below a certain amperage draw the whole system is grounded and comfortable to most people    and my solar controller is ultra hd so itll kick out if there isnt enough draw on the batteries which the inverter takes care of the fridge lights vent fans and small appliances can run just fine on the solar panels    and with a full charge and the a/c on eco at a reasonable temp the system can last 8 hours overnight    its more of a camper than total off grid rig but it would work off grid id just add a super quiet generator on an equipment rack on the hitch
  and its also a 68 v10 so i really wouldnt want the engine running without my knowledge/to disturb other campers with that truck starter sound  2am    rrrrrnnnnnnnnnn   rrrrrnnnnnnnnnn   vroommmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
so for those who are curious ill list all the expenses to the best of my knowledge    van   got from a wealthy friend to use for my contracting business on the basis i would get it running and use it     battery80  brakes completely redone 600  tools to remove seat brackets 35  spark plugs coils 50  windshield 225  ac components and tools 125  blower motor 25  iac valve 40    topper  aluminum tubing and connectors 240  plywood/panels scrap  fiberglass resin gel coat mat cloth900    rough framing  2x4s 50  self drilling screws40  wiring outlets switches80  dpdt middle pos off switches 120  2000/4000w inverter 150  300w 140ah solar system 700  insulation100  panels scrap      finishing  spacklepaint 50  trim75  carpeting 100  lights30  fridge 85  climate 230  roller/windshield shades100  cabinet doors100  futon pad130  toilet60    assorted runs to menards 250    i still have a couple hundred left to buy the stuff to do the body work and vinyl but overall im just about done
  she wanted the fan to be vegan    fucking spit water laughing
  he could probably build or have built a battery box in the frame just have an acess hole in the floor of the van so you can get in it
  well if its mostly camper build a trailer or just get a shitbox 1000 trailer to store your shit hell with a little more power you could have a shower stall and semi truck or camper washer and dryer
  600 for fuckin brakes did that include new rotors and lube
  i did brake pads rotors drums shoes and fluid for 350 on my truck
    it was calipers lines rotors pads   i change most shit myself but the brake lines were rusted through and a rotor was split when i got it      and thats why this thing rocks i could tow a 35 travel trailer and make the kidsguests sleep in the van lolololol
  i used seal agm batteries and put them in the lower cabinet by the a/c unit     the door shuts air tight and theyre vented out and down the body underneath the van
alright i have the bus now im poor as fuck planning to not move it often i can get an electrical hook up if necessary but id prefer not to do that im planning on getting a water hook up soon so far the bus runs it has some sort of solar set up that it came with a spot for a bed and a propane oven and stove i got it for 6 grand i hope to live in it full time thoughts general advice
  planning to not move it often  unless you own property to have it on or have a rented space where you can leave it for long periods of time this is a bad idea  electrical hookup  if you can afford to install a way to connect to shore power id recommend it it will be cheaper than idling your engine speaking of which relying on solar generation only is a bad idea more often than not the times when you need power the most the sun wont be shining so make sure that your apu is able to charge off of the engine also refer to   water hook up soon  how do you fill your water tank now do have to run a hose through the bus  general advice  keep money aside for maintenance and repairs and possible replacement regularly inspect your bus and repair any problems you find asap install and use blackout curtains draw as little attention to yourself as possible make improvements to the buss security if the previous owner hasnt already
  dats a long boiii
  those windows are gonna be a source of a lot of insulation issues in more extreme temperatures in the summer its not so bad you can open them all and get a good crossbreeze going but in the winter its gonna freeze you alive if you arent in the south us or west coast youll freeze it might be a little expensive but getting those windows insulated better will allow for way better quality of life if youre going full time i would also devise a little system thatll let you open/close them all at once but thats just me  good find for only 6 gs anon
  the property is my mother in laws she says we can stay as long as we want as long as we keep our area mowed its a huge farm so we still get a good bit of privacy    could i not use a generator as a back up i think it would be 600 to hook up to a real power line but id prefer to be as close to off grid as possible of course if i can not keep my refrigerator or other necessities going then i am not opposed to real power    no water tank yet i am still in a rental house with real hookups    bus security is pretty good i can lock both doors but if someone was determined to get in by breaking a window then i could not stop them i dont think theres a way around that unfortunately      im as far east and south that you can get without being on the coasthurricane warning this weekend so its pretty hot the windows are already a pain with the intermittent rain but its bearable the heat isnt too bad with a fan we are planning to get some sort of ac for next year for this winter we are thinking of a woodstove yeah i thought it was pretty much a steal and rent just seems like a waste so we are trying this its definitely feasible with an electrical hook up we are planning to play it by ear we pretty much spent our life savings on it so theres only so much we can do for it currently
  free rent in exchange for mowing the lawn  6000 dollar mobile house with more sqft than some condos  florida weather    holy shit anon youre set looks comfy af inside too
  a backup generator wouldnt be too bad of an idea but you should have it default to charging off of the engine  security  what i was thinking here was placing security film on all of the windows except for the windshield installing latches that can only be unlocked from the inside for when the bus is occupied locking gas caps locking access doors/ valves/ switches accessible from the exterior and if you have the skills and/or confidence installing a custom security system to help protect against theft of the bus theft of outside accessories and intrusion of the bus
  one idea for opening/clsing the windows all at once  screw some rings onto top and bottom of the window frame as a pull  string some durable cordage to both rings  run each cord through a dowel or metal pipe  bolt some circular sections as a frame for the dowel so that the dowel can be above and below the window line and still rotate  handle on the end of the dowel/pipe  turn handle on top to open windows  turn bottom one to close them
  well thats the thing shes the typical crazy mother in law id love to live here for the rest of my life but she is a bit unstable i really dont believe that we will be able to just live here by only mowing our lawn shes the kind of person that likes drama and if there are no problems then she will create them so i know its a terrible idea to try to live here its about a 2 mile walk from her house so were hoping that we are far enough out of her way that she will leave us alone for the most part if not then we can drive away to some other place we would just move out but as it stands our dogs have a whole farmover 100 acres of woods and ponds and wildlife to go play on and we dont want to move them to a yard ill update here how it goes    this is very new to me would that be efficient how do i begin to do that it came with an inverter that runs off of the engine but i dont know how effective that is fortunately my uncle is an electrician that specializes in security but he loves cars so i should be able to do just about anything even with my terribly limited diy knowledge with his help    security is definitely important to me i want to be sure people arent messing around in there when im gone which is rather likely unfortunately so it has to be locked up tight it has latches on the two doors that can be locked inside i dont think it has any of that other stuff thank you for the ideas ill do some research    i like the idea ive saved your post as that will be down on the to do list below things like toilet and shower theyll also probably be closed most of winter so this sounds like a next summer project thank you for the advice
  youll probably want to have the inverter running off of your auxiliary batteries instead of the engine and have the aux batteries be charged from the engines electrical system with a switching device in place to keep the apu from causing the main battery to be excessively discharged regarding the source of the power for your bus heres my recommendation have automatic power switching in place so that the following occurs if the bus is hooked up to shore power have a rectifier powered by shore power charge the batteries and have the ac outlets bypass the inverter and directly connect to shore power if the engine is running and the main battery is at a sufficient charge have the aux batteries be charged off of the engine if the solar panel is generating sufficient voltage and the apu load is below a given level have the solar panel charge the aux batteries if the aux batteries fall below a certain charge and the bus is able to auto start controlled by a manually toggled switch so that you dont harm yourself or others have the engine start and run until the aux batteries are charged then automatically stop if the engine fails to start attempt to start the backup generator please pardon the text wall also if it werent for budget issues id include plans for automatic testing of the aux batteries and having a mobile internet connection
i need a half ton vehicle for hauling shit with my dad i have a truck right now but i was considering a van because i could live out of it instead of wasting 2 hours commuting for school is this a good idea is there any legal nonsense i need to know about sleeping in a vehicle what vans would you recommend
  welcome back to the cx network burger
  if you really wanna sleep in it it needs to be full sized econoline express dodge ram van isuzu nv the new cargo lines etc    id aim for a 3/4 ton or more if you have serious hauling    you can take the seats out of any of them but cargo vans dont need curtains     its only a legal issue if you cause an issue      wtf are you on about    hook up the aux batteries to the starter solenoid and the alternator will regulate voltage on the whole system while the key is on they wont over charge because the alternator should kick out over 144v    if you really want to follow this imposter you can get a battery isolator which effectively does the same thing except it costs 100 and constantly wastes power    you can have the solar controller hooked up to the batteries at the same time because the controller is made to separate the panels and the system    you need double pole double throw middle position off ac switched to switch from battery to shore power they should run 40 a pop and youd have to order them or hit a distributor     im op and i realized i dont have pics of my electrical yet    ill post them soon      i would buy a super quiet generator from hazard frought 3000 watts is preferable then you can run an 8000 btu heat/a/c and other appliances without blowing anything out
  if you put a tarp over it you could keep the windows open when you sleep and have an awning to sit under outside this will keep a lot of sun off of the bus  even a small tarp that only covers part of it is worth it    it might be cheaper to run a small generator than using the bus engine many people charge their system while driving anyway so they dont care
  when it rains
  good luck getting insurance on a school bus/motorhome conversion
  oil leak from alternator  caused by alternator being mounted incorrectly   what the fuck is this jibberish
  here is our old bus   it has 4 dynomax bullet mufflers on it it is obnoxiously loud
  id imagine if the alternator wasnt mounted correctly the tension on the pulley would be very uneven and cause premature wear on the bearings or motor shaft or whatever else is in that fucker
  pig disgusting eurofag detected
  your making yourself sound like a idiot  alternators dont contain oil bearings spin the armature that do not require oil  if the alternator was mounted in correctly it probably would chew up a belt
  party deck or shade
  oh shit that makes sensefuck yeah that would be a bitchin camper i got a 600 shitbox but day 1 we cot flooded and rioed the ass end completely off i had 3/4 plywood laying around so i went over the whole rotted floor and build a new ass end seeled it and just used same color roofing screws on the old metal that sheered off siliconed the seems and siliconed and screwed a strip over the seems worked out pretty good actually its dangerously ass end heavy but we dont travel far anyway took all the screws out and sikiconed around all the screw holes before i stuck it back on    fucker is bulletproof back there and i can bolt all kinds of shit to it    its a tiny shithole and i have a cdl tho an old school bus is like 4k at most and i have a near new fiberglass tub and 3 walls unit i can throw in it coble a shitter in and run curtins and a matress and im good to roll for well under 5k will make it nice next winter and probably keep it till i die
  clearly says alternator was mounted incorrectly someone must have mounted it in the sump lol
  alternators do not commonly use oel but if you google alternator of the ford transit 1987 year you can see there is on the back a vacuum pump for the break system attached
  i love your enthusiasm but i have no idea what youre talking about    so boys this is the electrical cabinets    top to bottom  60a solar controller  3 dpdt middle pos off master switches  2/4000 watt inverter  wire jumble will address when i buy 2 more batteries  2 35ah 12v sealed agm solar batteries with a place for 2 more    so this system has 2 sources of power  1shore power the orange 3 way ext cord  and   2 the batteries/ solar van engine    so the solar goes from the panels through the topper to the controller then to the batteries    when the van is running power is also supplied to the batteries via the starter solenoid from the alternator    the batteries are then hooked to the inverter i have the vent fans directly into the batteries most would recommend lights as well    the switches left to right control the heat/ac unit left side of pic outlets and lights    the 3 plugs in the ext cord and the 3 in the inverter are correlated with the master switches yellow is a/c others are lights and outlets     when the switches are up they draw from the ext cords 2 are necessary if running a microwave and ac at the same time that run to a grid power outlet    when the switches are down they are running through the inverter off the batteries i have the lights and outlets switches down in transit and if i need to run the lights or outlets without shore power just need to flip the inverter on    my fridge is alt current so it needs the outlet switch up or down to run obv if you had a 3 way or 12v fridge you could wire it right to the batteries same with other appliances but that wasnt important to me    i ran the lights alt current because leds use so little power that id rather waste 2 watts on the inverter and have a real switch than deal with ugly 12v stuff there is more than 1 way to do things    when not in use i move the switches to the center and everything is off except i can turn the fans on
  the limitations of the system     the 2 batteries wont put out enough amps to power the a/c when i get 2 more i assume this problem will be resolved     i dont have a battery charger on board because i let the sun do it for me i switch to shore power and the bank is good to go in 45 hours for free ive considered it but it is unnecessary at this time due to only the fans running off of it     certain gfci plugs really dont like my outlet circuit i dont know why but i have a switch at my shop thatll kick out when i flip the outlet master     i had the problem on one other gfci but normal outlets wont blow their breakers when its plugged in
  it already has insurance as an rv v
  it probably fucked up his muffler bearings too
  ford  for the break system  ford  has built in break system  this must be why they break so often
  do you have any more pics of your old bus  did you build it yourself
  what is the interior height
  if its like the new ones it should be 64 in the middle and like 56 by the windows
  kek at least it aint a piece of shit dodge
  sorry i was pretty drunk its bee a long week basically i have a cdl buying a big ass school bus to build a camper
  70ah of 12v dc battery  not enough to power the a/c unit  140ah should do it  anon most a/c units suck down more power than any mobile solar system can handle even a tiny 8000btu portable a/c unit will pull about 9 amps of 120v a/c which will be about 100 amps of 12v dc after the conversion unless you are running deep cycle batteries youll be able to run that a/c unit for about 30 minutes and use every bit of battery you have in the process ive got 220ahs of 12v dc battery for my setup and im not expecting to run more than my minifridge laptop a few fans and maybe a tv    unless you only plan on using a/c when attached to shore power then go right on ahead
  2 35ah 12v sealed agm solar batteries with a place for 2 more  i thought there was some sort of typo there 70ah is way too small for most peoples needs    i have been working on a van for about a year now designing the solar system at the moment i will be using 3 145ah agm batteries 400 watts of solar on the roof a 40a mppt charge controller and a 3000w inverter    i would highly recommend the book mobile solar power made easy by william prowse its a very short read and he explains exactly how to properly size design and install a solar system on a vehicle
  im going with a somewhat smaller system slightly tweaked for northern climates 2 6v 220ah flooded lead acid batteriesdeep cycle baby 300 watts of solar panel 45a charge controller and 1000w inverter then again im running a small setup with not a ton of power draw and expecting to get a bit less sunlight than on average
  just needs a tassel pinned to the top and youre all set
  laugh all you want but he can stand up in his van that is more than many of the low budget vanlifers can say its the best you can do unless you want to spend like 40k on a sprinter transit or a promaster cant wait until a decade from now when all those vans hit the used market
  your van is badass op
    yes it is op glassed in the top not cheap and it looks like he did a nice job      the white fez is pretty funny i would paint the whole van white but that is because i live in a very sunny place
  relax princess its only batner
  i was thinking of junk yard hunting for a safari van and get it running or cut the front clip off and wld a hitch on it
  220ah    trojen t195 boiiiiiiiii
  105 ffs
    325 for 6v 225 ah  trojans are awesome and all but i went for much cheaper batteries 99 for 6v at 220ah i paid about slightly over 1 for each ah in my system as opposed to about 290 an ah dont you love it when battery sellers give you a 10 discount just by picking the batteries up
i take naps in here sometimes if that counts
  are you a dog
the beast
dont need all that shit like a sink and toilet just a bed is all i need im outsidefuck all that weight who sets inside when camping
  human bean
  thats dope      i have the space to double it to 140ah that would run the fridge and fans all night which is more than enough especially for 240 worth of batteries 3 100 watt panels etc    it doesnt make sense to go bigger for what it is      im not planning on running the a/c off the bank but theoretically maybe in perfect conditions it could keep the cab under 80 on a hot night      im with you on being hyped to buy a ford transit a few years from now      thanks          thats cool    i wanted to strike a balance between you and those guys who pay 10k for a conversion
  ffra0511r1 frigidaire 5000 btu  450w 4a  on a 48v system  11a  roughly 6 hours a day  4 200ah deep cycles wont even flinch with that load and its not unreasonable to carry and charge them in a portable setup youre not fully charging in 1 day sure but you probably have a generator as backup anyways plus this setup will power lots of small stuff
  but it would be better to also note that this same power request from a standard wally world generator is childs play 450w you could literally spend 10 on gas and last like 3 days with a small generator vs this 2000 plus ecofrendli solar bs that still requires a generator for emergency charging

  wow elitist much   i want a nice cheap truck topper   i dont want to die    no seriously though 2 realistic options  buy a 4 door tons of room in the back of a silverado  buy a used topper on cl or whatever is the new marketplace these days
  im looking on getting one of those mini dorm fridge freezers  how many watts do they use  how many does yours use
              are you guys talking about typical solar batteries with those you can only discharge like 2030 of the battery before you have to charge it    im buying a 100 ah lithium lifepo4 battery which i can discharge to like 90 of the battery
  heat  what are you using for heat i was going to use propane
  fuckin eh man hope they are descent quality im probably going to take a road trip with a bro directly to a manufacturer if they allow it    fuck shipping
  with those you can only discharge like 2030 of the battery before you have to charge it  nigga what are you talking about   that figure is for starting batteries not deep cycle aka leisure ones
  breaks diesel engine with vegetable oil  she wanted the van to be vegan  the footshooting misadventures of veganism never ceases to be hilarious
  on the internet no one knows youre a dog  delet
  dorm fridges  typically a consistent 140 watts theyre poorly insulated so they use lots of power insulating them or using a radiant heat barrier does wonders for lowering power consumption    an aside  if you know the moveout days for your local 4 year university college students throw out so many working minifridges that its not even funny those are your tax dollar funded student grants going straight into the trash they do have to be thoroughly cleaned out though they all inexplicably have a shedding cats worth of hair in them
  bullshit   the solar ones you still cant discharge part like 40 look it up
  typically a consistent 140 watts  i heard it was a lot less  where do you get this figure from    i heard it was high until it gets cold then it uses low wattage to stay cold
  i salvaged a lot of older mini fridges and they draw around that much it may be different for the newer stuff but i wont know until they hit the dump for me to salvage its true they consume far less power once cooled down but since theyre built cheap they do need a little help when keeping them energy efficient
  typically a consistent 140 watts    i heard it was a lot less    i salvaged a lot of older mini fridges and they draw around that much  avg 580w per 24h period
  heat is for squares    ill run off shore power most of the time so when i need it the a/c has a heat function it just reverses the freon flow but blankets can get anyone through off the grid     also i could replace the rusted out leisure battery box that was under the frame of the van and add a bigger deep cycle if i wanted but i just dont need to id get a hazard fraught quiet generator before doing that put it on a gear rack and stay cozy 24/7      get an old one and remove any excess weight    and for anyone whos gonna cut a roof off a van use a recip saw angle grinder takes way longer used both but ran out of rip blades
  the way ive always know the rule is 40 for starting batteries and 80 for deep cycle aka the solar ones that is how i use mine    i hit the google but cant find anything like youre suggesting
  i think my 230v one draws about 45w max so if you just estimate it is on half the time you can get a decent idea
  dude you dont k ow anythimg im posting this on 4chaj so i must be right
  no im talking about 6v deep cycle marine/golf cart batteries they are heavier than your usual flooded lead acid batteries but they can take abuse better i dont plan on dropping below 50 charge but its nice the know the battery can take it if i have to      on a 48v system  11a  roughly 6 hours a day  4 200ah  ok but youre gonna pay more for 48v solar panels four 12v deep cycles and a 48v inverter i got 300w of 12v solar for about 300 a 48v solar system capable of 11a will run you about 10001200 like i said before i got 220ah of 12v for roughly 200 youll be paying about 300 per each 12v 200ah deep cycle for 1200 just for the batteries i got a 700w 12v inverter for 150 the cheapest inverter that would be capable of powering that a/c unit and very little else would be 250 650 total for a 12v solar system capable of running a minifridge and a few other items versus 2450 for a 48v solar system capable of running a tiny a/c unit unless you wanna dump over 2 grand into solar for your mobile setup its just not worth it
  30 year old tranny  owned by pikeys for probably 2 decades  ive spent thousands  i should buy a fiat    thanks for the laugh anon
  i would like to point a few things out  youre so poor you think 2000 to 3000 bucks is alot  youre under the impression that i think its a good idea    i would never suggest it as that whole setup wouldnt last you 10 years a generator can quadruple that output for the same cost and last over 20 years with a hefty tank and a trailered generator you can go off grid for weeks asuming you limit your power usage reasonably    solar setups arent for poor people theyre for grandpa who already got his 401k payout still earns a pension and has enough time to actually diy theyre for mr and mrs smith who had total solar llc to install a setup for free but they pay for the electricity it generates its for the google developer who needs to live0ffgrid for his latest vlog post
whats the best way to cool the van down in the summer
  almost sounds like the mechanic was pulling one over on him in reality it was most likely the blinker fluid
  hahaha looks like you got fucked by a tranny
  park in the shade    run a tarp a foot above the roof to insulate from the sun    install two extractor fans on the roof one pulling air in one pushing it out
  do those air coolers work    the ones that you pump icewater through copper coils attached to a fan  
      if you super insulated your van wouldnt it just get super hot in the summer
  they work pretty well if you have a good supply of ice    problem is they add a lot of humidity and eventually will fuck up your interior
  problem is they add a lot of humidity and eventually will fuck up your interior  i was thinking of getting a dehumidifier to remedy this problem    thoughts
  it didnt even matter about all the work  i remember him posting and its too heavy for him to drive on his driving license anyway  classic case of doing absolutely zero research and getting burnt
  thoughts    a dehumidifier is an airconditioner that doesnt get rid of the heat
  it takes moisture out of the air    that plus the air cooler should work      no
  get a class b if a burger
  it takes moisture out of the air  and it gives a net gain in heat because it doesnt get rid of the heat it generates  it works like and airconditioner sorta  a compressor which makes heat runs compressed gas through an evaporator coil where moisture in the air collects and falls into a container  the evaporator coil cools the air but not enough to overcome the heat generated by the compressor thermodynamics  plus youre paying for the energy to run the air cooler which is adding the moisture/humidity  it would be less expensive to just run an airconditioner which cools and dehumidifies in one go
  with shades drawn on sun side doors open away from sun and fans on mine stays at air temp or lower     im touching up the topper edge and redoing the front edge cuz it delaminated from no surface prep
  babbys first van  i know a lot of people who have done this not enough brains to listen to sound advice
  what i dont understand is why nobody told him you could downrate to 35ton from 55ton just by fitting larger bumpstops
what kind of car should i get if i want to live in it but also be able to park it on normal parking lots where sleeping in your car isnt allowed so i can make mine look just like a regular parked car

  means a lot had to move out of living on my boat because of the crick in my neck
  im 18 and live with my parents when i eventually move out i like how it seems to live in a new trailer home either in a trailer park or on my own land    are new mobile homes a good idea  i hear they tend to depreciate in value over time  i cant find any used mobile homes for sale online that arent total wrecked pieces of shit    i was looking at this one         or this one with 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms      i live in houston where cheap apartments tend to be available so this may be a better option heres my plan   parents housecheap apartmentfor a few years or however long it takes me to get a better paying jobmobile homefor about 10 years until i find a mate and get a new house or give up on life and raise a family out of a trailer parksingle family house
  depreciate in value over time  they depreciate while youre signing the papers to buy it  stay with your parents while saving enough to get into a new or used home  programs are available to help new couples buy their first home
  i hear they tend to depreciate in value over time  they depreciate instantly     i cant find any used mobile homes for sale online that arent total wrecked pieces of shit  that is because they are built like shit and should be considered disposable  your walls will be the same garbage they make office cubicles out of   one little leak in a corner or window seal and your whole interior goes into the trash      if you consider it disposable and pay it off 500/mo as if it were rent you will own it in 5 years    consider one of those fancy sheds from old hickory or derksen instead  id say go for shipping containers but you cant really get those on a payment plan
  i dont want to do any work    get a shipping container    lololololol oh anon youre hilarious     the guy wont even repaint a 2000 mobile home
  dude just buy a used mobile i spent 5k on mine another approx 23k renovating it floors paint fixtures etc anything that looked like shit everything is nice now and whenever someone new comes over theyre surprised     tornados are scary though
  shit anon i grew up in a trailer park it was fuck as fuck man pretty much get to do wtf ever you want and always have a buddy or 2 to hang out with just down the road
   he shits where he eats and sleeps
  save time and money find cheap land and spend 12k on a cuckshed shell build your own home
  tornadoes are scarry    anon i raided through the last tornado aint no point in being affraid if its your time then at least i can be celebrating sweet net gear while getting impaled
  he doesnt know i meant fun    he feels the need to call out grammar errors on a fucking chinese marble discussion forum    just kys miserable 3rd world cuck
    napping in a 9296 mustang    are you like 56 or have a perma hunch to your back
  problem with mobile home is you need a place to park buying yourself a land or three and rotate seasonally some areas will only allow upto 6 months of stay per year so if you buy 2 cheap lands you can rotate between the two without having to deal with the law
say i had access to an old box truck which i could theoretically live out of but i am a man who   1 shits alot  2 does not like handling shit or emptying a shit bucket that has a risk of leaking    how do i build a decent toilet and shower into a truck i got a guy who can get me toilets and showers for cheap from ching chong land
  i need to be able to shit in my rv  i dont want to handle shit and/or blackwater tanks  ive got bad news for you that problem aside considering that you have a fairly large amount of space to work with id reccomend having a separate lavatory and shower but id have them next to each other id have the sink   for the lavatory drain onto the shower floor and have the shower drain through the bottom of the truck
  i just mean i dont wanna have one of those portopotties you see some of the van builds use where you gotta physically take out the toilet and empty it i just wanna be able to press a button and eject my shit through a hose of some sort
  1 shits alot  im on a meat/dairy only diet and shit once a week or less try it for a month see how it works out for you
  i just want to be able to press a button and eject my shit through a hose  youll want to start off by finding refuse tanks with a drain valve the problem with this is that you might not find a tank that meets your needs if you cant find anything that already exists that meets your needs you can try making your own tank and then using a sewage lift pump to drain it
  
this is what i want basically gonna copy this build with a few tweaks to have a mobile home office travel north when it gets warm south when it gets cold different view every day
  i never understood why anons dont just buy a used trailer and diy a camper and drag it with a half ton
  i would guess it has something to do with convenience of a single unit vehicle
  i guess youre right im buying a bus but im still hauling a moped fuck a bunch of monkeying around shitty cars
  i can tow anything with his camper van    you have a lot more options and flexibility when the living space is in the motored vehicle i can haul a trailer a boat another camper etc etc instead of the camper itself being the extra vehicle
  i decided not to go with a trailer because i dont want to have to exit my living area walk around to the front in the rain and then climb into the passenger seat in order to drive to get my morning coffee etc ill have the rear separated from the front by blackout curtains so i can have privacy but easy access    also by going with a van like a mercedes sprinter i can park in any standard parking    its just a personal preference and a bit more convenient for my needs
  install toilet and have it drain to a tank at the rear install a pump that vents the tank out your tailpipe useful for tailgaters and marking your sleeping areas
hi
      whats going on here anon
  dont forget your enzymes   but ive seen a custom build for an army vehicle that had the plumbing drain directly into one of these bad boys and then they had an access hatch on the side so you could roll it out and dump it     really cleverly removing the middle man and increasing usability
  ahaha faggot go b for being a piece of shit
  buy a forclosed shithole or tax sale bulldoze it and make and rv lot for 1
  do like i am anon build/buy big shitter tank plumb a big drain pipe with a rotating spray bar that spins when under pressure get electronic ball valve for shitter tank use it till full drive down highway at night pull over and have pipe on pasengers side push button and drain into the road ditch close drain and run spray bar open drain with sppray bar on close drain turn 360 and walk away
  i see didnt thinknof that
  anons i have found my dream home sadly married and for some strange reason my wife doesnt want to live in a box kek    197378 gmc motorhome
  new engine build
  do not do this  it can spread disease    theres a reason that human waste cant be composted for fertilizer
  drain into the road ditch  fuck you you make the rest of us look bad with this shit also there are places where you can properly dump refuse for free theres no fucking excuse for literal street shitting
  foreclosure sale or tax sale  dont these properties tend to be in crime infested shitholes though
  theres a reason that human waste cant be composted for fertilizer  what would that reason be  if you can get over the ewwww factor peecycling your own urine into the garden makes good sense fresh urine is high in nitrogen moderate in phosphorus and low in potassium and can act as an excellent highnitrogen liquid fertilizer or as a compost accelerator
  what would that reason be  part of what makes manure from cows pigs chickens etc act as fertilzer is the microbes in their fecal matter and those microbes seep into the ground if the fecal matter came from a diseased animal this can cause the disease to spread to other animals and in some cases humans in the case of humans not only can diseases by transmitted by fecal matter but there is also the issue of drugs being introduced into the environment also the use of manure frequently requires monitoring the ph of the soil where it is used monitoring that will never occur with human waste being dumped wherever
    install a septic tank of 50 liters or more    2 no touch pumping options    1 repurpose a small block chevy oil pump or similar gear type pump and your choice of motor or jus use a cordless drill the gears will crush peanuts chicken bones and even pump out turds like a 1 thick shit sausage  if you want you can also use a decomposing enzyme thing that turns everything into sludge the blue stuff from porta shitter  you cannot use toilet paper though it will lock up the gears 50 liters in less than a minute    2 pneumatic diaphragm pump harbor freight sells them for 150 it will pump out all sorts of shit and ass paper is no problem  you will need an air tank plus compressor about 100psi
  
  you wont always know for sure if you are ill and all it takes is one screw up with the processing of the waste to cause an epidemic
  vegan  she  that poor van never had a chance
  oh well fuck around dammit i guess i could build a metal swivel hose and hit up rv clean outs
  it depends some people die and nobody claims it or investors just forget they even have them
anyone donemuch with solar charge conteoller alternator charging and invertors especially in europe with 240v recommend me some brands
  theres a reason that human waste cant be composted for fertilizer    human waste makes the best fertilizer the big corporate farms get it straight from the city sewer system    organic growers cant use human waste because of the antiquated sewer system     if you eliminate all the disease carrying infected drug addicts etc human waste would be organic but these peoples shit gets mixed in the sewer system and ruins it for everyone     you can use your own waste as fertilizer for plants that you eat but you cant share those veggies with others and you cant eat veggies that were shat on by others like the bible says reap what you sow
  whats the reason i never understood that why cant we compost human dookie for fertilizer    i see why is paper verboten with the enzyme does it fuck it up either way with a big enough water tank it might be kind of nice to have the luxury of a bidet on board less storage space required for shit tickets as well i could be living my sci fi shitting fantasies
  now that i think about it i might go for something like this is there anything else that would fuck up the gears  use cool led toilet with some cleaningfeatures  bidet  try to find used dyson airblade  it could feel like shitting on a space station
  you are literally full of shit
  whats the reason i never understood that why cant we compost human dookie for fertilizer    he literally just gave you the answer it spreads disease    animals generally only susceptible to diseases specific to their species pathogens capable of infecting more than one species zoonoses are pretty rare so eating plants fertilized with the manure of another species is much safer its not that you can never use human waste in compost its just that you have to be more careful about it and theres not much reason to do so if you have ready access to just about any other kind of fertilizer
  the mechanic    yeah not cut out for /diy/
  pretty sure most of those repairs are way out of rearch for the average /diy/er
  thats the one i have i had to do some work after i bought it they forgot to put insulation in the master bathroom wall the toilet was rocking back and fourth it was sitting high off the floor on the pipe i had to change the faucet in the master bath it was leaking in the wall they ceiling vent wasnt wired into anything both doors leak on it i had to build a front and back porch with rooves to keep the rain from coming in i installed mini split heat pumps in it it is very efficient aftewr all is said and done i dont think i should have had to do so much work on it they drop dramatically in value good luck trying to resale it for anywhere close to what you got it for i think they go 10000 as soon as they leave the sale lot if you go to get one do check these types of things

  the best shitting experience on earth    its in a van next to the bed and kitchen
  in my current apartment the toilet is on the other side of a wall opposite my kitchen just wall it off and figure out a way to cut down on stink from all the lentils a van dweller is gonna have to be eating
  love will prowse seems like a cool kid but he is very naive about electricity and electronics to be writing a book about the stuff it seems  some of the stuff hes said in his youtube videos worries me that he wrote a book on it sorta      now that is a good idea i hate having to dump an rv tank into one of those and then haul it and dump it again _
this sounds great if youre in your 20s but i would not want to be a sad middle aged man living alone in a vehicle in a wal mart parking lot

hay guise i have zero money but want to do something like this wat do  
i would buy an army surplus truck and custom build a box for it    now i have experience in auto home building and engineering so i could go absolute ham on it and end up with a dope af set up    if you arent experienced i would use all your resources to draw and design your cabin before starting just on my van i took the 7 months of time i spent casually saving and constantly adjusted my plan until i got it perfected
  wat do  get some money
is this the right place to talk about outfitting smaller vehicles for travel too ive got a honda element id like to road trip with and im just curious what you guys think the essentials are when i had to live out of my car a couple of years back there were definitely some thing things i felt a serious lack of mostly a hot plate of some kind and some way to organize the stuff i needed to keep on hand
  is this the right place to talk about outfitting smaller vehicles for travel too  probably  road trip with  are you just going to be using this as an rv occasionally or frequently if the former itd be cheaper to use motels and if your case is the latter buy a used van its worth the investment  when i had to live out of my car a couple of years back there were definitely some thing things i felt a serious lack of mostly a hot plate of some kind and some way to organize the stuff i needed to keep on hand  are you still living in your car if so i dont have very good news for you all a car is going to be able to provide with how little space it has is a little storage basic shelter and heat in the winter if you are asking because you will have to or are otherwise planning on living in a vehicle again buy a used van preferably a cargo van
thinking of converting a ford box truck into a workshop/motor home i want to use a 2kw lpg generator inside of the van vented outside if i extend the generator exhaust through the floor and had active venting would this be safe
  vented outside  that will take care of the exhaust but you still need to make sure that your generator wont suck all of the oxygen out of the interior of the vehicle if the air intake for the generator is a single pipe with a filter youll be able to just have an air pipe pull air from outside of the van if not youll need to put the generator in a vented cabinet with the exhaust still going into an exhaust pipe the hardest part regardless of the situation is going to be keeping the generator cooled without overheating the interior of the van
  was thinking a 5 duct fan temp controlled with baffles through the floor and insulating/sealing with access on the inside im from the uk so dont need to worry about summer much
  summer  how hot does it get i know you said that you dont have to worry about the heat but if youre going to be having a mobile workshop both the tools and the generator are going to produce a large amount of heat  inb4 anons ask why workshopanon wants a generator in his truck  12v dc isnt going to be able to provide enough energy to power to kind of tools needed in a workshop
  just a light jab at our shitty weather here i would definitely be conscious of the heat the generator has safety shut off but i would probably set up another failsafe before that like a temp alarm
  check out real rvs that have generators on board    the old ones rolled out of the bottom storage area because they knew theyd never get the box 100 airtight to the cab    the new ones and motor coaches have generator compartments that dont extend but they are 100 air tight to the interior    with a box truck you ought to be able to build a box under the deck if you find the right generator     would also recommend the generatorbattery bank inverter set up to save generator fuel then its just charging the batteries at a low constant output instead of highlow alternating rpms
  and when i say air tight i mean its 100 inaccessible to the interior door seals fail fancy venting is never 100 and generators get fucking hot obv gas burns  2000 f
  i dont know if this is the right place either but i have this crazy idea where i want to take a golf r and turn it into a sort of mad max rally car i want to take out the back seats and the passenger seat and put some sort of tiny bed in it i wouldnt want to live out of it but i think it would be cool to have
  i want to take out the back seats and the passenger seat and put some sort of tiny bed in it  kei truck
  im not sure if youre kidding but i meant a bed for sleeping i want to keep it as a hatchback on top it would have a roof rack with spotlights
  just looked up the car you want to mod it doesnt look like youll have much room to play with regarding the bed it looks like youll have enough room for that based on your plans assuming that the bed goes from front to back

whats the market like for used ford transits these days
  good
  how used are we talking in europe the market was always good     the us market is getting pretty good now too and will get better as 4 and 5 year old fleet vans come on to the market
     hook up the aux batteries to the starter solenoid and the alternator will regulate voltage on the whole system while the key is on    are you fucking trolling or do you just not know how the alternator regulator works   hint its not a fucking honda bike    heres the scoop so someone else doesnt do this and destroy their batteries the regulator works by sending power to the alternator field coils when the input power reaches 138v the regulator chokes off power to the field coils so the alternator doesnt produce too much power for the system it a can only perform its function while the alternator is turning engine is running and b cannot regulate power introduced from anywhere besides the alternator    now if youre talking about a halfwave rectifier/regulator found on cheap motorbikes yeah that would work until you burned it out anyway but what you described would do precisely dick for regulating system voltage in a car truck or motorhome where the power is supplied from shore hookup or solar panels or whatever else         addendum this works if the engine is running and youre charging the coach batteries only by the alternator also there is a solenoid in factory motorhomes that does this anyway when the engine is running no need to add anything it is useful to add if youre say converting a school bus
  theres no way thatll hold if enough snow sits on itholy shit
  thats just the base for the fiberglass
  assuming that the guy is running a heater in cold weather it might be enough to constantly melt snow i just hope the fiberglass is thick enough wet snow is heavy as hell if it can go through the roof of a house it can that as well my inner criticalthinker is just tripping because theres really no central bracing along the top lengthwise wouldnt have been much more work to weld one final stretch of pipe with cutouts for those crossing its width forgive my autism
moron adj someone assuming that a van should have lots of batteries and solar panels and good heating systems maybe a full fledged hvac as well and appliances some coffee machine etc demanding literal kilowatts    as long as your house has engine and wheels you can just move to some warmer country to avoid a cold winter and to some cool mountain to avoid a hot summer just plan ahead of time    also carefully plan your electricity budget you just need a few led lights a smartphone maybe a tablet maybe a 12v beard trimmer a 12v hair dryer a very few amps will be needed for the 12v water pumps and 12v thetford toilet  yes  they come with a cost yet they will make you save a lot of money in the long run and you wont feel like a shit when the rain is pouring down wile you take a dump in a real thetford toilet instead of some cheap portapotty or some old bucket
  i dont know how to fiberglass properly  see    you couldnt put enough snow on this thing to get it to collapse    why would i add the weight of steel when the fiberglass is lighter and provides uniform strength
  you literally just said i was wrong and then said to do the exact thing i just said    the alternator kicks out when theres too much voltage just like the solar charger does    neither will blow the system or get blown by the other since they both regulate    is it ideal maybe maybe not but theres no reason to waste any money on anything else that will either waste power or operate the exact same as this system     please think before you post     t all of /diy/
  see      guy weighs 300freedom units and can walk anywhere on it
    you are wrong    youre telling him to use the alternator regulator to control the system voltage from the solar panel input that will not work
  i dont think hes saying that it would be really stupid if he was

  separate voltage inputs    the batteries are hooked to the starter solenoid they are also separately hooked to the solar controller     this way when the key is on the solar panels charge the bank and the engine battery     when the engine is on the alternator charges the engine battery and solar bank as 1 system keeping the voltage around 144 since the panels still charge during this time the alternator only has to put out more juice at night to keep that voltage as the panels can pump 18v easy midday       the solar controller protects the panels from the alternator so everything is kosher   i see where you got confused but you should have been clearer on what you were saying also
  im fairly certain that its illegal to remove the roof of the cab without properly welded supports in the states no one is going to charge you unless you get in an accident and die or kill/injure a passenger then insurance doesnt have to pay out and youre liable    could be wrong but all the literature i have read on aftermarket van toppers all say something similar
  pros   diesel  wide enough to sleep sideways    cons  easy to get a dui  have to bid govt liquidation auctions to obtain parts
    okay i get it i was under the impression you were trying to negate the need for a solar controller or whatever secondary input

  im having trouble deciding a sheen for my bedroom walls im stuck between matte eggshell and satin i used satin for the first coat but i feel like the gloss takes away from the color i have a second gallon of the paint in a matte finish ready to go but am hesitant to commit the room isnt that bright and i dont expect the walls to get that dirty which finish would look the best
  matte looks objectively better but it scuffs like a motherfucker and is hard to clean
  matte looks objectively better  i went ahead and starting painting the second coat matte i have to say it looks gorgeous if not better than the satin finish on those walls  but it scuffs like a motherfucker and is hard to clean  i went with a high quality paint benjamin moore aura so it should hold up im pretty gentle with walls anyway all in all im pretty impressed with the quality of the paint job
ive been sleeping on an air mattress for three months now and ive been having to pump it full of air every few hours to get it at a tolerable stiffness  reviewers say theyve been able to sleep on it daily for years whats up with that    ive checked the surface of the mattress for cracks and couldnt find any obvious ones so i think the internal air compressor must be leaking or something  what do you guys typically do to diagnose a leaking air mattress
  whats the cheapest way to fireproof bare pir insulation bonus points if it can be transported in a tiny shitbox ie fullsize plasterboard sheets are right out
  to be clear the leaking only started yesterday
  get some soapy water and spray the shit out of it if there is a tiny pinhole leak it will foam and be visible
  seams split if you keep it at max pressure or youre a fatass water/dish detergent on the seams will tell you where
  i went with a high quality paint benjamin moore aura so it should hold up    i think he meant more that it gets dirty fast the painters we hired did our baseboards in matte they looked like shit inside of a month     had to repaint them all       pinhole sized leaks do this     return it and get a new one
i have a weird electrical panel  the mains front panel is secured using a screw the screw has a hole drilled through it and a wire is run from the orange tag through the screw and then through a slit to unscrew the panel you have to break the wire     well as you can see someone just pulled the whole thing off the screw used to screw into  i assume  an l shaped piece of metal which snapped into the bottom of the panel box     im just going to fabricate my own but was wondering if anyone knew what this was called or had seen this before not critical  just curious     im going to take a l shaped piece of metal drill a hole in one side for the screw and then affix it to the base of the panel im not sure best way to do that i dont want someone to just unscrew it from the bottom     what would be a secure way to do this

  start your own thread diy kitty feeder deserves it
      i found a thin crack on the corner half the thickness of a pinky finger for now i put duct tape on while i wait for a repair kit didnt want to be without a bed during rma   should i do anything else to the tear in the meantime  normally with cracks in anything youd round out the edges so that the cracks dont spread but i dont think itll be necessary for an air mattress
  got a bike or have a friend who does bike tire repair kits are good for patching stuff like that im not an expert or anything    personally i would go spend 50 on a shitty mattress and sleep on that and return that inflatable thing sounds like you are just digging yourself in deeper and the end goal is still a shitty inflatable mattress wont repairing it mess up the rma

when tiling planar magnets what tiling pattern makes the most amount of force  do i tile them in alternating the poles or just force them together to have the same pole on one side
i plan to dismantle a washing machine that fell into disuse  what you guys think could be a good project for the parts    like rn i have no idea but i am thinking anything that works with the strength to tumble 13 kilos of clothes  water by a simply plugging into the power outlet gotta be able of doing something cool
    thanks for the input that hakko was what i was looking at before i am going to sneak in and see what iron he uses now when i am at his house
  the way to give them more force is to stack them together not to tile them    if you tile them the force lines would probably extend furthest away from the plane with an alternating pole arrangement but would have a wider field in the plane if they were arranged as same pole all on one side    it really depends on what youre trying to do but i would suspect for most cases alternating poles would work best just try to imagine the magnetic lines going from n to s poles and see if you can visualize it
  very helpful
  what youre trying to do  i want to stick something on a metal surface i have 10x40x3 magnets    stacking them might give more force per area but you would cover less area with given amount of magnets tiling in some way would give less force but your area would be more with the same amount of magnets i feel    ive been lurking a little since my first post not many data on configuration forces except hallbacharray pic related is the most information i found
posting this again im replacing the thermostat in my apartment and next to it is this 3 speed fan controller im looking for something more discrete so either rig it so it runs always at medium speed and i can plug up the hole or where can i find a replacement when i search hardware sites i only get back ceiling fan controls  can i use that or how can i rig this to run at medium the wires are thick gauge so i assume its using 120v
  the hakko is great but its really overkill ive been a fixing shit professionally for years and building fun shit for over a decade with one of these   
  make sure everything on the backplane that your leds are mounted to is matte black then throw like 2540 tint film on your glass there will be less light bouncing around behind the glass so itll all look dark but the leds will shine right through just 30 dimmer     hard abs plastic is garbage unless you want to make trailer park arrowheads throw it away   washer motors wont run on dc so unless you want a lawn mower that plugs into an extension cord throw it away      dont trust any answers you get here theres no way to know how that speed controller works from the information you provided so anyone telling you what to do is simply speculating my only thought would be taking the knob off so the controller can be set to medium and shoved back into the box with a flat faceplate
    i found out the switch is made by carson there is a wiring diagram on their site that shows red is low medium blue high is black      yellow is capped off so theres only brown which is labeled aux would it be as simple as twisting the brown and blue wires together    are 3 speed ceiling fan switches similar in wiring
  would it be as simple as twisting the brown and blue wires together    no dood the thing slows down your fan by putting a selected coil in series with your fan you cant go around it unless you want 100 speed     so best bet is to hide it inside but thats a really faggy thing to do real men love knobs they can play with i play with my knob all the time

  im thinking of buying a cheap compressor pic related costs 80euros atm would that be sufficient to run a impact gun and maybe for painting/blasting small parts gonna buy a high qulity compressor in a year or so any help is aprreciated
my nephew painted a bunch of rocks with acrylic paint and they look kind of cute but they are too dusty and dont feel good to the touch what should i use to seal it
  you could probably run the impact as long as you take time between fasteners but it wont run to its full potential because of the small fittings and hoses    painting other than airbrush and sanding/blasting are some of the things that you really want a powerful compressor that moves a lot of air also look at the duty cycle of the compressor because you will fry the thing really fast if youre trying to run it right at max capacity all the time and the pump is always running
  washer motors wont run on dc so unless you want a lawn mower that plugs into an extension cord throw it away  thanks for the knowledge man i may do actually as long as i can do a standing mower instead of one of those karts than i am actually down to see if i can pull off
  thanks it got 110 l/min effective with a 24l tank and its oil free there are some others with 50l tanks for not that much more too bad i cant run a paint gun with it

  how to stay motivated i have many unfinished projects and only one weekend between this and the kids its a lose lose i just cant seem to stay motivated to finish anything should i promise myself a reward or what works for you
  need an electrician in heremy house is a 1940s build and all the wiring appears to be copper 12 gaugemy garage has a 15 amp breaker but it keeps tripping with the heater 1500 watts and a 46 amp tool running     can i just toss a 20 amp breaker on the box safely
  a small hole and a jigsaw
  stop starting new projects until the others are finished
  the heater should probably be on its own circuit you should also be 100 certain about the wiring instead of hoping theres no mystery junctions somewhere it would not be safe to just put a larger breaker on there
  well its a detached garage and an independent circuit would be too expensive to run as would rewiring the whole thing the line coming into the garage is 100 12 gauge at its first termination which my heater is plugged into     your concerns are duly noted though ive been thinking about a hot dawg propane heater im just concerned about sawdust explosions when im sanding i might just run the heater until the place warms up switch it off work until its too cold and restart the heater then
  sorry to beat a dead horse but from the manufacturers page it says its a rotary switch    a rotary switch consists of a spindle or rotor that has a contact arm or spoke which projects from its surface like a cam it has an array of terminals arranged in a circle around the rotor each of which serves as a contact for the spoke through which any one of a number of different electrical circuits can be connected to the rotor the switch is layered to allow the use of multiple poles each layer is equivalent to one pole usually such a switch has a detent mechanism so it clicks from one active position to another rather than stalls in an intermediate position thus a rotary switch provides greater pole and throw capabilities than simpler switches do    isnt that just connecting one wire to another
  lets approach this analytically if the switch was active adding in various droppers to limit power then how many wires would it need two one in one out  it has like 4 right so pretty safe to assume one common and 3 switched  this is pretty common for fans actually to present winding arrangements to choose between for speed its the simplest way to do it  you seem to have done your homework and are pretty confident right theres only one way to know for sure  if you had a multimeter and knew how to use it safely i would tell you measure it

i want to weld a workbench with a wooden top and just thought about something what can i do to prevent the inside of the steel legs from rusting should i use some fluid film or something else im new to welding
  paint
  from the inside
  google overtopping dam
  take the top off weld it paint it put top back on obviously you are trying to halfass it to save work
will a decent carbon filter on a diy fume extractor electronics bench filter the fumes to an neglegible extent for my lungs and health  or theres still some significant percentage that can cripple my health with prolonged exposure

  getting toxic resins and carcinogenic fibers everywhere
    having a speed control thats just a rotary switch is certainly doable but such a switch is usually located inside the fan itself and is activated by a pullchain now its conceivable that someone would extend those 4 wires down into the electrical box and then extend them again with short sections of redblueblackyellow wire    there are easier ways but this method would certainly work and i suppose costwise it would be equivalent you spend more on wire but less on the speed controller so if you see those 4 wires going out of the box and into the fan instead of just 2 go ahead and try shorting bluebrown still document every change so someone else who doesnt suffer from ocd can restore its functionality        most likely the buzz is from a dirty power supply if it has two jacks sending linelevel sound out you might try hooking up external speakers to those such as amplified computer speakers        the best filter you can use is the great outdoors try to send the fumes outside using something like 4inch round dryer vent  still unless youre doing this for hours just a fan to blow the stuff away from your face is plenty

2250inlbs of torque  at what point do you need to go with impact sockets i always ran regular chrome sockets on my 1/4 drivers but this brushless thing is quite a bit more powerful
   i dont know how to google torque specs for tools  funny how you have so much to say about them but then you ask retarded questions like this that can be answered with a search fuck off faggot
  the torque spec for the impact did you read the question
  at what point do you need to go with impact sockets    id always use impact rated but like you i have on occasion used ordinary sockets with fear and trepidation    pic related is an adapter that i abused i cant remember if it was impact rated or not but after failing to break a fastener loose using it on my impact driver i noticed that it had twisted quite a bit but is fine otherwise
  i already assumed that i will destroy a few of those cheap adapters if the thing is really putting out 150ftlbs i have some of those milwaukee shockwave ones though so im hoping they will do a bit better but might result in less impact force on the nut or bolt    i was moreso worried about the sockets i have 1/2 drive impact rated sockets but may be looking for a set of 3/8 and 1/4 drives if i have issues never had a problem using regular sockets on my old 18v dewalt or the 12v ridgid but those are far less powerful i think that new impact may be 3speed though so i dont have to go full force on trim screws and shear each one off
less of a diy and more of a general construction question my fathers been trying to cover the roof in plastic resin to stop water infiltration from a couple of holes in the actual roof but so far it keeps dripping inside because the holes are way too big to just cover with some paint and hope for the best  my stupid ass however made the uneducated guess that maybe some das could be used to plug those holes before the paint is reapplied again  is it a viable method or should i consider plugging those holes with something else
  i have this window above my front door which is ugly opaque/reliefed and lets through a lot of heet since its single pane i want double glass in it so i decided to do it in one go with all the other windows in my house i want to replace next year or so however i thought since this is such a simple window no moving parts and theres wood around it because of the doorframe i thought i could probably get away with just ordering a sheet for lack of a better word of double glass the size of the outer frame and putting it between glazing beads nailed to said frame the mullion and the inner frame would disappear it would just become one large window     is there any reason why this would be a bad idea i dont know that much about windows apart from installing ready made german pvc ones with my father so this could be a stupid idea but idk it would save money and time

how hard is it to diy my own scroll saw    i could either mount my jig saw or try to matthias wendel it but i dont trust myself to go that route

  measure for squareness  a rectangle of glass may not fit into a parallelogram hole
    thanks will do so there are no major obstacles when doing it like this insulation issues
    i did some more research apparently its a very bad idea to let double glass rest on wood come to think of it there were always plastic spacers underneath and to the sides of the glass in windows i installed with my father    i made a drawing of what i think should be the correct way

what pressure regulator should i get for tig welding  is it worth spending extra money on a nicer one eg pic related harris 651 125  or will a 35 generic chinese one be just fine  the better ones claim to save on gas and are probably more accurate/consistent but is that worth the extra price  does anyone own a cheap one how bad is the build quality feel in hand  any safety issues with them
  any safety issues with them    anyone try tig welding with acetylene
  any old shit is fine even borrowing the oxygen regulator from a cutting torch will work set your argon to hiss adjust by feel    camwhore welders are gonna push all sorts of pro stuff flow meters pyrex cups proprietary fixture tables gas lenses the size of egg cups bluetooth footpedals whatever its driven by advertising revenue you can buy it if it makes you feel like a pretty princess but you dont need it
  quads of truth  thanks guess ill get the cheap one then  camwhore welders and expensive toys  i know welding is probably the most marketing infested tool division  but since a pressure regulator is a necessity and not just some toy gimmick  i was worried that its a buy once cry once situation where cheaping out causes trouble in the long term    old shit  unfortunately not an option just getting started without family/friends in the trade  and i dont think that the general hassle of buying used is worth it for such a cheap item

  in the olden days a pane of glass was put in a wooden frame the back opening was slightly smaller to stop the glass falling out and the inside was packed all around with putty to hold it in place because its wood that can absorb moisture but mostly because its packed with putty so there is nowhere for moisture to go it doesnt matter about drainage  with upvc windows people got lazy the window is still held by a rubber weather strip on the outside and clip on rubber strips on the inside  rather than use loads of putty plastic packers sometimes timber hold the panel in position around the edges before the rubber strip clips are installed this leaves gaps and shit for water to get into the rubber isnt perfect like putty it has joins and gaps unfortunately thats what you need drain holes for in upvc if you used glazing putty in a timber frame or just silicone the fuck out of it you wont need drains  or knock the old wood out completely and find a second hand upvc unit for cheap because someone ordered the wrong size cheaper to get the whole thing than a new panel

  no when it comes to air compressors dont cheap out and make sure it can at least match your most air hungry tools required psi at the appropriate cfm
  test a clear coat spray on it unless you want to handle these rocks    i forgot to mention that you can also smoke your compressor if its running beyond its duty cycle in an attempt to keep up with your air demands

  fenix olight thrunite nitecore    theyre all fancy aluminum tubes with leds     and the impact sockets i think i will grab that 3/8 drive set eventually would buy it right now but i have too many xmas gifts to buy was talking to a buddy and he says he used regular chrome all day on his milwaukee fuel stubby which is rated over 200ftlbs but weaker in reality so ill use my 1/2 impacts if im going to work on something tough but i dont think i need to worry about a 10mm shattering on that 1/4 driver and any 1/4 drive sizes on that impact the fastener will probably shear before i crack a socket
  fenix olight thrunite nitecore  thanks
  flashlight  get the blf a6 if you want a general purpose one and dont have any special needs    its as good if not better than the big name brands  i cant vouch for the included 18650 cell but the combo deal is cheaper than the light itself  so you might wanna buy additional cells

  only if you need the degree for a job you could get involved in the industry writing code and then leverage that into whatever you wanted 4 years working in a robotics lab is going to be way better for your end goals than 4 years in university or whatever
  this was sort of what i was hinting at when i said theyre all just aluminum tubes with leds i got a couple of those lights that zoom and they sell under a million different brands i think they have an as seen on tv version named the tac light 2 for 20 runs off 3x aaas or 1x 18650 and at full zoom you can see a couple hundred feet away find the option with the modes and button you like and dont worry about the brand too much since theyre using the same bulbs anyway    harbor freight even has a bunch of new ones that are pretty good for the money and always in sale that rechargeable one goes on sale for 19 a lot
  those lights that zoom  harbor freight pic related  avoid those they are basically 5 lights sold for 20 using low performance leds and drivers where proper design doesnt really matter    while the nicer 50 ones    fenix olight thrunite nitecore   use the brightest leds available and theyve been properly engineered to handle the higher current and dissipate the heat    ive recommended the blf a6 because its on par with those 50 brand name ones but being sold for 20  since it has been designed by hobbyist autists at  and is being produced and distributed by the chinese  this combination gives you the best bang per buck    just compare the light output to your harbor freight special  the blf a6 advertises 1600 lumen and measurements report 10001200 of actual output  while harbor freight only claims 220 lumen and who knows what the actual output will be
  depends on what you want to do  i have a lot of nigh end flashlights but in the end i carry a pretty pedestrian fenix e12 on me every single day it really is a perfect every day flashlight  check out suspension clips if you plan on carrying your flashlight in your pocket you can get chinese ones for really cheap      theyre all fancy aluminum tubes with leds   dont worry about the brand too much since theyre using the same bulbs anyway    leds are only a part of the equation the emitters and the implementation of the emitters are just as or even more important    cheap flashlights are cheaper because they skip out on proper emitters which cost as much as the led does or even more importantly the pill or aka the heatsinking you know how a lot of really cheap lights have your typical 5 mode low med high strobe sos they all use the same exact shit emitter that is fucking garbage    this leads to flashlights that get hot the heat causes led and emiiter failures and loss of efficiency much lower battery life     its not hard to make a flashlight that is 200 lumens that gets hot after 2 minutes and gets a 20 minute battery life they arent practical and their usability goes way down people who actually need to use a flashlight cant deal with poorly implemented flashlights
trying to pick a trade to go to school for thinkin either welder or millwright    any opinons i think welding is really fun but i could imagine it would get old doing it all day every day plus i got a family friend who is a millwright who says any retard can weld and that millwrights do twice as much as any welder but hes probably biased

  not really interested in electrical to be honest
  i have a lot of high end flashlights  when you ask a wine snob which flavor franzia were drinking tonight
  much closer to   bepis the boonesfarm drinker goes to /ck/ and tries to like like an authority in a dedicated wine thread    but then again that is prevailing theme to the majority of your posts here
there are these red/pink spots that came up after the paint dried in my room doesnt matter how much plaster i put or how much i sand it they come back up
    dont worry about it its just grannys bodily fluids from where she was walled in eventually shell become mummified
  how long does it take for them to come back what is the wall underneath  drywall or concrete   have you tried replacing the drywall    could it be pink mold
  how long does it take for them to come back  a few hours    what is the wall underneath  drywall or concrete  concrete    could it be pink mold  never seen pink mold before here so i dont know i do live in a damp place
  these red/pink spots that came up after the paint dried in my room
  yeah i used the one i always use never happened before
  never happened before  now its happened
  i keep seeing deals on two packs of angle grinders why would people want to buy two angle grinders
    so you can keep going when the disk breaks
  the problem with using polyester resins/fiberglass is that they have styrene or fiberglass thinner in them    styrene is inarguably linked to lung cancer to safely fuck with styrene inside youd have to have an enclosed ventilated workspace that pumps a lot of air actually outside instead of recirculating like most stove vents     so to answer your question super heavy duty plastic enclosure with cardboard floor and a super duper vent fan
  obv need to stop fapping exercise and sleep more
  you paint over them plaster over them and in a few hours they return    move out that is legit a haunted fucking house
  superstitious fuck    if you havent tried shellac based primer then then you havent tried everything    shellac based primer will actually seal the stain and cover it whereas everything else is porous so the transmission fluid/ red diesel/ blood can just come back to the surface    now if you use shellac based primer and it still comes back then your house is haunted and you need to gtfo      
  kilz is just a shit brand   every paint has mold inhibitors see killers in it  every oil based primer works similar to kilz 1 every latex primer works similar to kilz 2    shellac based primer is the only primer that works 100 of the time for stain blocking
  im a chef too
do you guys have any recommendations for really nice dimmers for 12v led strips theyre the fancy highcri yuji ones and i know some ways of dimming fuck with color temperature and cri so im worried about buying a bad dimmer
  shellac based primer is the only primer that works 100 of the time for stain blocking    we had a house where 2 chain smokers lived for decades oil kilz then latex failed more oil kilz failed then shellac and it still bled through we gave up and suggested they replace the sheetrock
  odor blocking is different than stain blocking    to odor block you need to paint with waterproof paint like drylok
    i should have been more clear the walls were yellow and they stayed yellow no matter what we put on them
anyone know how can i restore the spring inside this pen its a papermate if it makes any difference
    smelt some beryllium copper alloy and you can make a nice spring just dont breathe the beryllium dust
  that nicotine and tar just absorbs new paint you either have to clean and sand that sticky shit off which could take weeks in a bad house or put a dozen coats of paint on
  because the hammer and chisel mechanics act like they are some god tier tool and use them for everything when in fact they are shit for almost everything
  when in fact they are shit for almost everything    in some cases they are awesome for cutting metal in a location where you cant get a hacksaw or some other tool they are awesome for trimming something like a deckscrew when it protrudes through a board and is a hazard on occasion they are the best way to cut metal stock    they can be dangerous and they can be loud eye and ear protection helps maybe even a full face guard

so i have built this workbench using wetroomplates not sure how to translate but they are too shiny how can i make them more nonshiny
  do work on them until they get dirty and scuffed
  bathroom tiles    i would put drawer liner on it or something
  that way you dont have to keep switching disks grinders flap disks or wire brushes when on one project i have 4      also this
  what is this screwdriver for
  there are all sorts of retarded security type screw designs to get in your way in the middle of a project so maybe one of those my leaf blower carb requires a pac man screwdriver to adjust it
  one of my first lessons as a poorfag living in the middle of nowhere was that any screw is a flathead if you try hard enough
  torx and a hammer will do work as well
is this silencer a meme or does it actually quiet the check valve normally i wouldnt care but i sleep in the basement      thanks    depends on what you want to do  all sorts of stuff i need a portable jackofalltrades type if that makes sense    reason why im back itt at 5 in the fucking morning is because i had to struggle with a shit flashlight in 11f weather while man handling a frozen sump pump hose and utility knife i also need a headlight too because you can never have enough hands
  oh and i agree with you on the fact that they arent all aluminum tubes with leds in them i dont want chinesium chink shit
thinking of removing the rust on my exhaust manifold by using vinager and steel brush then painting over with heat resistant paint anybody tried it does it work
this thing is 605 cm wide im considering getting one and placing my 52 cm long computer case inside cutting ventilation holes into the back and/or side of the cabinet is this a really bad idea
also the monitor and whatever would be on an adjacent bench
  just make sure you have both intake and exhaust vents of sufficient size
just bought my first foreclosure cheap at 75k    should i replace appliances that work but are old and do not match the aesthetic of my kitchen the stove and dishwasher are ugly thinking of getting stainless steel ones to match my refrigerator old but good looking    or should i replace all three in a black friday bundle deal
  the aesthetic of my kitchen    you are apparently homogay so yes replace them all
  update i lied about the dishwasher it is broken    torn on the stove
are short sales worth it
  thanks decided to go with an open shelf instead will get an ikea bror and modify it with some nice hardwood panels and stuff will allow me to have only a front panel and maybe metal mesh sides on the shelf where the pc sits
i am designing a parachute recovery system for a hobby water rocket    i want to the nose cone to be held in tension by a rubber band attached to a servo arm after a fixed period of time determined by experimental launches to time apogee i want the servo arm to be given power and turn 90 degrees thus allowing the rubber band to slip off of the arm letting the nose cone detach from the rocket thus pulling the parachute out of the rocket body    what electronic chip can i interface with the servo arm to accomplish this task how would i power the chip/servo arm    i think i could accomplish this idea with an arduino nano but i am looking for something lighter and smaller
  does it actually quiet the check valve  if your check valve is causing water hammer then it should work  this is an air cavity to make a shock absorber to stop water hammer
  the simplest way would be to use a 555 timer chip there is tons of information on it on google basically you want an astable oscillator also known as a oneshot oscillator you can run it with a 9 volt battery one resistor and one capacitor    as far as the servo goes if youre in to model rockets already you should be able to figure it out but im guessing you dont really need a servo you more likely just need a regular dc motor
  i had a thought that maye you could still buy lead solder from chinese knock off sites like wish so i looked and it appears that yoiu can but does anyone know if its up to scratch as a lot of the stuff on those sites obviously isnt
they probably use the same shit themselves so it should at least be workable i bought generic chink rosin core 63/37 that i use all the time and its fine
what would happen if you tried driving a speaker above its rated max frequency say its rated at 27khz and you drive it to 32khz
  it doesnt make as much sound
definitely not the right thread or place to ask but does anyone here have experience building diy because commercial ones are pretty weak from what i hear powerful ultrasound vermin repellers dogs raccoons insects and others trying to figure out where to start plenty of options but im on a short budget    there are 3 main ways  purchase a niche purpose built device like the ones on myskunkworksnet rated for up to 130db doesnt way measured at what distance nor watts  build an array of piezo tweeters and build the amp myself plus either use a mix of arduinopi mix or 555s or premade ultrasound frequency generators  get a ultrasonic transducer for a ultrasonic cleaner ebay has these going for as little as 35 28khz 100watts plus driver board but im pretty sure you need a horn or something added to it to actually produce sound cant find info on that though not even sure if these can be used to produce sound to be honest
which board should i start a smart home general on /diy/ or /g/ just trying to get me feet wet before i start my first project
  can silicone melt plastic if it gets pressed against it for a while i was digging through storage and found an old dildo resting against the ps3 it was stuck to it    i pulled it away and the black plastic of the playstation where it touched had turned into a soft goo dripped onto the paper beneath it too unplugged and the damage was from the outside dildo completely undamaged    really weird
        happens with fishing rubber worms too found similar messes in my tackel box  soft plastics have plasticizers that keep the material supple  it can melt other plastics if left in contact for long periods of time
  then it wasnt either silicone or actually body safe
    i dont think we should discount a smart home general outright ive seem two definitions of smart homes which are in one of the two categories the cutting edge of construction technology or wifi connected bidets
  interesting thank you anon surprising i didnt find anything about it searching lucky none of the parts that mattered on the machine got damaged      good to know its an uncomfortable dildo anyway hence it being away in storage ill toss it
  watch out for such plasticizers in cheap childrens toys made in china as well dont buy rubbery plastic toys for your kids or nephews
im trying to make a stencil think spray paint stencil of pic related so i can use some glass etching compound to make a gift for a friend how should i start making a stencil i can cut out and apply to the glass within gimp / photoshop    spoilerapologies if this is the wrong place to ask/spoiler
  i had a similar situation i used superglue to coat the area around the leak then laid on a small patch made from a bit of ziplock freezer bag worked like a charm for 3 years when i got a memory foam to replace it
    smart home general  general  you dont need to become a general right off the bat just because you want continued attention if you make an interesting thread anons might post in it share what you know first then maybe others will contribute too    maybe theres no interest or itll get nothing but shitposts until it drops off the board but you definitely dont need permission to make a thread just because you think a general is the only way to proceed
  option 1  2 50 gallon drums open ends welded together to make a tank lay flat punch several holes in bottom side for drainage dig bigass hole for tank run drainlines to tank cover up bonus points for wrapping tank with landscaping fabric to keep dirt from getting in through holes  option 2  the white trash redneck way run pvc drainpipe to ditch or ravine youre done white trash dont need no epa rules gubmint aint gonna tell me what to do on my own land freedom bitches

pic related  does the black arm with the two wheels that come down spin to feed paper into the printer   because the arm comes down but i dont see the wheels spinning   i dont want to trash a printer if i can help it its an hp officejet 6500 e710af
im making a bookshelf out of spare wood one question  how should i mount the legs i think i should do it like this pic or flat or should i run one piece down the back and make it like a floating shelf
anyone know of good cheap led grow lights or similar that ship within eu im not going to use them to grow but to use for red light therapy since being marketed as such seem to make the things ten times more expensive around 630 or 660 nm wavelength as well as 850 nm ones are most relevant for this use as well as decently high output bonus points for generating little emf
does anybody know if there is a way to set up an aeroponics system on the cheap
  i dont see the wheels spinning  the wheels probably cant spin unless there is paper in there  the wheels grab the plastic and lock up instead of sliding the paper
  is this thing going on the upper wall or on the floor
i have a 3filter water filter system  sediment prefilter  osmosis filter  carbon post filter  i replaced the prefilter and postfilter recently but now theres a ton of particulates and air bubbles coming out with the water the water pressure is also significantly higher compared to before i did the replacements    should i take out the filters and flush the system and tank with bleach again replace the osmosis filter it had a slimy yellow film on the outside that i wiped off when i had it out
  i watched with and without paper and it was the same i just found out my sister force fed card stock through the wrong feed slot so theres that  reeeeeeeeee
flashlightfag here im leaning towards the fenix e12 im planning on using it as my bedside light/misc things around the house   looking for opinions
  my sister force fed card stock through the wrong feed slot  you should force feed something through your sisters feed slot
  fenix e12  i ordered this      based on another anons recommendation    i only ordered it a couple of days ago so it will be a while before i actually have it in my possession
  ill check it out thanks
  how does it charge you have to take the battery out    anyway that looks straight because it will probably run forever if they give you the battery in the pic
  you coulda probably filled with water before installation air in the lines doing weird shit itll burp/flush out eventually or bleed the sys hint air goes up hill
  i admit that when i filled up the filter housing initially i didnt top them up completely i already checked everything a second time after noticing issues and made sure to top up that time especially getting air out of the filters themselves but the problems persisted    its the particulates that bother me the most ill put a glass down after filling and junk will settle down to the bottom i even had a piece of film come out of the faucet when i first put everything back together  maybe i need to do something with the tank instead something groans when i run the water at full blast for a while the faucet likes to drip too when off or maybe its the inline filter right before the faucet too many things to check when it shouldnt be any different from before changing out filters

i thought this problem was over but its 430 am and i was woken up by a mouse at a bait station mice have been waking me up since june and im losing my shit by losing my sleep  first exterminator set poison bait traps which seemed to work at first i finally called terminix and they did what i have done in the past place glue traps they also sealed the house although i called them back because they missed a spot by the front step there was mice shit everywhere they should have seen it    tldr  whats the best fastest way to make a mouse auschwitz
hi /diy/ i am out of desk space and am looking to have a sort of collapsible extended piece of wood attached to the edge of a table that can support some weight for maybe a laptop or such    what would you do in this kind of predicament
  go to shawn woods youtube channel then sort by most popular  i suggest the rolling log trap the walk the plank trap or possibly the bowl of peanut oil trap
  folding side tray would be super easy just get a solid hinge and make sure you brace it well when its open    otherwise if you want a slideout take a little drive around on trash night and find an old desk or dresser down by the street and rip those rails and rollers or whatever theyre called off one of the drawers go to home depot and get a piece of wood the proper size and attach the garbage picked rails to your desk and the new wood
was looking to get a cheap battery powered mower to get the few places i cant get my real mower ride on into then remembered i had this piece of shit in the shed i picked up when masters closed down a couple of years ago rather than getting a 18v to 240v inverter do you think this thing already has a low voltage motor inside  ill take it apart tomorrow and have a look probably its night time now  its a wesco ws32lm 1000w if anyone know where i could find technical info its probably cheap chinese crap thats sold under heaps of different names all over the world
  thanks does he or someone else you know of have videos on how to keep them out in the first place
  i dont know of any    but i guess you have mice because you have a food source and/or a nesting material source so i guess keep the place clean secure any food sources poison anywhere they might be getting nesting materials from and just generally keep killing them until there is none left
  do you think this thing already has a low voltage motor inside  no its cheaper to make a high voltage motor this powerful than to make a low voltage motor and a voltage converter    18v to 240v inverter  for  wesco ws32lm 1000w    1000w  1000 watts at 18v is 56 amps  18650s wont work at this unless you do it with 60s10p pack 600 18650 cells  12 or 24vdc to 240ac inverter is more practical  use one or two 12v lead/acid batteries capable of 45 amps
  18650s wont work at this unless you do it with 60s10p pack 600 18650 cells  your math is wrong for 18v you need 5 in series and good cells can deliver up to 15 amps  so lets stay conservative and only draw 10 per cell  hed need a 5s6p pack or 30 cells as a minimum
    ok fuck it ill just go buy a 100 used petrol mower
  yes a folding side tray seems right up what i want but i dont know what kind of hinge i want exactly and how i attach it to my table im not really used to all the diy stuff but im thinking this isnt too complicated i just wanna make sure i dont ruin my desk too
  your math is wrong for 18v you need 5 in series   yes my math was wrong but in a different way  i was doing the 60s to get the 240v without an inverter  i was still thinking of the high current drawn at 18v when i said 10p  and good cells can deliver up to 15 amps   not continuously as in mowing the lawn  the almost 5a drawn by the motor at 240v is more practical drain  so it would be 60 series cells without the need to parallel  but that may still not work because the motor could be ac only instead of an ac/dc universal motor
  so i had looked at his previous iron and there was no markings on it he had mentioned that a while back that he had bought a bunch of points when they company stopped manufacturing 10 years ago i think i am going to go with the weller and get a precision tip with it
  the e12 is the perfect small flashlight using common batteries and with decent battery life for its output its practical i use one throughout the day working on helicopters
my hot water was stupidly hot so i decided to turn the t stats down a bit when i stuffed the insulation back in the blue wire apparently touched the black terminal right screw how fucked is my water heater
hey /diy/ i am creating a coffee table for a school project and was wondering if miter joints are an applicable joint here im scared that they arent but they look aesthetically best in this table design any suggestions
  may have just tripped the breaker  worst case thermostat needs replaced about 20 i think  a better pic of wiring or schematic would be helpful
  the breaker did trip didnt hear it go so i didnt think to look dont wanna turn it back on yet
  might have fried the thermostat contacts  if it were me id tape the blue wire move it and turn it on  watch the temp and make sure its turning off  if it doesnt come on or doesnt turn off replace the top thermostat  if it works but you seem to run out of hot water faster replace the thermostat    if you have a meter or test light connect one side to the blue then the terminals marked 24 should turn on or off depending on the thermostat setting
  ill have to try that without a light or a meter and see if i can find a cheapo thatll serve only got an automotive multimeter it wouldnt handle the voltage
  thanks only thing missing is a clip desu   do you own any other flashlights
im having a hard time figuring out some rope rigging lets say i have a rope with loops tied into it at regular points i want to attach something eg a carabiner to a loop throw the end of the rope over a tree branch thats out of reach and raise the carabiner to a certain height and then load the carabiner the problems are that i dont want to raise the carabiner to the same height all the time and i want to be able to undo this system from the ground does anyone have any ideas     if i could tie a loop in the rope that i could move by pulling on the free end that would work then i would only have to tie a smaller lead to the loop itself to unfasten it but i dont know of any such loops    another solution i have is to wrap the rope multiple times around the limb and let friction lock the rope but that isnt secure and it is a hassle to adjust and ill want to move it frequently
    what does load the carabiner mean raise your body
  yeah i am using this to anchor a trxtype trainer so it needs to be adjustable to various heights i wont be dangling from it over a cliff or anything the main goal is that i want the handles to be high enough to comfortably do pullups from but also enough to do things like low rows the problem is that i cant comfortably reach the tree limbs to adjust everything manually
    a long rope that you toss over the branch then one one end you have a loop that you stick the other end through and you pull that loop up to the branch and it locks and your carabiner loop is in the end that is stuck through the loop the key is that that loop end up at the branch has to have a tail long enough so that when you are done you can pull the loop back down
  jammer block or a clam cleat if youre a cheap fuck
i need to keep some liquids room temperature in a room that gets cold often by the front door would putting them in something insulated like a lunch box keep them at a safe temperature or make them colder longer
why are air purifiers so expensive cant i just buy some furnace filters and mount them to a fan
  all of your exterminators are using traps for a good reason you dont want dead mice in your walls  so build a better mouse trap
im planning to make a smallish 5kn tensile testing machine  whats the advantage of having a leftright threaded lead screw pic related with 2 moving plates over a simple lead screw with one moving and one stationary plate
  no the first one didnt luckily the smell wasnt too bad but i wasnt going to do that again plus it takes too long to kill them   whats worked for me in the past is peanut butter in glue traps i was just hoping there was a faster way to get rid of mice my patience is running thin especially because i thought it was over more than once only to be surprised my a mouse waking me up in the middle of the night
  they will match the temp of the room define room temp and yes
  theres no advantage they just wanted it to look cool
  it certainly does look cool  i thought there was a hidden trade secret or something but i figured structurally it does the same thing as one stationary and one moving plate
  i turned the heater on and it ran for about an hour i ran the sucker cold with a long shower as a couple of handy man sites suggested and now all ive got is luke warm water it would appear that i roasted the top tstat but what are the odds i burned the element too
  mouschwitz
  you may have turn the thermostat down too much did you change the temperature on both
  to keep the moving plate parallel with the stationary plate
  i dont even
  what are the odds i burned the element too  near zero  the element is made to take the full voltage and limits the current with its resistance no short there could expose it to a higher voltage or current than its designed for
i have two lumps of thermoplastic rubber weighing a total 40lbs id like to glue the two together and can insert a pvc rod and rounded staples to provide a extra strength what kind of glue should be used to make a solid bond
  i derped and shorted a wire on the upper tstat      ill run around today with parts numbers and see if i can get a suitable replacement
should i prime my desk before painting or could i get away with using a primerless paint like behr premium plus ultra without it looking like a pile of shit
  wha tthe fuck
  what material is your desk made of  also what color is it now and which do you plan on painting it
what are good brands of tools    i want to buy a friend a set of tools he can have for life or at least ten years my budget is about 200
  glue traps work and everything but they are pretty much universally considered inhumane     seriously if you actually want to kill them just kill them rather than keeping them alive and screaming while they slowly dehydrate grow some balls already and stop being a woman about it by using glue traps
  i replaced the upper tstat and after checking to be sure the wiring was right i powered it up and nothing no clicks or quiet hissing im gonna guess its related to wires
  kek love that pic  i do use glue traps i dont let them suffer though i dispatch them with a bb gun i dont know if they suffer close to we do or not but there is enough suffering in this god forsaken world and i dont want to add to it  /pussy rant    top kek
  around here in the winter people often use tippingramp traps and a bucket of waterantifreeze they die pretty quickly in subzero water
when should you add relay on your own when adding electronics for car for example i want to put led light bar on my car 180w but the package doesnt come with relay also is it true that the light bar can consume energy even if the switch is off and the relay can stop that
  if i didnt sleep down here and i could physically lift a bucket i would theyre very clever
  a day and 70 later it was the wire all along whatever i did blew the blue wire apart so like any good southern engineer i stripped the good bit and plugged it back in the water heater is working for now
looking to buy a welder    could i go too wrong with this    
  whats wrong anon its a pretty mild question
  6 year old conjoined twin sex doll      kobalt husky craftsman gearwrench klutch tekton will all sell you a set for that kind of money they should all hold up with regular /diy/ use and they all have warranties if you act a dumbass and break them doing something stupid
  how did you know    but no really the 50th percentile in weight for six year olds is already 20kg so two conjoined six year olds would be in the 80lb ballpark at the very least the only way that would work is if the plastic kids also had severe dwarfism or were in short six year old conjoined dwarfs two twentymonth olds would also work and no longer need dwarfism to be in the realm of plausibility
  depends how theyre conjoined
      
i want to get an indoor garden started but since it wont be marijuana this time around im going to have to keep costs down my plan is to use 8 5050 led strip lights with each strip spaced 3 / 8cm apart alternating sets of 9 blue / 3 red cuts can be made every 3 leds for veg if you have any input on any of that id be grateful but the real question is how do i power it each strip requires 12v2a i could run 8 12v2a wall worts but im thinking that i might be able to run two sets of strips in series each with a 12v8a laptop power source is this supremely idiotic
  cause damage  if your pond is decorative youll probably want to keep the water bleached like you would a pool so that could potentially kill your grass if the pond is ph balanced and holds fish the emulsion in the water would actually help the grass grow better
  each strip requires 12v2a  12v2a wall worts  its a good idea to add 2050 for safety so the wall wort should be rated around 25a3a    run two sets of strips in series each with a 12v8a laptop power source  voltage adds in series  current adds in parallel  so youd hook 4 sets in parallel to get 12v8aid go for a couple 12v10a supplys  arent most laptop supplies 1819v im assuming you meant 12vled power source    why not just get a 12v20a or 12v30a supply  the 12v 30a power supply i got for my 3d printer on ebay was about 21 would recommend seller   
  voltage adds in series  current adds in parallel  so youd hook 4 sets in parallel to get 12v8a  i guess i had that backwards then thanks  im assuming you meant 12vled power source  yep i searched for laptop power supplies so i had that on the brain    so ive been reading up on it and evidently its a bad idea to run them in series because of voltage drop anyway i was under the impression that if i ran them in parallel id need to increase voltage and subsequently if one wasnt soldered correctly id be splitting higher voltage across a lower than expected draw and blow out the others again i guess i had that backwards    why not just get a 12v20a or 12v30a supply  because the only one i could find was 50 and i could get two 12v8a for 30 plus if something dies the plants would still have some light while i fix the problem but i suppose thats not a huge deal if its just tomatoes anyway    would recommend seller  appreciated but i dont use ebay anymore too many deceitful listings and three week shipping times ill have to find something on amazon
  cont  im not sure where i got the idea that i needed 2a/roll its 44w/ft x 164 ft  722w x 8 strips  600w power source or better    newegg / tigerdirect
windows 10  how do i set a window to be always on top i have a program that makes a full screen overlay that you need to unlock to to close it does nothing more than display information in the lobby its dedicated for one window 24/7 windows alerts system updates and other system related popups come up infront of the overlay and i get calls to fix it its driving me nuts ive disabled all 3rd party programs and cleared them from the registry to be extra sure but i cant stop the windows popups
whats this connector called its on an imac mini ive got a board here but some autist who changed the hard drive has managed to rip off the little surface mount connector then lost it and im fucked if i can find a replacement
  look up turbotop for windows 10 that should sort you out anon
okay so i was about to pull the trigger on eight led strips and two 33a led power supplies when i realized that thats 577w to cover a fifteen sqft area when i used to grow weed i was flowering with a 1000w hps for sixteen sqft and that wasnt even specific lighting frequencies is what im trying to do insanely overkill    pic related thatd need to be a lot of tomatoes if its going to cost me 25/month
      i looked up imac mini connectors and all the forums say new logic board lololol
  perfect thanks anon    new logic board kek
  is there a way to do it through system features without another program the program that is already installed that locks the screen puts the overlay on top of all windows and runs on start up already ill try out your suggestion but i hope the two programs dont interfere with each other the program i already use is 10/10 for windows 7 and earlier     windows 10 trying to be more user friendly will of these obnoxious apps and notifications are the bane of my existence with this computer /oldman_rant

i need a pair of insulated grip gloves that will keep my paws warm up to 10 degrees fahrenheit     preferably waterproof or water resistant     need decent grip but doesnt have to be insane also good finger control would be really wanted    looked up on amazon everything looks like shit looked on duluth trading company they have a winter work glove but it has no reviews yet    anyone make a reccomendation
hi diy    so i love these things but i cant stand the ticking every single second is there any way i can easily prevent or remove the part that causes the ticking each second and still have the clock be fully functional
  if there is ive not found it yet anon    i feel your pain  i had a similar issue with a looped video that would play on a screen in the foyer of a local hospital    earlier versions of windows even earlier versions of windows 10 you could right click the maximise button and select stay on top or just press ctrl  space and that would generally do the trick well enough but microshite in their infinite wisdom have slowly eroded away many of the handy behind the scenes options that made life just a little easier    i dont suppose you could swap to a linux distro    my favourite thing for running continuous low power apps is simply to install a pi instead of a pc and let it get on with things    makes me a nice profit too as most places are expecting a bigger expense so i manage to put a very healthy markup on the hardware plus they dont worry too much about paying top dollar for my time
    cant tell if bait or not     take the battery out / dont wind it up    sure itll only tell the correct time twice a day but itll not make any sound
  cant you turn off or hide system notifications automatically
    nope its a silly as fuck question but its not bait  if people wanna waste their time fighting about its their time not mine    i wasnt sure if the ticking was created by the main gear/cog mechanism or if it was a separate 1 tooth that just got tapped at every rotation of one of the mains
  fair play anon  the tick is because of the timing mechanism so in the regular clock like that you cant get rid of it
  i like neoprene
  
  you can always pull out the mechanical assembly and retrofit a battery powered servo in there    it would be a tremendous pain in the ass especially considering you could probably buy a clock with a similar bezel that already runs on batteries but it may still be worth it for you as im assuming that you really like this exact style of clock and wouldnt mind dumping a good 4060 hours worth of research and work as well as 100 worth of parts and tools in to it    tldr you can technically do it by putting new battery powered guts in it is it really worth the time and money though
our fence is falling down wood is termite holed weirdly split  half is on our side half is on neighbors   and it is also too short our neighbors yard is fucking 2 feet heigher than ours for some reason     i looked around for matching boards but couldnt find anything that thick so im thinking of going to lumberyard buying what i need and then tipping the corners so they look like current fence     original owner  i cant tell if he did a shit job or not im looking for suggestions  should i do this myself hire someone use something instead of wood personally i like the aged wood  it looks nice with the garden     im on the neighbors side fixing the planks that are attached on his side

i got a weird one for you can anyone recommend a small magnet mount work light smaller than the free ones at harbor freight i want to put a head lamp on my uvex s8505
so my girlfriend kicked our bedroom door closed and it completely broke the latch like the knob would turn but nothing happened at all tried to take the knob apart and work the latch butnothing i tried to jim the lock with a card or knife from the other side but nothing tried to slip various things around and pull to slip the latch but its too stiff and just snaps whatever ive used    any thoughts right now we gotta climb in and out a fucking window and get in and out of the flat through the balcony    the hinges arent really workable either with the door closed
      these look sweet theres a similar olight model that is held into the head strap magnetically but i cant figure out where the magnets are otherwise theres a million cheap lights like pic related but they mostly have the magnet in the tail end and i dont know it thats ideal for what youre trying to do
  if the posts are shot replace them with metal ones sunk in concrete they will outlive you wood rails are fine replace as needed the thicker the picket the longer it lasts generally your idea of buying what you need and knocking the corners off might be your best bet if you cant find decent ones in your area
i need the brightest light possible to cure my winter depression    are leds the way to go i was thinking of buying a giant 200w corn led pictured or maybe getting some floodlights in my room any ideas    would the 200w corn led be safe to mount on a plastic table lamp do they make a sound
  push the door towards the jam really hard where the latch is and turn as normal    the latch is probably over set
  blindness cures depression
  youre not supposed to stare at it apparently its meant to simulate being out in sunlight    i dont know how it works theres something about being in a bright light environment that is supposed to help and i am desperate enough to try it    the commercially sold ones are a little weak so people end up sitting right next to them
  how do i reassemble this 36v cordless screwdriver i opened it to replace/mod the battery and it just completely fell apart  i think i know how the gears fit together i just dont know where the pins and ball bearing things go  or wher can i find examples
  i was thinking of buying a giant 200w corn led  do they make a sound  just read the specs and make sure they arent popping corn leds
  how do i reassemble this 36v cordless screwdriver  theres only one way to get those back together  youll need a cordless screwdriver
  why not take vitamin d instead cheaper and it takes five seconds

magnets     i build a toolbox out of wood with classic groove slide drawers for a reason i need them to sit secured in the toolbox while i carry it around     to save space i want to secure the drawers with magnets i want to screw/glue a metal plate on the back part of my drawer and a strong magnet on the inside of the toolbox when i push the drawer in the metal and magnet with hold together     drawers are about 600 x 300 x 80mm 236 x 118 x 31 inches    can anyone tell me what pull strength i could work with to make it ot too loose or strong     i was thinking about 515kg 1133lbs

i have one of those jet lighters it sopped working gas still comes out but it doesnt burn  it burns for like a second initially but then stops i can hold a different lighter into the stream the flame will be disrupted by the supposed stream of gas but it doesnt ignite    what gives
  its out of fluid purge the remaining air from it and refill
  its pretty full unless the liquid in the tank is something else
  are you sure the belt didnt just snap
  you can try to purge the excess air then ive always found if i do that it doesnt work quite right or burn all the fluid correctly so i dump everything point the refill valve down and push on the edge with a small screwdriver and refill
  yes i wish it were just the belt
  check the belt does the drum move freely with some resistance if the belt is not broken there may be a limit switch or fuse may have tripped
morning /diy/    so im living in my van this winter and im encountering that my 5lb propane tank is getting too cold i dont have a heater to run my stove i already have one of pic related for my water tank would it be a bad idea to slap one on my propane tank chances i blow myself up it has an internal thermostat that turns off at 65f allegedlybut would there be any problem with putting localized heat on the tank 65f is not that hot but im unsure about applying it directly to the side of a propane bomb
why does dimensional lumber have rounded edges
  thats the specification its produced to dimensional lumber without rounded edges is not dimensional lumber
  yeah so whats the reason for the specification
  if you do your clock wont work anymore that noise is the clock functioning
  i would do that but wrap it in insulation and trench a line just in case
my laptop is filled with chang screws and theyre starting to round  ive got calipers so i can measure them and buy replacements  how do i know that im getting the good shit and where do i buy it from
  you can wrap the propane tank with the heating pad at 65f the propane is only at 100 psi and is not even close to the relief pressure
so first of all id like to know if these will work together and if id likely need an adapter since i dont have specs on the connector sizes    secondly if that would work and i add that and a second nonyagid antenna to a raspi rigged up as a repeater/bridge/whatever would i be able to pick up my friends wifi from about two blocks away with mostly lineofsight with his permission nothing malicious just trying to split the outrageous internet bill and save us both some money
  it may cost you a little more than you were expecting for screws but honestly the only place to go when you dont want to have to question the quality is    
i bought a second hand cougar gaming chair a few months ago its good except for some leather that fell on the the front i was thinking of just patching it with some adhesive leather patches from aliexpress    what i really want is to paint the orange to black to match my office but i cant find good youtube videos showing that
any suggestions on good resources for learning zwave or similar smart home systems looking for something that actually going into capabilities of different hubs programming interfaces etc
i know this is pushing the limits of stupid questions but how best should i mow my lawn ive got a lawn mower and a line trimmer just about to go get some fuel and oil for them but i was hoping to get some pointers on proper technique or methods etc
how to do this
  dont go too short especially when its really hot and sunny in julyaug those same hot months its worth letting it grow out a little longer between cuts especially if its not very rainy trying to go short and often in the dry season or hot season will give you a bunch of yellow spots if the grass is wet take it real slow and bag it if you have the attachment same thing if the grass is really long otherwise you risk getting those big piles of trimmings all over the yard     old man told me once to alternate directions so if one week i go horizontal the next week i will go with vertical strips but so far i havent noticed much improvement doing that    and then the basics of the lawnmower keep your blade sharp check the oil and dont put it away for winter or any extended period of time with fuel in the tank because it will gum everything up and destroy fuel lines ethanolfree gasoline sometimes called rec 90 around here is best for yard equipment otherwise its a good idea to use some fuel treatment like stabil with the regular gasoline
  dont really like how metal looks might just use treated wood are you sure about concrete i thought that promoted rot and is a bitch to pull out like you are supposed to use packed gravel or something
  ive looked into this before you need a ridiculous amount of lumens and you need certain types of light     look how this fucker rolls ive been thinking of trying this       you definitely need to do this get your d levels checked you can safely start taking like 5000 ui per day  but you do want to get levels checked vitamind accumulates in your system because it isnt water soluble i take 50000 iu per week to keep my levels normal it also greatly helps with immune system btw  im not some vitamin popping dude there is plenty of research about how winter  low vitamin d  every one catches colds and spreads them     i suffer miserable sad / winter depression i will say this is the first winter that i havent been curled into a ball for week or two at a time changed up my meds and vyvanse seems to really be helping im a bit surprised good luck man  i hate this shit and know how miserable it can be
  i think its /diy/nosaurs but could be wrong

thinking of making a table that i can fold upwards and hang on the wall with the help of a simple hook and rope  what kind of hinges should i use are either of these pic related alright  i plan on using trestles or folding legs so my problem is the hinges being able to support the weight of the table itself when its folded

i want to start woodworking as a hobby can i get a list of some tools that i will need i have experience using skil saws miter saws and jigsaws  here is what i plan on buying  tabletop vertical bandsaw  jigsaw  handsaw  miter saw  skil saw  chizzles
  tabletop bandsaws are just toys save your money and buy a real bandsaw
  what are you planning on building  probably at some point you need a drill but very important is a shitload of clamps  start with a project and see what you need for that there are many different ways to do certain operations based on what tools you have i would say a router mounted to a table is quite versatile add a jigsaw and you are pretty much set power tools wise i mean it wont be easy but it will be cheaper than buying a fuck load of tools you dont need  dont underrate a good vac either dust extraction sounds like its for queers but you start actually cutting regularly you will feel real shitty real quick eating that dust  sandpaper chisels files backsaw hacksaw are important planes and scrapers if you like squares and angle guages for marking out personally i use a spirit level as a straight edge very useful to have around  how much space do you have  chop saw is handy but table saw and bandsaw is showing off if you are just starting out
a random orbit sander
  i have limited space and got a new rikon 10306 which was the most powerful benchtop bandsaw i could find and its been pretty sick so far 1/2hp and 55 amp motor and 5 inches of resaw most of the other benchtop ones i found had 23 amp motors generating 1/3hp
  id honestly recommend just determining what you need based on what you want to make even if money is no object you can end up with a lot of clutter really quickly     no matter what you do i would take the other anons advice and get some sort dust collection and filtration system if you want to do it in a ghetto way just hook a shopvac up to a preseparator and hook that up to your tools dust ports and then get a cheap air filtration system off amazon the wen one is pretty great for like 125 with a 5 micron filter and then a 1 micron filter inside it
  i was actually looking at this ryobi bandsaw for small projects seems like it would be perfect for my uses 
  oh i know about the dust i cut schedule 80 pvc daily with a chop saw
  what are your uses  if it involves cutting 1/8 balsa wood itll work fine if you plain on cutting anything else its shit
  what tabletop saw can you reccomend i dont have a lot of storage space at the moment
  i recommended the rikon 10306 that i have
  table saw would be useful
  thanks
  fukken this what a time saver    op i would say a table saw is probably the most useful followed by a sander i bought a router recently and have been surprised with how useful it is although everyone told me it would be  otherwise just get quality hand tools buy as few tools as you absolutely need buy quality and definitely dont skimp on measuring and marking tools like levels and squares
  check out lowes for some sweet deals on tools /diy/ will shit on craftsman but the stuff isnt that bad i just picked up a new cordless jigsaw for 10
  fuck of with your shilling you narcissistic cunt seriously yes you buy thousands of fucking tools a week and what do you do with them apart from post pictures of them to 4chan    not a fucking thing choke on a bag of dicks
  paper bag or plastic bag
  seriously though you should talk to someone about your compulsion
  
  i recently started making chairs as a hobby and i get by with a table saw jigsaw plunge router sander chisel hammer measuring tape carpenters square rafter square strap clamp two pipe clamps 2 ft ea two bar clamps 2 ft ea cclamp 3 in 12v impact driver and a sawdust vacuum dont forget your ear eye and respiratory protection as well if i would buy another thing it would be a fucking drill press because goddamn is it a pain in the motherfucking ass trying to drill straight holes with a hand held drill especially when you are making jigs and that shit needs to be precise even before i bought all of this shit i remember making my first bar stools using nothing but a single bar clamp pocket screws wood glue pencil jig saw and a measuring tape
my grandfather does a lot of woodworking and has a pretty extensive shop based on his experience id suggest in order of first to last  sturdy workbench w/built in clamps and storage  largest tablesaw you have room for/ can afford  bandsaw  japanese style pullsaw  good set of chisels  mallet  chisel sharpening supplies  good sander  lots of different sandpapers
  dude fuck your gay ass grandpa
  wish i knew that you can never have enough clamps earlier on
im planning on making a wooden ashtray for my grandpa i was wondering wether or not i have to coat it with something to make it safe advice would be greatly appreciated
  post some chairs
why dont we have a woodworking general
  we occasionally do but it usually devolves into faggots arguing about pocket screws and the merits of pallet timber were not missing much by not having them
any britbongs recommend a drill press
  pocket screws and the merits of pallet timber    nothing wrong with pocket screws or pallets if used in a sensible manner
  hatchet axe and saw
  certainly not but try telling that to the aspies who will argue about it for 180 posts
    picturing a snoop dog branded line of tools being sold at homies depot
first of all you dont start a hobby by getting a bunch of tools you think you might need     first you get raw material and work out your idea of what you want to make out of it then you start processing and molding the said material you buy tools as you go when you find out that some thing you are doing requires it dont be the asshole that buys a whole bunch of things just to get the buyers rush and end up making nothing start little and work your way towards the things you find out you like
  dont be the asshole that buys a whole bunch of things just to get the buyers rush and end up making nothing    does bepis work with wood i though his specialty was lugnuts and voltage testers
  does bepis work with wood  only his own
  this is stupid who the fuck want to wait intil there ready to make the first cuts to go buy a saw  then wait til your ready to drill a hole before you buy a drill  then wait til youre ready to screw the first fastener in before you buy a screwdriver  and wait 3 to 5 days or more each time for those tools to get delivered after you order them one at a time  how much foresight does it take to realize you can/will have a multiple uses for a good selection of the basic tools
  meh my woodworking projects include this hex key holder a screwdriver holder a dvd rack and my workbench its mostly a pain in the ass because i can never seem to get large pieces 100 square with a circular saw but i think next project will he building a dock and i need to get one of those clamp guides or something
  goddamn is it a pain in the motherfucking ass trying to drill straight holes with a hand held drill  you said brother dont even get me started on that
  beeswax
  meme or not
  beeswax varnish is made with paraffin oil that sounds p flammable bro
  listen to this fellow get a load of second rate second hand shit use it to make scrappy stuff and get a taste for it then gradually get good stuff as your skills reach the point where youre seriously limited by your tools
  i have a clark one that is great
    theyre ok but super annoying if you have to do more than a few holes with it
  i have that one make sure to calibrate/tune/mod it right out of the box trueup the guide bearings and adjust the motor mount tension right out of the box just look for yt vids on bandsaw adjustments and make sure the teeth touch the crown of the wheels not the back of the blade     oh and order a good bosch or dewalt blade for it toss the junk it came with i have cut half inch copper with it just fine
  thanks im having trouble finding out how much cutting range it has how many inches of blade are exposed i plan on making some boxes out of some 4 inch logs
  its about 5 inches maximum the 9 inch throat might be an issue for you i mostly make pen blanks with it so its not an issue for me
  jealous of your setup yeah i wish had a drill press ive been making all my chairs and tables with hand tools not because i want to be quaint but because i live in an apartment try making sure youre drilling at a 16 degree angle with a bit brace
  i really should make a table saw bench like that i was planning to make adjustable wings on mine but i suspect they will be off by enough to be worthless
  now ive only recently finished setting up my workshop in manner i find useful took nearly two years and i think i need far more vises but at this point tools ive found indispensable are    cordless drill  impact  table saw  planet thicknesser  woodworking vise  millions of clamps  cheap set of chisels  mallet  dovetail saw  trustworthy ruler  trustworthy square  pencils everywhere so that one is always handy  knoife  decent sharpening kit    tools ive enjoyed the hell out of but probably arent core setup  random orbit sander  decent chisels  decent bevel edged chisels  hand planes  more hand planes  yet more hand planes  mitre saw  router plane  power planer    things i find myself needing sometimes  power router  drill press  more good handsaws
where do you guys keep your offcuts / what do you do with them i have so many handfulsized chunks of mdf and ply

  youre full hyperbole tard he means you dont need to buy a triathlon bike heart rate monitor full racing garb and aero wheels if youre a fat ass whos going to ride around the block twice a week to get in shape    if op is quitting his job and starting a cabinet shop fuck it buy all the stuff
  i was gonna comment on that and say my bad    a lot of my shit comes after i do a project and i think man it wouldve been easier if i had this tool and honestly having the proper tools gives me a lot of confidence to take on projects i was afraid of before also it fucking sucks having to run to the store in the middle of a project for a tool dammit ford who uses 9mm allen bolts anyway    but i wouldnt reccommend that approach to people you probably dont need more than a dozen different 11mm sockets      thx for the informative post
  on top of these bags of mulch next to the used oil i need to pour down the drain
  youre full hyperbole  no you actually retart
  the used oil i need to pour down the drain  oh you horrible person its bad for the water system to do that  just pour it into the ground thats where it came from and thats where it belongs
  he feeds off of yous
  so do i anon  so do i  mmmuhuwahahahaaaaa
  i love that pic      anon have you made a diy spot welder    somebody posted a video of one awhile back useful for making battery packs     i wanted to stay up all night building it but i think the only thing im missing is a relay because google and advance autos website both said a store was open til 10pm but the doors were locked at 915    i found myself a car battery sitting by a dumpster and it actually held 120v over 24hrs so im charging it nice and slow in hopes of it working the video said a 100a battery will work so im hoping this half dead 400a gets the job done only copper nails i could find were small so well see got a momentary switch but its only rated to 6a or 10a so i think i need a relay and i dont want to take one out of my car only spare relay i have is a turn signal relay but its only two posts so it wont work for this    i cant find the video anymore and the first couple results on google were way more complicated thinking about what else i could need and what type of relay i should go with
  have you made a diy spot welder  no i wouldnt know how but i think a spot welder is something i could find a use for eventually like making metal enclosures for various projects
  iirc its just a 12v battery to two copper nails with a momentary switch and relay thrown in    fwiw i guess my dumpster battery has the juice to do it but i dont want to put that current through the switch so im gonna grab a relay tomorrow at the auto parts store and fuck around with it
  do not talk to tripcunt especially when he is thinks this bullshit is an appropriate solution for a spot welder
  this great way to fuck up a battery ruin some relay contacts and blow holes in a piece of metal you have just spent 20 minutes cutting and shaping    why the fuck said anything about spot welding anyway
  you gotta find the right lead acid battery to get the weld right at least if youre doing it the real basic way like that video guy said you want one rated around 100 cca for spot welding nickel strips to 18650s more than that and you will start blowing holes in the metal    im sure you could find a way to adjust the output without swapping 12v batteries
  nigger i have seen the bullshit you spout in /ohm/ stick to what you know and keep posting tools youll never use like the whore with her trinkets that you are you dont know shit and you have no business commenting on anything electrical fuck off
  hurrr you must know how to run before you can walk
hi woodwork guys do you like woodworking thanks frens 
  thats cool man keep shooting your mouth off about shit you know nothing about everyone can see it and thanks to your super handy identifier will be able to see the pattern and know that your words mean shit i sure as fuck dont mind
  do you like woodworking  not really i prefer working with metal   im just here for the general hobby project discussions
   hurr youre qualified to talk about running when all you can do is crawl  fuck off tripcunt
  just pour it into the ground thats where it came from and thats where it belongs    its not the same oil retard oncw its outo fo thre ground its processed and refined and is not the same crude oil and is actually bad to pour back in the ground    get an educaton tard boy
    why do you faggots always take pica with your cancer sticks and lighter as if were supposed to be impressed you will die sooner than everyone else     fag
  so you know its the real bepis    comcast guy is gone i really dislike having another man touching my wires but they wouldnt give me a signal booster without the tech installing it time to get back to muh spot welder project need that relay      jesus christ you people need to clean the sand and grit out of your vaginas it sounds like they may be infected at this point
    check out this mad tripfag
  im not mad just diappointed that i had a black man in my home messing with my wires    so if you fegs want to be useful for once what type of relay should i be looking for this 4blade looks best but the only advance that has it in stock is like 30min away theres lots of heater relays with 5 blades but i dont think i want that for this project    oh and do you guys tip people who come to your home i have had tons of issues with comcast since i moved to this house and i always try to give dudes 1020 so they can at least buy lunch
  this guy has the right idea but has expressed it incorrectly think of a project scope the materials youll need then the tools youll need to get the job done be careful what you cheap out on cheap screwdrivers will cam out but a cheap saw will likely last you for enough projects to determine if you want to go full retard on a sanvick for power tools find the cheapest then buy the next one up forget about brands youre not a tradie a cheap tool will teach you about respecting the limits of your tool and what is actually important on a tool theres a bit of trial and error but you will eventually over enough projects find your sweet spot price wise       yes tell us more about shit that has absolutely nothing to do with the thread topic its all about you isnt it faggot
   woodworking thread   tripcunt making it about him and his shit non wood project  are you actively trying to demonstrate yourself to be a cunt or does it just come naturally

  tabletop vertical bandsaw  ok for bird houses and very small details  jigsaw  rough tool no chance to do nice straight cuts or curves you will need sander to finish things  handsaw  you will need more then one whole collection for different purposes  miter saw  yup  skil saw  if you can get track saw instead  chizzles  yup learn how to sharpen them  you can do it on belt sander with fine belts and some skill
    fyi just copped an aldi special drill press for 70 they have tracksaws jigsaws and 18v drills on offer too my experience with workzone stuff is its decent quality given the prices  
  i use workzone all the time decent quality cheap tools  never failed me just wear down  if used for dyi will last forever
hey /diy/ i recently took advantage of black friday sales and bought a bunch of benchtop woodworking power tools for making my own furniture and shelving and such    kobalt 12 dual bevel sliding compound miter saw  kobalt 10 table saw  kobal router table  porter cable bench sander with 8 disc  4 belt  porter cable 18 scroll saw  porter cable 125 planer  porter cable 6 jointer    and i already owned some older hand power tools including  7 1/4 circular saw  planer  jig saw  couple routers    my question is this what blades my gut is telling me to go with highest tpi accross the board on miter table scroll jig circular  as for the bench power planer hand power planer and jointer is there preferred blades  how about router bits    i already have impact and hammer drill/driver what are good woodworking bits for those    i have some experience with all these tools but this is the first time owning them all and im not as experienced with blade brands or features    ty guys
 here  also picked up a porter cable pocket hole jig and dovetail jig for making drawers and such as well    also have hand power sanders like detail orbital belt and im also looking to stock up on sand paper for everything i know i need a variety of grit but are there preferred brands for uniformity or uselife
  ok
  inspect element  bepis pls
    whatever you think of bepis/kevin hes the most successful troll /diy/ has seen in ages
  you sir have never seen a dock that needed to be rebuilt
  considering the sheer volume of shitposts he makes and clearly marks them as such its to be expected
  whatchu think i got this for
oh bother  this has all become so very tiresome
  get a couple different tpi blades for the circ saw if you want to find out the high teeth blades make a bunch of dust a slower cut and minimize tear out the cheaper blades rip up pretty much everything from framing to demo the quality blades come out when you need a few clean finish cuts
  shop vac  random orbital sander  router  table saw  hand plane buy used on ebay   thickness planar    in that order obviously your needs will vary depending on your skill level i got by for a while without several things because i was willing to put in the work by using using creativity and ingenuity you can do a lot more with a lot less     id just pick a project and start building it will quickly become apparent what you need and what you can get done the hard way
  just look at the reels with the wrap still on theyve never been used why are you buying this shit if you arent going to use it
                            what the fuck is wrong with you people

  actually i put some use into those today and took tape off of two reels      this    tfw the biggest troll ever will be revealed when bepis admits that he was also the antibepis shitposter      meh when i get to play with them in 25 days well see if the funposting gets any better    checked
  you need a good oldfashioned set of wood chisels and a grinding stone  you also need a rough manual saw and a finesaw like a nokogiri one way saw    you need at least one pair of clamps and you should have a workbench or a normie bench with an even surface you can work from    a rasp is always useful and you definitively need a hand plane and good old sturdy model without too much wear and tear should do
  this list is if you are serious about woodworking    grinding machine with wheel because the tools will wear out quickly  a workbench    a good woodworking knife  jack plane  set of chisels  a few clamps  a couple of rasps  a couple of saws  mallet  good wood glue
  and sandpaper ofc
  as important as any of that is knowing how to use a bench properly and how to hold your work and it actually is different depending on the bench you have check paul sellers on youtube vs the wood whisperer

does anyone here have any inca tools  i need a new tablesaw and this one goes for 125 eurobucks used  are they actually still around from what i can tell you can still sort of buy spare parts but the company overall seems to be dead no reviews or anything either other than a dead as fuck subreddit which doesnt really mean much to me  sawblade needs to be replaced too but that has to be a standard one

   braaaaaaaaaaap
  do we need to build it for you as well
  do not buy dewalt saws if youre gonna get into woodworking trim carpenters wont even use them cuz theyre so sloppy    and learn about different saw blade teeth patterns    figure out what handsaws you need also they are not created equal    scroll saws work really well for detail cuts     skil saw is like saying dodge vehicle what saw exactly do you mean    chisels are more about care and sharpening than brand    youtube has lots of good vids on pros sharpening shit chisels
  i love you anon    buying power tool  always check for realistic sound   its the shot of black of tool buying
  chizzles  wtf are chizzles
  skil saw is like saying dodge vehicle what saw exactly do you mean    construction workers know what a skil saw is and they drive fords anyway
  231x219  why would you post instructions if we cant even read them
  this is why i wont buy brushless tools
  not op but thanks for the tidbits  and learn about different saw blade teeth patterns  i have been looking at this for a couple days question though assuming my saws really are for random projects and not product of a house or something why would i want to bother with a a cross cut or rip cut when i can get this bad boy which claims the sawed surface is like it was hit with 220 grit    they have 12 and 10 versions of that blade which would satisfy my miter and table saws just need a 7 1/4 blade for my ciruclar saw
  not product  meant production as in my saws are for leasure not banging out construction for business
  buy the blade and try it out on some scrap to see if it works for you i figured out my preference for crosscut when i was deeply engrossed in my foolish handsaw walk about got to spend money for your education anon
  live edge
  implying i wont like it    seriously why    got to spend money for your education anon  the saws were 249 and 179 both marked down from 300 and while i do like having the proper tool for the job and while i also like options the blade pictured is 70 for the 12 and 60 for the 10 thats a bit pricey imo should i not buy or should i buy complimentary blades
im soon going to be finding myself with a decent bit of empty space in my residence and ive been thinking about attempting to set up a hydroponics system for the growing of vegetables and other produce to supplement or entirely replace buying produce after watching much reading and watching of videos i think im wanting to do a dutch bucket style system consisting of the following    food grade buckets as many as my space will permit with drains set to retain 4 litres approximately 1 gallon of nutrient solution   sterilized clay pebbles as growth medium  timer on the water pump to water 15 minutes of every hour  grow lights on 10 hours a day  pvc and vinyl pipes and tubes for the plumbing    the questions i have    am i missing anything important and/or obvious  does anyone have experience with similar systems  any suggestions or recommendations for changes or alternative systems  what are the potential dangers and how do i prevent them mold mildew water damage pests that sort of thing    on an unrelated note fuck yeah insight
  ive only got a little experience with a tiny kratky system but i definitely recommen covering your growth medium with something to block out light i had trouble with algae growing on the medium which later became moldy covering it solved the problem other than that make sure to ventilate adequately
  am i missing anything important and/or obvious  nice try officer
  nice try govt weed grower    fixed that for you
and other produce
      while it is indeed legal to grow that type of plant in my area that is most definitely not my intention for a variety of reasons however i do understand why one might think this just about everyone ive asked about it always assumes that
  thanks i hadnt thought of either of those thank you what did you use to cover the medium i figure the lids for the buckets with a hole cut in it just big enough for that plant should do the trick eh
    1 word anon    microgreens    google that shit and hit up restaurants and grocery stores
  just cut a slot and a hole in a bucket lid works great
  e doesnt eat marijuana salads
  ventilate what
  ventilate what  the room being used to grow in so that moisture doesnt cause mold and fungus in the rest of the house    anything opaque works i used tin foil over the medium and around the buckets to get some extra grow light reflected at the plant
i got tired of buckets and switched to cement mixing trays they are cheap
  some quick googlefu tells me that a small setup like what im planning shouldnt require much in the way of ventilation a decent fan ducted presumably outside but nothing i found said anything regarding time would it have to be running 24/7 or just on and off throughout the day id like to be as energy efficient as possible but as im only renting mold prevention is definitely a priority    good call with the tinfoil to reflect the lights maybe mylar or something to maximize efficiency if i can get it cheap enough
  theres also these threads fyi 
        there are some really cool led grow lights that ive been looking at that are quite affordable
  i dont know how big or how small you plan to go but its definitely something to keep in mind ventilation fans generally dont draw huge amounts of energy just to move air and there are fans with humidity sensors on the market id expect maybe 4050 watts per hour assuming they run 24/7 which i doubt its an investment but at least you wont end up venting more heated air than you need to depending on the climate in your area
  thanks ill give those a gander      likewise im definitely going with led lights just havent settled on what ive found them as low as 30 to as much as many hundreds of dollars just have to figure out what sort of wattage ill require      im still in the moving/unpacking process so space is yet to be confirmed but it wont be huge by any means southern canada with natural gas heating running the fan wont be a big cost but blowing the heated air outside will be i probably wont have anything resembling a functional system for at least a month or two so the worst of winter should be over by then    how about mold resistant paints if i am able to repaint the grow room with it obviously not a substitution for ventilation but that might help the cause somewhat
what kind of nutrients to give the plants
  how about mold resistant paints if i am able to repaint the grow room with it obviously not a substitution for ventilation but that might help the cause somewhat  maybe if your grow room is a hermetically sealed concrete bunker otherwise i wouldnt bet on it air moisture will spread throughout your home and into walls and ceilings and condense against cooler surfaces where mold and fungi will be able to grow undetected if your windows fog up along the edges often its usually an indicator that youre not ventilating your home enough    there are different solutions available but theyre all mostly different nitrogen phosphorus and potassium in different ratios for different needs depending on your diet you could probably grow basil in diluted piss not even joking
  cheap mylar source if you have any injection moulding shops near you raw plastic is often shipped in large bags inside large boxes some grades are bagged in mylar you could be looking at a few square meters for the asking if you catch the right guy on the loading dock at the right time  tformer material handler
  ne sure and leave a window open or put a farm advertising sign in your yard so the cops dont donkey kick your door in and fuck u
  good idea man
  get your reddit nigger kratky shit the fuck out of here all of these fucking faggots have no idea what they are doing and dr kratky is a fucking idiot
  my sides
  include constant airstone bubbling in the nutrient medium and inoculate with nematodes they consume the bacterial and fungal growth on the medium and in the solution and will kill fungus gnat larvae before they can start to kill of your roots  aeration is necessary to keep the nematodes healthy to fend off microbe blooms this is my own experience leaving pools stagnant for any amount of time causes a film to form which can be sucked into a submerged pump and block the impeller a 1w bubbler per 5gallon bucket has worked for me most of my old tomato setups were modular like that        yes ive never gone wrong with a broccoli/bok choy sprout mix just the right amount of spicy and crunch as sandwich filler
manual hydroponics no moving parts  meant for weed but works with any plant      could be automated with a basic 25 water pump and a timer and 1/41/2 inch pvc pipe    you need to ph the water to about 556 ph depends on the plant so youll need a ph meter and ph 7 calibration solution    leds cree cxa full spectrum    if youre doing lettuce herbs and small shit house hold led bulbs will work just fine  they should theoretically work on tomatoes or melons you would just need to stack a bunch of them i can attest to the fact that a 15 watt led bulb can produce 15 dry grams of weed so they def do work
all things considered knifemaking questions about techniques and tools show your riggs props machines and knifes ask for and give advice about anthing concerning forging heattreatment finish and stockremovel
yes glad the thread is back i am going to be getting setup soon and i love seeing all the different feedback and general advice
wanting to get into stainless but why does every ss require a cryo temper im apprehensive of having a dry ice and alcohol vat in my shop
  is there a certain metal you should use for kitchen knifes or do you have to put something special on the blade after forging
  stainless steels should be used high carbon is not particularly great for kitchen knives
  cryo is good for three reasons  scavenges 12 hrc  very high amounts of wear resistance  some amount more toughness and edge holding  thats for anything which counts as steel your old lump of 1070 or some alphanumerical super steel theyll all get some advantages from a dip in the nitrogen co2acetone baths ive never quite been sold on as theyre technically a shallow cryo and youre not really getting the full value there of going through an extra step time and the expenses sure its cheaper than liquid n but its also really not as good you want that 200c or lower to really covert the remaining martensite theres quite a lot of material on cryo treatments as they fell off the back of race engine technology for forged internals gears and other stuff so its not completely alien technology      depends on the end user to be honest if theyre not going to look after their tools then a semi stainless or full stainless is really the only things that survive but i still move quite a few into the profession kitchen users which are a2 and they really appreciate the edge holding over any kind of special care they really only need to be cleaned and well dried at the end of the day to keep any minor rust away for storage use mineral oil  in terms of what you can put on a carbon/low stain resistant steel diamond like carbon coating dlc is fairly much the premium coating for knives like cryo treatments it fell off the back of the motorsport and engineering industrial processes its also fairly pricey but if someone wants the best then they can spend the dollars  bluing is still ok but not huge amounts of corrosion resistance most of the paint on and bake stuff is next to worthless on most types of knives and just doesnt hold up over time
i just finished these two     big one  190mm blade  small one  100 mm  rwl 34  25 mm thick      the guy that commissioned them wanted a santoku with comfortable handle that will last long time  so i chose g10 i made some holes on the tang but still its pretty heavy  240 grams for the big one and 95 for the small one the balance on the big one is just behind the heel     after some reading i figured out that a straight handle similar to the japanese knives is one of the most comfortable and practical handles for a kitchen knife i dont know if im right  i tested it and it feels nice  but im not a profesional cook  so who knows     its the last time i am making kitchen knife except if its for me or for a friend or if they pay really good it takes alot of belts to grind so much surface and to finish it nicely also if i make a mistake its realy hard to fix it also warped during tempering quenched between aluminum plates and i had to grind it straight     i hope that the guy will appreciate the steel and will be able to sharpen it
shop heater crapped out on me but this is my next one once i fix the heating issue
first two knives and my current project blank on current project is done and i tried to harden it but couldnt hold the temperature  a little frustrated   next up is a hidden tang knife   makes me want to get a forge going because the stock removal method is such a waste of steel sadly anvils are nowhere to be found here gonna try and get my hands on a piece of railroad track
  100 or less option for you          but get it at hf with 20 its 20     carve out an opening in one fire brick in the back outside with a respirator and gloves its like carving styrofoam so you can shape it with a flathead if you need to for the flat torch head in the back     if i cover the opening of this it gets up to at least 1950 degrees open it takes and holds 80crv2 at nonmagnetic 1560 it aint pretty but it works
   the stock removal method is such a waste of steel    as a medieval historian all i can say is steel is cheap time isnt unlike the past where time was cheap and the materials valuable  so work efficiently     personally i do minimal forgework  smack in the shoulders for tangs put in any curvature i need  making it precurved helps to counter plunge downward if youre making singleedged blades like seaxes bowies etc in homogeneous steels and of course any patternwelding but otherwise profiling and the likes is entirely hogged out with a 36 grit cubitronii and it takes less time and less physical damage healthwise
  think with kitchen knives the handles tend to be simple because they get used in a variety of handling styles during the course of food prep so the simplicity there tends to lend itself to that rather than locking into just 12 preferential grips with a more complicated style of handle results there are great though g10 is sometimes a bit of a nobrainer for kitchen knives as its comfy non porous and will survive damn near anything  what steel      forging is a young fellas game smashes up your wrists messes your shoulder joints up and all manner of tendon buggery  working on a 9 bowie commission for an old family friend raindrop pattern welded out of 109515n20 and its just about damn near fucking killed me physically
  is stainless harder to work with or heat treat i used to weld it but i dont know anything about forging it
  in some ways i find it easier to use the high chromium metals and stainless over the carbon steels as the stainless is very much a modern material which basically fell off the back of the industrial revolution meaning its well standardised reasonably high quality control and well documented what that means for material engineering is basically follow the manufacturers instructions and youre golden itll work every time if you follow the instructions exactly every time  the biggie deal for home hackers is that stainless and some of the more specialist tool steels tend to require  comparatively high temperatures starting at 980 to 1200c  multiple lengthy tempering cycles usually minimum of 2 x 2hr most benefit from a 3rd and they all love a bit of cryo in between tempers  precision temperatures /20c with a dedicated soak time of anywhere between 2040min depending on the exact material/thickness and temperature  atmosphere deprived high temps using tool wrap vacuum furnace or an atp coating    so prior to say 1990s to make good stainless steel knives you where looking at some fairly expensive hard to get equipment and it wasnt really until the early 2010s that stuff like affordable precision kilns wasnt really in the bracket to be seen in most countries around the world and the mainline high capacity industrial complex tended to have the sole dominion of the market course being mass produced meant that most where just wham bam products which became infamous for their ability to get blunt after a few swipes and never quite got the love needed to bring out the most in the metal   so ss became a byword for fucking rubbish amongst knifepeople simply because it was hard to find one that wasnt if youre willing to make the leap to get the gear spend the time leaning the ins and outs its quite cool but you cant forge it and you cant make it on a budget    i recommend any knife maker gets themselves a thermometer  thermocouple though
    the steel is rwl34 and the things you are saying sound logical thanks
  ok cool thanks for the info
i need some advice i am trying to acquire my first anvil and the guy closest to me that has a couple sent me the following prices 76 lb hay budden for 350 a 98 lb mousehole for 500 and a 90 lb riss meehan missing a hardy hole for 250 are these decent prices or should i look elsewhere
  fuck forged in fire for ruining the anvil market it used to be you could buy an anvil for scrap value before that fucking show    that said those arent terrible prices a 114 anvil on my local craigslist is going for 1000    just make sure to do the ball bearing bounce test to make sure it hasnt been in a barn fire
  yeah its ridiculous how expensive even a railroad track one is over 100 in my area but ill be sure to get a ball bearing and test them out before buying one
  the only pristine one he seems to have is this one for 500 it is 100lb and sets on a 100lb stand
  5 a pound  oof glad i got mine at 3 a pound with the stand for 500 i guess thats not terrible as long as it passes the bearing test but id still try to talk him down a bit cash is king or get him to throw in some tongs and maybe a hammer
  yeah he has a bunch of anvils apparently and other misc tools it doesnt really help that im new to all this either
  this is a 90 lb one already on a stand it just doesnt have a hardy hole but its 250
  should i be worried that it also seems that he keeps all these outside 24/7
  that is a cast iron body with hardened steel plate it wont ring like a wrought anvil imo a feature not a bug but supposedly the plate will tend to want to chip off the cast iron body the price is possibly kind of high for that anvil given the poorer reputation that it has it is on the lower end of true anvils as opposed to stuff like the hf garbage which should not be considered a real anvil anvil pricing is super locality dependent though generally in the usa the further west you go the higher the price basically the blacksmith shop stopped being very prevalent once full industrialization and machine tools started being a thing making it both easier to get new product from a large centralized manufactory and changing the emphasis to mass manufactured home goods this took to around the end of the 1800s for this process to really dwindle down the blacksmith trade if your state had a low population at or before this point in history there wont be many anvils lying around im sure the old industrial areas like the rust belt has anvils lying around willy nilly       id skip this one the edges have been so ground that it would be very difficult to use lack of a hardy and prichard is also bad both are very important to the versatility of an anvil
  this one is a bad choice     as long as it passes a ball bearing test weather exposure wont be an issue for you wire wheel the surface rust off and it should be good to go
  i thought it looked too round and thanks for the info im in va like right on the coast so idk what the anvil scene would be like in my area there is colonial williamsburg nearby so i know there are at least a couple of blacksmiths around here
  you probably have a pretty good chance of snatching one at a fair price virginia though not heavily industrialized like the rust belt or new england at least was populated long before the end of the blacksmith shop every town village and farm required metal implements larger plantations had their own shops even thomas jefferson had a nailery at monticello a manufactory for nails with many workers slaves in this case with many anvils mass producing nails     on a side note one way to kind of tell if an anvil is a cast iron body or wrought iron body is the markings generally forged bodies then have the markings stamped into indented letters and cast bodies had the letters cut into the pattern mold and thus create raised letters on the body this is not foolproof of course the second thing is that due to the shock damping properties of cast iron they generally do not ring even with a true hard plate face this looses some of the romance of forging on an anvil but it is way less noisy so i see this as kind of a user preference thing proper tight mounting of an anvil will also reduce the ring on a wrought anvil quite a bit from a free standing anvil     this guy  brings up a good point for one there are anvils out there that are just cast iron completely with no hard face this is extremely bad since it will immediately deform when struck even lightly and also be prone to cracking and chipping as cast iron tends to do testing the bounce of a ball bearing is a quick and easy way to check this it will detect if the face has a hardened plate at all or if it formerly had a hardened plate that has since lost its hardness there have been many an anvil that has been in a shop fire where the heat treatment of the face has been destroyed
  just out of curiosity because i want to do some knife making i have access to liquid nitrogen and if i really want liquid helium is this something that is worth it to a first timer or is it just another risk to ruin your blade if it goes wrong
  put it this way its a lower risk than the actual quenching the blade  the slightly riskier option is doing the quench wait until room temp and 24h in liq n then tempering cycles the low/no risk is the quenchtemper cryo for 24h and then temper again just be a little bit careful between moving the knife to its cooling rack and try to avoid rough handling in between stages until its at least room temp    both are fairly well documented and if you havent figured it out theres a fair bit of reading and research when it comes to knives   give it a go and see if its worth your while time cost and effort experimenting with new steels techniques and heat treats is all part of the fun
  wow thanks for all the info i really appreciate it
  iron with carbon and maybe some other metal in small amounts in it you can buy it as so called steel
  ah i recognize that hilt design pukko anon is at it again
guys i have a friend giving me unlimited 2 inch thick insulwool and unlimited firebricks of any shape and size what the fuck kind of forge should i make with these
  lucky bastard wear a mask and gloves when cutting that shit friendo forge type depends on if youre looking to be gas or electric and what size your projects are
  in addition to what  said you also need to seal or harden the wool if you use that or it will continuously release little fibers into the air either that or wear a mask forever which is not worth it you should find out if the firebrick is the soft type or the hard type afaik the soft type is the only kind that is insulating it is cutable with an old hacksaw blade pretty easily it is soft enough for you to press your fingernail into imo if it is the soft kind id just make the whole thing out of that mortared together with refractory cement i went the kaowool route but it requires maintenance to keep the sealing laying of stuff intact i dont know if the stuff really soaks into the interior effectively or not it just is a source of paranoia for me anyway it might be nothing but it bugs me in my mind
  yeah the soft stuff insulating fire brick insulates/reflects heat while the heavy brick just takes the heat isf is the best option for a forge  s it aint pretty but works forge is a simple but effective build
    they look well crafted and the steel sounds like it has some good characteristics i think i would love using those knives except i am not a fan of santoku
i just ordered ziricote wood for a knife  hope it will turnout nice    pic related  its the larger knife already ground it after the pic but still needs more polish
this is a little off topic but may fit    anyone know a good source for blank kitchen blades    just want to start with making handles to some nice blank blades read somewhere that blanks of vg10 steel would be a good start there are some on ebay and such but the types and forms are limited
where is a good place online to order steel and handle wood
i discovered something recently that some of you may like to use for your wood handles theres an invasivethorny ornamental shrub called japanese barberry berberis thunbergii it doesnt grow very thick but the wood is pretty hard when seasoned the neat thing about it is the wood is bright yellow and uv reactive pic    after lots of googling it seems most woodworkers only use it for inlays the bushes are really easy to spot since they are usually reddish/purplish and have bright red berries in the fall/winter        another thing is that in forests that have barberry there are more ticks than those without barberry so getting rid of the invasive plants is a good idea for a few reasons
  it should be noted that the yellow color is brighter in direct sunlight that image was in led light top and uv flashlight bottom
  nice
  223 kb   i discovered  nice shit i should check my woods for luminiscence
  wow thats spooky ive got half a dozen paring knives to heat treat tomorrow almost that exact same profile as your larger sweeping blade there  except theyre much smaller of course  ziricote has always intrigued me with its sapwoodhearwood contrast and one day i was thinking about making a knife with it probably a hamon or one of my bimetal monsters to have sort of a matching contrast effect between the two materials its frigging hard to find here though so ive not imported any
  heat treated the blade for it today and its on its second temper right now 80crv2 and did the basic profiling of the wood     i had an issue with my propane tanks valve freezing shut on the furnace today so i eventually put it a tub of hot water so i could finish the damn heat treat    also preview of part of my next knife this one is going to have a finnish black metal motif to it maybe a skull pommel made from antler for a person who loves black metal bloodwood red/black spacers african blackwood spacers again bloodwood again
  me again while im not currently working on a knife i did find that i wanted to keep the saw dust from a whistle project for later use because of the woods uv properties heres what the stuff looks like the upper image has an oak dowel rod laying across it for comparison bottom image is the dust collected in a baggie with a wip project whistle on it    from one bush i should have enough material for many inlays for knife handles it is easier to work with and softer than i first realized it may be worth stabilizing if you have the gear for it
  and this is how the new blank came out after drying overnight very satisfied with the look of this blank it will probably be attached to a 110 mm puukko with ricasso
  that will look nice what fixative do you use
i know it is more about the job you are doing at hand but what style do you find more useful for daytoday jobs heel or no heel on the knife top no heel bottom with heel
  thanks i use devcon 25 ton epoxy this will have a hidden tang that will be burn fitted and epoxied
  i have some devcon 2 ton epoxy that i use for various things for laminating wood i figured id use tightbond for wood stuff though
  i use tightbond to make the pine scabbards in the sheathes but that bloodwood and blackwood is such a tight grain i figured epoxy was a better option
  so long as it isnt bending flexing or taking on enough water to swell it will be just fine titebond allows for movement devcon tends to crack people who make laminated bows use titebond for the most part as far as the grain goes it doesnt really matter just prep the surfaces with sandpaper as the fixatives direct on the bottles
  yeah its really about the task and tool for the job lot of the smaller generic utility stuff like opening boxes cutting rope whittling and all that just a small knife with no heel does the job best at least for me when it comes to something a bit more involved like processing material/food off a work surface the heel and knuckle clearance between the handleknife edge is a bit more valuable as it lets you use more of the total knifes edge without mashing a finger into the surface  handle ergo is also important if youre doing a lot of work in one sitting got to remember that humantool interface       if youre doing a lot of burn through maybe time to come up with just a standard generic tang shape for your spurdo shanks you use on every knife that way you can just heat that puppy up yellowhot and blast through handles with no fussing well no more fussing that someone running around with 900c hot steel should have to worry about
  imagine if there was a knife that had a blade you could move up and down then lock into place then it would have a heel or no heel depending on the locking position
  i have a common cut for the tang of my spurdö shanks im trademarking this i also tend make the tip of the tang into beveled blade too assist the burnfit
  its doable but having something thats mechanically strong and doesnt look like a dogs breakfast after running down a long windy path of madness tool throwing bad words and lots of prototypes in the art bin will be another matter      i actually bought a lump of the old 80crv the other day for a decent price as i was wandering through placing an order for other stuff going to give the n690 a trial run and see how it goes  dont rightly know exactly what im going to do with it just yet as ive been busy finishing off an order but thinking about making some kind of big arse ugly cleaver or chopper
  this is the first knife ive made its alright but was getting chips out of the edge when i was initially sharpening it with one of those handheld sharpeners with two pieces of grit crossed in a v shape could that just be damascus steel delaminating
  handheld sharpeners with two pieces of grit crossed in a v shape  ah the old knifefucker 9000  yeah throw it in the bin those pull through sharpeners are rubbish unless the steel is really soft
    yeah those turn a smooth edge into an rng serrated edge
  most of the finnish puukko makers use 80crv2 in their high carbon puukko laurin metalli puronvarsi jäärvenpää et al so thats why i use it i find a three minute soak at nonmagnetic and 140 f canola oil harden it just fine 380 f on my oven takes it to the desired straw color for temper
  i stacked some stuff on one of my knives handle that has a heel the added material is the same amount needed to hide the heel it doesnt feel too bad though the taller the heel is the more material there would be and the taller the handle so a chefs knife would probably be clunky to use but a simple camp knife would be doable without much fuss    the rear hole through the handle would be the hinged for the blade and the two forward holes would be for locking it into either position the locks themselves could be fitted with n52 magnets at the end of the hole in the opposite side and a steel rod dropped onto them to change positions you just pull the rod out move the handle and replace the rod in the other hole if you dont want to use a magnet imagine the metal swarf getting all over it from other projects the rod can be grooved and leaf springs put in place for friction fitting
  it has vast amounts of toughness and resistance to edge deformation so i was looking more at the heavy impact properties for something big and gronky thatll blast through a beef bone or frozen chicken ive used it in the past and generally fallen back on o1 for similar uses which has better wear resistance and can get a tiny bit harder but will sometimes chip out if youre not careful on the thermocycles
  yeah the thing i was thinking is some kind of screwin with a big fat m12 thread into different position and maybe a lock to pinstop it in the correct orientation and stop it wiggling  like everything theres a compromise somewhere
  all sc anvils are cast with a steel plate on top if theres a forged steel anvil there go for it instead of the sc even in shitty shape if a forged steel anvil passes the ball bearing test you can fill weld grind sand the edges and surfaces back into usable shape search up some videos it isnt difficult to do
  im not a farrier and dont know anything about it but that looks like it would be pretty handy for one
  spurdö shanks im trademarking this  long as you remember us poor dudes when youre rich and famous    anyway finally got around to photos of the last project before it gets sent on its way to a new owner  i extremely rarely do bowies never do tactical stuff maybe 110 is a utility/bush knife and most of my stuff is kitchen gear then its a blue moon if i do pattern welded stuff because its too much damn work but a long time friend of the family wanted one and its sort of hard to say no   so about 8 layers of 1095 and 15n20 folded twice drilled all up and down mashed to death for the raindrop pattern and surface ground its good to have friends with a spare 6 tonnes of industrial equipment you can borrow on short notice no less used the customers design  material requests a few tweeks of my own a260 brass and this really old lump of african wenge i had lying around for years that i didnt want to cut up has a gunstock oil finish blade got a fairly shallow etch then i blued it ran a fine 2000 grit  light polish over the surface
  fantastic dude im saving up my puukko monies for some sort of anvil and building a 3 or 4 burner forge so i can start hammering my own steel i think a high contrast damascus would look neat on a puukko
  awesome pattern looks amazing
since im still looking for an anvil thats not too insanely overpriced what do yall think about having one like this to start out with he said everything is made with railroad tie plates and spikes
    thanks fellas its a little busy for my tastes but what im getting paid for and after a bit of steel wool tidying up and a wax polish over the handle to even it out its lustre at a point im happy with the product  just as a word of warning with wenge always wear a respirator and glovesthe dust will irritate eyes and lungs splinters can go septic very quickly so its a bit treacherous getting 1095 sharped up is always a joy though so fucking easy to get it up to that oh shid be careful sharpness really quickly      basically with stuff like that if you keep the work piece small to say 36 blades and give the surface a bit of love to get rid of any pitting they do work slightly fancier versions you can also get from farriers shops called a striking anvil these work great for small stuff you just need a flat surface for and no curved surfaces plus they dont cost anywhere near the full amount an anvil does  the hardy hole is great for mounting chisels punches and other stuff in there like a planishing stake  still if you aint got nothing use what you can get
  i think a middle constrast feather damast would be ebst for a pukko maybe with a cutting steel insert for edge
  how cheap is cheap also i dunno how well that base will work for you it will tend to want to rock on you highly annoying unless you can widen the base if it is cheap enough id consider it
    he is selling them for 40 im not sure if they are premade or made to an order though because he says he can do both but i only want to start out small anyways so i guess ill get this and work my way up to a better anvil thanks for all the advice guys i really appreciate it
  not the guy you answered but what do you think of this idea im thinking about getting the 55 anvil from hf which i know is basically pot metal getting a half inch plate of 1080/90 cutting it size get it heat treated be like 15 for me and then welding it to the anvil after grinding the surface level of course   is this a feasible option
  i have seen a couple of people do that but the issue is when you weld the hard plate in there can be a small gap between the plate and the anvil causing a loss of energy when hammering and a lot more work on your part im not the anon youre replying to btw
  afaik normally anvil faces are mid carbon steels like 4140 and such ht to the low 40hrc probably for impact resistance to prevent chipping
  problem with the cheapo anvils is that the material really isnt very good for welding i believe that theyre some kind of cast iron  if theyre iron youd need to heat the whole anvil up to about 250c get your 4140 or 1018 surface  recommends and then use an en55 electrode these are comparatively expensive  if theyre cast steel same heat same striking surface and then use a 7018 electrode but at least theyre cheap    after that into a kiln at 450500c for an hour then leave it there overnight to stress relief so the welds dont pop due to the thermocycle expanding/contracting too suddenly  then ramp up to critical austenising temps for the hardenable steel and dunk that whole red hot nightmare into oild lots of oil and may god rest your soul if it catches on fire or explodes  temper it back in the kiln  this kind of madness is why anvils cost a lot a good one has a lot of relatively precise engineering in them regarding material and heat treatments    in reality all doable but how much you spend risk to life and limb its sort of something youd have to figure out the cheapest you can probably do is just go find a foot length of mild steel thats about 2/50mm thick few inches wide and tap some holes in the bottom of it so you can mount that to a bench saw horse or some kind of stand youre really not likely to wear it out or dent it too much in a hurry either just beating on it with manly man arms and a hammer thats known as an aso anvil shaped object and for small pieces they work great for how much they cost and will tide you over until something better comes along
  or you can just use a hardfacing rod and grind it smooth afterwards
  for most tasks i prefer a knife without a large heel on the other hand i tend to use knives with a significant heel and no bolster more because they are easier to sharpen and if they are ground the way i like them can take a lot more sharpening before having to be reground
    a good anvil should be well above 40hrc  i bought a kanca anvil from a blacksmith and it came with a certificate that had a diagram of the anvil and points along the face/horns with the specific hrc reading at each position kinda like this picture i found online but not the same mine has one corner reading at 62hrc which is pretty cool    from the place i bought it from  following independent testing we are pleased to confirm that the quality of the drop forged anvils had an average inferred hardness of 59hrc on the edges and faces and 53hrc on the horns the face and horns of the bigger refflinghaus anvils are guaranteed to be at least 59hr
  alright guys bought one of these striking anvils it was only 40 and it had a surprisingly large plate the only issue is it comes up to my knees im thinking of just prying the railroad spikes out that are holding it and putting it on a higher log what would yall recommend
  id just put the log on top of a base made out of 4 x 4s on the end grain
ok strike anvil guy again what would be the easiest way other than using an angle grinder to get this thing smoother or should i just keep going the way i am
finally had a chance to get back in the shop stupid holidays ruin everything
  personally i wouldnt worry too much about it youd be surprised about how much it doesnt matter the scale will have far more impact on the surface quality than the minor imperfections on that face it looks like there are relatively smooth sections you can just aim for when you are nearing the final shape
a commission that is nearly finished just needs a bit more finish work sheath and sharpening

im not sure this is exactly what you guys meant by knife making but i am a semi professional not really but i make a little bit more than beer and tool money wood worker and recently my buddy asked me to make a new handle for his old knife made a beautiful handle out of an old piece of walnut burl i had laying around from another project and it made his old pos knife look like a million bucks since then i have been toying with the idea of putting handles on premade knife blanks and putting them up for sale     the problem im facing is that i dont know fuck all about the knife industry all the blanks i can find seem to be in they okay but not great catagory as far as steel goes according to google searching i really have no idea i dont really have a problem with this if they will sell but in order to get my time/money i would have to put a decent price tag on it because good looking lumber isnt exactly cheap throwing a 50 handle on a 20 blade seems wrong but if people just buy knifes to use as expensive paperweights it might be okay in short i guess i am asking if a so/so blade with a very nice handle would sell and if not where should i be looking for high quality blades
  dont buy blanks buy steel you can treat and temper and stock removal your own designs
    but then i have to buy tools that i can work it with apart from 6 tools all my shit is hand work i dont even have a bench grinder i just want to throw beautiful handles on knifes actually turning barstock into a proper blade is far outside my ability level
  want to to the same thing i saw someone doing it on imgur recently who actually then sells them which i dont want to but anyway    the guy used vg10 steel blanks but didnt cite a source  been looking around but only found some on ebay which didnt look bad but not really satisfying
       looks good and sturdy i only have two critiques  the handle is too square  i would break these edges much more the finish on the blade looks a bit coarse  like 120p maybe  but i might be wrong anyways good job show the sheath when you finish it        most of the knife guys dont like these hybrids  custom handle/mass produced blade maybe you can find a guy who makes blades and do coop with him
  pretty good so far what materials and steel did you use      if you can put a decent handle on a knife the rest of it sort of works itself out thing with stock blanks and the like is youre sort of restricting yourself to whatever parameters are there instead of being able to put your own ideas into it as much  other thing to look at is maybe getting a whole heap of blanks cut out of a sheet with a laser or waterjet just putting some bevels on them with a cheap 1x30 belt grinder  jig and then sending them off to be heat treated personally i dont as it takes the control out of it and i dont want the chance of an apprentice chewing on anything i put my name to but each to their own and what makes them happy
  the handle is too square     this was on purposethe handle near the spine is rounded so its not too square and the customer didnt want finger grooves like pic related so i was trying something new it fits well in my hand but i may be biased    the finish on the blade looks a bit coarse  its surfaced finished but i left the quench/tempering scale on it instead of scraping it off just because i like it better it also think it obfuscates scratches better and i expect my blades to be used      brown canvas black micarta handle scales polishes completely black as you can see 1095 steel and stainless pins
  you can make blanks from just using a hacksaw files sandpaper and a portable drill     you can make a bevel grinder from 20 dollars of materials and a doublecut bastard mill file    its much more satisfying than just buying blanks and you can change your patterns and steel to suit the customer there is a guy in my area that does just this hand tools for everything and charges ludicrous amounts of money for them
  ok cool i just ordered my forge so i am getting pretty stoked about finally getting started on bladesmithing
    i already have a drill press an angle grinder and a belt sander i guess i will go pick up a cheap bench grinder some steel drilling bits and some a2 next time i have to head up to the city
  the harbor freight 1 x 30 grinder/sander is really good for a budget option with the 25 off coupon it works out to about 50 i have had the same one for 2 years now and used it for stock removal until i built my 2 x 72 last summer watch a few youtube vids on how to modify it true the crown on the wheels get the tensioner to work right and it will last if you plan on using a bevel jig you can make one with wood and a 1 hinge and its a good way to accurately recreate bevel angles just mount a long piece of plywood to the work surface and wax it    the belts are insanely cheap too 40 grit ceramics are like 3 for a two pack
  brown canvas black micarta handle scales  wow damn it finished up really impressive i was thinking either a really high grade of ebony or a plastic but for micarta to come out like that is great
  i am going to be using it for most of my stuff for that reason and more it also does not scratch in my kydex sheaths and is less abrasive than g10 when im shaping it so its easier on my band saw and belt grinder
so i pulled the trigger and bought this forge since im still starting out my question is what is the rigidiser that everyone uses i usually see people spray their forge with a blue liquid where do i get that from or is there something at a home depot type store i could use
hey i have a friend who owns a massive factory getting me limitless firebrick in any shape or size i need what kind of forge should i build
  ive often thought about making some of it up in a press with layers of cloth  resin and seeing what i can come up with it can be quite pricey to buy compared to g10 so thats mostly what ive been using lately      its a mix of amorphous silica 30 and water 70 you squirt all over the wool  you can buy the silica and make it yourself but make sure you read up on the hazardous materials sheet before having much to do with it      most people just make up a square steel frame out of bracket weld it together to fit the bricks into
  well i usualy find the scale too brittle if i want a lasting coating i do it with linseed oil  it gets a think black coat that is pretty resistant
  prety strong curve in the bakc of the handle   overall ncie but isnt that bevel still a bit rough
  get a grinding stone or pin wet sanding paper to a very even surface   do start with 240 if there are no larger breakouts  and go higher to atleast 600 but ideally 1200 or so
  got the wood but only form the heartwood the very light outer wood is very soft i read  i want the theme of the knife to be dynamic so i will try to choose the sides with the most dynamic pattern of the wood   idk if i should place some leater or metal as liner between wood and steel i will probably use epoxy and simple rod pins for the attachement
  now that you mention it fuck it is
  you mean the grind or the back of the handle  i think it looks a bit off for such a long handle  can go good for some smaller ones
  i used a scotch brite belt to get the loose stuff off and you can see the result the rest will either slowly come off with use or will have to be sanded off with an actual abrasive
    very interesting result i actualy like it might try it too
howd i do lads this will be my first real knife aside from a buck 110 and a bunch of opinels i almost grabbed a piece of 1095 flat stock and went that route but i figured i can always do that with the next one plan on staining the handle dark and back sanding a couple times then blo capped with tru oil
  i love curly maple if you dissolve some steel wool in distilled vinegar and brush it on it makes the curl pop but greys the wood so you need to stain it
  thanks for the tip anon ill try that out and post the results i have a mediumdark water stain i plan on using it so that works out well
  pls show how it went   also i would be very very sad if i bought blade blanks as making the actualy blade is the most fun part the attaching of the handle scale always troubles me
  ill take a bunch of pics and post them here when its done hoping to get it finished before christmas    also i would be very very sad if i bought blade blanks  i went back and forth on that for almost a week before i ordered the blanks i have access to a full machine shop and am no stranger when it comes to shaping metal but i would have to build a kiln to heat treat it ill have more time for that earlier next year so maybe ill take what i learn with this condor and apply it to that   my primary concern with this build is shaping the handle correctly im going for something like the one on the right
   fitting the scales is probably much easier at a machined propper blanks  when i do it on my handmade knifes its usualy a pain to proppery attach them because i lack a drill press and then my handdrilled hols are not straint and so on
  i lack a drill press  seriously find a 40 bench top one on cl there a godsend when doing scale work
do you really need wood drill bits for scale work or will a sharp regular drill bit work
  would recommend wood bits a lot
  in germany tools are more expansive in the us will still try to get one that is not rubbish
  yeah even the wobbliest cheapest piece of shit drill press is better than eyeballing it with a damn hand drill most dont have enough runout to seriously damage or fuck anything up in a major way nearly all of them though are gutless on power      if youve got them use them they centre and cut a lot better in softer materials micarta g10 dead trees  otherwise i do most of my stuff with regular generic bits only real turd with those is they tend to clog up full of wood goo and just burn their way through unless youre careful and brush the gunk out of the channels
  i believe your lidl drill press is comparable to a harbor freight press and if you look at some tune up vids on youtube you can tune it up to be worth the euros youll honestly be glad you got a press i swear
  lidl drill press  usualy the discounter only sell those stuff during action idk never trust them on tools
      thinkin bout this one looks nice and ahs a laser visor
      its done
  closeup of the sheath mount and belt loop
    very nice ive been wetforming this all evening
  i wish i could do leather but i dont have the patience and there is a sick leatherworker in my area that i want to support
  and i wish i could do kydex so it balances out p     i like leatherworking saddle stitching while listening to music is zen to me
  desu kydex is just like stock removal except faster to make faster to shape and doesnt wear out my abrasives and saws     i prefer podcasts and hand sanding
  looks wet af  nice spiral work anon
  yes best thing to do during winter eavening is leather work
i bought my first set of tongs and plan on making my other sets what are the best common types that you would recommend to make
  start with flats  when you can this maybe try to get a matrix to hammer a pattern into the toungs bites
  ok i bought a pair of flat jaw ones i guess ill make another or at least the ones i think are called wolf jaw with a flat one that fits over it
  look on youtube for videos showing how to make wold jaws they are pretty hand and the tonge i used most often
  ok cool will do
  so this forge finally came and its time to rigidize it with the powder it came with should i also rigidize the insulation where the burners go in at or just the insulation on the inside of the forge
  just to clarify the instructions are kind of unclear on what to do it just says mix the stuff with water and spray then let it set 24hrs
everything has arrived except for the brass pin stock d
  damn neve rgot myself tung oil ik if it is even named like that in germany
me and a friend of mine have been toying around of the idea of starting a knife making business were not expecting to make millions off of it and hell the idea may never actually come to fruition but we can at least say we tried we have a rough outline of a business model ie selling decent quality knives for a reasonable price online weve worked out all the tools we would need  anvil bench grinder belt sander angle grinder etc althought we would primarily be doing stock removal i was just wondering if you guys had any advice
  this site has ruined my eyes because all i could see from the thumbnail was a uncircumcised penis
  i think you need to look at what the competition for your product would be theres vast quantities of decent quality knives out there in most countries now keeping in mind im also including the mindfucking crazy amounts that will come out of places like china that are for all intents and purposes decent as a product  cost just from a consumer viewpoint you also have to consider what the average user considers decent and its a much different idea than what a knife maker has its different from what an autistic pocket knife collector has and its also vastly different across generations of tool users home cooks and process workers  once youve figured out what the target consumer is id look at a process of meeting expectations  cost then aiming to deliver exceptional service  product that exceeds their expectations  because thats really the only thing which will really determine the next steps  materials  ease of sharpening  maintenance  appearance    problem is that joe average has been spoilt by 30 years of mass produced shit which for the most part is disposable junk but it actually works for how much they pay for it and thus consider it decent even if its a barely hardened lump of 420ss that has bevels like an axe and ergo for an alien species the fact mass production has become more competitive with each other has resulted in better products over the last few years in order to cater to people sick of rubbish but its really only raised the bar a little bit higher for the backyard knife maker    tldr dont give up your day job  only real advice is find your consumer target then aim to hit that with their expectations commensurate with your skill levels at production
  actualy laws in certain countrys make it even harder to even start officialy selling knifes on the side
  ive never used it either supposedly it is similar to boiled lindseed oil except it takes a little longer to dry is more waterproof and dries a little harder  it smells like fresh roasted nuts im almost tempted to taste it
  lick it pls and tell
  just did put a couple drops on a spoon and tasted it  tung oil tastes like exactly like peanut oil but it coats your mouth as if you got vaseline in there or something  6/10 not bad
  maybe we shoudl try to use peanut oil with vaseline as an additive  maybe thats the secret formular  testing anon
  thanks for testing
  put a couple drops on a spoon and tasted it  start making any final arrangements anon
  he uses google instead of bing
  never thought i would push one over the edge on /diy/ always thought it would be on /pol/ or such
  so should i stop eating the fries i just cooked in it
  no pls proceed   look if there is a woodworking general they may help with the casket
  they may help with the casket  i have a ton of pallet wood to contribute
  nice another case of /diy/ being helpful for home projects
  i dont mean to let you down anon but only the nut itself is toxic
  so tung oil is made from a nut there is a tung nut and a tung tree and a tung plant and tung leafe and a tung wood and so on   everyday you learn
  yep its native to china
  i dont mean to let you down anon but only the nut itself is toxic  but look how effective the bait was            
  so tung oil is made from a nut  no  its made from the seeds inside the nut  lots of tung oil trees are grown is the south of the usa
  so your sayin its really tung oil tree nut seed oil insted of tung oil
  fucking mislabeling gotta sue them
huh so my throat is sore and feels kind of tight probably a coincidence
  my throat is sore and feels kind of tight  a sip of bleach so cure that right up
so just the one accidental suicide and one of 4chan slowest boards takes up speed human nature strikes again as it seems
  just wait until /diy/ discovers the fact danish oil likes to spontaneously combust on cotton rags
do any of you sell these things and if so how do i get started with thati need some extra money to feed my raging substance abuse
    danish oil can combust  ok i am looking to get a load of it      well for the first time you gotta put a lot of money into it and you will work your ass of if you want to snort anything at all  not gonna make you a quick buck except you sell absolute junk overpriced to idiots   at which point this market is alreay oversaturated by the chinese massproduced shitknifes everyone uses
  danish oil likes to spontaneously combust on cotton rags  also linseed oil
  i know it but mine sadly never did c
  im not walter sorells but repeatable designs that are actually quality is my key i have a website and also post them on ebay and that directs business to me
  where are you country and how much are cou making /put out
  im in the us but ship internationally where legal that is i make enough to live
  i am not walter sorrels  i fucking hate his videos for the video style  i know some stuff is actualy helpful but i just hate his style his voice idk    also yeah in the us taxes are low enough i guess toi survive in germany you would need to so many licenses and pay for em that i cant afford to get a legal permission to sell my knifes because some stupid gild laws from the 15th century
  i used sorells as an example because his knives sell for double what mine do
  i know  how much take you for one i try to take no more and close to 10 bucks per work hour  i use the moeny for the coal and other surplies and the rest goes itno my car
  i think i round down to about 12 and hour and it also depends on what materials i use i keep 50 for my income of each knife and 50 is used to upgrade or buy new equipment material and shop consumables
  seems very similiar to my stuff
  varies from state to state here for the most part as long as i dont sell knives to u18s without a parental permission no one gives a damn thats a fairly stupid law really as i grew up with various hunting pocket and fishing knives and somehow managed not to murder anyone with them wouldnt exactly say im an even tempered person either and i was even worse as a teenager    about the only other fucky laws which get in the way are in regards to trench knives knuckle dusters gravity or spring assisted knives butterfly knives and ninja stars  the ninja massacres of the civilian population where apparently so bad here theyve specifically made it so no free man will have to fear a sharpened piece of oriental metal flying out of nowhere and killing them making them illegal to sell manufacture and use will surely stop those ninjas  i could rail against it but frankly im just past the point of giving a fuck about pointing out bureaucratic retardation      i cant afford to get a legal permission to sell my knifes because some stupid gild laws from the 15th century  ok i wont complain again about how retarded governments are some people have it worse
  just as a quick aside to retarded governments whats the legalities of selling art that is possibly in the form of a knife  thinking that if its art and just happens to be made marketed and sold as an artwork about mans fucking stupidity to man made out of hardened steel it could be a work around
  germny fucking police when they search your house for jack shit like posting memes in a closed fb group they even will even get pic related as a weapon besides your usual everyday opinel knife and your civtorinox swiss knife  no joke this literaly happened and was shown as weapon finding ina news article related to a house searchin and ti was an official pic ffrom police
  arrests and fines are big money
  usually thats a real desperation move by cops they go in spend taxes on searches subpoenas and warrants to fuck with someone they got nothing and have to make basically anything stick before theyre held accountable for wasting time money and the court systems hours in a day   basically anyone in that position needs a lawyer of some sort get them in and pound the cops arseholes with them it might cost a bit but they will get fucked extra hard by a higher level which is essentially the government    cops are paid to enforce laws not make them up
  well they also dragged out gas pistol and toybows so yeah germany is at fuckign retardaton level i mean i can built a primitive gun in my basement anytime i can even built crossbows ligally and wark around with it because laws are retarded
  in germany well fuck that law is already history   we do not even have constition that was promised to us to vote on after reunification   and those things are legal too have it is all amde up they literaly take your wall building tools
heres a chip carving knife i made a few moments ago it only took an hour to get this far im using jb weld to affix the tang into the burned in hole yes i havent finished the edge and it has lovely wavy lines from the sanding drum i used to shape it i didnt anneal it and just kept it cool on the wet cloth the metal is from an old broken 70 year old crosscut saw    i havent finished the handles sanding and tool mark removing the handle is american sycamore the blade is 1 inch long
  interesting hoüpe the edge is strong enough to keep sharp good woodworking tools need a finde adge that also hols up long
  it should be fine i have a few other knives from that steel one i used every single day and it keeps sharp for a very long time even with wood only one did i screw up trying to keep it cool and it annealed slightly but still holds an edge well enough ill probably get around to retreating it someday
  the good ol condor i bought one of those blanks a while ago
  varies from state to state    i live in central arkansas im 75  about sixty years ago i went to the local hardware store with the cash to buy a 22 cal revolver  i pointed to it in the case and saidid like to buy that pistol  the man behind the counter askedarent you named my dads boy  yes sir and my uncle is gave the name of my uncle who they knew  hands me the gun and saysthatll be fifteen dollars do you need some shells for it    my how time has changed everything
  looks like it will be as tough as a mule
  keked
  this sounds so wholesome
  i find it difficult to object to background checks and ffl transfers this is how it used to be the clerk didnt sell it to the mentally ill boy and he knew who all his customers were    now you go no facebook and get a phone number and some guy youve never heard of gives you a gun
  im 45 and grew up in central nsw  30 years ago i could take my 22 magnum rifle to school on fridays leave it with the vice principle and go out to a mates farm on the weekend shooting bunnies roos and foxes carry it in a case on the bus out there and one one even looked twice  now thats probably classed as a terrorist incident and id be shot by the cops but we didnt shoot or stab each other at school back then because it was just a dick thing to do there was terrible consequences so you just didnt do that kind of thing    fairly sure ninja stars where probably right out though even back then though mostly because we didnt really know what a ninja was  im sure our ignorance in such things was the reason so many got killed by the ninjas
  lol it is based on flexcuts chip carving knives only more suited to my hand
  yeah thats how it was for me back in the day      in the day and age of 3d printing working weapons i think background checks are preposterous    inb4 background checks for 3d printer sales
lets discuss rattail tangs    how do you affix your rattail tangs ive been push fitting them by first drilling a hole in the work piece to make sure it is aligned properly then using a second piece of metal that is shaped like the rattail getting it red hot and jamming it into the solid wood handle then i use epoxy jb weld or devcon 2ton to affix it solidly the rattails i use are long wedges instead of long rectangles    i prefer the angle since it can better flow into curves as the blade begins where the hilt is the rectangle shapes lend themselves more to 90 degree corners that i see as major stress points the only thing im a little concerned with is the longevity of the epoxies when using them with thin flexible blades i only use rattail tangs on smallbladed wood working tools and use full tang with wood scales on full knives    pic related but not mine
  also i consider full knives or oversized knives with a threaded rod welded to them as rat tails the epitome of bad knife design
  i drill mine then heat the tip of the rat tail with a torch careful to not muck the tempering of the blade and burn fit i also put groves in the rat tail to give it extra surfaces for the epoxy
why would anyone ever use epoxy for handles when you can just heat up the end of the tang and upset it to make a a tight fit
try to get a little bit of s30v for making a singular knife  only sold in 36 lengths  i dont know what i expected anyone know where to get say 8 of 3/32s stock of different fancy stainless steels or is it one of those things that you gotta order lots of it
  nevermind found some now i just gotta choose between some retardly hard to sharpen steel that i dont have the equipment for or a more boring steel
  i prefer to channel cut a hidden tang into wooden scales      jantz sells it in smaller lengths
  twice the price as alpha
    final question before i fuck off with these basic bitch things does anyone know anyone i can hire to heat treat vanax as a one off probablyll cost an arm and a leg but i sure as hell cant do it myself
  find a tool maker/machine shop in your area they will usually be willing to throw a knife in for you when they do a treatment of their own stuff for 530
  i very much doubt a machine shop near me would know how to temper vanax to be honest its not exactly a common steel
  i cheat and use allthread and drill and tap a matching endcap
  ive been thinking about making scores along the tang using a massive grit sanding drum
  well i finished the edge as much as i want i just used a triangle file to get a bit convex on a single side with an ever so slight back bevel then sandpaper up to 1500 grit theres only a bit of tool marks left on the tight side on the heal but im for function so that doesnt bother me    heres the first item i did as a quick test on some softer black cherry this thing is scary sharp and is doing chip detail pretty well it is really nice having this much control over a blade it beats trying to do this with a pocket knife by a mile
  my 1 x 30 does a fine job on the slack belt portion grooving both axis of the tang
hey guys i finally got everything set up and started to make my first knife i know its a meme knife but the guy i bought my strike anvil from gabe me a couple for free
  a couple of railroad spikes that is
  i just love that pale greycharcoal contrast its really unique timber  liner between wood and steel  generally ill put at least a thin 05mm bit of g10 on them as sort of a way of stabilising them and having at least 1 flat surface somewhere on the whole debacle just found that it helps prevent warping during temperature/humidity changes and is an impermeable layer between steel and timber so if any moisture sneaks under there its not going to fester as much brass bronze and copper also make nice liners if youve got some sheet of it around titanium and 300 series ss works real well too and adds a lot of stability but youll be in for some fun times trying to cut it i swear ive been sitting on these halfmil titanium liners for a year now and after doing one a long time ago just threw that shit in the art bin fucking crazy white sparks all over the place and it takes no shit from grinders    been working on these thicc boys for last week or so they where going to be paring knives but i figured out the little shits just too thick and went instead for some old timey sabre grind final bevels which arent insanely sharp theyll shave hairs ok but theyll do as cheap small fishgame outdoor fuckarounds for someone they also passed the fucking idiot test as i had them clamped up on the table and one of them had like 2 x half kg clamps hanging on it fell off the bench and went bam right into my concrete floor tip first   well fuck my life face  huge chip out of the concrete tips fine no cracks no bends wew      good job for a 1st go the spikes are good for practice and cheap enough youre not going to bust a budget on more expensive metal
how are ecigarette box mods made  the container part not the electronics they seem to be cast aluminum or some other kind of potmetal
  whatever you want man  the term mod actually originates from people modifying highpowered flashlights to accept a 510 ecig threading back in the early days of vaping
  i mean how are they made in the chinese factories    i havent been able to find any video or pictures or other information on it
theyre called hammond boxes and theyre diecast aluminium
  thousands of dollars for a high pressure mold hundreds of thousands for a molten metal injector     this isnt reasonable ore necessary to diy  you could probably 3d print something and have a threaded insert or something to handle the heat    you could also design something to be bent out of metal or cut out of metal and welded it brazed together    you can watch people make steampunk shit like lighters and cigarette cases out of copper
  regulated or unregulated  stamped metal seems to be the easiest way machined follows after
  damn thanks anon        i just machined the reference assembly for dna 200 chips very strongly considering a line of heavily custom ecigarettes i wonder how saturated the market is
  the term mod was around before your grandmother sucked her first dick
  the low cost simple box style mod is very very hard to find no one wants led lit voice activated bs
  if i build one its going to be durable enough to drop off of a roof and still work water resistant and flexibly powered too
  good one    only using evolv llc approved components for now though
  smok uses a zinc alloy
  clearly i wont get anywhere economywise machining them from billet aluminum but maybe for a custom shop
tldr any advice for a cheap place to live and still have a workshop    fellow single diynosaurs living on their own what advice do you have for someone whos looking for a new place to live at first i wanted to get an apartment with a detached garage sounded perfect but unfortunately only places with a really high base rent even give you the option ive looked on sites like zillow and apartmetnscom for cheap townhouses but havent found anything     another option is getting a 2 bedroom apartment and converting one of the bedrooms to a workshop but i feel like the noise would be an issue maybe not    any advice living in phoenix az if that helps
  my brother rented a storage unit and just turned that into a workshop
  rent a house with a garage and a roommate
  not a bad idea having to drive somewhere kinda sucks though
  generic search sites like zillow kinda suck for finding rentals  try to find the names of the most prominent property management companies in your area and inquire with them directly  i do minor home hobby stuff mainly electronics in my 2 bdrm apt no issues  i have a garage with it that i could use but i prefer the convenience of working on stuff in my bedroom
  thanks for the tip i do robotics mostly so while some could easily be done in a bedroom things like drills bandsaws dremels and mills are more tricky
  theyre cheaper you can get what ever size you need and if you got more shit you can easily switch to a bigger storage room also you wont usually have noise complaints
mods and addons    so i got a brand new drill press  addons will be a 2cm hardwood board screwed onto the table to protect drills and table and a plastic piping to vacuum off the drilling chips    how do you mod your machines or what helpful addons do you build
  2cm hardwood board screwed onto the table to protect drills and table  why theres a hole in the table for just that reason
  theres a hole in the table for just that reason
  brand new drill press
    even if there was no hole for the drill to dip on  you have a fucking drill pointing at exactly this point  just drill a hole bumfuck
    mfw no 2cm hardwood board to protect table
  ill bite  it looks like the big wheel on top is beltfed mechanical power  the lever in back looks like it raises and lowers the whole drill which really cant be right if the top wheel really is the power source  and whats with the big handle on the side is that the power source  and why doesnt the table have a hole in the middle
            to be honest i failed hard thinking that an image of an obvious old and ancient drill press would never be considered the brand new one i bought should have known better since its 4chan    ffs i just picked that one to avoid that the entire threat derails into a discussion about the specific machine i bought    and yes while there is a hole already in the table by default the entire table can be rotated and tilted so there is no guarantee that the hole is always under the drill
  helpful addons do you build    i got tired of awkward cclamps and made pic related which is a bunch of tapered blocks of wood two large carriage bolts and the top boards that clamp the work piece it can clamp something as thin as sheet metal up to something several inches thick quickly and easily
  next time post a real pic of the actual thing yohr making your thread about    this should be a minimum requirements
  nice and oldschool
  jesus christ just buy a drill vise    i know its diy but with the amount of time you not only spent making that setup but the time you spend fucking with it every time you use the drillyou could easily afford a nice vise and get on with your life
  but the time you spend fucking with it every time you use the drill    explain how a drill vise can hold something thin like 1/8 thick    explain how a drill vise is quicker or more versatile when the slots have to line up with the slots in the base plate which quite often does not allow you to move the piece to the proper location you want to drill my system never runs out of adjustment
  better tell machine shops all over the world to throw away their toe clamps truly you have revolutionized the work holding world
why would you even bother with securing that its a small hole in thin wood line it up with one hand press and be done with it
  pic related    trying to draw some false equivolency between an actual quick and easy to use clamping product and anons minimum 8 piece home made clamping setup  truly you have revolutionized my perception of dumb
    also if youre a poorfag and can only afford basic bitch drill visenothing wrong with that get pic related so you can move the clamp to hold the piece where you want it theres a reason it has slots instead of holes
    that 200 vise still cannot clamp things like thin metal say 1/8 thick and while its really nice in many cases its too tall for a table top drill press while the home made system works fine on almost any drill press and is more rigid than that vise    inb4 buy a floor drill and that vise and stop using your stupid wood clamps
  50 on amzn can you show me your problem with the 1/8 metal please im having trouble visualizing your issue im imagining an 1/8 square stick of metal clamping in there just fine  too tall  yea for a bench drill press i can see that being an issue not gonna recommend a floor standing drill i would like one too but being a renter and not an owner i dont think its a good idea
  get pic related so you can move the clamp to hold the piece where you want it    how do you use those with a drill vise and drill table that both have slots that are a lot wider than those things
  washers
  derp maybe you meant slots placed farther apart rather than bigger in size in that case you would need a thin piece of wood or metal as an intermediary with the mounting patterns of both the drill and the vise
  can you show me your problem with the 1/8 metal please    when im drilling through metal it helps to have a block of wood behind it and a clamp system that uses downward force rather than side force is 100x simpler to set up especially if the piece of metal does not have parallel sides try clamping a triangular piece of anything in that vise you cant     i think im done with this debate because either im not making my points well or im wrong
  im not making my points well  no its starting to sound like you want to drill through a sheet of metal you hadnt said this this whole time i thought you were talking about like a stick of angle iron
hey /diy/ lets say for a moment i had my hands on an old siemens sgt turbie according to the user manual the sgt800 has a robust dual gas/liquid fuel system whatever that means     my guess is that so long as a fuel source is combustible enough and is in the form of a liquid or gas obviously you couldnt shovel cow shit into the turbine you could get the turbine up and running to full 50 mw capacity    am i right or am i retarded with that in mind how would i go about stealing my neighbors compost and converting it into an acceptable fuel input to generate electricity from my siemens sgt800
  make an artificial cow stomach fill it with compost let microbes break it down and then syphon methane off of it
  short answer is yes    long answer is no unless you have the facilities to make a bioreactor of sufficient size to make the quantity of fuel you need sufficient infrastructure to store that gas until needed and sufficient time to manage it then yes
  wood gasifier used to run cars on wood during ww2 when gas was impossible to get got about 15miles from burning a dead cat
  acceptable fuel input to generate electricity from my siemens sgt800    50mw    is your neighbor a 50000 head cattle farm with a fermenting shithole
could modify intake to run pure oxygen instead of 20/80 normal atmo ratio should result in commercial grade co2 that can be captured for a zero emission system   as far as alternate fuels will have to be very pure any collection/impurity build ups in the compressor section will not only kill efficiency brand new would be about 38 roughly with about a 1 decrease a year till it flattens out at around 3134 efficiency but could also cause an imbalance and corncob your turbine natural gas is plentiful and cheapand to switch to a different source would you have to modify the vortex nozzles and combustion cans
  this could be done but would have to run the vapor through several filters to make it clean enough for the turbine to accept if memory serves me right the vapors produced from gasification are dirty as all get out and leave a residue on anything the come into contact with gummed up an old 1barrel carb really bad when i was messing around with it and that was running through 2 coolers and 3 filters  but with a gas turbine could cut out the coolers as long as temp was somewhere around 100120f
  build up in turbine section not compressor section fuel will never hit the compressor section and majority burned fuel is what hits the turbine section
my guess is that so long as a fuel source is combustible enough et c you could get the turbine up and running to full 50 mw capacity    given an adequate fuel supply you can run an engine brilliant deduction    am i right or am i retarded   both it seems     an engine like this would require more than 1 kg 2 lbs of gasolineish fuel per second good luck making a fucking biofuel factory from scratch
robust dual fuel just means itll run on lower spec diesel and process gas rather than just jet a1 even if you had the energy density and quantity to run it on home made fuel youll just block up fuel filters and burners very very rapidly
  its theoretically possible practically impossible with a turbine of that size though look into the chrysler gas turbine car from the 60s your idea is totallt viable with a small turbine of that size youd obviously need to modify the design to work with a gaseous fuel tho
1 get fresh cow shit contains methane producing bacteria  2 put in bucket with food scraps / grass etc  airtight lid  3 connect second bucket via airtight hose with a on/off tap   4 get air compressor make air inlet come from bucket 2    use shut valve when putting in bucket one / air compress current gas build up before opening bucket 1 to add more to bio digest into methane    you can probably even store the compressed gas in a tire or some shit
  nobodys asking the real question here where the fuck did you get a turbine that fuckhuge     pic related 55000000 muhammadollars for a new one
  55m is for the whole plant two sgt800 one sst400 gt  gas turbines st  steam turbines as well as all needed infrastructure to power this thing off the existing gas pipes as well as the cooling and radiator system to power the steam turbine reclaim energy etc much of the cost is in the fitting and plumbing when assembling the place even though the turbines arent bargain bin  long and short is that anon obviously wont have industrial turbines at hand if he needs ideas that include wood gasification and using motherfucking tires to store his gas  yall larping good news is you can use an old car or truck turbo from a junk yard or buy a new one and make cool diy engines and gas experiments
  good news is you can use an old car or truck turbo from a junk yard or buy a new one and make cool diy engines and gas experiments      picknpull price  321 turbocharger car 5999 999      that sounds like an interesting project    what are the chances a junkyard turbo is fucked
  he did say milliwatt a turbocharger capable of generating enough energy to power 50000 gaming pcs on nothing but his fermenting compost pile would be impressive
  how on christs green fucking globe did you get one of these you should be making a wooden jet aircraft saints preserve us
spend fifty million to create facilities to turn compost into fuel with sufficient pressure volume and flow or maybe consider propane
  op was incompetent enough to write mw when the actual datasheet says mw   larp
how about you make a prototype from a car turbo first and get that running on cow shit or wood gas
  50mw  unless you own the worlds smallest turbine ill assume its supposed to be 50mw  a bioreactor able to keep up with the demand would look like one of those gigantic storage tanks in fuel depots   justno
  could i turn compost into fuel for a gas turbine    basically you want to build a jet running on your rubbish
  pretty low desu
no now fuck off
  big oil here no stop trying to dodge us
how do i make vinyl records i want to put stuff i download from the internet to vinyl so i can listen to it in the gramophone    how did 70 pirates do it
  how did 70 pirates do it    does that mean 70s they made cassette copies and maybe some 8track crap    id look into wax cylinders if i were you
  you build a record lathe the concept is simple the diamond cutter is moved on the blank with speakers playing what you want to record attached to it
  yep its essentially a record player working in reverse is it easy to get blanks
    well at least soviet underground pirates from the 50s and 60s cut records from old xrays
  
  
    i should have known
  how did 70 pirates do it      buy record off ebay  make mould  cast record  sell record on ebay    profit    
  this seems to be what im looking for    how hard/expensive could it be to build it myself i guess the most tricky part would be the movement of the diamond cutter probably will need some kind of electromagnets and also how large should the movements be etc    does anyone have any experience doing this
  laser cut records have a decent fidelity if theyre played on a gramophone but does anyone have a schematic or list of materials to buy in order to make a lathe using servos and an arduino     also bump
  profit  i dont think so tim  the pirated record would probably cost even more than the real ones and itd be hard to produce the same sound quality without all the expensive professional equipment  
  there are plenty of services doing it for you    i was asked 80 bucks for 2x 33rpm containing recordings of myself playing the guitar i only had to email the mp3 files and the jpeg for the cover       40 each did i get ripped off    i guess recording machines cost a few thousands  btw i dont think its worth  not even a 320kbits uncompressed flac can beat a true 16 tracks professional studio tape
is it true that lowes only exists to let tool manufacturers find out who the idiots are
  i dont know but lowes is usually a little cheaper than homo despot on the exact same shit where i live
  how would they do that
  lowes is not as common as home depot where i live  they are more comfy generally  i hope i can go to a lowes soon
    you idiot home depot will match lowes price and beat it by 10
  i wish we could trade places im in arkansas the birth place of fucking walmart and they have a deal with lowes so no home depot for many miles
  i dont know but lowes is usually a little cheaper than homo despot on the exact same shit where i live    home depot is way cheaper than lowes where i live     and lowes can match and beat by 10 but the process is kinda complicated and takes too much time for what its worth
  slowe in hot springs has to be the worst
lowes  homeless dipshit at least in my area they have actually employees in them and they keep their shit in stock    it varies a lot by location though whoever has the monopoly in your local area will be the shittier one guarunteed
  im up in bentonville
lowes employee here i give out discounts on the reg because i hate my job and this company hope the stock keeps tanking and the company sells to amazon
blue store bad
  i dont think so however i dont really know desulast shit i bought at lowes was a bosch 12v drill/driver combo kit that was cheaper than either of them separatelyi already had the 12v angle driver so now i have the 3 tools two chargers and 4 batteries  and i still rock my makita 18v drill/driver combo i bought at home despot10 years ago
  home depot seems to be cheaper for most stuff i go there for    home depot is where dudes go when they need to get shit done lowes is where you bring your wife to pick out a new vanity    there have been a couple things i ended up at lowes for because home depot didnt have it some of the larger lowes have a better tool selection than home depot wanted a clamp meter that could read dc and home depot didnt have one so i ended up getting a southwire from lowes
  yeah at least i can make the drive to benton or little rock and go to home depot and save money and headaches 
  i already get 10 off at lowes
  can you translate that into english i dont speak retard
  found the lowes customer
home depot has sunk to new lowes if they are paying people to shill on this board
  small at least kinda expensive stuff should be bought online its cheaper
  i looked around it was all about the same unless you want a chink brand coming from a guy who bought harbor freight calipers im trying to go with a known beand when it comes to measuring tools    the klein i was looking at was about the same anywhere you looked but they only carried the cheaper models in store i like buying at a brick and mortar place so i can fingerfuck it a bit before i drop money on it and then i can return it easily if i destroy it in a week so i found the southwire at lowes for like 80 and grabbed it    if i saw a meter in the store for 120 played around with it then saw it was 75 online from a reputable seller with a good return policy then i would order it
  lowes is not as common as home depot where i live  they are more comfy generally  i hope i can go to a lowes soon    they are closing stores home depot is kicking their shit in
  2 or 3 years ago they opened tons of those orchard supply stores around me literally 6 of them within a 30min drive    theres a whole lot of slightly used retail space for lease now
  cheap tools are all chinkshit no matter where you get them from youre just overpaying for the same tools if you get them from a physical store
i feel sorry for yall if you dont have a local menards they always have the obscure shit i can never find at lowes or hd drywall shims the electric boxes that screw into studs from the inside way larger variety of s4s boards that are all individually vacuum sealed just to name a few plus you can buy groceries there and everything is generally cheaper
  back before lowes was even around it was home depot and menards everybody i knew would only go to menards because home depot was for the spics lowes wasnt even in the conversation    now the nearest menards is 4 states away    anyway have you fags seen the new craftsman power tools at lowes the kits cost as much as dewalt or milwaukee why would you ever buy those
  back before lowes was even around it was home depot and menards    maybe in your area but lowes hardware goes back to 1921 with the second store in 1929 while the first home depot opened in 1979     in the area where i currently live for a few years it was comical the first huge store was a hechinger which lasted a few years until they built an hq a mile down the road and the hechinger closed then they built a home depot another mile down the road and the hq closed then they built a huge lowes another fucking mile down the road to replace the old small lowes and i assumed the home depot would disappear but that was many years ago and they both still thrive
    lol i had my custom css turned on to hide trips and after i corrected your nonsense it occurred to me that your post sounded like the resident retard/expert so i turned the css off and ha ahaha ahahaha hahahaa    you never disappoint friend
  yeah this was chicago area im trying to think the first lowes i remember in the area was around 2000 they opened in the old kmart building    we also had a sears hardware for a few years that store was actually sweet it was like a big ace hardware good size selection of tools and garden stuff but without all the building supplies like home depot i guess like an orchard without the goofy bullshit and it was a couple blocks from my house which was real nice but it shut down within 5 years
  i aim to please
rona was the most based hardware store before lowes bought them
enters thread  welp  leaves thread
  anyway have you fags seen the new craftsman power tools at lowes the kits cost as much as dewalt or milwaukee why would you ever buy those    why would you continue to buy craftsman hand tools  because idiots throw money at them
there is like a 15 miles radius ring home depots so unless i want to drive like 45 min in any direction its lowes for me    theres always a huge fucking line at the wood cutting station too and it takes fucking forever for some reason i think because faggots give them exact measurements like do you want them to just build the whole fucking shed for you too
once upon a time
  buying lumber at home depot  compact car owner detected
  ace is for niggers    kelly farm and garden/agway for life
    the shit they sell is garbage bought a window ac unit didnt work at all right out of the box returned it for another an took in home put it in an this time it turned on and the fan work but the compressor didnt kick in  i took it back and got my money backwent to bestbuy and bought an lg unit     then i buy a shower spout with the pull up shower diverter take it home put it on the dam pull up divert doesnt even seal in the spout  so i take it back an get another an it does the same thing  i go get one from home depot 8 more an that one works 1st time
  i would never buy the hand tools at full price considering the coo and the fate of craftsman but theyre pretty good for the money when you find deals for 50 off    the power tools though its a brand new line with an unknown future and cost as much as the contractor grade brands hell c3 tools are still more expensive than ryobi and with power tools its kinda important to have product support when you want a new battery or possibly a replacement part
  opinion disregarded
  drop the back seat and i can get an 8 ft board into my compact
  he respects opinions and advice given on 4chan  good luck friendo      i got a couple 4x8 sheets in my small suv but i couldnt see out of the passenger side mirror i have a roof rack and ratchet straps when that fails
  heres a hint dewalt and craftsman are the same shit with different colors
i order most of my shit from a whole list of obscure little online tool shops who are all cheaper than one another for certain products and usually are cheap or free to ship    big box stores are a meme for anything except big bulky but overall cheap stuff like raw materials  and even then their selection is usually both shit and overpriced
  checked and my apologies
    theyre like costco full of mediocre crap with some really good deals mixed in for people who know what theyre doing
  you think its dewalt or porter cable i know its all sbd but what tier are they trying to fill
  im calling bullshit small online tool sites are always more expensive provide some examples  go ahead ill wait
  ace in my area is just old people and guys like me who need a single obscure nut
  what are you trying to imply with that image the expensive one is a totally different item  1 has a brushless motor  2 has a hammerdrill function  3 comes with 2 batteries instead of 1 and both batteries are more powerful than the 1 that comes with the cheaper model  4 comes with a case  5 is more compact in size  6 even comes with a fucking belt clip bitch
  do they want them in workshops or jobsites why would you buy craftsman for your garage when you could get a much better deal on trusted ryobi if you needs something for the jobsite why would you spend dewalt or milwaukee money on the stuff    porter cable quality with dewalt pricing and that trusted craftsman name    im sure theyre fine tools i was just suprised to see the prices on a lot of the stuff
  isnt it obvious theyre catering to retarded diy homeowners and contractors who dont know a fucking thing besides the name
  kek that is true of most craftsman stuff its not bad homeowner tier but definitely not worth paying full retail i maintain that most of it is a good buy if you can catch it on sale for 50 off like sears so often does at those prices its close to hf but the products are normally better the power tools never seem to go as low as the hand tools though
lowes has better products more reliable better built as far as rough plumbing and rough electric  lumber is culled more thoroughly and generally better than the depot  yeah its probably more friendly for the women folk too  and its not fucking orange with shitty home depot theme music playing in background  home depot crams their shelfs full and do not thoroughly check whether another box has been shoved in place of another  many times at the depot i find common necessary items are out of stack  two inch coupling how the fuck are you out of two inch couplings  anyway going to the depot is always a desperation move
  cabot has a home depot as well
  i bought cheap roof rails feels dangerous but so empowering
lowes and home depot are 3 blocks from my house in opposite directions i go to home depot on the reg the staff all knows me its comfy and friendly and full of tradesmen doing work ive been to lowes a handful of times when they have an item hd didnt and it was always weird like a bizzaro world shifty staff seemed far more distrustful of everyone in the store and often were nowhere to be found when you needed them at hd they may be clueless sometimes but they hang out and try to help lowes definitely seemed to be more showroomy more floor models set up and more home decor sections
  this ive regretted every damn dollar that i spent there lots of variety all shit
  pretty much only thing ill buy there is framing lumber and paper towels the company is too jewey for anything else
  yeah can i get a dorito taco supreme and a large mountain dew
    lowes sells bosch craftsman skil   home depot sells milwaukee makita and dewalt and ryobi if you want cheap chinesium   thats all you need to know to make your decision maybe if craftsman made tools like they used to lowes would be a competitor but if youre serious you need to go with the homeless despot
  lowes has their sales on dewalt but it seems like home depot will always have a similar if not better sale at the same time     if you want to go homeowner tier but dont like green lowes has some steals on porter cable but im with you i would rather do home depot for power tools    ryobi  cheap chinesium  imblyign the other brands are much better      i gotchu on a large dew but no doritos on me at the moment
  ryobi is selling their brushless drill/driver kit with two 20ah batteries for 79 on black friday ill take that any day over a junky craftsman drill     
  home depot also sells bosch skil rockwell worx and some other garbage brands on their website just not in stores
  tripfag neckbeard confirmed
    home depot also sells bosch and you left out ridgid lowes has exclusivity on bostich hitachi and kobalt lowes ryobi but i agree that milwaukee and makita are what make hd a better brand range     this is true for a bunch of other brands too  ive found several great tools on hds website from brands i had never heard of before
  home depots website also has the wen tool line which is ttis harbor freighttier tool line of cheap chinese stuff they rank under ryobi
i hate dewalt but i love portercable  keep making sbd rich goyim
  parent company autist strikes again    my giant monopolistic company is better than your company
  before lowes was around it was home depot and menards    lowes is older than home depot fucktard    ace masterrace
  in my area  i forget how belligerent these people are    and ace is a lifesaver but godddamn are they expensive plus i have two home depots a lowes and formerly two orchard stores within 15min of my house so ace is pretty much only there if i need a spark plug for my lawnmower or two specific 7 bolts
  ive had a one job kit for ages and it has run for like at least 4 years without issue id say longer but some filthy little shit stole my first set
  im in nea got a lowes and home depot here just bought a ryobi 3pc2 free set for 200 gonna build my 5yo a playhouse
  ace masterrace  not everyone here is a billionaire
  hot springs    bentonville    benton or little rock    cabot  im in bauxite the lowes in bryant is closer to me but i work in benton so if im going to the big store i got to hd in benton  i buy charge to account most of my hardware store stuff at sutherlands  if theyre really busy i fill out my own charge ticket
  havent bought normie tools in a while hang on last thing i got for a steal online was a brand new interrapid 312b15 test indicator for 180 from viking guage apparently the boomers in charge of running the site let their christmas sale go all the way into july of the following year they normally go for 390    took them an entire month to ship it to me but i guess they didnt want to have to cancel my order and refund me
  thats why theyve distanced themselves from carrying the same products
  both now coddle women with tacky decorations  somehow theyre morphing from a hardware store to pier one  they promote dogs  this isnt a dog park i got bit this spring keep your dogs at home    fuck both of them theyve taken out the core building blocks of the diyer and replaced it with gimmicks accessories cleaning supplies and decorations
  build me a playhouse
  and fuck those boy scouts shilling popcorn outside these hardware stores    thats a perfect example of the declining masculinity thats going on  using child labor to panhandle outside and getting to keep 35 of what they collect  if hd or lowes gave a single fuck or if the parents werent cucked theyd partner with the store and make birdhouses or sheds or actually offer to do some labor in the community like habitat does theyd be learning a life skill other than standing on the streets asking for spare change
  like do you want them to just build the whole fucking shed for you too    i work weekends at hd in the lumber department 80 of customers i cut for have exact measurements for their projects most conversations start with im making this project or i saw this project online most of my customers are lazy asshole who cant take the extra time to do it for themselves
    ive never worked at a store where they offer to cut wood for free so i dont understand the issue are you and the other guy saying that its too hard to cut it at a particular size what do you and he think you just toss the board on the saw and eyeball it
  you still dont get it china is just a 3d printer factory it wouldnt matter if the factory were in michigan or beijing its still the same quality of chink loading the printer with material the difference in tools is in the quality of the engineers who designed them
  not him but the saws at the store are meant for rough cuts  ie ripping it in half so you can get it home  at some point (((those))) customers took that free labor and started trying to get the lumber guy to be their free carpenter for the day
  the saws at the store are meant for rough cuts  ie ripping it in half so you can get it home    what sort of saw is meant for rough cuts the ones ive seen look pretty nice and if i bought a 4x8 sheet of plywood and wanted it cut into a 3x4 and a 5x4 piece i dont see how thats any harder than ripping it in half     i can understand if the customer asks you to take a 4x8 sheet of plywood and produce 6 specially cut pieces and for that situation you either have a sign saying one cut per board or price per additional cut it seems sorta silly actually that its a problem just have a clear policy and enforce it if i want 100 cuts it should be beneficial to me and the store to make 100 cuts raise the price per additional cut to the point where the store wants to cut boards     im reminded of a crazy issue i once had back when you took photos that had to be developed and printed the store had a sign saying you only pay for the prints you like so i went to the clerk and said if i take 35 shots and only want 2 is that ok sure    so i did that and he got absolutely pissed that i had taken 35 shots of the subject and wanted to buy the 2 best ones i dont get it have a policy that benefits the store and the customer and stick to it
  what sort of saw is meant for rough cuts  its calibrated once at install and some people come in specifying cuts to an 1/8th     if i bought a 4x8 sheet of plywood and wanted it cut into a 3x4 and a 5x4 piece i dont see how thats any harder than ripping it in half  have you ever had an issue getting a board cut any way other than in half both lowes and hd have done it for me    have a policy that benefits the store and the customer and stick to it  if you look at it from the other customers and the store pov having one of the maybe two lumber employees tied up making 100 cuts isnt really viable for customer service
  i never claimed one was better than another you dumb fruit its all the same shit
  the promised land    nothing beats menards    half the shit i buy at home improvement stores isnt even sold by orange or blue    i used to work at lowes heres why menards is better they pay a lower hourly wage but along with profit sharing the workers get paid the same or more while the store is simultaneously protected from hard times that could come about due to market crash or what have you     and has anyone noticed menards diversifying their specialties closet stuff auto stuff furniture its all high value and in one place
  it looks like the premium brand from hazard fraught
  there were a lot of people commenting on how the high end hf looks exactly like dewalt that shit could be contracted out to the same people and craftsman is owned by sbd which makes dewalt so who knows      hey bby 
  is it true that lowes only exists to let tool manufacturers find out who the idiots are  lowes is like a backup home depot  you only go there when you cant find what you want at hd and by chance lowes carries it
  youre misinterpreting why the service is there its for one or two cuts without precise measurements  i bet youd buy a 3 2x4 and ask them to cut it every 1/8 so itd turn to dust then after an hour when the dude is done take it to the counter and ask for a discount  specialty cuts and detailed requests arent what it was ever intended for thats why carpenters exist it used to be inherent knowledge hence why there arent signs
  not buying from contractor outlets on big purchases and ace hardware or harbor freight for small purchases    not using craigslist as your first source
here in michigan we have home depot lowes and just got a bunch of menards  i go to the depot for materials and tools im starting to like menards more and more   i only go to lowes for lenox blades other than that lowes sucks
  menards    menards has a lot of good shit if you want to do ambitious projects like building your own house you can buy preengineered roof trusses from them
  homo despot  kek made me chuckle reminded me of a former classmate in electro school who had such a nickname for about every shop/store in the vicinity
  ace is much closer to me but generally more expensive
  why does lowes kiss the ass of spanish speakers though    im fairly close to quebec put signs in french
  we still are friendo
  where i live white people go to lowes and the mexicans go to home depot the selection is similar lowes is a little cleaner home depot is a little cheaper
  whats the deal with menards only selling no name power tools if i wanted no name i wouldve gone to harbor freight
  we are supposed to get paid
  wickes every time for me i dont know what lowes is never seen one but i think home depot i may have

  supposedly that masterforce stuff is or was made by makita i have a hammer drill and right angle drill from them no complaints but i was looking for an extra battery without paying 90 for a 20ah and couldnt find shit anywhere besides mendardscom since its not a big brand and the nearest store is like 1000mi away
  my mom works at lowes ama    protip she says people come in a steal shit all the time and shes not allowed to stop them and when she tells loss prevention they say oh that sucks and write off the loss  shes in chicago btw

harbor freight patrician checking in
i would homo depot is the same    their instore brand rigid used to make really good tools suitable for professionals    i bought their 13 planer and the random orbit sander and both have worked excellently so i recommended them to a few friends    those friends bought ones years newer than mine but had a plethora of problems like racking of the screws in the planer poor lifespan of motor brushes     i checked out his planer and was surpriosed at how many changes all to the worse his had over mine smaller motor thinner infeed and outfeed tables etc    garbage
  their instore brand rigid  rigid  its a common mistake
  i work at lowes too no one cares
    get better jobs losers
i work at home depot ama
  i make 22/hr selling installs and have very little responsibility no thanks
    ace is maximum comfy and i love the staff at my local one but its awful expensive compared to the big box stores
    well they still make excellent hand drivers im glad they havent let that slide
he doesnt shop at megalomart
  i prefer not to buy my screws from the aisle next to the feminine hygiene products      boomerdrivers  those basic craftsman ones arent bad but i wouldnt call them excellent screwdrivers are goofy because they look so simple and you think how could they possibly improve them but some of the more expensive brands use this voodoo that results in less stripped screws    i wanted to try pic related while they were on sale but i already have a gorillion screwdrivers husky and stanley both have diamond tip drivers too and they grip bretty gud and theyre not too expensive    and then theres the pricey brands like klein wiha and snap on but youre paying for the black magic with these drivers its kinda like kosher food they have a shaman at the end of the assembly line who blesses the tips and keeps these drivers from camming out
  tell us more about all the shit you buy and never use or ideally go get a fucking blog so you can wank on about yourself in peace
  would you read my blog i dont want to put in the effort unless you will read it daily    and i didnt buy those screwdrivers because they would never get used unless i tossed all my ol craftsman ones    recently i have been using these cheap ones all the time because theyre right next to me on the workbench or the 11in1 i kinda want to replace those cheap ones with wiha or something else nice but it would end up being like 300 since theres phillips flat torx and square and they go all the way down to smaller sizes was a sweet set for 20 just to experiment with the little organizer but theyre kinda crappy
why does ryobi have 1000 tools with 999 brushless variants but their impact wrench is the only thing in the whole fucking lineup that isnt brushless will they ever make one like every single other brand has or is it just a matter of cost
  i think its the same reason milwaukee and dewalt wont sell you a brushless high torque 120v impact those 1000ftlb cordless impacts have to be a big reason why people get started on one of those brands i definitely took it into consideration before i got these ridgid tools ridgids most powerful impact is 400ftlbs and i almost went yellow to have the option of a big stud snapping wrench but the deal was too good
    eh theyre good enough for the girl i run with     theyre esthetically pleasing to boot
  eh theyre good enough for the girl i run with    and /diy/ descends into the abyss of stupidity
    i was espousing the merits of a modern day craftsman product that isnt total shit     dont you think thats a bit extreme
  most craftsman stuff isnt terrible its 2018 not much is made in the us anymore if you ever use some tool shop or hdx or pittsbugh/hft its easy to understand the difference between asian made tools and cheap ass chinesium    those craftsman drivers arent bad they fit better than the absolute chinesium drivers that may need some filing out kd the box but they havent made them any better as the premium brands figure it out they offer a couple lines that are better than those basic ones though and the black and red handled drivers look ok
  sunk to new lowes    you need carlos there  15 of the recaptchas
  they used to have these stores in the us
  i work at a menards ive seen the shit we sell and trying to track down the manufacturers only to deadend at a chinese website with close to zero support is super frustrating  even if it came at an increased expense i would rather spend my own money buying quality tools at another bigbox at least their crap comes with some level of american customer service
building a desk    cant afford a solid door and craigslist has been bunk for a few weeks    i was using pic related before but ended up breaking it by being an idiot i used a piece of plywood underneath the fasten the legs the only problem was that the monitor mount was too heavy and would bend inward and warp the wood heavily i used a u bracket to fasten it to my wall to take the weight off of it but im not tryina do that again cant think of a more elegant way to support the mount    any ideas to support that mount hollow doors are like 40 bucks and i can get em new and unstained with no holes
  a 2x6 stud laid flat underneath the table edge where the monitor mount mounts screw/glue the stud to the plywood along its entire length and if you can into the two back legs as well
  i got my hollow core door for free off cl    anyway pretty much what  said if you want to make a cheap desk last or not fall apart fast you are going to to add on to the structure of the desk
  go spend 30 bucks for a sheet of wood couple 2x4s at home depot or lowes can easily make a table that can hold a few hundred pounds
  home depot sells a 77 72inch foldable work bench that is sturdy as fuck    is 77 too much for you op
    workbench  cant sit at that like a normal desk and your legs would bash that shelf on the bottom  also workbench    you can buy a fucking piece of wood cheaper than that and lay it on top of the old desk and fasten it to it and make it stronger get out of here buyfag
put a fifth leg under that back middle part
  this is how i had it before was planning on using the same piece of wood for my new desk but if the stud has to be attached id have to cut another piece i used to have just some random wood sandwiched at the underside of the mount but it didnt help much imma give this a shot tho thx
  thats a better pic heres is how i was imagining it
    hell yeah gonna get a new door and give this a shot if the mount is too flimsy and it cant take the weight underneath on the stud ill probably just wall mount the monitors
shoulda made a frame out of 2x4s to support the top and painted it black
i have the same mount perfect on my desk just spend a few bucks on 2cm thick gluelam and some steel
  here is the bottom side
  thats because your desk isnt hollow
menards sometimes puts their solid doors on clearance for 545
  yeah thats why i suggest gluelam
  wouldnt they bend over time if they stay horizontal all the time
  you can buy a fucking piece of wood  get out of here buyfag  which is it anon
    the other anon suggested buying a complete workbench rather than piece of wood to fix the ops desk which is what he was wanting to do     read moar faggit

hi guys    when replacing my ceiling light today i snapped one of the metal clips and cant seem to find a replacement part online    does someone know what these metal parts are called or better yet where to buy one    i would rather not buy a whole net unit/ kit since i am renting
  thats an oyster light and a quick search for oyster light clips seems to have bought up some good hits have a look might be worth rolling into a lighting supplier with one of the good clips as well see if they stock spares
  thanks    all my results are aussie and really broad could you link me your google search or some results please
its a lot like this
  im also ausfag but now im looking a lot of shit is seo optimised rubbish that doesnt actually link to spare parts maybe take pics of the part and any indentifying numbers on the fixture itself email beacon lighting or the lighting superstore see if they can help you out there seems to be entire fixtures on gumtree for around 1525 as well might even be worth letting your slumlord know its not unreasonable to disassemble the thing to replace a globe i cant see it being a big drama with them shit happens ya know
how do you blow a fuse    i want to go home from work early      please tell me someone has invented a tool that does this automatically
  plug everything in including forks
  first get down on your knees open wide    oh wait i thought i was on a different board for a second never mind
  sure its called a piece of wire create a short are you fucking 6
  typically fuses are thermal current produces heat  meanwhile heat increases resistance  so the most straightforward way other than just shorting out the supply or plugging as many electric showers you can find would be point a hairdryer at the fuse and get her nice and hot
  think about the illegal immigrant thats going to take your job and just get really really mad about it
  find one of these  insert fuse  profit
  are you telling me that if i put the end of a wire in both sockets of an outlet it will short
  find a seedy fuse bar go to the mens restroom and look for a stall with a hole cut in divider
  kek  fucking stupid but still chuckled
  is 15a  swap over with green 30a or similar swap back when blown ymmv
  bro i am the illegal immigrant
  cant call ice cause dont know anons identity  cant be bothered to make an effort to find out anons identity    well stop it you
  are u tellig me that if i short a circuit it will be shorted  mind  blown
  mostly forks
  took me time to realize it was stalker artifacts kek
  based wall building trips poster
  remove green fuse  lights go out  insert blue fuse into green location  lights turn on and off in less than a second  put fuses back to its normal position    yeah nothing suspect happened
  introduce extra homotrons into the circuit theyre the little known parts of the atom at are responsible for blowing fuses
    you blow the fuse at home and keep an assortment of various blown fuses with your personal tools    i spent a summer working on a road crew back in college everyone had a blown fuse for the radio at all times so if they ever happened to be called while sleeping they could swap out the fuse worked great until we forgot to tell a dickhead that he was called and he ratted out the whole system i left a week later but ive heard they have been issued spare fuses and nothing has changed save for a couple loose fuses in the toolbox
  jesus fucking chris  the absolute state of diy
anybody into christmas lights on their houses buying a house at the moment and its always something ive wanted to do
why should i waste the time and effort to put up decorations that can only be seen from the outside    only a couple other people nearby put up anything at all    better off to decorate inside where you can actually enjoy itputting lights and stuff in the windows works both ways
i have a couple strings of multicolored leds that i hang along the awnings of my house as well as an inflatable prop i cant see it most of the time but others can  but i do the majority of decorating indoors
  some people interact with their neighbors and do things for their benefit other people go outside and like having the outside of their homes look nice some people have a sense of civic pride and do things for the benefit of the community in general some people have children who enjoy decorating for holidays
  t grinch
      fuck that    you tend to lose any sense of community when you live near assholes and businesses who are so lazy that they cannot be bothered to clean the sidewalks which they are legally supposed to even when they have a snowblower forcing people to walk through several inches of snow and slush or walk in the road
  so rather than making things better you would prefer to stew in misery and contemplate the inadequacies of those around you    theologically speaking the main difference between heaven and hell is the company saints are people who cooperate fix problems care about each other and pursue good in all things they can therefore have nice things and even make nice things for themselves the damned are petty spiteful wasteful and make each other miserable they destroy nice things if they are given any christmas is an opportunity to remind people of their better natures and to act for a time in ways that we could yearround but generally cant be bothered to people may not achieve the ideal but seeing symbols of good cheer from time to time can remind them that there is an alternative to idle misery    so anon are you sure you dont want to do anything for your community this christmas have you got anything better to do
  are you sure you dont want to do anything for your community this christmas  i do do somethingi shovel    have you got anything better to do  yanking it in the dark while yelling im on the hiiiiiiighway to hell
  where im from it goes more like if you dont shovel old guy slips its an act of god if you shovel and it ices back over old guy slips its your fault because you didnt shovel it right/well enough so you get sued i give this a 50 chance of being a bunch of horse shit but thats good enough for me theres no sidewalk in front of my house anyway so it really doesnt matter
    op here im an ausfag and buying in a decent enough suburb so snow is definitely not an issue and im hoping the neighbours are decent enough that i wont turn into a jaded grump
  if youre planning to put up a lot of lights consider leds instead of incandescents they use a lot less electricity so you can do much longer runs without blowing a fuse depending on where you will be hanging the lights you might need to get different clips also i would recommend having a good stable ladder     aesthetically consider the overall look youre going for religious display santas and reindeer everywhere just lights etc pick colors and styles that work well with the space available
  more like old/disabled person has to ride their electric wheelchair in the road because the sidewalk is impassable and gets hit by a car    the city isnt even clearing sidewalks next to property owned by the city    if they dont respond to the complaints the next step will be making some kind of ada complaint
bill ansell
  consider leds instead of incandescents  incandescents arent outlawed yet havent seen them for sale in 5 to 8 years ish   leds are cheaper to run efficient brighter more robust in theory
  sounds like a certain rrace of people to me
  they were white
tradition here were the only house on our side of the block that decorates so we go a little beyond string of lights we have inflatables wood cutouts 3d trees and this year ive trashed the old icicle lights for led c6s
  get a load of this lazy faggot
  sidewalks are obsolete thats what the suicide lane is for
    fentanylamericans
  of course they were    blacks owning a business
  what is a beautiful atmospheric white christian tradition      fuck off mudslime christmas lights are comfy as fuck and with leds now a days its cheap af
hell yeah i love christmas lights they make this time of year fun plus its a subtle way of telling the neighbors youre just a little bit better than they are lol j/k but for real pic related got mine up as soon as thanksgiving was over    pro tip use a daylight sensing plug so they turn on and off automatically and buy a timer for your christmas tree lights to turn on each day nothing like coming home to a house already lit up just feels cozy
    any other pics the red/white combination in that pic looks pretty horrid

this thread bought to you by the aduc7025 precision analog microcontroller youre analogue why shouldnt your uc be too
so this might be more /sqt/ than /ohm/ but if i have a device that requires 5dc and 5vdc can i run them from separate bench supplies or should i slap together an appropriate reg circuit its a device under test/restoration i have two identical supplies but i can slap together something on breadboard to power it short term if needed
  if your bench supplies are floating you can bridge two 5v ones to create 5v relative to the center point
do you think these generic arduino relays can handle being powered by 12v instead of 5v
  they are thank thank you anon       best to use a resistor to drop the voltage use rv/i to determine the value required then use pixv to determine what wattage resistor you need so it doesnt smoke
    make a break out board  call it x arduino board  the guy that had this idea is genius but i died inside when i saw a potentiometer board
  this was legit good idea there are many components that require additional components to work with things like raspberry pi or arduino for example thermocouples capacitive touch sensors or the mentioned relay since you cant power it directly from a digital pin etc  so instead of ahving to solder 5 different things together and ending up with a mess of wires you have a tiny pcb format  but some things are pretty stupid breakout wise like for example mosfet driver boards why would you need that you can easily drive the mosfet directly from a gpio pin you can even pull it down from it
  you mean drive the driver from the pin right because power mosfets need some current to get going and usually have von5v
  no you can drive mosfets directly from logic pins
  obviously i mean logic level mosfets
  anyone know what the connectors on the bottom of this switch are called    i know there are connectors that can easily plug into them but i dont know what they are called
  cdi box  what model what pins are you measuring  if you measure at same points and get different values  your measurement technique is shit
  what does the 10a 30vdc 10a 28vdc mean on it the part number makes me think that it can only handle up to 5vdc
  seriously  its the rating for the switched voltage and current current and coil voltage
    relays quite often come with different coil voltages so they put the coil voltage in the pn so you drive this one with 5 v    listing 28 vdc and 30 vdc is retarded but maybe they had a big customer with a retarded purchasing dept who kept bugging them is this ok with 28v it says 30 so they listed 28 too stupider things have happened
  its the rating for the switched voltage and current current and coil voltage    put the crack pipe down son
  come on brainlet apply yourself  you use the 5v to turn the relay on or off and you can pass 30v dc up to 10a or 125dc up to 10a through that relay it is really not that complicated at all
  according to this quick google search you cant test cdi boxes with just a dmm 
  i think he was commenting on your retarded sentence structure
  those are solder lugs  youre probably thinking pic related which is available in different sizes some of them might even fit to your connector theyre called faston or abiko connectors depending on where you live
what is a good crimping tool  i want to buy one from ali but they have so many of them  i would like some unversal that can do lots of terminals  i will be using it solely for putiting terminals on wires sized between duponts and normal outlet wires the bendy ones
do you think the 9000mah 18650 liions chinks sell will have at least 3000mah
  no i think if theyre chinese and have some obnoxious rating like that they will be 1500mah
  have a look at some google results on them plenty have been tested none come close i think the lowest i ever saw was a 9900mah battery that only had 500odd i would avoid unless you can get them locally and return them easily when they fail to deliver
    anon who mentioned the kobalt drill batteries probably had the best idea 6x 2000mah for 20 and i doubt those kobalt batteries will have used or knockoff cells in there even the harbor freight stuff has new samsung sells    otherwise walmart pic related was 15
  based      nonratcheting the molex 638111000 hand crimp tool is pretty universal for noninsulated terminals at the smaller end of that range  ratcheting there are a few tools on ali/ebay with individual crimp dies available theyre all pretty much the same ive found the sn01bm to work best with dupont connectors      nope pic related
    seemed too good to be true        get the fuck out of here faggot
  the fuck is that little silver rectangle the actual battery    that better be cocaine weighing it down
  pls kill yourself tripfag
i would like to power esp32 from a battery   is saw it has ams1117 voltage regulator on it so i beeped the 3 legs and one is shorted to ground one to 3v3 pin and one to vin pin  i assume that if i want to save energy i will have to go through the 3v3 pin directly and connect it to a battery but since it is bypassing the regulator any slight overvoltage will destroy the board  so i was thinking of getting a small buck converter set to 3v3 and two 18650 liions connected in series feeding the buck  since the buck isnt wasting energy as heat this should be very efficient and safe right
  ldo regulator with a single nominal 37v battery gives 33/37  89 efficiency youre not gonna beat that with a cheapo buck converter module
  if i read the sheet for the ams1117 correclty it drops at minimum 12v which would be only 25v left for the board which is not enough
  can i use a transmitter to fry car stereos people in my subdivision with really loud bass im hearing their music through their car across 200 yards and through my house annoy the shit out of me  yeah im aware id probably be violating some fcc regulation theyre black they wouldnt report me even if they knew what the fuck was happening
  im workin on it    20ga wire for relay switch  12ga wire for power to nails  sound ok
welp after some digging i found out that the chinese 18650 liions have a slightly lower capacity than the originally claimed 9900mah the real capacity is actually pretty close 550mah but sadly not enough for my needs i would be perfectly happy with even 2000mah  god damn it i will have to buy those overpriced pieces of shit here in my country to actually get a good capacity
  can you get any drill batteries for a decent price     that canuck ave took apart a chinesium dewalt knockoff battery that was supposed to be 30ah and it ended up being slightly used 2000mah sony cells so it was actually better than the packaging claimed otherwise if you can find a cheaper power tool brand and grab a 20ah battery it will probably have decent cells
  overpriced  no your cheap chink shit batteries are underpriced you want good batteries you have to pay good money
  so get a better ldo
  i buy everything electronics related from china and so far it was all been perfect i buy arduinos from there for 3 a pop whereas here they cost 19 a pop and the chink ones gave me zero problems so far  so this is a question of finding a store that carries liions which arent a pure rip off
  i already have 50 small buck convertors it was min purchase quantity so i will use those instead
  its easy to make a totally identical rip off of something like an arduino the cheap components work pretty much identical to the real ones much harder to do a battery   you just cant make a battery cheaper and still have it be as good cheap batteries are always going to have lower capacity and the electrode overlap is going to be shitty too   go ahead and try cycling those batteries hard see how long they can go before blowing up
  this is really shitty situation   this would mean that batteries for my project will cost literally 3 times as much as my entire project
  test
  not a bad idea  maybe from letgo or some shit like that  the problem is that if they were use in a drill they would be cycled alot and probably near dead
  i mean if you can get them dirt cheap maybe you can get 23 cells that are still really good and the other are crappy and the ave ones ended up all being good cells but you could tell they were spot welded to something else before    theres a company that sells remanufactured prius batteries that does something similar they take the failing battery packs and its normally only one or a couple cells failing and the others still have a ton of life left in them so they test all of the cells junk the crap ones and use the good ones for new battery packs
  you could also buy and old lead acid car battery they are really cheap and then cut open the casing and pull out the liion ceels
  thats what im trying to do but i think i need a bigger pry bar    inb4 this guy  gets here
  maybe youd have to consult the datasheet and see dont forget to consider quiescent current and the total amount of run time you need      if you have to ask no you probably couldnt      many such cases in iot
  the current will be almost nonexistent basically it is an esp32 with a digital temperature sensors it will be in deep sleep and wake up once every 60 second connect to wifi read temperature make http get request with the temperature and go back to sleep  so no heating issues or anything like that  so since most of the time the esp 32 is in deep sleep which is like 5ma or something then buck would be worth it since i bet the liner regulator would waste lots of energy during sleep
  if you have to ask no you probably couldnt  nigger it was a yes or no question dont be fucking smarmy with me  now that i know that answer is yes but it requires you to go learn something ill go fucking learn something if it had been no that isnt possible id be wasting my goddamn time by learning about it  i didnt ask you to spoonfeed me the how  just to confirm whether my desired end goal was realistic  thanks cunt il go learn about radios now
  you need one of these
meh its not really a spot welder but more of a make things glow red machine i definitely lost some current somewhere in the contraption i would put my money on the shitty connectors     welp gonna put that project away in the junk bin
  the regulators quiescent current i mean thats whats killing you with the ams1117 which is not the most efficient linear reg  i bet the liner regulator would waste lots of energy during sleep  regulators vary widely i wouldnt bet that without reading individual regulator/converter datasheets
i have a kicad question component pads in my pcb editor have these rings around them they seem to be in the front copper layer and disappear when i make footprints or pads invisible     in the footprint editor on the left the rings arent there     anyone know whats going id love to get rid of them
  never used kicad but the size suggests theyre solder mask expansions check the pad settings for solder mask or displayed layers
  found it its an indicator of net pad clearance     any ideas how to disable that besides setting the clearance rule to 0
  got it its in display options
  get the fuck out of here faggot
    i prefer pic related
  at 75 im too uninformed geekwise to know where to find the mod/pack youre using
    shits cash if you know what i mean  i havent tried but you can probably use the plain old tripcode filter with just a single exclamation point to mute all trips
is it acceptable to use a single schottky diode to make a higher voltage rail than your silicon rectifier bridge such that i can drive an nchannel mosfet on the highside rectified mains btw      4chan x browser plugin allows you to draw little pictures in the quick reply window among many other things hotkeys for spoiler math etc tags hotkeys to hide or show all images on a page change date/time formats it has a very extensive settings page      its possible but it will require a few hundred dollars of rf equipment if not a few thousand youll have to send them rf at an audio frequency 10khz would work and have it get picked up by the amplifier meaning youd need to induce at least a few hundred mv across a tiny wire the electric field strength needed to pull that off would require a large amount of transmitting power even 5m away so trying to do so at 200m would require a directional antenna and even more power not to mention you couldnt use a self resonant antenna at such a low frequency other options are frying their electronics with an emp not an option or somehow trying to match their classd amps pwm frequency which might not do anything at all but as far as fcc regulations i dont think youd be in trouble at all since i dont believe bands below 100khz or so are regulated
  is it acceptable to use a single schottky diode to make a higher voltage rail  no draw all the diodes inside the bridge visible and you should see why on the other hand you can add a capacitor and another diode to make a kindasorta doubler  you need a protection diode for the mosfet gate too
  a good ldo will waste less when the esps in deep sleep than a good buck
  i still dont really see the problem
  thats amazing
  what
  thanks
  look at d1 and d5 youre not gonna get anything across c2 simulate it and see
  oh yeah the other diode drop is on the ve rail still i can use a schottky diode is there an issue with that
  y tho just move that bitch to the low side and have more gate drive than you can handle      see if you can find the hidden cw voltage doubler in there  protip you cant
  i want to make a buck converter so having a highside switch would mean my output voltage is referenced to the neutral/earth line    or would using a lowside and flipping the live and neutral lines be recommended instead
  oh it wouldnt be referenced to 0v anyway since its a fullbridge rectifier
what is a good control scheme to cool a led without wasting power when it isnt very hot it has a heatsink but ill add a fan because sometimes it really gets toasty bangbang control is adequate ill proably go analog because it seems like a simple thing
  add some hysteresis
  the generic term would be quick disconnect
  lol no read the datasheet from the specific manufacturer carefully ill bet that rating is based on some ridiculously low current draw like youd expect from a 3v lithium coin cell like a cr2302
    in a batterypowered design look at what your typical current draw will be to determine if you want to use an ldo or a switching regulator low current draw use an ldo medium or high current draw use a switcher theres even some buck/boost types that include an ldo and will switch to that automatically when appropriate to cover the middle ground linear tech i think
  can i use a transmitter to fry car stereos  not really but if you have access to a cb radio with a linear amplifier ie kilowatt or better highly illegal and an directional antenna you can overload their car stereo and some diode junction in the audio section of it will act as an am detector so everything you say into the mic will come out their speakers can be rather unsettling if they dont know whats going on and if youre creative about what you say when you do this
  try using some carbon rods as electrodes instead of those nails
    if a few tenths of a volt are really going to make a difference then make a fullwave bridge out of four schottky diodes and be done with it
  can confirm my home stereo used to pick up transmissions from trucks on the highway next to the house the speaker wires were about the right length to be a halfwave antenna it got detected in the output stage the volume control had no effect
  it worked with the nails when i tested it with wire straight to the battery the relay is rated at 40a maybe that is the weak link or one of the connections i did 12ga wire with everything but the switch and i think it was 14ga or 16ga i used to test it    dude in the video used copper nails i think they were larger than the little copper plated ones i bought but once again they worked in the test and i was thinking about filing the point a tiny bit     carbon rod sounds interesting this may be a retarded question but could i use the lead from a regular 2 pencil       simpsons did it
  id only need a halfbridge rectifier since i wouldnt need the two diodes that establish a negative rail also please just make all your quotes in the same post and dump the trip
    hmm this guy did a different yet simple setup he uses a dc power supply mine is sitting in my guest bedroom and im trying not to open it til xmas 3 big capacitors in series and some graphite rods for the electrodes     probably not as fast as the big battery but still a cool idea and he claims he can spot weld copper with it which im assuming is more difficult than the nickel strips    i wanna load test this car battery somehow and see what kind of balls she had left in her seems to be taking and holding a charge better than i expected but my little 4a charger is great for the 10ah scooter battery and slow as steam coming off a cold turd with a full size one she sure did blow some holes in the nickel strips with the test run and that was at 119v    i need a fuckin purpose before i get the motivation to perfect the thing any ideas on an easy fix to control the output for different materials
         gets a trip just to rile up the board even more  another trip to filter great to see you have the community at heart you cock lord
is it safe to step down pc fan voltage from 12v to 5v with just a resistor i want to reduce rpm by half
  you can filter all trips automatically so you experience can be 100 trip free
  do you prefer to filter the entire reply chain to a tripfags post too or just the actual post the tripfag made
      the tripcode is the problem  delusional
  nope but its a symptom that you can filter to solve the problem
    the true chemo would be to implement a silent permaban for anyone who attempts to post with a trip
  see    now leave it off dipshit       they are not without their place but to assume a mechanism to prevent thread hijacking and ongoing verification for works in progress is for turning the board into your personal blog is the actual delusion and arrogant in the extreme even fucking bunkerbro the one guy on /diy/ who actually warrants a trip manages to refrain
  even if 5v is enough for running it your fan might not start  for an extra of kludge you can put a large capacitor in parallel with the resistor to give the fan an initial start pulse
  if i connect the fan to 5v it runs just fine just dont want to waste a buck convertor to step down 12v if i can use a resistor
  fan pulls more current starting than it does running at steady speed if you size the resistor to get 5v steady state itll be getting less than that when trying to start might not be enough
  fuck why cant anything ever be just simple for once will 500uf cap be enough
ok so i know little about circuits and i have a poor idea of what im doing but here i go    say the decoder output table y3 y2 y1 y0 is   hhhl  hhlh  hlhh  lhhh    which is the same as the encoder input table  is the pull up resistor on the left the right way to make the horizontal lines go high when a button on that line is not pressed or should each line have its own resistor
  answer yes for a few quick seconds otherwise use a 100 ohm 1 watt resistor
  each line should have at least its own resistor otherwise once you pull any line low all other lines will go down as well since all 4 lines are connected    though personally i would never use this configuration
  get a slower fan  or use pic related      no add a small voltage regulator
  voltage regulator  for relay  kek
  pointofload regulation is a legitimate technique in power design no doubt the device youre sitting in front of right now has half a dozen of them  begone lolduino thot
  thanks frien  i did this in order to use the least pins possible on the microcontroller it will eventually be attached to but what do you mean by youd never use this  too unwieldy
  just to prevent keypress ghosting id add diodes other than that its just mostly preference how you do it
how do i balance charge on my liions without spending hunderds on a balancer
  series right have a few difference comparators youd need a separate voltage stage for each battery but start there thats only if youre optimizing if youre not just put each battery at 4142 volts above the previous negative terminal dont think normal regulators sink current so have fun youre going to run into issues if you want to charge it all at once in series you could switch which battery  is ground so you only need a 4142 supply and if each battery is charged enough switch to the next one
  legitimate technique  what does that have to do with anything  anons point is a simple resister would do and a vr is overkill for this application    thot  ah faulty reasoning explained
  depends on the frequency but you can couple them with a transistor/other mosfet/not gate if its a problem around 100khz youd need 0515a depending on the mosfet a circuit i worked on i was pushing hardware to its limits i wouldve needed 115a for 1mhz and the goal was 15mhz at highest speed i didnt know power drivers existed before that
  does anybody want to spoonfeed me on mosfets was trying to read the wiki and stuff but a little over my head are they basically like a relay except its not 0 or 100 it can be anywhere in the middle based on the input voltage if thats the case then what is going in/out of the 3 pins and can they handle high current like a relay    they seem to be in everything i open up
  no they are all in parallel since i want to increase capacity not voltage
  does anybody want to spoonfeed me on mosfets  not really but ok  are they basically like a relay  thats one use for them but important differences are that they dont isolate the control from the signal they dont require any significant current to drive and only work in one polarity if you try to drive them in the other polarity theyll just act as diodes no matter what you do with the gate voltage   except its not 0 or 100 it can be anywhere in the middle based on the input voltage  yeah  if thats the case then what is going in/out of the 3 pins  for ntype which are the important ones drain gate and source drain to source is the signal path and acts like a resistor when the fet is on gatesource voltage changes the resistance its a bit more complicated as neither of those effects is linear with vgs or vds over the whole operating region  and can they handle high current like a relay  depends on the fet and how well its heat sinked
    and take off your trip fucker why would you want to be known as the guy who doesnt understand fets every time you post
    thx bruh    and see im learning your little beppu is growing up
  so trying to read the fet wiki now source would be like 30 on this relay drain like 87 and gate like 86    took of the trip for this one post since somebody was actually helpful on the ol taiwanese spearfishing forum
  ill tell you if you promise to leave it off for all future posts
  its a space future triode  normally the electrons sit in a pool at the bottom doing nothing but when you suck some electrons out the middle of the tube electrons from the bottom fizz up to the top
    picking a trip when you dont even know the basics or made 0 things to make the thread better and ask questions  die
a symptom that you can filter  filter trip in comments  no more borg posts
  what if i leave the trip off but every post includes a pic with newports in the shot
  thats not bad    if im reading your picture right 30 is drain 86 is gate 85 is source
ive got a couple questions  whats the point of the arrow on the trim pots there are some of them that arent marked what kinds of resistors are those  what effect do you get when using a capacitor inline instead of across
  resistor with arrow coming in the middle  variable potentiometer  resistor with only two terminals  regular resistor fixed resistance    capacitor inline blocks dc and allows ac to pass generic usage  there are more specialized uses but at the moment no need to know    for audio stuff capacitor inline blocks any bias dc voltage that is present and only allows ac signal audio to pass since it is what you want and what generates audio in speakers
  the arrow represents the tap on the pot if you measure the resistance between both nonarrowed terminals on a pot youll get the max resistance value of the pot if you leave one side of the pot floating and measure from the connected terminal to the tap can get any resistance from 0 to the maximum value of the pot depending on how far you turn it     capacitor inline forms a high pass filter which is typically used as a dc block though depending on the size of capacitor it can be used to filter out low frequency ac too usually a dc block though to prevent dc from the bias networks backfeeding into your signal source and into your load this is typically known as an ac coupling capacitor capacitor across forms a low pass filter which takes out high frequency noise also referred to as a decoupling capacitor because it shunts high frequency noise to ground due to its very low impedance at high frequencies additionally these caps can serve a dual role they also store some energy and can quickly supply it if theres a sudden spike in load power consumption this helps keep the voltage on the dc rail constant where it otherwise might have dropped a bit and then recovered
    thanks  one more thing how would you go about powering that circuit  oh also whats a good place to snag the relevant op amp
  since schematic seems to be using 9v should be good idea to stick to that voltage external supply would probably be best option    component stores are mentioned in 
anyone know of a good way to clean a motherboard im envisioning some kind of lightly pressurized isopropyl alcohol hose/nozzle maybe in a bath with a filter to recycle the alcohol
  check the store in the op  find the chip  see price  heart skips a beat  realize that commas and points are switched  oh thank god sure didnt help that they were showing one more decimal than youd expect
  i always clean electronics with isopropanol 99 and a soft bristle brush   a pressurized spray system is overcomplicated i spray the alcohol out of a regular spray bottle that way you can spray with exactly the force you want and adjust the spray size
  take a look at the big muff pi anon  
has anyone here ever tried using a r2r ladderuc to generate sines and ramps in the absence of a signal generator if i use only parallel 1 resistors to get 2r and r the error gets cut down in half maybe its possible to make a 10bit dac
  8bit resolution percentage is 04 10bit is 01    for a 10bit converter even using 01 precision resistors would not guarantee monotonicity of output    
    how about make it impossible to post with a trip in more than one bumplimit not reached thread at a time make it take like an hour for your trip to get verified for each thread make it a bannable offence to have more than one tripcode you know who you are      what do they call it in europe a decimal comma
  the tripcode conforms to the rules   instructions are at   the asylum is not run by a few triggered inmates
  the tripcode conforms to the rules    correct the sad but funny thing is that the smartest board on 4chan  never learned the basic rule do not feed the trolls    bepis rules this board because it is full of morons and he is somewhat creative in his trolling
  the point of tripcodes are for verification of someones identity as being the same as the one who posted earlier without requiring any form of irl identification be it a name or distinctive piece of furniture or scar its there in the first place to prevent people from faking posts by a known anon like bunkerbro or any other person that has anons interested in their updates across threads which is simple to do since were on a website thats anonymous by default    not only do we have people using tripcodes when nobody is interested enough in their updates to want to avoid posts by an imposter but people using what i assume to be their own name as their tripcode this is out of line of the original purpose of tripcodes and an obnoxious waste of time for all involved having to go out of your way to filter every useless tripfag when there may be an occasional person who does deserve a tripcode is tiresome especially since the ones we do see often display subpar ability    the suggestions i made would keep tripcodes able for use for their original purpose while disincentivising them for other uses extremely lowquality posts are against the rules after all
  fuck off even bunker anon does not use a tripcode how about you start doing /diy/ instead of being a fag
  bunker anon doesnt need to because he always posts sick oc if it were an anon reporting from north korea who cant post images since he doesnt have a camera/doesnt want to get caught the use of tripcodes would be perfectly justified and if bunkerbro did use a tripcode i dont think any of us would fault him for it
is my maths wrong my sim is giving me a different result to my calculation
  thats my old wallet bro thats how you know its an impostor        he actually took the time to type all of this out    i rode the short bus to high school it was more bumpy than the regular bus there were only like 4 of us on there and for xmas the driver gave us all bugles chips
  please go back to using a tripcode
  i1 and i2 dont depend only on v1 and v2 review you circuit analysis and algebra books
  fuck i thought so for such a simple circuit it has such a complicated transfer function
  the grass is always greener amirite
    oh never mind i forgot all about millmans theorem
so im testing a variable dutycycle buck converter and ive hit the snag that i though i would namely the feedback voltage is smaller than the voltage set by the potentiometer so the differential amplifier is feeding the comparator a voltage within the bounds of the triangle wave but the resultant duty cycle isnt enough to get the output voltage up to the desired level since the output voltage doesnt change the feedback voltage doesnt change so the duty cycle doesnt change and this sag / undesirable steadstate would happen to some extent regardless of what load i put on    pic related but its kinda awful oscillator voltages feedback voltages and potentiometer voltages are all set to vary between 2v and 3v which i assumed would give me plenty of room compared to larger ranges if the output voltage is higher than what i set it to be then the comparator should shut off completely and if its 340v too low then the comparator should turn on 100 of the time some funky low value resistors are there just for ensuring the transistors turn on quick enough
  then youd get banned for avatarfagging so yes please do
  any proportional feedback loop maintains a little bit of error to keep it pushing in the needed direction try adding more gain to your error amp u1 to start you might want to see the duty cycle swing from 0 to 100 as the feedback voltage varies from 99 to 101 of the reference voltage maybe even tighter
  cont  i assume its a problem typically avoided by simply turning that sag as tiny as possible 100mv or so since eliminating it entirely while possible would require vastly different circuitry so i think ill need to change the gain of the differential amplifier currently at unity to be much higher which will probably require its ground bias voltage source v4 to change too changing the inductance would also probably help      you might want to see the duty cycle swing from 0 to 100 as the feedback voltage varies from 99 to 101 of the reference voltage  ah that does send me in somewhat the right direction thats far less arbitrary than what i was thinking but ill need to do a fair bit of math to figure out how to alter the gain of the amp for that to happen thanks a bunch
    a fair bit of math  oh all i had to do was increase the gain a whole lot because all the other factors cancelled neat
how does everyone build your projects    so far ive just been using perfboard and making connections with spare wire and bending component legs its a pain in the ass to solder though
  depends if im just testing shit breadboard i use mostly through hole parts because of this since smd doesnt easily lend itself to prototyping without a metric fuck ton of breakout boards lying around and at 14 a board those costs add up when you need a lot of them     for more permanent but not too serious stuff i use protoboard like in your pic the ones that have buses like on the breadboard are nice but theyre relatively expensive so i dont have many on hand the cheap ones with holes are okay i usually make connections with component legs people say to use solder bridges to connect pads but i can never seem to do this right which is not helped by the soldermask     for any project i want to look nice or that doesnt lend itself well to breadboard due to high voltages or parasitics or whatever ill get a pcb made     i wanna try out manhattan construction but i dont have any plain copper boards and they arent cheap either
  i dont 
    tab wire cause i like to step shit up and make things harder then they need to be looks cool though hay
  with lots of hot glue
    forgot pic
    mfw hiromoot adds a new rule against newport posting
  back to camel wides i guess
  even though youre a tripcode user the physical model of a mosfet makes them way easier to understand they have an npn/pnp setup like a bjt but the middle channel is nondoped normally theres a capacitor made against this middle channel by having the gate connection and an insulator if you build up static on the gate you displace charge on the other making a conductive path more static charge greater current capacity the opposite long side doesnt have the gate connection so theres nonlinear body problems it gets worse because as you push higher voltage on d/s the ends of the channel pick up a static effect so the channel shortens and becomes more conductive mosfets are actually nondirectional devices but we build them in a way which makes them better oneway
  thats a y connection you could transfer it to a delta to figure out the current going from v1v2 and then use ir to figure out the voltage drop through the resistors to get v3
i am considering using a mosfet instead of a relay but since mosfet works with some electron magic fuckery instead of airgapping shit like a relay it surely has a lekage current  how long would it take for a closed mosfet to drain an aa battery connected to it
  it would drain it from the source input    dont power tools all use mosfets in the switches they dont seem to drain the batteries too bad
  imagine being this determined to cause drama in a community why the fuck is anyone still responding to this faggot
  it depends on mosfet voltage and temperature your fets datasheet tells the worst case value but you can expect the leakage current to be significantly less than 1ua at room temperature and at voltages relevant to aas worst case values can be onetwo orders of magnitude higher  your typical aa battery has a capacity of 2500mah or so and it would take couple of hundred years to drain it at 1ua current and around 3 years at 100ua
  im just holding up my end of the deal 
probably a retarded question but why does my body have a decent connection to ground potential even when standing on eg concrete which is a very bad conductor is it merely because of the size of the area im standing on which makes the resistance low if i take a look at the formula for the resistance of a wire rrhol/a it would make sense
  why does my body have a decent connection to ground potential even when standing on eg concrete  where does this assumption come from some electrical safety stuff wet concrete can be conductive enough for it to matter
  do you mean the assumption that you have a decent ground connection or that concrete is a bad conductor
    tfw doing electrical work barefoot on wet concrete
  the first one
  i did assume that because if you for example touch a 230v line while standing on the floor a considerable current flows through you which must mean that the current flows to ground no so for that to happen there has to be a somewhat decent connection
    if current flows to any appreciable degree you are in trouble when you grab a hot mains and it tingles or even makes you twitch a bit its just capacitive current and is very small
  its just capacitive current and is very small  well but still there must be a conncetion to ground no
im looking to buy a bunch of cheap simple and safe 100w 12v power supplies yknow the kind where there isnt any exposed mains wiring for idiots and children to fry themselves on so far im thinking of ordering good ol simple laptop power bricks from aliexpress any other suggestions they need to be cheap so i can keep the costs down but at the very least kinda safe so i wont get into trouble when some idiot hurts themself after buying my product
  well but still there must be a conncetion to ground no    through a tiny capacitor high impedance and the relatively large resistance of your body and probably the floor as well the floor might also be largely capacitive     all of which is why you can touch the mains with one part of your body and just tingle
  simple laptop power bricks    no need to specify laptop it wont hurt but it wont help either
  im not buying them for laptops  all i need is 12v and around 100w in a small safe and cheap package
  so just search for whatever 12v 8a10a power supply and find the cheapest    alibaba if you really want to buy in bulk
  alibaba if you really want to buy in bulk  oh i had completely forgotten about that website  i live in the eu could it be cheaper to order from amazonde for example than from china in bulk due to import taxes any experience on this
  for quick and dirty proofs of concept i use le ebin solderless breadboard and my minimal stock of throughhole components  for somewhat pernanent stuff that im in a hurry to build usually its a combination of cut copper tape and gouged board which is good down to sot23 sizes pic related a balanced antenna amp and bias tee free manhattan islands in lower right sometimes i will use a 100 protoboard and my dwindling stock of tht components  for permanent and/or complex projects where im willing to wait a minute i order prototype pcbs from china      14 a board  plain copper boards and they arent cheap either  if you order direct from chink theyre like 520 cents each  plain singlesided boards are like a dollar each use nibblers or alternatively tin snips to make islands or if you can find insulated copper tape try that maybe with a bit of kapton tape for extra layering and jumpers  also pro tip sot23 can fit onto an lshaped section of a 100 protoboard      probably not if they paid the import tax too
  breadboard perfboard or i draw and etch a pcb i dont have a laser printer so i have to do it manually
  greetings fellow magic marker user
  thoughts
    if there was a pcb 3d printer equivalent would you buy it    what if it could only do singlesided boards
  there is you can use a cnc router to carve away the copper where you dont want traces alternatively you could probably use a lowpower cnc laser to burn/ablate away an etch resist or simply use a 2d printer to print ink either with an inkjet on an acetate transparency or with a laser printer on the photoresist sheet directly where you want to avoid exposing photoresist theoretically a violet laser gan or doubled gaas would be usable for exposing photoresist without printing a template to obscure it but youd have to tune the power correctly to avoid exposing other parts of the pcb
  best explain i seen in a while thanks for laugh anon
  if it got wet while it was powered its done for
  im guessing its just covered in that sticky sort of dust that a pcb accumulates after years in a room with another person
  fans and speakers dont like baths maybe just take it outside and hit it with canned air with extension straw you might be surprised
  h2o isnt conductive you genius
   lightly pressurized  pussy i drench my shit in windex let it sit for a minute or two then hit it with a pressure washer pushes all the dust out of card slots and blasts all the shit off the surface follow up with a methylated spirit bath to displace all the water and make it dry faster have not had a single board vintage or modern fail but just make sure you remove any batteries and dont get closer than 100mm or so otherwise you may blast stickers off       pure h20 is not conductive the shit that comes out of your tap that is full of mineral and other contamination is  is still a potato for making such a dumb unqualified statement though
  see also
  i assumed it was bait since the assumption is that if it got wet while it was powered on it probably wasnt due to spilling distilled water on it also its h2o not h20 sweaty
  i cncd my own boards for several years but mostly get them printed now that those services have become so fast and cheap cncing the traces for chips smaller than sop was almost impossible for my 1000 machine and things like solder masks silkscreens and through hole plating is also really nice
  1000 machine  got a link considering getting my own machine though pcb routing would be a secondary use i wonder if a picknplace head for a generic 3axis cnc machine would be viable along with a solder paste extruder at that point doing a solder mask and silkscreen with some sort of felttip pen attachment wouldnt be inconceivable though certainly a waste of time compared to offshore pcb production
  i use a genaric 4060 model from aliexpress with a better cutting head and a homebrew set of rotary encoders to track position the base models keep track of position with dead reckoning so if the motors ever jam or slip it doesnt know and ruins everything it took a lot of experimenting and practice to get consistently good results dont expect to just plug it in and go like an inkjet printer
  how rigid is it could i cut aluminium with patience enough
  my plan is to make a laser engraver to engrave pcb or photo coating also the normal alternative is cnc
  the plan is to use dvd carriages ive tried using the lasers but they are so tiny and they cut off their legs so soldering them is impossible
is it better to drill one sided pcb from the copper side rather than from the top side
  assuming youre hand drilling is there any other way   can visually check you are centered on the pad   no risk of the pad lifting as the drill comes through
   no risk of the pad lifting as the drill comes through    i agree with your first point about centering on the pad but your second point seems backwards as the drill will try to lift the copper if the copper side is on top and if you have some wood or something on the far side there will be no tendency to push the pad down
  i dunno sure a drill has a twist but thats to pull swarf out once it has been removed by the cutting edge i guess making sure youre using a good sharp drill is the key its not a problem ive ever had at least
anyone have experience with this shit  about a year before i started in my current job the previous engineer decided to replace all the lights in the factory with high efficiency fluorescent tubes  they bought about 50 extra tubes  fast forward to now all spares are gone and lots of bulbs are blown  turns out theyre a plastic tube with a shorter than normal fluorescent tube inside and built in ballast pic related so turns out they pulled all the existing ballasts out of the fittings so i cant use normal fluorescent tubes i could go to led tubes but would have to rewire all the fittings so live and neutral were on the same end  the chink company they bought the tubes off have dropped off the face of the planet and any lighting suppliers ive asked have never seen anything like these tubes  the ballasts are still good but i cant fit a standard tube into the fitting with the ballasts on it  anyone ever see these things before or have any idea where they can be bought
  looks like you got chinked  replace all lights with led light bulbs and never look back

    did karly kloss take up electronics
  brainletpng  i dont get it is that because its beautiful
    it looks like something a girl would do if she were more interested in the artistic appeal than how it functions    is there a reason for that monstrosity looking like a jungle gym
  wow i bet fm radio signal on that thing is amazing
  we dont use breadboards here so any prototyping is done junglegym style i like that term more than freeform im adopting it
  looks like ill have to  theres a few hundred fittings to be rewired so
  be happy you have work son  if there was nothing to repair you would get fired because nobody will pay you to do nothing
hey /diy/ i cant afford regular cigarettes anymore and rolling tobacco from local farmers is a much cheaper alternative the problem is it smells very strong and the flavor is pretty bad ive seen people spray whiskey rum and other spirits on their semidried tobacco what do you think about that will it give it a better taste better aroma what can i do to make it taste/smell better cheers
  theres always a thread on /out/ called outings with a pipe those snooty looners might help you
  i didnt know that thank you mate
where are you located op    i work in tobacco so i can give you some recommendations
  have you considered not smoking its a healthier option that keeps on giving
  get some whole leaf burley tobacco online at leafonly  smokes great and anyone who smokes my rolled cigs compliments them and seems to really enjoy them
  and rolling tobacco from local farmers  are you sure they arent growing tobacco for pesticides
  hey /diy/ i cant afford regular cigarettes anymore    this is why everyone sucks on that robot cock so hard vaping is relatively cheap and it gets you that nicotine fix you are fiending for and it comes in all sorts of child friendly flavors so that the smell and taste isnt so offensive
  quit smoking you smelly fuckhead
  put it in the oven at 250f for a few minutes then smoke it     now you have diy lucky strikes
  im not op but vaping gave me a cough and lung pain on physicial exertion   its for faggots
  did you vape fat rips    slow and steady wins the race
  normal and temporary its the cilia getting healthier and expelling the built up crap from smoking
  not op  nobody wants their smokes to have child friendly flavours  the taste of tobacco is one of the best parts of tobacco
  do they ferment it correctly  if you get pure leaves you need to make a hard disk out of them and leave it to a warm place for some time after few weeks you can start cutting the disk to thin slices after this if the taste isnt good you can use rum etc to flavour it and also add sugar to smoothen the flavour
  for as long as your a smoker youll believe that youve associated the flavour of a cigarette with getting your nicotine fix i thought i loved the taste of tobacco too until i started vaping now its clear nicotine is responsible for what i deemed to be enjoyable about smoking
  buy better tobacco in my area of jew jersey a half pound of decent tobacco costs about 14 bucks including tax

  what projects are you guys working on or wanting to work on but procrastinating    procrastinating  usb wifi keylogger  esp8266 rfid skimmer    new project  building a device to set off horn on cranes we build at work with my phone
  temperature controlled soldering iron fm radio multichannel bt/mp3/microphone/radio headphones ohmeter all being procrastinated

  why not some of them are dead simple
  why not some of them are dead simple    you missed the point son
eventually a usb keypad for premiere
  whats the point then or do you not have one and youre just trying to cycle through your irrelevant reaction image folder  i just want to do 8x the work to get an impossibly high score on some crappy games whats wrong with that
  irrelevant reaction image folder    that image genius is a woman who cheated and appeared to win the boston marathon until it was discovered that she didnt run much of it    so go ahead and build your cheater crap to get a high score that you didnt actually get how old are you anyway 4chan is 18
  being this mad     the high score doesnt even matter its just a project bro
  cheaters who hack games ahould be banned im going to tell my dad he works for nintendo
  why dont we talk about one of the other significantly more complex and worthwhile projects then or someone else can share with the class
  more complex and worthwhile projects    which part of getting sick high scores on tapbased phone games is not complex and worthwhile anon
  its complex but on the scale of teenage wastes of time arduino projects fall only slightly ahead of attentionsapping mobile games basically youre not giving yourself a good start as far as the worthwhile scale goes    on that note heres some /ohm/ projects to remind you that this thread will always just be their containment thread for arduino fags
  i was only talking trash anon  that proj is more advanced than the ones ive done so far  i do have some more complex projects in mind but not started yet
  rolling up in this bitch
  lc meter  hahaha have fun with that one
  theres certainly some things you need a microcontroller for though like how else are you going to do something like     gps location telemetry mod  and record and store previous data then write it to an lcd without an order of magnitude more effort than just getting   a 3 arduino if the goal is just making a thing that works just do it the easy way if the goal is learning then fuck yeah design your own buckboost converter on a breadboard or design your own pcb like a nerd but the effort/reward on tons of these projects is just ludicrous
  dont use arduino if you can avoid it as it says  obviously there are some projects that you should use an mcu for such as the lc meter otherwise i wouldnt have posted it here
   otherwise i wouldnt have posted it here    bumpduino    the next incarnation of this thread should include simple electronics that dont belong in /ohm/
  whatcha doing with that there box
wow
    fun fact i think i calculated the rtc battery life to be about 5 centuries based on the ds1307 standby current and ignoring battery shelf life why did i use such a huge battery nobody knows
  should include simple electronics that dont belong in /ohm/    this meets that definition my hot plate on the lowest setting when the kitchen is chilly will burn my sardines if i dont stand there and tend to them which is hard to do when the party is raging in the other room    so this circuit maintains the set temperature no matter what the ambient is that grey blob over at the right is an lm35 temperature sensor coated with jb weld epoxy and it gets placed down in the pan with the sardines or whatever the circuit is a simple lm339 comparator with hysteresis that drives the solid state relay which is rated at 25 amps and easily handles the hot plate 8 amps might need some heat sinkage when summer rolls around but it doesnt even get warm now the tiny pot on the board can adjust the temperature from about 120 f up to about 170 f i think the range was chosen so i can keep the food warm without actually cooking it
  simple electronics that dont belong in /ohm/  id say theres nothing about this post that doesnt belong on /ohm a temperature controlled stove would be a great thing to have though for boiling water i think the only proper feedback you could use would be the rate of steam production since the boiling point will shift as a function of pressure
  though for boiling water i think the only proper feedback you could use would be the rate of steam production since the boiling point will shift as a function of pressure    oh fuck thermo     i always hated thermo
  best way i can see is to have a lid with a flowsensor on it or just an internal and external pressure transducer since p is proportional to v but that does require a lid methods with something that sits in the pot would not only be dependant on the fractional area its taking up but also the presence of a foreign body in the water could cause preferential nucleation that would be a function of both the probes material and of that of the pot so using a lid seems to be the best method    so how about selling pots with a thermocouple in the base and a flowsensor across a hole in the lid youd plug these into your hob or hotplate or into a small adapter you plug into an existing hob or hotplate and it would regulate the temperature/boiling rate perfectly if you knew what you were doing you could even have it communicate via passive nfc and so require no wires just a coil in the base of the pot but whether you could get it to work for an induction hob would be tricky since the wires of the thermocouple and sensors would be antennas for all that ac
    if you were mocking me this would be gold    but i think you are serious and on the level and i am ashame
  i mean no insult perhaps the reference to fluid dynamics was a bit of bragging but i only learnt that from a single physics experiment about calculating the critical velocity and viscosity of water    if the electrical analogy will work a pipe has a constant resistance and by measuring the voltage pressure at either end of it you can figure out the current flow rate via ohms law in the pot lid the vent hole would be the resistor im thinking around 1cm in diameter too small and the flow will become chaotic and the small pressure difference between the inside and outside of the pot divided by an experimentally defined flow resistance will yield the flow rate    the reference to a small adapter you plug into an existing hob or hotplate was basically to something like what youd already built in 
  this looks awesome
this is being sold in my area in a local online auction it is an athol model 724 4 inch vise its got some surface rust but still moves freely and the jaws are in good shape how high should i go without spending too much i cant use past ebay sales as the shipping on these things throws the prices out of whack does anyone have a ballpark
about 350
about 35
about 35
  about 3500
  about 350
  about 035
  35 nanocents
  whats it worth to you how uch is the shipping  what is the average retail price of a similar vise for sale at your local tool store    when im comparing costs for things like this i just roll the cost of shipping into overall price how much is it going to cost you shipping included  if shipping is like 100 then i wouldnt pay mor than 50 for the vise itself    max price total with shipping included 150
arent these like 50 brand new i have a whole fucking box full my old man bought from a garage sale all in working condition lmao
depends on how much you want it athol was made by starrett and were really good vices there are collectors who get wet for these things theres a thread here on vices post it in there id say its worth at least 100 if in useable condition
  4 inch vise    like 50    its an average size bench vise older so a little heftier and overbuilt
get a post vice and never look back
this unjacketed wire is ground right      i fucked up thought i took a photo of the other side but guess not unjacketed wire isnt pictured     pic is only semi related that switch went bad so i pulled another switch that leads to an outdoor outlet i dont use which is next to the switch for the hallway lights     cut the exposed hot wires from the outdoor outlet switch and covered in electrical tape but still have a loose wire i cant completely cut back but i assume its just the ground and should be fine to leave loose in the box as long as it isnt touching the hot wires on the other switch     am i gonna burn my house down when i flip the breaker back on     should i twist the two grounds together rather than leaving the one disconnected
  if you have two grounds in the receptacle youll probably want to twist them together there is 50/50 chance youll burn your house down regardless
  this unjacketed wire is ground right  yes    fold/cut/cap it back anyway since it will short to the live wires if it touches them
twisted grounds together but first i grabbed my calipers and measured the diameter because its stiff as fuck which struck me as a little weird     125in    why the hell are all of my wires solid 8awg isnt that usually reserved for the dryer/ hw heater circuits
  makes a new thread  holy fuck you stupid idiot this isnt that hard figure out which wire is which and follow the fucking wiring diagrams are you a minority or slow
  i pulled another switch  theyre about a dollar

what the hell why didnt i know autodesk makes software for 3d printing    
why dont they make a lathe spindle that can use er collets
  because you can just put it in the chuck jaws and be better off
  they probably do
    drills endmills what exactly could you use a collet for that you cant use in chuck jaws
  why dont they make a lathe spindle that can use er collets    the spindle probably has a morse taper    so you buy a mter collet chuck
  and a drawbar to hold the mt in place yes
i think i have found the perfect insert for my mini lathe cnc application    60 degree triangle with sharp corners and extremely positive rake coated carbide    can be used for threading because of sharp point turning because of positive rake and is a 1/4 inscribed circle insert so its small and cheap    now if only the info label was still on the pack
  sharp corners and extremely positive rake  measure the angles and churn thru the possibilities on ebay    t 2
are blue chips bad
  its tp something something    11 degree relief  
  no they are good it means they are taking the heat with the chip    unless they are turning blue before breaking off they should come off golden and then turn blue after sitting for a second or two
  
  
  but the usual collet chuck devices for lathes are either throughbore shafts to pull the collet into the chuck or mounted via the spindle nose attachment method threaded on or camlock d

damn grimsmo is getting good at macro stuff    he has apparently made a probing routine that will let a pallet loader decide which program to run by screwing a set screw into the correct hole to select the program nice and lazy    
  oh and they actually have a 1/64 radius on the end so technically not quite adequate for threads smaller than 3/816
  can you post inserts code here i cant access this site my local fablab have small proxxon lathe but only hss/brazed cutters i am in search of small inserts for it but code system for inserts is quite confusing for me
  depends on what youre doing

  thanks anon
scraping metal for flatness 
  i guess because er collets are not really made for holding stock as they can only hold parts at least about 2/3 as long as the collet also they cant really hold square or hex stock maybe they are just too young and c or w collets already filled out the role
  i dont think those limitations are true    they do make giant collets that shrink evenly front and back for industrial use though    
how do i get tiny metal splinters out of my hands
i graduated college with a bad degree and want a job with dependable income  how do i become a machinist  should i be one whats it like
  calipers work in a pinch i usually use a fresh xacto blade or pointy knife and scrape it off a little bit enough for tweezers      local tradeschool 2ish year course in machining and cnc programming from there find local machine shops at first youll be doing mostly bitchwork for 15/h to 18/h like scooping out putrid gunk from old coolant tanks or being a button pusher operator and youll learn a lot youll do some setups where you are handed a program youll put together cutting tools do work offset zeros and tool heights make sure the program runs properly and from there you start making 20/h you might do stuff like cutting soft jaws or manual machining for odd jobs here and there if youre lucky and dont crash often youll get more experience doing setups that are more complex making 24 to 26/h or so you might be able to get into programming with whatever cadcam software the shop uses at that point youll have experience enough to handle your own shit youll likely be given caded out parts to cam so youll do all your toolpaths fixturing tooling and shit from start to finish depending on the size of the shop smaller shops sometimes have the one guy doing everything larger shops have the programmer the setup machinist and the operator or something like that big shops have a few programmers a couple setup machinists and a bucket of operators    pay depends on shop and local economy its often hard to explain what you can do because people get their terms mixed up    machine operator  monkey button pusher put parts in push button take part out  setup operator  posttradeschool machinist that has machining experience and can tell if something is wrong like too aggressive cut or whatever can cut metal can set up a cnc for a job  programmer  usually more desk job doing cadcam mostly cam    having programming skills and machining skills is best with experience 30/h is pretty common
    if you can program this sort of shit you can easily make the big bucks probably over 90k/year or something but im not sure        i mean just look at all the tiny optimizations the drill at 543 drills through one side of the part wall rapids through the empty section then drills through the other side beautiful just that minuscule detail shows you the difference between a lazy and/or beginner programmer and one thats had lots of experience and is fucking good at his job    ive watched this video many times it still amazes and educates me
  setup operator  setup machinist    machinist  general term for manual work so if you can setup a cnc and work simple programs by yourself you can be a manual machinist and setup cnc machinist its just annoying when you have a bunch of experience can setup cnc machines cadcam your own parts and programs do parts from a to z and then some hr guy wants to give you 14/h because youre just a machine operator right    yeah sure go hire some kid and then wonder why you get crashes every other day that break hundreds of dollars of tools ruin expensive shit damage the machine just because cnc is so simple just press button xd
  when you say program you mean on the controller or with cad/cam
  usually it means cadcam but knowing a few canned cycles on the controller dont hurt    i usually whip something up with mastercam or even just type up a program gcode is pretty simple depending on the operation it can actually be simpler just to type it out by hand its not common but it has made my life simple on a few occasions
  ok pretty cool now if only i could find someone dumb enough to hire me      that video it would be soo nice to be able to insert pauses in the generated toolpath to do simple things like halfway through that 3d toolpath on the pocket op flip it over and dump all the chips out the chips from that insert cutter are probably so heavy a high pressure coolant blast wouldnt even sling them out so in the simulation area of fusion 360 add a tab or note or interrupt to the operation to retract the tool and flip it over to dump the chips out then return cutting for better tool life
  pauses to dump chips  its really a showoff video if they were really making parts it would be shooting coolant all over the place forever    generally an insert cutter doesnt mind a few chips hanging around too much as long as theyre not getting wedged between the part and the cutter its not exactly a big deal
  or you could add it in by hand but really the software should cover it
  i get that but there are a lot of instances it would be a handy feature this isnt the first time ive wanted something like that    for that matter manually fine tuning certain parts of the toolpath in the software without changing the configuration options and applying the parameters to the entire containment envelope generally split the toolpaths into smaller pieces to handle it but still
  sorry my dude can you look over those last two sentences a little bit maybe its just me being sleep deprived but i dont know what is going on there
  its just me dreaming again
  i meant more grammatically i guess if youre using dream logic to form both the idea and the sentence to describe it that fits its pretty deep    welp channel your inner shintaro kago and machine all the things
  like instead of editing the form and regenerating a modified toolpath use the simulation view to identify the part you want to change and implement a way to manually manipulate just that part of the toolpath without changing the form options    because the alternative is to change the form options and regenerate the entire thing normally you split the generation up by containing the toolpath to certain areas then you can do the fine tuning by changing the form options    pic related toolpath containment
  not sure why modifying and regenerating the whole toolpath is that much of an issue in mastercam for a setup like your parts id program it once and then use toolpath transform with a subprogram in incremental even with a shitton of 3d toolpath you only really have a single program with a subprogram for one parts worth of toolpath then you just offset its start point to the next location and run the same sub    you can chuck in a special retract movement or something like that in between various toolpaths if you really need chip evacuation movements or something for some reason you can literally machine a thousand parts next to each other that each require complicated ballnose programming but have the program actually be a short little thing that just calls up a sub a bunch of times    if you need to mess with that rectract/chip evacuation movement it wont mess with all your other toolpaths or require regeneration of the 3d ballnose work so your 8 year old thinkpad doesnt die every time you change a thing because thats literally the only thing that would care about regenerating a toolpath a few times    maybe the terminology between fusion and mastercam are different and its confusing me in mastercam you use toolpath containment to prevent a toolpath usually a complicated 3d or adaptive one from machining something you dont want to machine never used fusion so im not sure what its doing or how different the terminology is
  the issue with regenerating a toolpath is that the options you changed to modify one single part of the toolpath now apply the rest of it so you have to divide it into sections its just a workflow improvement not a magic wand    how does this subprogram thing work
  the issue with regenerating a toolpath is that the options you changed to modify one single part of the toolpath now apply the rest of it so you have to divide it into sections  ah i see mastercam tends to have so many fucking options that if you cant find one to modify one single part without changing everything else youre not looking hard enough mastercam has a function to manually edit sections of a toolpath but ive never had to use it    subprograms  basically your program looks like this if you have a work offset for every part      o0100  g90 g0 g54i p1 x0 y0 machine goes to first part  m98 p0001 machine goes to subprogram  g90 g0 g54i p2 x0 y0 machine goes to second part  m98 p0001 machine goes to subprogram  g90 g0 g54i p3 x0 y0 machine goes to third part  m98 p0001 machine goes to subprogram  m30 end of program    o0001 subprogram  g91 incremental mode  toolpath  /toolpath  m99 end of sub return to main program      if your parts are a specific distance from each other and dont need an individual work offset you can do this      o0100  g90 g0 g54 x0 y0  g91  m98 p0001  x1  m98 p0001  x1  m98 p0001  m30    o0001  toolpath  /toolpath  m99      same idea as first program but instead of having each part in its own offset the parts are just offset from each other by 1 inch in x program stays in incremental after the first move so it just moves over to the next part and runs the sub and so on    im using this shit to run a 4 axis program that machines 16 parts with a lot of ballnose surfacing the whole program is 710 kilobytes running a single part alone is 680 kilobytes or something    it also tends to make restarts easy you can go to the tool you want to start from skip a few subs and start from where you left off if say a tool broke no sea of endless fucking code just a main program and like whatever amount of subs off doing their own thing 72 in my case but it really doesnt matter
  nice when i need to restart in a section of code i usually post process for that section onward and upload to the controller    this could make things a lot easier for me thanks
  nice when i need to restart in a section of code i usually post process for that section onward and upload to the controller  pain in the butt isnt it        but wait theres more    various controllers have different ways of doing this say with an l code or adding more digits to the sub call but you can do shit like    m98 p0001 l10    where you can call the sub 10 times in this case you can also nest subs you put a sub in a sub to do various things you can do that for stuff like rotating a part you can have sub 1 level run the first toolpath enter sub level 2 where its just reading a code that rotates things 180 degrees where it reads sub level 1 upside down then exits the lot and starts over again ten times shifting incrementally with other codes in the m98 line again controllers some would do like m98 p00010010 x1 or using the l word or whatever check your manuals    nobody really does this anymore as modern controllers and computers dont give a shit if the program is 15 megabytes thats why we have multicore multithreaded cpus screaming at over 4ghz with flash drives you couldnt fill with code if you tried    still it has some use just for ease of tinkering and restarting or whatnot just be careful when switching from incremental to absolute and stuff restart at the wrong spot and you can easily crash
  okay well have a good sunday tired now
  me too good night
i have a very limited budget and want to measure bore sizes hobby shop from 6 to 20 maybe rarely up to 40mm which is the best option to go to telescoping gauges inside micrometer internal micrometer or dial bore gauge maybe some homebrew niggerrig with a test indicator i have a quite reliable digital caliper but i fucking hate to use it on inside features and the general feeling of using it is garbage i would like to have about 001mm repeatability is the chinese stuff usable or total pos i have a chinese micrometer which is absolutely fine to use is it comparable to that
  telescoping  01 mic  12 mic
  i own a set of 10 chink telescoping gauges the ones that come in a blue plastic holder theyre made of somewhat thin metal but otherwise probably function as intended at least i didnt notice any glaring issues
  thank you for the info i realised another problem may be that my bores are sometimes quite shallow can you measure at around 1 to 15d of depth with them
  they all have the same depth limitation which is about 68mm i think
  can you measure at around 1 to 15d of depth with them    inside spring calipers and a micrometer will work fine
how do diy cnc lathes even work if the cam software cannot know where and how youre bolding the insert
  you bolt/measure the insert so it matches up with the numbers you gave to cam
  you tell it where and how youre holding the insert    if you dont it wont know i think unless they have a turret its a lot more setup you put the tools on the crossslide and touch them off on a gauge pin or something    gang tooling 
  you should have some sort of zero reference to touch the tip off
which poverty cad is closest to autocad    also is there a non finger stealing way to apply emery paper directly to a piece in a still spinning lathe
  fusion360 and yes there are plenty of safe techniques mostly boils down to holding the ends of the emery so if it grabs it just slips out of your fingers put space between your fingers and the part but also space between both of your hands        not a bad vid
  also is there a non finger stealing way to apply emery paper directly to a piece in a still spinning lathe    use long strips  pay attention to where your hands and the strip is  move the saddle/cross slide out of the way  remove the toolpost if that makes you feel better  learn to automatically let go if you feel resistance
how would you guys feel if i used a high speed steel threading tool to make a v shape into my piece
  fine but watch out for the tip of the threading tool to break     so i have a problem that might be more suited to /g/ or some other board i have a db25 connector for sending gcode on my lathe and i dont know of any way to properly get the signal from my computer to the lathe has anyone used a i/o card db9 pci expansion slot and had any results
  db9 connectors are usually used for the motor connectors right    
  4wires for steppers dont know how many wires for servos or steppers with encoders  db9 can handle 9 wires
  db9 connectors are usually used for the motor connectors right  no db25 is what is used to send gcode back and forth to the machine db9 is just something i found easier to buy because its also adaptable to db25
  oh sorry i thought you typed db9    yeah the uc something or another parallel to usb    cncdrive uc100 perhaps
  thats called a form tool and will work fine with light feed normally will chatter because of so much contact area            the emi shielded genuine uc100 this guy is shilling he sells here 
    thisll support industrial cnc and not just hobby stuff
  i have no idea but i assume so its not like its sending more signals than a servo drive or stepper with encoder system the power going to the motors is from the drivers just low voltage signals from the pc going through it    they sell cheap knockoffs on amazon too     but you might actually encounter some emi problems
  emi problems  yeah i could see that maybe being a problem round so much electricity but i think im going to take a chance on that knockoff because it names my controller as supported and the seller seems to be pretty responsive heres to hoping     also thanks for the suggestion anons
  that might seem like the way to go until youre ballsdeep in a 5 hour long program and you turn the radio on which fucks it up
  all i need is a quick transfer from my laptop to the machine memory no dnc required
  might be ok then
a local fab shop is looking for an apprentice machinist what could i add to my resume and keep in mind for the interview to beat out the youngins i dont have any prior experience but im willing to learn
  firm handshake and a smile     find common ground and then get the guy to like you if woman then flirt a bit be the guy people want to like if you cant fake it until you make it
  also    look the part be the part motherfucker
  try to get summer job at machine shop  walk in give foreman my resume and a handshake  call back a week later  sorry were not hiring right now  find out a classmate got hired like a month later
  i had a similar experience then i decided to say fuck it and apply at the big time aerospace facility up north of me and they took me despite my short resume    mind you i had a degree in mtt and about six months of general industrial experience already i also overdressed for the interview    on a side note someone explain the logic in carburizing a thing and then having me cut allthe way through any case hardening that may have developed i understand stress relief but i dont understand the need to cut parts when theyre sitting at around 60 hrc with a case depth of 030035 of which said case is 100 gone by the time my operation is done with
  when i used to cut a lot of 4140 and other 41xx series steel the problem with that is that you would get massive fluctuations in tolerance after the hardening process which would render the part unusable so its easier to just have it treated and then machine it out     its gay because it kills tool life but i could never find anyone who did it differently
over thanksgiving someone mentioned a welding shop was having a lot of trouble being a second class customer to a large machine shop how am i supposed to explain to them my cousins husband heard of him and i thought i would ask around for work
  word on the street is your shop needs help  nani  anon enters strikes a pose and shifts his toothpick around in his mouth
  oh well i guess i will stumble over it
  cousins husband already talked to him not needing any work right at this moment
  mmmm cbn
what are the cheapest carbide inserts i can buy that wont break in 5 minutes
  probably the round ones
  i mean what company makes them i need ccmt 2151 but everywhere i look is either chinese or wants me to buy 10 of them at once for 100
  ebay
  i mean theres sandvik iscar etc but are there any good budget options or are my only choices paying out the ass or taking my chances with china
  not that i know of    saw someone using these on youtube a few months ago they are made in china and marked mitsubishi        not the right size for you but look around
  just buy the pack for 100 chink shit is awful and no one sells inserts individually
  his video about almost losing everything in the recession is pretty damn good teaches you that ya gotta diversify
ok so im thinking about using this setup to try to make a part i have a fixture thats basically an aluminum tube about 6 across and 10 long with 8 set screws spaced around it i want to put my steel part thats 2 feet long and 125 in diameter inside it with the set screws holding it in place then i put the fixture in my lathe chuck and adjust the set screws for runout about 2 of my part would be sticking out from the end of the fixture i need to turn about 3/16 off the diameter and thread it plus drill out the through hole slightly larger for about 3 inches do you think this would be rigid enough for cnc i only need to run it once the set screws have brass pads on the ends
  my shitty drawing
  i think he must have skipped the being poor while having a shop step all uphill for him for a long while apparently
  making a cats head    use thick wall tubing and set screws dont want spinning shit that will catch on stuff    didnt see that you were already using set screws     are you going to have a steady rest holding one end of it    its hard to tell but you might run into problems with the material between chuck jaw and setscrew twisting if you dont make it out of steel    just go slow and it will probably be fine dont spin anything long and skinny it will bend at high rpm and turn into a wicked flail of death that kills you or the machine
  not sure how far you have the 2 foot part stuck into the 10 inch cats head    its just so hard to decipher what youre talking about for some reason
i know you guys probably see this question a bunch but im having a hard time finding machine shops near me    is there a registry of machine shops in utah    i just want to cut some chips man
  most of my part will be in the headstock only about 2 inches i actually need to cut will be sticking out of the fixture      will it be ok if i limit it to 400500 rpm ive seen people use this for much shorter parts but i dont know if it will work with a long one someone said it would but i dont think he ever actually did it himself
  if you can put a sleeve in the spindle bore to keep it from smacking around in there
  will it whip around that much if its not going to stay straight it kind of defeats the purpose of using the fixture to indicate it in
  google
ordered some ballscrews from automation technologies inc for my g0602 cnc conversion    they are rolled not ground unhardened and the machining on the ends leaves a bit to be desired sharp edges etc pretty sure they botched the 3/8 thread on the end too    that said they do look like ballscrews and dont have any noticeable backlash might last a year or so of use if you keep them clean speaking of which they come with dirt embedded into the ball grooves of the screws probably from the rolling process it is hard to clean out    for 130 for two ballscrews with ballnut ehhh i will say the larger ballscrew looks slightly not much nicer than the smaller one
  once you get the grooves clean they are super low friction and when held upright by the ballnut will unscrew themselves
    special care should probably be taken when mounting these as i seriously doubt the ballnut flanges are perfectly perpendicular to the axis of motion    might use some machine epoxy if its cheap or grind it slightly closer myself so it isnt tweaking the shaft and inducing drag when mounted
  oh what up i tested out the basic netfabb a few years ago in conjunction with a form 1 i really found it to be inventors 3d printing environment with a few extra bells and whistles that would let a newbie do nice curves without having to deal with kind of tricky stuff like splines and lofts netfabb ultimate is a whole different beast though i liken it to the difference between a base v6 mustang and a rousch special
  im in the process of finding a new shop for my business and i feel your pain there really is no such thing as yelp for machine shops just start working google maps or look at big shops in the rust belt we often send stuff from here in nc to a place in northern il
  small shops are where its at bud less overhead and lower turn around sometimes better quality too   i used to contract overflow from a large aerospace shop and usually we had much better quality and were able to charge much less for our jobs than they were     hell id plug my own bidness if i werent so busy atm
  if the orders are small enough for a one man operation i would be happy to oblige here in southern il
i want to put an 1000 aluminum insert in a hardened steel gear how much should i undersize the steel bore i need to put splines in it  dont have a broach and i dont think my die grinder bits will live thru 4x per gear i can heat it up with a torch afterwards for shrink fit if necessary
tfw was talking with my drafting teacher about an internship that i want to do and it turns out he knows a bunch of people in the program and is having the coordinator call me tomorrow morning about it    holy fuck i could be making 16 bucks an hour have most of my classes paid for and get medical benefits i cant believe it this could change my life     like i cant believe what an opportunity this is especially since the ability to learn from people who are currently working is such a huge opportunity i really fucking hope i get this job because suddenly my life could change overnight and become 100 better     pray for me boys and pray to the machine gods i need this bad i need to move out of my parents house before i kill myself because i cant take the constant arguing and belittling that my dad does every single day
  uh why aluminum and steel you know them together cause steel to rust like crazy just use brass or something     also check the machinery handbook for fitment stuff
i cannot find enough time at work to machine all of the personal project things i want to make so i want to get mini hobbyist tier machines for home use i know they are shit compared to the real deal but im not about to stick a monarch or bridgeport in my apartment suite lmao    where should i look to find a small hobbyist tier milling machine pantograph mill and lathe  i just want something small to fit in my apartment balcony weird building i have a large balcony with very solid floor covered entirely by upper floor and tons of floor space    in west coast canada if that helps
  check out local makerspaces before buying minishits theres no way i can get a 3 bore 7hp lathe in my apartment either but a ten minute drive and 24/7 access is pretty dope for a few bucks a month
  the nearest one is an hour away from me fuck that shit  i dont need the mini machines to have amazing tolerances just functional enough to save me from spending a copious amount of time using hand tools ive already done too much of that in my early apprenticeship
  damn    mini machines are pretty shit its less about tolerance and more about everything literally everything rigidity power bed ways being butter soft nothing is straight or square making gibs tight make them bind up as the ways every way like cross slide or compound slide arent cut straight so theyre loose on one end of the travel and too tight on the other its about the multiple seconds of delay between input and result when turning it on or changing speed or whatever its about shitty fucking gears requiring pain in the dick changing for any kind of feed or threading operation its about the tailstock being cut so wrong i cant even type it id have to make an ms paint    i could go on but literally run away from any fucking piece of shit 7 fucking mini metal lathe    find a smaller south bend theyre reasonably small and not incomprehensibly shitty
  what about a mini mill  what about a somewhat okay drill press with a 2 axis sliding milling vise  mind you im intending on exclusively using small endmills and drill bits and cutting modest amounts of material per pass not fuckin sendin er    i wouldnt think of doing this at work but honestly i dont think i need anything amazing for making miniature parts with barely a need for precise tolerances here and there
  any milling is going to be hard on a drill press a small drill press can hog a surprising amount when doing actual drilling but even a pretty sturdy mill will have issues they do make drillmills that are a little better in light milling but its still meh at best    if youre doing small stuff a watchmaker milling machine might work out theyre generally more expensive but actually built well with quality materials and you wont be pulling your hair out    you can always stick an endmill in the chuck and bolt a two axis vise in the south bend lathe itll be a lot better than a drill press shoehorned into milling duty
  mill will have issues  sturdy drill press used for milling will have issues    fucking that sentence up means its bedtime night
  i forgot to mention that i dont want to spend more than 500 syrupbux on it    lol
  buy used and fix it up    cant stop you from burning your money but hey i think ive done my part in warning you about the complete garbage mill and lathe insults to the machine spirit failed fucking abortions they call tools
  buying used machinery will be cheaper but beware more expensive machinery is heavier and has heftier power requirements    the precision matthews mini machines have slightly better castings than the other chinese stuff        
  making money with mini machines is incredibly hard unless they are taken apart gone through with an experienced eye and a surface plate and then cncd    but if you dont mind taking forever they are usually workable except when you want to turn something heavy offcenter or large diameter
  
where is the guy with his old small lathe way better than the chinese stuff on the market
  i got one needs work   more importantly i need heat in the garage
  damn that thing is still sexy    install a wood stove or something hell even propane bottles and a burner would work if you can vent the exhaust      propane is getting even cheaper like gas thanks to fracking no reason not to heat the shop anon
  one more winter and then i should be able to redo the work space half
how big of a deal is the endmill helix angle is a low helix tool completely unsuitable for aluminum
  hope you like picking meltedon aluminum off your bits every now and then
  bought that exact set and the one i really needed exploded on day one chinese quality
is anyone here a tool and die maker is it a decent career
  sounds like maintaining metal stamping machines which used to be a good job until china outsourcing depends on the pay i guess
  i know a couple but theyre both retired and havent done it in years isnt it mostly cnc now
  my dad was a tool and die maker he repaired the metal stamping machines and dies for making new dies they probably sent it out to a real shop    they do have a good line of surface grinders for sharpening the dies and the workers there are mostly using manual stuff still
neat vid on geometric threading heads  
      added to op  remember everyone that videos on the op can be voted and discarded so only quality content is posted  so far the only suggestion i got was removing the thread hymn for some chinese stuff
  how much would 5 axis cnc cost for a 40cm x 40cm x 25cm aluminium blisk
      guarantee this thing is at least 50k tho            and i dont know why this is 44k looks like a ripoff    
  5th axis is big money for anything
how does this look for a first cnc  facebook com/marketplace/item/356866315061310
  i hope this channel finds an old hobbing video  though its weird that theres videos of companies basically detailing their patents like theyre intending to be detailed commercials for their potential customers or maybe an instructional video fro their workers
  i wouldnt add that video because tapping heads like that are never used anymore i would say this old tonys video on threading and making a tap is probably the best explanation ive seen barring mrpete
  looks meh i wouldnt give more than 1500 for it if it worked perfectly
  datron is probably 50k starting
  the old electronics are a massive liability but it might be a wonderful machine as long as it isnt worn out and you can keep it running    if the electronics go who knows if you can find spare parts for it or get it fixed are any businesses making spare parts for that machine is the original company still in business and offering repair services    dripfeeding large programs to it will be quite a hassle i suspect if it is even possible i wouldnt buy an old cnc if you cant drip feed to it    i forget does it come with a tool changer as long as it is a proper cnc with ballscrews and isnt worn out you could probably do a lot with it but fighting the ancient electronics as you drip feed it will make it annoying to use
  dept of education in the olden days probably paid them for making these videos to train people who might want to work there
  looks like a converted knee mill or factory cnc knee mill so no tool changer may only be 2 axis tho
  oh shit it is a knee mill i think the bed type mills make for better conversions for some reason
  no enclosure either wherever it gets put is gonna be covered in chips within 3 yard diameter
  you sure those are never used what are actually used for high production od thread cutting starrett factory among others uses those still
my new coolant nozzle is pretty sweet
  ahh sweet i have some right angle ones myself    i wonder how a few of those mounted at an angle to the tool for milling would compare to one of those biscuit style coolant rings
  coolant rings  i only just found out about those and im thinking of getting one for my mill it isnt a enclosed machine so i cant go too crazy trying to use coolant to blast chips out of pockets anyway
  insert threading tools its so much easier to just program a threading op and then program another than it is to redo one of those heads every single program change you want high production look into videos of multispindle automatic lathes those things are as high production as it gets today
  right like swapping out thread chasers on a threading head is worse than swapping out inserts    they dont all need manually reset you know and the thread chasers dont want to push the part offcenter one of the styles in the video you can even resharpen them until the hss is gone    i think a modern one would work fine especially for slender parts
  depends on your task my pro machinistbro made and makes gobs of money with his two bridgeport eztraks those bps still sell high because they are insanely versatile he has other manual and cnc machines too of course his specialty is custom machine building and repair machining along with small parts runs     chips are easy to sweep up and not having an enclosure makes it practical to machine oversize parts i found him usb to floppy header adapters cheap on ebay but otherwise the hardware is stock
  tangent type chasers
  setup being easier does not make for high production gains for most shops the easier setup would indeed be worth it
  okay then please find me a machine shop that isnt a mom and pop shop that uses threading heads for everything single point or multipoint threading is used for everything stop living in the past anon      easier setup and replacement is threading inserts and insert holders you put a holder on the lathe set your offsets and go need to change the inserts or index them a screw turn and your done
  threading heads are specific for high production shit anon there is advantage to them there
sometimes when im threading it goes ok at first but then i get a shitty looking pass and when i check my threads with an optical comparator i have w roots instead of vs what causes it to shift like that and how do i prevent it i leave the half nut engaged and run the spindle in reverse off the part to get back to the start
  did the work spin in the chuck did something shift or rotate like the bolts clamping down the compound
  yikes
  no kidding its a fucking mini mill with 2 more axis controllers  motors    
  like the bolts clamping down the compound  the gibs
  no the things you loosen to rotate the compound
  no i didnt notice anything shift i was going straight in which i know you arent supposed to do so the only thing i can think of is that the compound backed out a little
  compound should be locked in place there is usually a screw on the side you turn to lock/unlock it    really though just use the damn compound you could also be seeing backlash in the leadscrewhalfnut sliding the carriage forward while cutting too
  im tool and die its like machinist but instead of being production you are assisting production its doing pm maintence repair troubleshooting sharpening punches and the like on metal stamping dies i personally do mostly injection molding which is pm such as cleaing and greasing laser welding and sink edm troubleshooting and repair lots of grinding its pretty chill
  backlash
  can you post me a picture of a newer one in use
  is the distance you feed the compound just thread depth / sin 59 i get confused because the thread depth on one side should be tan 60 / 2  pitch but that always ends up being a different number than if i just subtract the minor diamater in the machinist handbook from the major diameter and divide by 2      in the carriage i was trying to give it enough distance between reversing directions and the start of my threads thinking it would get taken up
  reason the backlash would still be a problem is it is cutting on both sides of the v hence why the suggestions to use the compound
  ohhh    did you change speed if it is manual speed control like gear change speed control then dont change the speed while threading
ive run events and want to make a custom set up of co2 jets for the stage how would i go about it
    start with a cryogenic solenoid valve you dont want a cheap valve freezing in the on position   source three minutes on google
  all the posts are about premade one and diy handheld ones whereas i want diy dmx controlled ones
  why make instead of buy isnt liability an issue
  let me know next time you have a shit so someone can wipe your asshole for you too
      how about you do some research and figure out how to do it why come here and ask other people to figure it out for you i dont know if you knew this but /diy/ is short for do it yourself not do if for me for free
  m8 youre an absolute penis op is asking for help so he can /diy/ it not sure if youve seen the sticky welcome to /diy/ a place to    post and discuss /diy/ projects ask questions regarding /diy/ topics and exchange ideas and techniques   would seem op came to the right place after all if you dont have anything constructive to add then dont post if its a shit thread it will die on its own
  /diy  hey guys i want to do a thing  reeeeeeeeeeeee    fuck you hateful faggots    log on /diy    see angry neckbeards larping about building anything and reeeing at op    log off    op i would just buy some electronic horn switches from a semi maybe something else if its over 100psi    i dont fucking know but ill go lool and come back
do these numbers look legit if they are does anyone want their edf performance predicted just gimme the specs

  there is another hydropnic thread already post there
nigga what the fuck is that diagram just get rid of the collector and out the reservoir there
  i have a better idea  go fuck yourself  hows that
  have you considered reclaiming your gray water if you do you might have to think about microbes and shit oh and a boa constrictor wont undo a clog use drano
  using excel for drawing
  is your electric dirt cheap  venting and air exchanges is important   pest control because nature always finds a way
whats the least expensive house you could build yourself that would be legal in the usa could you build something legitimate for 20000 this isnt including the land cost etc
  from scratch  are you including the workforce costs too or not  what kind of materials do you expect to use  size of the house  general area where it will be built 
  a 13x20 could be framed up for 4k plus 1k for a slab  diy electrical / 1k  plumbing maybe another k or 2  some land is as cheap as 1k an acre    i really wish i went full ted kaczynski in my early 20s instead of getting a job and wife and kid
  if i build it by myself and we assume that the county allows a 1000sqft home materials would be the economical choices no exotic woods or ostentatious designing a single 3/4 bathroom single floor no basement in say rural new hampshire like timber land undeveloped which i would landscape myself i just want the house cost the land is easy    its my plan im 23
another anon mentioned stickbuilt / lumber framing thats very cheap  but do consider steel kit buildings those are also very cheap especially when they go on sale  youd put down a concrete pad assemble the kit insulate frame rooms plumb and wire to your specs  theyre not pretty but they are quite inexpensive long lasting and functional good value which is why so many businesses use them for storage and field offices    if you dont have a significant other in your life consider just buying a cheap used rv and living in that until you build or assemble your dream home
 continued  wanted to add to this  i actually bought a quarter section and my plan right now is to just put my rv on it with a composting toilet or maybe incinerating toilet  then in a few years once i have some real money put a steel building on it
    a used camper welded onto concrete blocks sunk into the dirt counts as a house    you need to be more specific state site location desired sqf and amenities are all major factors
  
  people live in cars and sheds and in tents if youre on your own property and out of sight no govt is going to care until you try and sell it and the person needs a loan    i often dream of this when im at work getting a few acres to hunt and slowly building a cozy vacation property i think in order id  build a shedor maybe smokehouse which would act as temporary housing  build a nice brick outhouse  build cabin  the only thing i havent figured out is plumbing and bathing i could do without electricity eventually id need water and to bathe
  you could pull it off for 10k for a 14x20 or so buy a cuckshead and finish the inside there are 0 coding and zoning laqs in most flyover land
  well not fulp ted right youd be getting assraped instead of have a wife and kid
  if you cant get well water rainwater collection into a cistern is one route but you will have to concern yourself with debris dust and maybe birdshit on your collection area one way to deal with that is to let the first bit of rainfall wash off the collector then divert the output to a cistern  to make it drinkable youll need a still or a ro filter good enough to filter out bacteria and viruses and shit  but you can do everything else shower wash dishes clothes with regular filtered rainwater
  this couple actually document costs of their cucksh er tiny house  they bought the land and built the house you could probably learn some things from them  
  aframe is stupid simple a single person could build one
  120 sqft is less than my damn rv
  and it leaves open the possibility of a future pet giraffe
  reminder most problems arise from neighbors wanting to play cops reporting you
  someone shouldve told them that you can just buy a shed from lowes instead of building it from scratch  nah but seriously though 120sqft cant be bothered to read their website but they probably sank a shit ton of money and time into that fucking thing people who do this need to be put down
  people who do this need to be put down  any particular reason why
research into cob houses
  you could probably get a lightly used park model rv which is like a cross between a big travel trailer and a trailer house assuming youre talking about buying a piece of land in the middle of nowhere the closer you get to a city the more strict things become in the city not a chance nimbys will fuck you before you even start
theres an endless supply of junker 50s trailers that can be had for free or less
  yeah because theyre a downgrade from a shed at that point theyre not built to last like a normal house chances are the thing will snap in half when you go to move it
  thats not true most counties require 1000sqft minimum you cant buy an acre in the middle of arkansas and put a tiny house on it
  try a less cucked state or province then most places will let you live in a cardboard box as long as youre far enough from the city
  i saw a project in mexico where designers built a house out of clay and used soda bottles  there is also the new trend of building houses out of old shipping containers
  no they wont what the fuck are you talking about unless you live in the middle of nowhere uninhabitable like 200/acre useless land you cant do this
  so much for that american freedom no wonder why all the good bushmen come from canada
  you cant buy an acre in the middle of arkansas and put a tiny house on it    almost everyone staying in the middle of arkansas make due with a 3x6 plot  pinecrest memorial cemetary  in almost any unincorporated area within the state where land is for sale by the acre you can live in any size/type of dwelling/protection you chose and can afford  my daughter lived in a yurt for two years before getting sick of her husbands craziness and leaving him
  op if you build a tiny house as a trailer then you dont have to have building permits inspections or anything else you do what you want the worst youd have to do is get it licensed so you can move it on public roads
earth bag home earth ship use shipping containers
  youd still have to rent some rv space or get the land you buy zoned as rv space or something
  20000    you can do it for 10000 if you do all the work yourself pier and post foundation a1 siding and cheapo finishes foundation is probably the expensive part i know because i built 700 sqft houses pic related
the big problem is that the minimum sqft requirement will usually push it past like 20000 in materials zoning is what makes it expensive and annoying thanks to nimbys if you could d whatever you want everyone would own few acres and live in a 50000 prefabricated brand new tiny house and be free from this shit but the government doesnt want you to be free if you tried building some 300sqft home they would legally fuck you in the ass
  how is that legal i bet that property has a real house on it already and those are considered like caregiver homes so its allowed
  tiny homes are terribly inefficient in terms of /sqft most sqft minimums are within the 700900 sqft range only tract housing land and retirement communities have retarded 1600 requirements
  its all zoning/state dependent if you take the time to go through the building code the bare minimum for most places is pretty fuckin low those mcmansion eye sores that fall apart in 10 years are actually built with midgrade materials the real cost of a house is in the land and the utility hook ups well/septic/power can run you 50k
  so you made one of those for 10000 and its 700sqft do they have plumbing and electricity is it empty inside like a shack or is it a real living space with a 3/4 bathroom and small kitchen area etc im assuming the answer is no but id be happy to be wrong
  so lemme back up we built those for 6k a pop that included all those exterior finishes you see drywall and a 40 amp main panel i estimated the other 4k for the bathroom finished flooring and kitchenette based on other cheapo jobs ive done     just fyi a crew of 4 could build one of those in a 2 days
  to expound 5080 of construction cost is labor and permitting the materials for the structure are literally the cheapest thing
  why doesnt everyone do this itd be like 15000 for land and your house
  generally land like that is 1 hours from the nearest city or town that means theres usually not a lot for work also keep in mind youll likely be stuck with shitty internet via satellite 4g or dsl if you even have a phone line on the land so sitting around gaming or downloading dragon porn is out of the question its viable as a vacation property but not as a primary living situation
  elon musk satellites will change that if you go the whole homestead permaculture route you dont need much money anyway
  because like i said it can be 50k for utilities meaning just water/sewer and power at that point you might as well spend the extra 1030k on a house thats going to last more than a generation
  what if you just dont do any of that tough and use a dry toilet and some offgrid water system and some inexpensive solar panels to charge a small laptop and phone and maybe a hot plate i think refrigerating food would be the only big worry
  ive slept in many summer camp cabins that consisted of less
  quarter section means you have 40 acres 
  quarter section means you have 40 acres   he has 160 acres  a section is 600 acres one mile by one mile
  40 acres 16 ha of land  a quarterquarter section
  trailer homes make more sense in every way but they arent trendy enough for the hipster and onions crowd
  most frogposters need to live close enough to their moms so she can bring them lunch every day    maybe you are the exception
  its not like building your own is going to be that much more expensive and its probably going to be better quality plus you get the satisfaction of doing it yourself why are you even here if you want to shit on people doing projects for themselves when they could just buy something someone else made thats the whole point of this board you know
what is the cheapest type of foundation that works for a house
  existing bedrock
  you can in alabama private land outside city limits the only restrictions are you must have a power dropand water and sanitation septic tank to epa spec beyond that cuckshed yurt old school bus ive even seen converted railroad passenger car used as a house
  whats the price range for trailer homes
  50k wtf  i can get septic put in for for 3 grand or so depending on the perk values water well runs around 4k for the hole plus lining and pump stuff powers a different thing depending how far into your property you want power
  powers a different thing depending how far into your property you want power  my driveway is 1/4 mile long  electric service was made available to me at no cost for installation  six utility poles and a transformer  i did my own water and gas lines  gas company looked at the lines before i covered them up  no one cares about water lines
pepe yep thats placenta
hey /diy/ i have a problem with a 240v nema 6 20 outlet im installing i ran both hots to a double breaker and grounded it when i measure voltage to either of the hots from the ground pin i get 120v when i measure from hot to hot i only get rougly 40v any suggestions on what to check would be appreciated
  what is a sine wave
  let me guess you put a tandem breaker in
indeed i did
  you put a tandem breaker in  then where is the 40v coming from  it should be 0v with a tandem
    did you make sure both hots are on different phases you cannot connect 2 120v on the same phase and expect to get 240  the 40v you probably getting feedback voltage because of your stupidity
  what is a sine wave  noun physics   a periodic oscillation as simple harmonic motion having the same geometric representation as a sine function   you could have looked that up yourself
  a tandem breaker should automatically be on opposite phase unless somebody fucked up the installation of the breaker box
  a tandem breaker should automatically be on opposite phase
    okay i was thinking dual was tandem  ill go take the dumbass walk of shame now    yeah that thing obviously will not power a 220240 circuit
  wow what a retard
  op needs a 15 or 20 amp like the 60 at the top of pic related  not one like either of the two outlined in yellow
    ftr im not op  im just a dipshit that thought i knew what something was which i obviously didnt
  thought i knew what something was which i obviously didnt  your electrics are fine just a terminology mishap  dont sweat it
    i want to know this too  bad connection maybe
  if youd gone to the hardware store for the part youd have come home with the correct one
op come in here to the breaker box  i want to explain something to you
    yes we have already established this is the case with op good job keeping up with the thready stupid mcfaggoty fagbert
      my best guess is that maybe the romex/wire is wrapped a little around other romex/wire in the wall or even in the panel possibly running with another circuit or something like that and he is reading induction think back to transformer theory we commonly call this phantom voltage kinda common desu especially in the commercial world where you have wire in pipe multiple circuits and easily wrapped up in the pulling process    in this case he literally has 2 wires of the same phase running the length of the circuit so its possible that the wires are literally inducing voltage onto one another meter cancels out the 120s of the same phase and gives out a reading of just the induced voltage    fun story time    dealing with 277v lighting circuits testing one at a time throughout the floor  turn on a section going through room by room  wtf why isnt this one turning on  get out the meter read 120v  mother fucker whos the idiot who wired 120v into the fucking 277v ballasts  search and search cant find it  shut off all the 120v breakers trying to narrow it down  shit still reads 120v  get the prints  realize that room was on the next circuit  go flip that breaker room turns on  only took me an hour     things like this are why people think electricians are retarded
my bro and a few of his other friends recently descided to get some ant farms and were wanting me to help build some formacariums ant habitats    ive been looking at autoclaved aerated concrete blocks to dremel by hand and get a feel for it before /diy my own    how important is it to autoclave the cement    a foam gun is easy as shit to make and the rest is just concrete and sand do i really have to build an autoclave / suicide device as well    having trouble finding reputable sources of blocks to carve also     how do i know its actually autoclaved and not some larping faggot using buzzwords    at any rate any tips or ideas are welcome weve considered selling a few to the ant collectors community and possibly doing a few giveaways here for feedback and fun
  the dust from the concrete will kiill insects its jagged on a microscopic level
bump for interest planning to eventually 3d print some formacariums myself after watching antscanada on jewtube    according to wikipedia  when the temperature reaches 190 celsius 374 fahrenheit and the pressure reaches 8 to 12 bar quartz sand reacts with calcium hydroxide to form calcium silicate hydrate which gives aac its high strength and other unique properties  
  shit well there shouldnt be any dyst if i paint with water and clay right
  dust
  welp i guess my smoker is kill ill be sure and live stream every fire so if and when i suicide myself you guys can watch    i guess they do make electronic valves running it from my cell phone shouldnt be hard just pressure and maybe humidity monitors and open/close for a steam pipe air valve and maybe a vent for pressure after i guess it wouldnt be terrible hard to build we are having trouble finding any near us would be super quick and easy to carve the concrete as it sets up and then autoclave it    just sucks i got every waking second of bullshit i have to do until after the holidays no time for fun
  do normal 100psi air compressors reach 12 bar
  usually you just clay out the patterns you want then plaster over it and wait until is cured
  174 psi is 12 bar
  dude whatever box you get just fill it with plain dirt from wherever you catch the ants or whatever type of substrate you prefer the whole point of these things is watching the ants build their own tunnels worked every time as a kid with no research or planning usually takes a few days before they figure out whats happening and get into it my 2c
  could ants dispose of a body
  it would take a very long time and youd still have to deal with bones professional bone people use flesh eating beetles and it still takes them several days to a couple weeks to full strip a decent sized animal carcass ants would take way longer
  why would it take so long
  gut in forest  put body in sleeping bag  throw in a few quarts of live bacteria yogurt  lime  bury deep
    because thats just a ridiculous amount of food for even multiple ant colonies
  well fuck
  around here we throw deer and cow skulls on ant hills    i would bet money not bone tho
  because thats just a ridiculous amount of food for even multiple ant colonies    right but its amazing what they can consume or store underground and maybe meat cant be stored but i had a suet block like picrelated that was moldy so i put it on the ground a day later there were hundreds of ants the tiny kind and about four days later it was gone    of course its possible that squirrels or possums helped out but it seemed to gradually shrink rather than disappear in chunks
  a day later there were hundreds of ants the tiny kind and about four days later it was gone    sureand a cake of suet is whatanywhere between maybe 051lb average human is 160/180ish even on the generous side assuming they go through a pound in 4 days youre looking at 640 days worth of ant food in your average human even if we assume that the 70 water content doesnt count youre still looking at over 5 months
  yeah but wouldnt they expand the colony in that time
hi i have some questions on things that i am not really familiar with my question may be broad but i do not know the accurate phrase for this so sorry in advance here goes how to build a computer not as in assembling the pc parts but things like a laptop game consoles smartphones dumbphones psp psvita nintendo switch etc like where do one start where to learn these things  why  i want to build a smartphone but with 12 buttons like the old nokia phones because i think touchscreen is a mess i want to learn on how to create one i want to create a handheld console too if that one is too hard because i hate that companies are trying to make this exclusive titles a thing and only allow programmers from america and japan to develop games for them and forcing the consumer to buy proprietary custom storage card please help me
  i do not know the accurate phrase for this so sorry in advance  youre already doomed if this didnt occur to you    
  know anything about computers and electronics    yes  should be good to go just plan engineer draw erase repeat till you get something    no  your fucked learn these two first
  arduino phone    
hi after hours of googling i have found what i needed to learn this topic is called embedded system development but my course computer science does not offer this kind of things and i am already on my final year project semester 
  see  
    read this book  learn how computer works  buy a microcontroller and programmer ideally not arduino try avrpicst etc get a development kit to start  read datasheet of your chip  start writing assembly work up to c  now learn electronics for 5 or 6 years  congratulations you are embedded  now figure out what you want to do go do it  mobile phone is black magic rf fuckery buy a gsm module or some shit read the datasheet how to interface it and go from there
i feel like with the new prevalence of socs fpgas and opensource hardware like arduino a selftaught hardware enthusiast will soon be able to do what ops talking about i mean whats actually missing services like osh park common screen connectors like dsi and pcb designers like fritzing

i am trying to sand down the orange peel texture from hammerite paint substitute armature powdercoating  what alternative abrasive material can i use  steelwool works but is smelly and dirty  cheapo household abrasive sponges leaves dark discoloration  sandpaper is too stiff and distresses the edges too fast
  steelwool works but is smelly and dirty    what the hell kind of wool are you using
  looks like this and breaks down fast
cutting compound and a da
  thanks will do
the hammertone hammerite contains a form of mica which is hard and abrasion resistant and allows for that type of finish  it is not orange peel    the only way to flat it is with sandpaper there is no other way   steel wool will only burnish it slightly but will not flat it    if your sandpaper is too stiff use the automotive kind and presoak in water
found this interest  
 is too stiff and distresses the edges too fast    it is the poor craftsman who blames his tools for his mistakes    then you are doing it wrong  all over the world people have been able to wet sand paint and top coats without burning through the edges  hint use 1000 or 2000 grit
  you might be on to something the only sandpaper i have is dry 60 grit
  what ever troll  nobody uses 60 grit for that application
  why
are the americans the only ones who build their houses with drywall and wood my underdeveloped country uses concrete instead     having concrete is a bitch though because i want to hide all my cables behind the wall but i would need to demolish it
  render and channels in walls my nigga
    why would you need to demolish your wall    can you not just use a grinder  chisel to cut a chase/channel into the wall run the cable in there and patch up the plaster
  wire mold and a bender
its takes less than 20 and few hours to make any of these  
it takes 1 post and 3 seconds to make yourself a faggot
  not a bad idea for a thread but this is clearly clickbait spam
dont get it why it click bait  site dont even have ads from what i seejust sharing good article isnt that what this place is all about 
  hes testing traffic and trying to get page views for adsense its spam before it even generates spam    op reddit would be a better choice i got about 20 visits from 4ch about 2000 from reddit theyre all retarded there
dude i have no idea what you are talking about  adsense what  lol i found this forum yesterdays and decided to share link i must missed something big cos every time i try to join some community and discuss something as soon as i link anything people say stuff like spam  clickbait  world has gone to hell  internet was lot funnier 10 years ago 
anyone would appreciate 20 more than some dumb 20 gift
  how about less than 5 and will earn you a really good blowjob    protip  use some shells that you and her collected together
  youre a horrible liar and its funny to watch you struggle
bro i reported your site for soliciting child pornography
  lets just clear some things up op  this is an imageboard you clearly noticed that to start a thread requires an image  folks around here dont take kindly to you posting a link instead of actual images  but on top of that this isnt something you did its ripped off somewhere else  but on top of that i havent clicked on the link but i can tell you all 10 things will be fucking garbage and also probably anyone who is bored enough to look up things like this will have already seen a variant of it because its probably an article where some writer has collected shit from the internet to post rather than inventing something themselves you know the internet we are already on and capable of looking at    its takes less than 20 and a few hours to make any of these    couldnt get one word out without fucking it up what a retard but could you have come up with anything more like an advert       isnt that what this place is all about   no fuck off      internet was lot funnier 10 years ago    take trolling here you are in the wrong place friend      you and her  but she is keeping the cock after transitioning or are you saving the extra 5 for strap on
last night i was drunk and decided to clear away the ice around the freezer tray in my minifridge i was going to chisel it with a flathead screwdriver and hammer but from the first strike things seemed to go wrong because the fucking thing started hissing honestly i dont know how i could have hit anything important i was only chiseling out the freezer tray anyway i decided to wait to take a sober look at it in the morning everything in there is still cold but it is still making a weird noise and there is water buildup in the tray directly under the freezer tray i think this could be from the ice i removed with my chisel it was messy work anyway how fucked is my fridge i use this as a backup to my main fridge and i dont really have anywhere else to put this stuff what do
  from the first strike things seemed to go wrong because the fucking thing started hissing    thats normal its part of the automatic defroster and will hiss for a while until it stabilizes
  suck homeless dick faggot
  unless anon punched the screwdriver right through a refrigerant coil but yeah if op does not see any puncture marks and the thing gets cold again when its fired back up then well i dont even know why he started the thread it either has a gash or it doesnt
  it either has a gash or it doesnt  this is how i feel about the transgendered community
  hissing  what do    theres a snek in there let it outside      in a mini fridge the refrigerant flows in a cheap aluminum evaporator that doubles as the freezer you let the refrigerant out and the refrigerator is now worthless
you had a minifridge now you have one of these the little compressor/vacuum pump doesnt pull a vacuum very fast but does have its uses
  turn it into a tiny combustion engine 
  crap wrong engine 
    good greif this guy cant present
  the little compressor/vacuum pump doesnt pull a vacuum very fast but does have its uses    such as my fridge is dead and i would like to salvage what ever i can before tossing to the curb
  my fridge is dead and i would like to salvage what ever i can before tossing to the curb        as long as you keep it oiled it makes a nice very quiet little compressor and/or vacuum pump
i use my pump for mold making/plastic work the vacuum will pull the little air bubbles out of the medium
i am trying to make leather gloves i am going for a few pairs the ones i am trying to make before christmas are going to be lined with white rabbit fur i have a bunch of furs leather and leather working tools and supplies i am looking for help finding the right design i want them to be real simple i have looked online but i cant find the right one i have also looked for tutorials but theyre usually not indepth i just need help with a templates and a little handholding with the steps
  im handsewing btw
i am looking for help finding the right design  go to a second hand store and buy some you like then copy them
  i made softshell and fleece gloves if you want i can give you the pattern but theyre adapted exactly to my hands and youd have to modify them i also doubt the fingers tunnels are wide enough to allow for a fur linen and theyre most probably not particularly different from whatever pattern you find online    i have looked online but i cant find the right one  if you could link/post them and elaborate what was wrong about them that would help a lot
   am looking for help finding the right design   go to a second hand store and buy some you like then copy them    or go to harbor freight find ones that fit undo the stitching copy
hi this is my 3rd or 4th project with leather i came once to post about a messenger bag i did and i heard your feedback today i need your opinion on another project i did thats a round box for my boom2 bluetooth speaker    i use fiebings pro dye i used to use the cheaper dye from the same manufacturer but it tend to ruboff a lot now i dont have this problem anymore i still use tiger thread 06mm and i had more attention to details and proportions i used the golden number for the cap/body ratio i use a better leather english leather it is cow shoulder veg tanned full grain grade a    so as usual what do you think any tips to improve my work/skills in the futur
part2
part3
part4
  looks good very nicely done
  it looks like you know what youre doing so what the hell are you doing _here_
  well i am new on leather working i started 6 months ago as this is not my job chemist i ask people to help me to target what needs to be improved
stitching is outstanding the crap ive made looks horrible please share some photos of the construction process i made a holster for my hand cannon out of some sole leather 11 thickness dont remember ended up using a 1/16 drill to punch all the holes  what a pita    ive got enough sole leather to make like 5 pairs of sandals 
  stitching is outstanding  agreed op is that hand stitched im guessing not
  i think i would have not had the joins line up potentially that could prove to be a weak point
  yes it is hand stitching i am using a chinese 3mm diamond shaped chisel and two 004 james jones needles i do not have a lot of pictures related to the construction i did a bag 6 months ago it was my first project    drive    google    com  /   drive  /  folders  /  1zufrl6f4ildavdnf2fqzhgd7lv4vmip    i will post the few pictures i have concerning this box
  is there a reason why you cant put the cut line between the vertical stiches  i think it would look better
  this would affect the strength of the joint it is possible to do it with different stitches techniques but i do not like the look of it well i like it but thats another style more like viking/middle age fashion     in theory the glue should be strong enough if i fold the leather but thats another kind of assembly based on thin leather glued on split leather or cardboard grey board this last option makes the stitches optional     on my design the friction would remove the glue after a while the stitches would break the first layer of leather as it is 06 mm thin at this distance i start to stitch 45mm away from the edge at this distance the leather is 1 mm thick my stitches are taking two pieces of leather between 1 and 15 mm each i did that to avoid that    the top layer is to thin here    nnnn    uuuu      i did that instead    nnnn    uuuu    the layers of leather are more or less the same this give me an even line that does not damage the surface leather    a last option is possible when you have two layers of leather all the way trough the box like in pen pots see the picture taken from google
   the n and u are the stitches
  i used the same kind of method than a guy on youtube  
  yes it is hand stitching  hats off to you op you obviously have a lot of skill and patience
looks nice as hell good work
my robotics team has been stuck on building a working intake for our flywheel for vex turning point if this continues our robotics council might disband us i dont wanna leave my friends how do i build a decent intake diagrams help especially
/qtddtot/
try chief delphi website if youre frc plenty of examples probably
  robotics council  the council has decided youre too dumb to know youre too dumb
but i know nothing about cars  is it possible in 1 year  some advice
  you can build anything in one year
neighbor spends hours raking and bagging leaves takes him three weekends to get it all cleaned up     be me    crank on leaf blower and spray all my leaves into the street in 10 minutes where they get blown onto his lawn eventually by the wind
  be a loser
  im an intellectual sir
  lawncare was a mistake  ridiculous way for humans to spend their time and energy  this is why the aliens dont come down and introduce themselves
  you friggin dandelion gardeners ruin things for the rest of us take care of the shit you own
composting leaves are insulation until snow comes in a sane society we would mulch them and leave them be
finally get around to bagging leaves  find 10 big logs of dog shit hidden away in the leaf pile  fuck boomers and fuck nigs
  use lawn mower with bagger  tafucking da no stupid attachments or accessories or bullshit toys
  its what you do when you cant stand your wife
  neighbor piles leaves 5 high into the street local no goodnick butthole drives throughassburger face  plot implemented drag out 40 year old thruster bike and cover with pile   oh no what happened to your foxbody bruh   ear rape him when i take off in the pocket rocket
  put cinder blocks in pile
suburbfag  dont have leaves to get rid of bc no treas
  this    its why nature created sheep theyre grass powered lawnmowers
  lmao in the end you are just slowly donating your lawns biomaterial to your neighbour
  leave them be  you know we can all see what you did there
  heheh this makes perfect sense actually
tfw covered all my grass with cardboard so it died  lawn is now a field of naturally appearing herbs and flowers  fuck grass lawns and fuck boomers
    the natural herbs and flowers are nice but why kill the grass first     idiot
  it will suffocate everything else exept very high level plants i want an equal chanse for all
  asshole neighbor throws his crap in my yard    cops show up later to arrest him for narcotics    judge adds extra 6 months for frog posting    win/win
who is this op it seems like he might be new to this board i keep seeing threads posted with this same picture and some greentext vaguely pertaining to /diy/      here he is using boomer which as i understand it is one of the terms /pol/ is trying to push to get people to self and argue      here he is again    theres something going on in here and i dont like it
  /diy/ is one of the easier boards to troll its full of older guys that didnt necessarily come here from /b/ and we actually try to help people here were too trusting if i were to guess id go with at least half the threads here are bullshit
neighbor spends hours mowing lawn and bagging leaves all summer and fall  spends tons of money on fertilizer etc  my lawn is local wildflowers and what not  mow it twice a summer  everyone hates me
  just mow them up tons easier
  i feel like this is more of a probing operation like theyre finding out what we respond to theres another frogposter that keeps making threads about building a house i dont want to write him off so soon but used to be rare to see pepe on /diy/
  its what you do when you cant stand your wife  if this is my future please just kill me now
  boomer which as i understand it is one of the terms /pol/ is trying to push to get peopl    boomer hate is an old thing its just trending post trump election  because we know you fuckers voted for him   247 ragging on millennials boomers are their natural enemy also boomers are going from peak power to old person in nursing home     as a genx i promise to help mulch all the boomers when the time comes
  the boomer meme is different they talk about 20 year old boomers
  thank you based gen xer
    first post on /diy/ wanted to see if this is a shithole    he is talking about inconsiderate baby boomers who let animals shit in other peoples yards and dont pick up for themselves because their whole life theyve had other people do shit for them the level of irony that hes saying it at who fuckin knows    desu its just a reality of internet life just remember the golden rule and this board will survive dont feed the trolls the only way to kill a troll is to starve them with being logical and unamusing if you get emotional and start crying about it theyll realize there are keks here
    there is no such thing those are millenials he could possibly be retarde
    i believe that is what the kids are calling a zoomer these days   t90skid
  yeah that is part of the evolution of it i dont know anymore though i think i lost a bit of my brain when the phrase dankmemes became used unironically that was the last little bit of soul i had and it got vaped away at that moment       np guilty enough that we played our part have known shit is fucked up but too scared / doing web ipos / heroin to do anything about mommy and daddy were like the older brother who had a drug problem and didnt do anything about alcoholic dad beating you all the time so sorry bout that
  damn
i kept looking for a noob guide on how to build a mini marty ultimax 18 and cant find anything like a cut list and how to put it together step by step with pics
mini and 18inch
  glue some wood together and stuff it with whatever is around
    i built the mini marty and we have to move the couch back after the movie depending on the movie by the way the pic is of the martycube
  just make it sealed and fill half way with polyfiber
looking for something which can handle powdered material for animal feed  these things seem either overpriced or cheaper ones reviews says it doesnt work very well    this looks gravity fed which all it leaves is the measurement needed for either flow or weight    if i wanted to build one what device could be used to measure flow/weight so a cut off valve would work with the gravity feed    no idea where to star with such a thing
  you could make something that is connected by a spring to a switch when the bucket attached to the spring is displaced by enough mass the chute is closed mechanically
    itt op wants to mass fill his dimebags
  this give you any ideas
  the pic has an auger for the flow  adjust the speed and time for the weight  if you need finer adjustment youll need a loadcell  not that hard to do  
      yeah thats a way i never throught of i suppose the material isnt consistentie volume changes due to compression and secondly i need to be accurate withing 12g dont think a spring will be so reactive      loadcellseems more like it not totally sure yet from the link for how itll work     is the auger running in the cone or is there a prefeed into weightthen drop into cone  never saw a machine in real life to see insides so trying to work it all out   not sure of the stages in the machine     i might go looks at load cells and try draw a diagram for what i think is right
  it depends if the material you will be working with can hang up on itself then a vibrating module or auger to keep it moving otherwise gravity is an option if it always remains free flowing     have a hopper with two metal slidein sheets like a magic trick cabinet the space between the two sheets is your fill volume the top metal sheet gets opened filling the chamber you close it and open the bottom dispensing the volume you will probably want a quality control step to adjust the weight after that
  ive been looking at this and can figure out all the parts  but the loadcells seems to be fixed where i see them for sale    no idea how to wire up a display monitor and adjuster to change weights    then is it better to have sensor in the auger funnel before the drop or dropping into container and when it hits the weight on a base to shut off gravity feed    or with parts needed for all this is it better to but one prices ranging from 500 with no auger vibration feed to 1k for original picture type with an auger    at least an auger would be cheap to rig upand old drill with a big cement mixer type end on it     the weight based trigger just noodling me
  use an arduino and a small grain auger adjust it until you get the weight right on a scale and just check a bag every day to make sure its accurate enough you can go a little over on the weight but youll get your ass had shorting anyone
  lol    find out how individual sugar packets are made and try that kek
  like for reloading
  of course apparently its not suitable for op because his medium is too clumpy
if you need to work with fine powders this setup works well  used to be able to get 01 gram accuracy on a 100 gram fill  no loadcell just speed and time  forgive the shity diagram
  thanks    but what part is doing the measure exactly   or is the plug weight based but how would it be so sensitive
    the consistent pour is from the 2 stirrers and the filling sensor is what detects the weight/amount  probably based on either time open on the chute or via weight touching the sensor/scale
  ive been thinking this over and finally think i understand now what you mean    i thought originally the cup was filling then dumping  but actually do you just set the auger put a scale underneath and time for when it gets to 100g  then after that remove the scale and just manually observe the time with each fill      that aside  ive been looking at loadcells still cant figure out how to rig a devide which would replicate what was in original picture and cost and time seems quite high looking into arduino also     but can anyone with experience tell me whats the learning time going to be might be worth spedning 500 on a machine which exists rather than investing so much to try and replicate a copy
  also can you recommend where to get parts    finding it diffuclt to find auger and funnel online
  look into used food machine suppliers in your area  stuff like that also turns up on ebay  might be cheapest way to go  with saying that you can make an auger withan auger  as in a wood auger/drill  just have to find a piece of pipe then find a auger that fits  as for the hopper maybe a steel funnel could be hacked on to the pipe  mod a cordless drill for the motor and gearbox  this all depends on what the size of the stuff your wanting to push through it
       had the solution overall i wasnt thinking about it from a time based set up  this makes the most sense doing it quick and easy    only problem is sourcing the parts are costing as much as a lower end machine  also cant find any parts which really suit so will end up with a messy set up when a premade machine is tidier     maybe if i stumble across parts i can keep them for future
    here i re read you shit and wonder if you misunderstand the function of the powder loader    it is very accurate with in a few grains not grams    it normally rests with its dispenser hole facing up towards the supply cylinder the medium fill the dispenser from gravity you rotate the dispenser 180 degrees and the medium falls out the bottom there is a screw on mechanism that is part of the dispenser that allows you to adjust the volume of the dispenser by turning a screw during setup you take a sample weigh it and adjust the volume repeat this step until you run into precision problems and youre done now you can rotate the dispenser as fast as your medium can fill it
  i need to be accurate withing 12g    what kind of feed are you making are you trying to mix feed commercially    we make our own feed at work weight it all out prior to mixing then mix it all up and bag it into roughly 50 pound bags using a gravity fed chute and a bathroom scale unless you are doing this professionally you are most likely better off doing this as well
  and whats the different weight you can set it toive no idea how much is in cartridge about up to 50g could you get to 100s
  yes trying to set it up so can mix larger quantities   problem i seem to find is a way of working which isnt messyfor example how do you load and close off the chute have to buy something special    tried using off the shelf pipes but nothing really matched up nicely    and as for scale im trying to move away from hand measuring
  if you use a volume to measure your ingredients you could use standard threaded steel piping add or subtract volume by changing lengths of pipe if that still doesnt adjust the volume to needs wooden dowels can be glued inside the pipe to further reduce volume
    i dont know if this will help you all that much but this is the set up we have you can scale it to whatever proportions you need its very simple to make and is easy enough for even a bunch of retards like us to use     we have a two story building we use for making feed we grind the corn and fill to a line in the in the mixing tub from that point we add all our additives from barrels/buckets sitting next to the tub each barrel/bucket has a scoop inside and a number spray painted on the side so we never have to hand measure past the point of putting in the number of scoops spray painted on the container from there it falls down the chute which has baffles in it to mix it up into another grinder to make sure everything is mixed up properly finally the mixed feed is either directed into a large storage bin or put into bags on a scale and bagged at as close to 50 pounds as we can get depending on what we are using the feed for and the time of year the mixing chute fed to the grinder is opened/shut with a piece of wood with a lever through a hole in it hinged on the side of the shoot pull out to open push in to close really simple    i know you want to go high tech with this but unless you are making thousands and thousands of bags a year this is really simple and you only have to actually measure each additive once for the scoops and then you just have to count scoops instead of weighing out each additive at a time while it is not 100 hands free it takes next to no time at all and you dont have to buy/make anything to expensive to make it work if you dont want to hand weight every bag you could feed from the grinder into another box that you know the weights of when the box is full empty into bags and repeat you will always have to hand measure everything once no matter what    hope this helps
  it was meant an inspiration you could make one out of say pvc for i dunno maybe 30
    or just do what this guy says for 5 get like a 4 pc pipe and put and end cap on it then start chopping length off of it until one full nll leveled scoop is your desired mass
  mercury switch and a counterweight could solve that problem more betterly     wire that to a transistor connect power to a relay and said relay to servo or something to control the opening and closing of the switch and youll probably need some kind of mixer in there to prevent it from getting clogged
  i suck but heres half an idea for a wiring diagram for a dc system
take a water gun  put it next to your toilet   shoot your butthole    boom instant bidet
you must have long ass monkey arms to be pointing that shit at your butthole tyrone
  super soaker 50  i had one of those    i put all sorts of crap in it soap bleach vinegar saltwater for some reason    its probably still in the woods
  one of those wiper pumps would be better tho
  tell me that shit when your back is forty years old i just hop in the shower after one of those monsters shits
wtf is wrong with my printer  it didnt have the problem the last time i used it im honestly not sure if its a leveling problem extrusion cura problem  it seems to sometimes just skip printing the head moves but the filament feeding stepper doesnt spin or try to spin
  relevel and check your settings what kind of printer is it i have a chinkshit one and its really not that sensitive about being leveled but i would get results like this when my slicers settings were trying to get it to print finer/faster/etc than it was capable of you can also trying heating up the plate and slowing the movement down  try everything until it works and then tweak to optimize
did you try turning it off and on again
  the filament feeding stepper doesnt spin or try to spin  wtf is wrong with my printer
  ive seen it with mine when winter is coming decrease the stepping of the filament driver motor to increase the force and make the hotend a few degrees hotter so plastic can flow more freely what diameter nozzle are you using
  underextrusion for whatever reason   is probably a clue if true it could be a bad connection to the stepper the wires shorting out or a bad board driver no signal is reaching in the first place pull your filament and try extruding/retracting just to see if the moves under no load might just be your spool hanging up and not letting the extruder pull it through
couldnt find a better place to post this     ok so 57 years ago i started learning the guitar with a teacher i started with an electric one got taught basic scaleschords and then moved to classical i was taught basic right hand technique and very little sheet music reading i quit afterwards and didnt play again    now ive dug up my old classical guitar and started learning how to play again and im trying to basically self teach my self through youtube videos what i do now is play for 1 hour daily i start by putting a metronome and playing open strings on it then ill do scales and then ill try to learn a song from youtube     i am completely aware that this routine is pretty shit so i would like some suggestions on what i should be working on every day im extremely autistic with things like these and can definetly commit
  theres a bunch of phone apps specifically for this wouldnt /mu know this
    ive been self teaching for the past two years trying to practice daily but im fairly lenient with the commitment id say 4/7 days of the week i will practice for 10  30 minutes ive committed about 10  15 pieces to memory of varying difficulty and style generally just practice them on repeat gradually i am seeing improvement and can play maybe one or two without mistakes im quite happy with my progress given my casual approach personally finding a piece that really appeals to me is enough to propel me to learn it and then it seems to be a case of many many hours of repetition with a metronome to achieve a pleasing playthough as with most things id wager that consistency is going to be the biggest contributor to your idea of success kinda just rambled there but w/e theres my worthless two cents
  couldnt find a better place to post this        you didnt even tried go fuck yourself
    /mu/ is a fucking shithole full of people who either like soundcloud rappers or pop music the guitar general is full of trolls and some autistic brazilian teenager
  no need to be so hostile   what the world needs right now is moe peace love and understanding  try to be a little more kind to your fellow beings
its really tricky coming up with a routine for someone over the internet plus by yourself you might develop bad habits maybe try learning some classical guitar pieces if youre dead set on diying go find a highly praised book on learning  but really though /mu/ is not a place for musicians
watch these youtube channels    ben levin  rick beato  justin guitar  signals music studio
  this/mu/ is rarely about music its about shilling a dozen shitty albums to be metaironic or contrarian
  warning    you are using the metronome wrong  metronomes are for practicing tempo shifts and pushing your playing speed up    for statictempo practice you need to do it by pulse oldfag composer like verdi and puccini warned against improper use of the metronome so im not making that up google up puccini remarks tempo and verdi metronome for in depth articles to that if you like
if you want to get this autistic focus on your mechanics   how far fingers are from the fretboard   chord accuracy no buzz   chord timing longer chords with very small pauses   a good ear can recognize chords without using guitar tuna   going up/down neck with basic scales  when you have the right tools you can do bigger jobs
this is what you are looking for  
  what do you like music wise that has guitar i am self taught i wouldnt say im that awesome but i can try to suggest something based on how i learned and what you like
actually just keep doing what youre doing always challenge yourself and make sure that your fingers are always as close to the string as possible maybe practice a little more but your current regimen should lead you to the next steps pretty organically its going to take a long time though just work your ass off    ive been playing fir ten years and thats pretty much how i started i can pay eugenes trick bag now
      not true at all i have conversations on mu about classical and postrock every day also a lot of us are pretty skilled musicians theres usually a general for sharing your music
  rick beato  this anon has the ultimate truth this channel is so fucking great and you will find what the fuck do you need to know and what can wait in terms of music theory    im music therapist i strongly recommend you  learn about functional harmony you know the i iv v ii iii and vi shit almost all pop is made of it will save you a lot of time searching songs and learning them learn and practice how to improvise scales and chords are nothing if you cant improvise and build up stuff practice with backingtracks not metronome and try to harmonize and reharmonize stuff by ear also if you could play along with other people it would be great
  call the autistic troll pete and see what happens
i recently discovered joe pass the late great guitar jazz player he has yt tuts and pdfs for free you can easily dowload im just currently checking joe pass guitar chords pdf he was recommended by joe satriani to learn chords and scales the easier way
  how the hell are you music therapist what do you play whats it like
    this guy is a faggot verdi and puccini are good but they are wrong in this regard    op keep doing what you are doing i recommend trying to learn songs by ear as well in whatever genre you like but if you know your scales you are ahead of the game to make scales more interesting turn them into patterns since youre autistic you should be good at this play them in thirds fourths fifths whatever     the important thing is that you keep practicing nearly every day
  everything you sad is true as fuck/mu/ has so much potential but the moderation is absolute shit and user base is filled with mentally illl prescription drug taking hipsters
  this is true for most boards the official mod/janitor policy is that if its not egregiously breaking major rules it flies regardless of how low quality or off topic it is its a death sentence for boards where its easy to be on topic while simultaneously contributing very little to the conversation /g/ and /mu/ are prime examples of this it will eventually gut every board until the moderation decides to get a handle on it but it looks like thats never coming
  those threads suck if you make anything other than memstep and chillwave bullshit dont delude yourself mate
you guys like guitar
  add adam neely to that list guy plays bass but the info is great for guitar players too
  mu is atrocious for classical guitar     ive tried there and anything related to it slides so fast      i wish i saw the same /mu/ you do post classical  postrock reccos pls      for sheet music projects try learning brouwers first 10 etudes then some villalobos first 5 preludes theyre gorgeous fun and accessible
  step 0 get a teacher    step 1 there are really good phone apps that drill you on sheetmusictonotename conversion and sheetmusictoguitarfret conversion i have been doing the first one and its been fantastic very useful want to try getting good at the second type of app soon too
  arvo part and esmerine
  i have tried doing this several times i followed books videos made a routine too many things  made another too little  made another too focused to one thing above others  im doing a new one right now and i will fail again
  i kinda feel motivated to start playing again used to play for hours but by now ive probably forgotten everything
seems like my air compressor is reading incorrectly the regulator meter doesnt match the tank meter when i have it all the way up also when i drain the tank there is still a good amount of air coming out while the tank meter already reads 0  seems like its always about 15 psi below where it should be  is there any way to fix this
pop the plastic off the meter and force the needle past max until instead of returning to zero it returns to 15psi
  seems  are you sure  like against a known working gauge    if youre sure you can remove the top then the back shell and use pliers to bend a part of the linkage so that it is pointing to the correct pressure
  put a new gauge on it theyre like 4 bucks at harvie freught
return it for a new one
  ereplacementpartscom  new gauges
i live in a spread out urban area with lots of new housing estates full of pic related  how do they suck ive heard of blocks being poured too thin so they crack after a few years for example
  pipes in the slab foundation
  a friend of ours bought and moved into one he tried to jack his car up in his garage and ended up exceeding the point load of the waffle pod reads cement over styrofoam slab and punched a hole clean through it they also has a shitload of lime leaking out of the cement and the grass in the square meter of dirt he calls a backyard has died off because when you dig two inches down it is thing but building refuse that has been covered with soil    pic related was built a few streets over from me i drove past it everyday during construction they all exhibit the same problems lime leaking out of the render cracked cement because laid over fucking styrofoam roads cracking because the ground was not allowed time to settle struggling lawns you couldnt pay me to live in one and i guarantee in 20 years time once they have have fallen to bits the whole area will be a new ghetto fucking disgusting
  it is nothing but building refuse  hurp
    substandard materials    eg ply structural bearers and joists    i dont care who anyone is have a look how 1015 yr old ply looks like after being out in the elements     my brothers new house is on those 5 ply fibreboard structural bearers with top and bottome pine brace its only a year old and the floor tiles cracking and its creaking like a motherfucker
    they throw those housing estates up so fast now    they dont even allow shit to set or dry the foam in the concrete is beginning to become an epidemic they are putting more and more in every year it went from the odd slim piece to decrease the concrete needed to 4 inch thick 3mx2m sheets    walls are a fucking joke the lightest shit pine formwork you could find with 5mm rendered cement cladding some insulation and gib you should literally smash your way through a house if you wanted to they are so weak these days     building standards in aus is disgusting     all those muslim builders using import labour and chinese tilers with sub standard material
  most of these were surprisingly enough steel frame but its white ant city out around these parts so i guess they had to do something right    i dont disagree on the general sentiment around building standards though but i would be hesitant to bring a race into it if regulations didnt allow it you would not have racetothebottom housing companies knocking this shit together as cheaply as possible and the only reason shitskins are taking the jobs is because the bosses are cheap cunts who wont pay a decent wage same reason why no cunt behind a 7/11 counter is white funnily enough there was a news article in the syd morning herald today outlining how new houses are on average 23 smaller than they were 20 years ago placed squarely at the foot of these estates and the new trend of cramming more shit into less land fuck that
  if it was erected in this country its poorly built
  im straight with mine if it was built in the mid 90s on the very south end of florida you probably have a beefy house the codes after hurricane andrew changed a bunch and my house is stout super loud thunderstorm rolls through and i can barely hear it    these new mcmansions are trash though some of these gated communities with 700k houses you can hear the toddlers running around on the 2nd floor when youre on the other side of the house
  eh depends  my house is 180 years old and its still sturdy as fuck im in west michigan and basically any house thats older than 150 was built like theyd need to it survive ragnarok
  i have a 1920s house in california only problem is the porch settling and cracking after the 89 quake
a friend of ours bought and moved into one   what do you mean one like do these houses look different from the outside is literally every new construction crap how do you avoid this as a buyer
  go drive through a subdivision built in the last 15 years theyre all nearly identical and are made of cardboard and sadness
  i dont care who anyone is have a look how 1015 yr old ply looks like after being out in the elements    structural wood in homes would need to be painted every 3 years to survive outdoors too difference is that you cant really cut corners on a solid wood beam yet theres a lot of corners you can cut on an ijoist
  mfw pipes in my slab foundation
    usually but not always
  hire a home inspector you trust and make sure you get a house that is 40 years old that weeds out all the shitty ones that have fallen apart over the years and the inspector finds all the shit you need to be careful about old roof bad wiring cracks in the foundation asbestos lead etc that older built homes might have
floating decks
so would you guys rather fix broken crap in a modern house or deal with all the problems that come with an old house lead paint substandard wiring rot etc
  sheetrock is the most poorfag cuck shit there is
  red flag no 1 its located in united states b which means its made from ply wood
  red flag no 2 the house is build from osb wich will rot when will murica learn to build with bricks
  the house is build from osb wich will rot when will murica learn to build with bricks    they serve two absolutely different purposes
  seeing as i bought a house built in 1951 the latter
  chinese poison and spic costcutting  lead paint
  an old house honestly because the failures are logical
  if it falls over in a bit of wind
  yeah but hows the piping the wiring im pretty sure thats all shit unless its been redone in the past 30 years which by default makes it a shitty house
    non home owners i see
  my house was built in 1906 built like a brick shit house very sturdy but like the other person who replied said there has been work done when i bought it all knob and tube removed is all duplex grounded 100 amp panel which i may upgrade higher plumbing is all pvc waste pipe and copper water lines not a stitch of lathe and plaster all redone with drywall im actually in the process of renovating it further since i bought it mostly just superficial stuff like new flooring and paint maybe a new kitchen as well
  tfw previous mexicans put undersized drain pipes with ts instead of ys in basement bathroom  tub drains too slowly  pipes buried in concrete  kill me      1920s home  lathe and plaster covered with drywall  walls dangerously thicc  knob and tube replaced with romex  except sometimes when knob and tube used as carrier leg for three way switches  three way switches switch off the neutral  two breaker panels because mexican construction site surplus  but on the plus side as you said these old brick shithouses are sturdy as fuck it looks like when mine settled someone put a steel beam running down the center of it years ago its good now and a fun practice home to upgrade things on
when will we wake up and enter the monolithic dome dragonball aesthetic era
 you   home   and plaster covered with drywall   dangerously thicc   and tube replaced with romex   sometimes when knob and tube used as carrier leg for three way switches   way switches switch off the neutral   breaker panels because mexican construction site surplus  but on the plus side as you said these old brick shithouses are sturdy as fuck it looks like when mine settled someone put a steel beam running down the center of it years ago its good now and a fun practice home to upgrade things on    yeah i went through my house with a fine tooth comb for all the big ticket items electrical plumbing hvac roof i bought it with a very old furnace so i just bought a new high efficiency goodman and while i was at it i just got them to install a central air unit as well because better then running two portable window units like the previous owner had brand new roof in 2014 as well which was a plus
  old house any time
  not being built with icf
  oh it has problems for sure most but not all of the electrical is 2 wire with no ground there is no insulation in the walls the ceiling is insulated with vermiculite which has never been tested for asbestos half the light switches are original so they take about 2600 pounds of force to operate and dont so much make a clicking sound as a thunking sound the fireplace flue leaks so bad it basically does nothing so i have to seal it whenever not having a fire which i dont do because the draw is poor smoke gets in the house the original floors which were laid directly on the slab foundation are brown linoleum in every room the previous owners couldnt get it up because it was glued down with marine glue might as well be welded to the concrete so they carpeted over it it also has not been tested for asbestos that is about it though    the foundation is rock solid the roof is less than 10 years old the windows were replaced with dual paned vinyl at some point the kitchen still has the original tile and wood cabinets which look great all of the main drain lines are 4 inch cast iron pipe so drains make next to no noise the lot is in the middle of town and is 1/4th of an acre more than i need the water supply pipe is huge so you can flush a toilet and not have a drop in pressure in the shower theres no lead in the place or mercury switches amazingly no asbestos in the drywall the water heater which is an old rheem fury with a saturn burner is getting on towards 50 years old so it will probably last forever all of the supply pipes were run in the ceiling because of the slab so they are easy to service never had to yet and you get near instant hot water because they are run as the crow flies the exterior is brick and wood siding so it is easy to maintain the layout is traditional so i dont have any of that open concept shit or a sunk in livingroom or any of that other crazy fadish bullshit people do
  continued    no osb anywhere the frame is all diagonally braced so no plywood there the only plywood in the whole house is in the cabinetry there are tons of builtins which is super nice the drywall is extra thick so i get very little noise from the street even without insulation the living room is paneled with 1/2 inch thick real wood paneling everything is shipshape and solidly built every problem that ever popped up was fixed years before i bought the place no surprises left if i wanted a newer house i would have had to buy out on the edges of town and be stuck with a smaller lot my commute is 10 minutes by car and i am walking distance to many local restaurants and such location location location as they say i wouldnt trade it for a new house twice the size unless i was gonna turn around and sell it to a sucker
  lead paint is only an issue if you are eating it or sanding it  so never
  or have kids  herp derp why are your dumb kidz eating paint  if it is flaky or chalking when the paint gets powdery it can collect on things like toys have a 6month old that likes to put everything in its mouth and you will understand why that is a problem    or want to sell the place  herp derp why would you tell them  in many states it is required by law that you disclose such things if you dont and they can prove you knew about it you can be sued after the sale has closed and have to pay for the cost of the cleanup plus damages in some places lead paint testing is required before the sale of a home you can claim ignorance all you want but when the tests come in that is it might as well take care of it yourself instead of having to show proof you hired someone or have to lower your price    besides any paint old enough to contain lead is so old you wouldnt want to be painting over it anyway it will likely be in such poor shape then it will either start flaking off or leave an ugly surface that requires many coats to hide
  57 times  in a row
if its not made of reinforced concrete is shit
  west michigan here too and my 100 year old house is not going anywhere the size of the beams is amazing it has survived 100 winters and probably that many blizzards as well as two major floods
first time posting on /diy/  im looking for advice about digging an underground tunnel and room structure  a property nearby had a survey and a test bore revealed water at both 25m and 4m depths  i believe i will need to water proof any underground room i make  since i live in a city with planning laws and will never get consent to literally dig under my apartment building i have to do this incognito  any advice on how to build underground would be appreciated  i would like to use a waterproof cement like pudlo or bricks and mortar that would be water proof  i would also like to have an arched ceiling  so far ive drilled an outline in the concrete floor and will begin the process of digging a shaft soon
so youre building your rape dungeon under an apartment block do you own the apartment or are you renting
  lol youre going to get caught
  you will find a much more sympathetic ear on one of the /unnaground/ threads on /k/ there is even a tripfag with the appellation of moleman btw get a spade bit for your hammer/drill
  a worthy cause op good luck and god speed
  im renting landlord doesnt do inspections and i can do what ever i want to the place
i bet that hammer drill was real quiet    real good bro real good
  why are you building a dungeon on a property you dont own your landlord is going to kick you out and use it himself at least bill him for your labor
  keep us updated pls    also whats the court date
  look up   james diesel   on youtube    thank me later
  only if he goes bragging about it    as long as he keeps the usual somewhat renovating method noone will ever think hes going to drill his own well and grotto    i live on the first floor of a small complex yet i own a small shed outside i cant drill there because there are too many people around that can hear that im doing big things in a 6x8 shed    tldr pls op post moar pics 
        yea he gonna get caught    1 its a fuckin apartment  2 name tied to documents lease and other legal documents for the apartment  3 other people complaining about sounds coming from the diggers apartment  4 landlord will find out after the tenant is gone after the lease is up or when shit has to be done to the place such as repairs and bug spraying
  fritzel why do you keep doing this
  title says  digging an underground tunnel in my house    but he then says  my apartment building
  i had a girlfriend once who could never remember the different between a house and an apartment chick was so dumb she thought sponges grew in the ocean
   she thought sponges grew in the ocean    they do tho
  the sponges you use in the kitchen to clean dishes i also convinced her the r in gerald r ford stood for are
  do you honestly think theres just dirt under there or something
  he doesnt use sea sponges  bitch i bet you dont even own a bidet
  so dirt is gonna have 2x the mass once you excavate it where the fudge are you going to put 16 truckloads of earth
  read up on the great escape you have to be secret about this op dig quietly and keep the entrance hidden carry the dirt out in bags you hide in a backpack or your pants dispose of it far far away
how do you plan on reinforcing the walls i do residential renovations and i hire people to do the masonry shit like foundations and i can assure you this is no easy feat by yourself with limited tools manpower and knowledge
  
  fun with aquifers
  he didnt disable aquifers  enjoy drowning in 7/7 water op
you can just put the dirt down the sink and toilet drains itll be perfect
  rebar shot crete grade sump pool paint    miner here    f
  you asshole faggot dont be doing novice structural engineering in a fucking rental    would you like it if i came over and built a rape cave in y nevermind
  billing someone for unliscensed and unregulated destruction of private property    no
  sea sponges are a real thing    what is a loufa
  in his pockets and enpty it in the yard do you even shawshank bro
  the sponges used in the kitchen used to come from the sea why do you think they are fucking called sponges
  why do you think they are fucking called sponges  because they soak up water like a sponge retard  why do you think  sponge  characterized by readily absorbing water and becoming soft when wet while retaining toughness used in bathing in wiping or cleaning surfaces etc  any of various other similar substances often porous rubber or cellulose used for washing or cleaning
  nigger the animal was named sponge before we were using them to soak up water that definition comes from the animals properties
  this guy still thinks sea sponges arent used to clean
    
why the fuck is this board full of people wanting to dig tunnels under their homes
  dig tunnels under their homes    i dug one over my home    not a good idea
  board is sinking to new lows
  the government got him didnt it  he hasnt uploaded any more videos
  it is odd isnt it i seeked out a job mining after having dinner at my bros grandparents dude built a concrete bunker its fantastic
  he doesnt dig tunnels above ponds
  probably a fucking cave in    digging in a 15 foot deep hole with a heavy ass structure on top of it and 0 fucking reinforcements      f
  hope you are trolling   sponges do come from the sea you ignorant shit  an apartment can be a house the word originated from the act of breaking a house into separate apartments    wow girls sure are dumb      i love these threads because you know the person will either give up  or die at some point they never end well     
  look up disco daves tunnel guide to nvda protest tunnel
  retard sponge anon btfo
  i had a girlfriend once  nobody whos actually had a girlfriend would ever say something like this
  0 fucking reinforcements  the thing is a steel and concrete cave
  op can i have your stuff when they find your crushed partially buried body
  
  op collapses apartment building  multiple negligent homicide charges  ass raped in prison
    op collapses apartment building  multiple negligent homicide charges  ass raped in prison    come on man after the building falls on him he would have to have an ass to rape
  a cave doesnt magically have steel and concrete walls you caveskull
  just why  why the fuck would you want to do this especially when your just fucking renting
  the ass would be all thats left
  im all for this op just concerned how youre going to hide it when you move out theyll eventually find it  god speed and share updates
been 4 days op you still alive post updates faggot
  
  let us know when you get someone else killed in an electrical fire
  i dont think ops ever gonna leave hes gonna live under that fucking place
  twice the volume not twice the mass
  if the building caves in youd be 100 liable even if it wasnt you because the insurance companies have better lawyers than you ever will    not worth the risk
how would you go about heating a notsofullyclosable shed in european climate  infra red halogen
  pic related this seems like an effort in futility honestly any heat you generate is going to vanish instantly given that halfinch thick wood and 3 open windows covered only by shutters with gaps wider than the straight gibraltar    the best you can probably do is to seal the windows get some shitty insulation and drywall on the inside youre going to lose even more space but its honestly the only way throw a thick rug in there and youll have a perfectly habitable death trap
  nah that was just for attention reality is much worse its ashed with a one side open that only has a light cover like this thats why i would like to use halogen or other infra red or near infra red heating as heating the air itself us futile
get inside  screw doors and windows shut  douse in gasoline  set on fire  kill yourself for asking stupid questions
  wow didnt know 4channel was up yet
  where do you think you are princess fagbook
  you tell me
  thats good in a civilized way another option is to have a wood fire in a steel drum barrel or in a wood stove thats a popular method in american openair situations
  is this to live in or just as a smoke shack is the structure yours if not what kind of modifications are you allowed to make they make outdoor heating lamps you often see at festivals and beergardens that might do the job if you just wanna hang out in there but sealing off the open wall and making an enclosed structure with a small electric heater will be more fruitful    there isnt really any magic solution here either insulate/fortify the building so you can trap heat or get an outdoor heating unit which will be a colossal waste of energy/money in comparison
  seen a few videos of oil powered diy solutions looked kinda ok but dangerous as fuck    its just a car shed  i can do anything im the sole owner of the house and its in the middle of nowhere its just to survive the winter so i could keep tinkering with stuff i dont want to do inside like sandblasting etc  i intend to build some kind of sliding doors over the summer the ceiling is sloped right side is 380cm and the left side is 180cm    went to obi and bought two of these fuckers 2x400w supposedly can heat up to 4 square meters ill see if it helps and maybe buy a bigger set
  how about a kerosene or diesel forced air heater just set that puppy on the outside facing in and enjoy the 180000 btu heat blasting at you
  just set that puppy on the outside facing in and enjoy the 180000 btu heat blasting at you    ah yes fumes i love them
small potbelly stove would work good they give off enough radiant heat could have every door and window open and other then the cool breeze would still be warm
  too noisy
  i wouldnt
  strait
  unironically philips 415836 heat lamp 250watt r40 flood light bulb
  get a coat
  thats kinda what i did
  notsofullyclosable  make it closeable heating is a waste of money if you have a drafty cuckshed  otherwise use a space heater fan like any sensible person theyre like 20
  a lot of blankets
  let your polish slaves go you gypsy scum
  european climate  northern to southern europe 40c difference  just go to northern canada for a bit and then return to your cuckshed and realize it was warm all along
  basically this /diy/ has been having more and more of these so called questions the liquid soap dispenser unscrewing thread the liquid pressure sensor thread and so on and so on   just kys already or lurk moar moaaaarrrrr
  build a rocket mass heater  
  the headaches mean that you are also being warm
  it depends does mohammed or tyrone allow electricty in your cuckshed
so i was a huge dumbass today and i put a small kitchen knife at the bottom of my camelbak ripoff and went for a jog expecting everything to be okay    its torn two holes in the bottom of my bag one sizeable one and a smaller hole next to it     i havent sown since high school is the best option to sow up the hole however i can then seal it with a piece of nylon fabric  seam glue id rather not buy another one this one suits my needs just fine
  that or a patch should do just fine
guysnever ever use these for assembling your bitch    if youre off even by 1mm 1/32it wont assemble
    this
  ever tried not being off a mm    works for me every time
if you cant drill a hole or cut a piece of wood within 030 you need to leave/diy/ immediately seriously im not even saying im a saint but when you have so little attention to detail that 030 is hard tolerance to hit you need to go back to learning how to read a ruler and start over
  within 030    thats 1/32 of an inch you cant even see that on a tape
  any real take has it again not trying to be mean but if you cant read a 1/32 division suggest you get glasses or learn to take pride in your work being 030 off is the difference between your project looking like a middle school science fair project and something somebody took pride in their work
im currently on a mission to make msg from kelp by boiling it and reducing the solution until solid ive ended up with this ugly brown shit that makes my tongue buzz so i think ive got it any advice for whitening/ turning into powder its kind of hard but still not completely dry its a little gummy
    bags of pure ajinomoto msg are like 1/pound
yeah but i just wanna do this shit for fun ive got no life
  go to /sci and ask some chemfag    id imagine youd puree it and use various solvents to gradually separate it out to something you can evaporate
  thx cheif
  msg is not soluble in ethanol but the brown goo is
im a tattoo artist offering advice on machine building or getting started tattooing ama
do you suffer from vibration white finger
    do girls actually like it
  is building actually from scratch worth the bother over buying kits  also whats the best improvised needle
  tattoos  absolute degeneracy
tattoos are for fags and fuck you
  have you tatted some fat lips
  what if instead of a needle u use a sounding rod would it be ok
  i got some amazon coil machines been practicing on fake skin i often have a problem where i lose the needle tip in the blog of ink that builds up on the skin and its hard to tell where im going how do i get around this
  any respectable tattoo artist wouldnt offer advice to scratchers    fuck off

my brushed whoop is old and the motors are wearing out again its time to upgrade i want to build a 2s brushless whoop something with the performance potential of the now quite desirable mobula7 problem is most of the places i usually buy from dont have a lot of micro brushless stuff can any of you micro builders out there recommend any places i can find this stuff other than banggood i already priced out building it with parts from banggood and it would be cheaper to just buy a mobula7
  horizon has their brushless whoop if i recall correctly its built around their inductrix board    along the same lines im looking for my first whoop and will be using it in multigp inductrix and newbee are my top pics but i came across aliens whoops now im really undecided also considering other suggestions
  whoops r gay
how narrow can a 4wd differentialsteering robot be and still work i dont suppose one that is 1m long and 10 cm wide would steer at all
  the ideal lengthwidth ratio for the centre of a tank track in contact with the ground is 35 the same goes for your wheels you want the distance from the point of contact of the front wheels to the rear wheels to be 5x and from the point of contact of the left wheels to the right wheels to be 3x    practically speaking the wider your vehicle is the easier it will turn but it will also be much slower the narrower it is the quicker it will turn but this is heavily offset by the fact that you need a lot more torque to overcome the traction of each part that is slipping which in the case of wheels is relatively small but in the case of tanks can be enormous    since this isnt a tank you can pretty much do whatever you want as long as youre on flat ground and not in a ridiculously grippy setup your car should be able to bruteforce itself into steering a 110 ratio is a bit excessive though unless your centre of mass is in the middle of the vehicle youll probably find it unpredictable to drive and it wont handle things like pebbles or grass well at all
  not him but fuckin saved thanks going for an 8 wheeled igloo cooler soon how the fuck will i control 2 sets of 4 brushed 24v 240 watt 10 amp motors foward and reverse
  hook each side up in parallel to a motor driver that can handle 960watts  but if you want to be clever about this what i would do is use bicycle chain and making the whole thing beltdriven with just one motor on each side that way you can slow it down to being controllable and get some very nice torque out of smaller motors you can also get a bit more ground clearance by not having a row of motors directly on the belly and you dont have to buy eight gearboxes just two
    buy one of these and install an ardupilot so it can follow you around install one of those car trunk refrigerator boxes on top and fill it with beer
  nice link
  thank you i take pride in my internet sleuthing and its nice to know people appreciate it
  nice  where did you get the 53 rule from    my frontback is 90mm and leftright is 80mm    so thats about 3373     i got n20 motors theyre pretty torquey
  bicycle chain    he could also use closed t5 timing belt since most of the parts are available on aliexpress and you can just use standard couplers rather than try to weld a sprocket to an axle
  the reason i suggested bicycle chain instead of a timing belt is because bicycle sprockets grip the chain easier only the frontmost and rearmost tires will have the chain wrap around them to a notable degree the two centre tires will have the chain only touch the bottom of their sprockets and the top if he adds an idler timing belts slip quite easily under that scenario whereas a bike sprocket bites much deeper into its chain    that rule comes from real life tank design though of course you had some variations there as well i mistyped in my original post though mixing the length and widths in the first paragraph what you want is 5 lengths per 3 widths so 53 lengthwidth  thing is the wider your tank is the easier it will turn but also the wider your tank is the harder it will be to make it go in a straight line and traction actually decreases through some arcane magic i dont understand through trial and error tank engineers realised that 53 was sort of a magic number for good turning capability good controllability and also for the overall proportions of the resulting tanks which needed to be narrow enough to fit on roads and railroads 53 let them be narrow enough to fit on a train while also long enough that you could fit all the men and equipment you needed inside  russians then sloped the armour in on the sides and used an enormously space wasting suspension system completely negating that aspect of tank design the bongs made their tanks obnoxiously long because they thought they would be fighting in ww1 trenches and the germans made their heavies a bit squatter because they thought turning speed was more important when you were fighting in russian swamps and they figured taking the tracks off which made the tanks much slimmer was easy enough that you could still transport tigers by train its a tank design guideline not some sort of rule you must adhere to
  i was lurking for some brushless whoops myself and stumbled upon ur65 on aliexress combined with chinese black friday some coupons and some luck i managed to get frsky rx and three batteries for 57  heard its really good for the price
hey lads trying to put together a first time build of a micro brushless quad pic related     i do however need some advice on the last few parts since im having a hard time with it    antenna  motors  receiver    any advice on what to get
  that camera is no good for that build try to get an hs1177 instead
    that camera is a hs1177  youre right it wont fit that frame is designed to take micro cams micro swift micro arrow etc
  you need a micro cam bro
  fuck im a tard thanks m8
  ardupilot auto follow mutherfucking genious
  mounting sprockets isnt a problem or mounting them to a shaft with bolts
  
  anyone know what brand this little guy is     i could get it for like 14 eurobuckos and have it tomorrow rather than another 3 incher from banggood taking a month to get here but id like to see if theres builds out there for this one
       forgot the amazon link incase no one is able to tell what brand it is could anyone recommend me what prefferably 1407 motors i should get along with a good esc
  i wanna start my first time build slow by first getting a frame motors esc and fc any recommended to get that work with pic related
  yes a proper 5 set
balloon guy did you burn up already
  wat
  hes asking about the nigga who wanted to build a drone or a hot air balloon to hold a light above his campsite or some shit
what props should i use with a chinese knockoff dji 2212 920kv motor
  9050 or 1045 props
just went to check out his channel to see if hes posted anything new since he makes some pretty neet videos and fuck me man        i dont know if any of you guys watched his vids or seen this one cause its not new by now but still
  saw that a month or so ago pretty sure jb or uavfutures mentioned it
  why would you use a drone or a balloon for that couldnt he just get one of those telescopic flagpoles
  thats what everyone said    apparently its easier to build a drone or a blimp
  because he was a dumbass
whats the best platform to run a diy photography drone from    as of right now im looking at a pixhawk s500 2312 935kv motor and 1045 props ive built a few quads before so im not completely in the dark just never messed with ardupilot     i was also curious why even with 2017 and 2018 builds most people still use simonk escs i found a set on amazon that are blheli will they work just as well at that why the hell is there a pixhawk 2 21 24 26 and 28 all listed around various places can they all run the latest version of arducopter or what    lastly just in case anyone bothered to read all this is there a decent 2 or 3 axis gimbal on a trustworthy site preferably under 100 i keep seeing shit about goodluckbuy and frankly the name of that site makes me feel like id be lucky to get what i ordered    thanks for the help
  diy photography drone  you wont get away cheaper than just buying a dji
whats the best fr sky receiver availiable from hobbyking that    1 will work with my taranis q x7  2 will work with my naza m lite that i have flashed the m v2 406 firmware on  3 is for a non racing drone that i just want to fly around and maybe record stuff on it
  dji is the only sensible option  why dont people use fixedwing more often
  thats a dumb question  cant hover  requires more space to take off and land
in drones gforces arent really a concern so why dont fixed wing uavs just brake by sharply increasing the angle of attack think of it like a paper airplane when its misfolded and goes sharply up after a few feet then starts to go backwards if its properly timed it should be able to land without a runway
  wrong
  okay so your uav is flying at ground level then flies up until all of its speed has been turned into potential energy height what do you reckon happens next if you level out youre now flying far from the ground and if you dont level out you fall back down if you dive back down again guess what youve just done whats called an immelmann and youre back at ground level and still going pretty fast
  no i mean sharply increasing it so it starts to stall then the energy should go into friction
  wont work friction is nowhere near great for that if your plane is very acrobatic and you mount support legs on the tail you could kind of do a hover landing or you could just do a normal landing approach with a super high lift wing which to be fair a camera platform would have and catch it with your hands as it moves past    neither option is anywhere near as good as just getting a dji
  friction is nowhere near great for that  that depends on how long the aircraft stalls for it could just go around in a circle stalling until its nearly at ground level then pull up sharply    neither option is anywhere near as good as just getting a dji  i was talking in general for just filming in particular wouldnt it be good enough to just have some kind of implement to catch it eg a hook on the uav and some kind of stick with a loop on the ground it doesnt exactly need to be gentle since it wont be filmed
  how many aerial photographers do you reckon are able to reliably stall an aircraft for any period of time and maintain control bearing in mind that a single failure could lead to the loss of some very expensive equipment versus a dji where when you need to land any retard can just click the come home button
  im talking about doing it the flight software i know that doing it by hand would be very hard  also i mean in general not for filming for instance for measuring
  not really the point im aware of that but i want to build one far as ive seen 400 or so can get 70 the performance of a dji    enlighten me
  whats the best platform to run a diy photography drone from    thats like asking whats the best fork to eat soup with instead of just picking up a spoon if you want photography buy dji simple as      far as ive seen 400 or so can get 70 the performance of a dji    except it doesnt and that 30 is the really important valuable stuff    dont get me wrong i love diy  have built maybe 18 different quads now including what i intended to be a photography quad based around a pixhawk but i also work in commercial aerial photography with dji stuff  the simple truth is that diy cant even get close to the features performance reliability results etc of dji even if you spend substantially _more_ money on diy    if you want a fun but ultimately fruitless diy project to occupy your time then by all means pursue a diy photography drone but if you want to do decent aerial photography just suck it up  buy dji
  what exactly is the major difference between a picture shot with a dji camera and a picture shot from a diy drone     most of the price of dji drones is the usability and extra features like the mavics 3 way position hold crap hell just in that picture youve got a 4000 dji drone against a 1000 diy build and the vast difference between them will be the camera and maybe the flight time 3000 would get you a better camera for the diy to solve that issue    im not trying to argue that dji isnt better it blatantly is but you act like diy cant even hold a candle to it even at 1/4 the price
  its the integration of the camera into the hardware/software of the drone  its controller this is a massive difference    a dji drone is literally a flying camera in the sense that you get all the same camera controls in your hands while flying the drone 500m away as you would if you were holding an actual camera in your hands    a diy drone on the other hand is often entirely fire  forget when it comes to the camera  you press record before you take off  press stop when you land if you want to change anything while in the air white balance metering exposure comp resolution/framerate even something as simple as stopping shooting a video to take some stills instead youre shit out of luck    the sort of integration between camera  drone that you get with dji simply isnt possible outwith a turnkey cots product the difference is so stark  the value of the dji package is so great i would literally take a spark over a diy copter with an a7s ii in most scenarios simply because the flexibility  basic usability of the former is just so far ahead of the latter
    also once you factor in the cost of a hd video link the diy approach isnt much if any cheaper    and yes composing shots/video on an analogue 58ghz feed really is fucking horrendous  ive done it
    i guess i dont see a several hundred/thousand dollar value difference between the hd link to the camera and just using an fpv camera to see what the gopro is looking at end of the day you get nice pictures and i got the fun of dicking around with a large quad
  having zero control over a gopro vs having complete control over a dji camera isnt even a competition if you dont see that i guess you just dont have much/any experience with photography
  this
  people need to understand that flying a gopro is not the same as actual aerial photography
  youre in a diy thread mate    of course im not a professional photographer and i probably never will be which is exactly the reason why the camera integration costing me at least twice what a diy drone would obviously i could just buy a used phantom 3 or 4 for 400 but wheres the fun in that
  you dont have to be a professional photographer to see the benefits of proper camera controls  go to /p/ and ask
  honest to god i would definitely have to be a photographer to appreciate the 3000 difference between a good f450 and an inspire
    were not talking about professional features  controls were talking about the sort of really basic fundamental stuff that even a completely clueless person wanting to take photos  videos from the air will find themselves wanting  needing like literally just swapping between taking photos  videos or tapping on the screen to fix the exposure the same as any random smartphone user is familiar with the first time you fly near water  the sun reflection completely blows out the picture    and as i already said it doesnt cost you at least twice because a hd video link for a diy build will run you a lot of money as much as a complete second hand dji and again as i already said filming via an analogue 58ghz feed simply isnt viable    i literally spent months building  tweaking a pixhawk quad with a gopro transmitting over an analogue feed it was fucking garbage then i bought a spark  havent used the pixhawk quad for any sort of filming since
  i think we all here know how fun it is to fly around with a gopro and a 58ghz fpv setup on your quad but when you say aerial photography it isnt referring to the toys of our hobby youre referring to the tools of a profession   if you just want to diy a quad with a camera to goof around with then just say so dont act like youll be a photographer with a homebrew setup equal to a dji because you just wont be youll be a hobbyist with a cool toy nothing wrong with that
  if you just want to diy a quad with a camera to goof around with then just say so  nothing wrong with that    this    if your goal is actually to shoot aerial photos/videos buy a dji    if your goal is actually to have fun goofing around with a diy project  shooting aerial photos/videos doesnt actually matter build something yourself
late to the thread but heres my current build before its maiden flight
    besides diy is more fun to fly than the dji dji is great for photos because its very stable and easy to fly but theyre not very exciting compared to something like a race quad    though i will admit that those new mavics can be pretty speedy
    just wanting to dick around with a diy is what i meant the entire time pretty sure i said that    didnt realize photography would be taken so literally my bad gonna have to come up with another word to describe taking pictures    now that weve established im seeking diy in the diy board hows the pixhawk why is there a 246 and 248 21 cube and why are simonk escs still a thing
  is there only 1 screw holding on the top plate
  t dji viral marketer
how big of a moment do i need to generate from the control surfaces in order to reliably control the roll axis of a 6 foot wingspan plane
j bardwell just made a videya about someyne getting sexually assualted at an fpv meet he disabled comments and im 2lazy to find any info anywhere not censored so do you /diwhy/ers know what happened
  friend got groped hes mad and cant mention names so he gave them a public fuck you without mentioning them im sure the race coordinaters he was talking about are subbed to his channel everyone in this hobby is    before the comments were disabled someone that might be/is not sure the victims husband commented on the video saying she claims the guy actually got up her skirt and fiddled around while she was under the goggles     honestly i could care less shes upset about it now but claims at the time she was flying in a crowded area for some expo or something and didnt want to dump the quad for public safety concerns but if someone is fingering you she should have just done it or easily could have gotten the quad to a safe place at the speed they fly sounds like the kind of drama he should have kept off his channel if you ask me
  i know the deets im just looking for the names here on the last bastion of free speech
  yea dawg lost the other ones lol havent had a single problem with it though
  surely you have other m3 screws laying around    that plate is essentially holding your camera in
retarded question    would it matter much if i used 11 inch prop guards instead of 10 inch my props are 10inch    the 10inch prop guards are out of stock for weeks now and i am tired of waiting
  just wanting to dick around with a diy is what i meant the entire time pretty sure i said that    eh you said whats the best platform to run a diy photography drone from so many of us assumed you wanted to do photography    hows the pixhawk why is there a 246 and 248 21 cube    pixhawk refers to a range of open source hardware designs which has led to a myriad of variants of varying quality under varying often confusing names essentially the big ones are the original pixhawk 1 including the 246  248 variants that youre talking about  i forget where the 24x actually comes from         the newer pixhawk 2 cube        the df13 connectors on the top of the pixhawk 1 are cancer im amazed i havent broken one yet but i had come across them before in a different project where i immediately broke one    also be aware that there are two firmware options for pixhawk hardware  there is px4  there is arducopter the latter is more mature  generally more popular to the point that lots of tutorials will just use arducopter without even mentioning that there is an alternative    why are simonk escs still a thing    most of the benefits of blheli dont really apply to big quads so the nonracingdrone community have been slow to adopt them most people building a big copter potentially carrying an expensive camera will choose something tried  tested rather than the newest  best on paper this is why the ancient massive hobbywing xrotor 40a escs are the goto for so many big quad builds because there is so much history of them handling big slow highstator motors without desync issues etc
i have a taranis q x7 and a nazam v2 fc and i need to buy a receiver i narrowed my search down to the following ones    d8rii plus  d8rii xp  x8r    which one of these should i go with    i want basic telemetry rssi  battery voltage at least and then as many channels as possible
  take a look here        the d series is old/obsolete  is generally lacking in modern serial interfaces the x series is the current generation now the naza isnt the most modern fc so an older d series receiver might actually be a better choice depending on what connections the naza has    the d8rii plus doesnt have a combined serial output so you would have to run one wire per channel between it  the fc the d8rxp has a combined single wire cppm output but it only carries 8 channels the x8r has a combined single wire sbus output that carries 16 channels so take a look at whether the naza supports cppm or sbus the latter would be preferable but if it only has cppm that would still be preferable over running individual wires per channel    the x8r also has smartport telemetry while the d series receivers use some other protocol for telemetry that ive never heard of
  quick sidenote i dont actually have a nazam v2 but a nazam lite with the v2 firmware flashed on it i havent test flown it yet but everything seems to be working fine including the gps/compass          both of them support sbus among some other protocols that i am not sure of    if i go with the x8r would i still have rssi and battery voltage telemetry
where is a good place to live to fly    where i live in maryland usa the weather is always raining just rained about to rain or gusting 20 mph it has something to do with the jet stream or whatever    right now its sunny warm but traffic lights are swaying in the wind    im lucky if i get a few days to fly out of a whole month
  if i go with the x8r would i still have rssi and battery voltage telemetry    if the fc supports smartport yes      where is a good place to live to fly    not scotland _
  it doesnt   is there any way i can get basic stuff like rssi and battery voltage without using smart port or a bunch of external sensors
  well rssi comes from the receiver itself not from the fc at least with frsky x series receivers so you will always get that but you would either need a smartport or similar connection to the fc or an external sensor for battery voltage    the other simple option for battery voltage if youre going to fly with a fpv camera is to use a camera that has a voltage sense pin  displays the voltage on the cameras osd any modern ccd camera will do this the vsen pin on picrelated
  so if i dont use a camera i basically have to buy an external battery voltage sensor that hooks up to the receiver directly correct
  yup something like picrelated    the only other option is just a little buzzer that you connect to the battery  beeps when it reaches a certain voltage but thats obviously only any good if youre close enough to hear it
  i can hear one of those buzzers a mile across my neighborhood those cheap ass ones you get for battery voltage are loud as fuck
  and i basically connect the balance lead to the sensor and then the sensor to the receiver and im good to go    if i want to add another sensor in the future will i be able to daisy chain them or will i have to choose between the two of them the x8r has one sbus connector right
  sounds like youre confusing sbus  smartport sbus is rc control signals going from the receiver to your fc smartport is for telemetry data you want to get beamed from the receiver to your transmitter    afaik you can daisy chain multiple smartport sensors of different types to a single smartport connector on a receiver im guessing its like i2c      i can struggle to hear them from 100ft if its windy
  just messed it up while typing    thanks for your help
    presumably youre flying fpv if youre far enough away to struggle hearing it solder a led to a resistor and some wires and to the buzzer and position it so that its in the fov of the fpv when the led starts blinking youre out of juice
  and if its the same type of voltage warning thing i have for my car that plugs into the balance charging plug on the battery it actually already has a led so you could just use some velcro to mount it beneath the camera
  if youre flying fpv you can just use a camera like  that has voltage osd    and anyway you can easily fly far enough los that a battery beeper is inaudible
im thinking of trying to get a cheap start to some fpv practice more on the racing side any place that might have black friday deals on parts
  if you want a cheap start/practice buy a taranis qx7 and velicidrone     get the first 400 crashes out of the way for 120 and no damage worst case scenario you dont like it and you sell the qx7 on fpv marketplace for 100
  should probably have called it fpv quad its very common to use a gopro in addition to a 58ghz fpv camera so its the perfect description of a hobby photo quad
  well shit like the s500 isnt exactly what most people think when you ask about when you ask for an fpv quad with a gopro    i want to build a drone for taking pictures i know someone with a 250 sized quad with a pixhawk mini and it flies stable but shakes alot in the wind he assumes its because the pixhawk is made for 450 sized quads so i wanna give that a go      right now the pixhawk 4 is getting shit because its got some kinks to work out and the 21 is a little more than i was looking to spend whats so bad about the connectors on the pixhawk 1 are they all like that or just remakes from places other than holybro
i dont really see any great black friday deals     i just got 2 silicone gel pads for under 2    but it would be good to see some more buy one get one free battery sales
  rc stuff is largely made in china and extremely cheap already the profit margins are thin i wouldnt expect any good sales
  shakes alot in the wind  djis do too they solve this by using software stabilisation on the image
  racedayquads had a bunch of batteries at 999 so thats basically buy one get one they also have 5 off their entire store and 10 off their brand stuff    getfpv has 5 off random shit and a code for 10 off your order    frankly im disappointed too i was hoping to get a good deal on a taranis of some sort and its respective r9 module but 15 off is the most i can find anywhere
is 45 mph too fast for aerial surveying and mapping anything much slower than that and my drone will start to stall
i bought the r9m back when they had the price war with tbs for 30 and they shipped it awhile ago but i still dont have it
  how the fuck do you make a drone stall are you using a bicopter or some shit drones are pretty much specifinally designed to hover i didnt know a quad could stall
  had the same thought
  he said drone semi autonomous not a quad or any n copter    rc planes and helicopters have gps fpv routes and gyro stabilization too
  planes sure but i didnt know rc helicopters were used in surveying
        yes its a fixed wing but does anybody have experience with this
  i want to build a drone for taking pictures    were back to the same issue it sounds like your goal is to take aerial photos in which case you really should just buy dji      whats so bad about the connectors on the pixhawk 1 are they all like that    they are incredibly easy to break when disconnecting cables if you havent used them before theyre not all like that though      most dji products dont use software stabilization they just rely on gimbals i think the spark is possibly the only dji quad that uses software stabilization because it only has a 2axis gimbal      depends on the resolution/detail you need the closer to the ground you fly the more detail you get but the slower you need to be so you dont get motion blur if you cant fly under 45mph that will severely limit you itll be fine if youre surveying large areas of forest but if youre trying to build a point cloud of a house itll be useless
    drone  multicopter  fucking normies  reeeeeee    protip your racing quad is not a drone and a plane flying a pattern on inav is
  your racing quad is not a drone    depends who you talk to im assuming youre interpretation is that any uav that cant fly semiautonomously without constant operator control is not a drone but thats certainly not a universally adopted definition
  semiautonomous  ok call that a drone  not autonomous in any way like your racing/freestyle quad  not a drone so dont refer to it as such    widespread usage of the word drone has been harmful to this hobby the word drone has negative connotations because of the last 20 fucking years where they have been killing people in shithole desert nations and it was fucking stupid to embrace the term in the way it has been embraced where drone colloquially means multicopter i hate it and it is wrong usage of the term so i am going to sperg about it
  i dont have anything to do with drones/copters but i absolutely agree with this     perhaps it was done intentionally by them reptilian elite so that if these drones ever caused them problems they would be easier to vilify
  and here i am thinking the autist mad about a word is the normie    the definition of drone is a uav therefore ill call it whatever the fuck i want
  the definition of drone is a uav  wrong its a colloquial misappropriation kind of like how nationalist now means nazi for some reason
  literal definition of drone is an unmanned aircraft guided my rc or onboarding computers    get over it
    colloquial misappropriation if it isnt autonomous it isnt a drone remote control is remote control drone is semi or fully autonomous
  man you are daft as fuck
awful fucking convenient that every single fpv site ive looked at having a sale is mysteriously sold out of qx7s and x lites if i didnt know any better id say these sites are holding stock so they dont have to sell them at a sale price
    9863 with shipping  not a huge discount but still
  gee maybe it has something to do with how /pol/ is overrun with stormfags
whats a reasonable price for a uav that can fold up and fit in a backpack without disassembly but that has an eight hour endurance and 300 mile range
the delusional larper is back at it again
  battery only endurance is just 3 hours but ill interpret the fact that you think its impossible as it should be more expensive is 15k good sensors not included btw
  multirotor or fixed wing    for multirotors skyfront are the market leaders in gas/electric hybrid multirotors  theyre current offering picrelated doesnt even come close to your 8 hours/300 miles its also way too big for a backpack which is a good indication that such a vehicle simply doesnt/cant exist even if you have 50k to throw at it    for fixed wing maybe some sort of powered sail plane could stay up that long but would probably be massively dependent on meteorological conditions i dont know much about planes somebody else can chime in on how infeasible your requirements are
  its a tandem fixed wing with solar panels
  fixed wing  honestly it depends more on location than weather some areas will have truly exceptional upwinds letting you fly basically indefinitely with a lowpower receiver and servos without solar panels you could fly all day in one of these places and with them you could stay up as long as the plane holds together charging your battery during the day
my r9m showed up and i spend the day taking my quad apart flashing firmwares and resoldering everything then programming the radio ect      took a few hours of messing with it but i got the system setup and its arming its dark now so i cant do any testing till morning but i think its all working and i should have rssi in the osd    in the morning i will go for a test flight with the new radio link and see how it does
  did you have to update the firmware on the xlite r9m and receiver    last time i looked into it you had to do all 3 seems like some shit to me retailer would have a way easier time than most customersdoing that stuff
   i have a qx7s and yea i had to update the opentx firmware to 222    and i had to flash the r9m and the receiver it would not let me flash the r9m with the original opentx on the radio 220     its pretty easy to do the flashing for radio and the module but for the rx you have to solder on a sport wire and use that to flash plugging into your radio
  retailer would have a way easier time than most customersdoing that stuff    retailers arent going to spend their time opening factory sealed components to update their firmware especially when its a process anybody involved with this hobby should be used to/expecting to have to do what about 3 months down the line when a new firmware is released are you going to ship your equipment back to the retailer so they can update it for you ffs
buddy of mine is willing to sell me a dominator v2 for 100 bucks and a xjb145 for 130 should i bite
  dominator v2 for 100 bucks    definitely thats an absolute steal if theyre in usable condition    xjb145 for 130    no thats barely cheaper than the brand new price
  oh the xjb is in new condition im still new so i was going to combine the xjb the dominator and a qx7 as a starter kit and work my way from there does that seem like a reasonable 300 starting point
i flew my r9m  100mw and it was feeling pretty nice     i did a test in my yard about 2 acre area with trees and some traintracks behind     it felt really solid and did everything my 24 used to do and a bit more i plan on flying it in the adaptive mode when i wanna get some range it switches from 100mw to 1watt on its own     ive ordered a super 8 antenna from frsky to replace the long dipole one it works a bit better and it will fit into my backpack easier
  the dom v2 is 169 so you will need cameras with 169 image output normal 43 camera images will appear stretched
has anybody here experimented with making their own liion packs instead of using lipos what are your experiences
  the amp draw limitations are what kill you they arent very good for small applications     if youre building a big efficient platform that can carry a lot of weight for the power required you can see substantial duration gains using liion just dont expect a highperformance rig out of it     long range / long duration builds go liion  high performance / small size lipo all the way
  what if you had a small high c lipo for takeoff and then switch to liion for cruise
does anyone here know any discount codes for hobbyking hobbyking10 isnt working for me anymore
are there any appreciable differences between props designed for quads versus props designed for fix wings if so what are they
  dominator v2 isnt 169 dominator v3 is
  it would be a pretty weird scenario in which you only needed high throttle for takeoff  then knew for definite youd never want high throttle during flight
if i wanted to build a quad strictly for speed/racing would it be better to go with a powerful motor like a 2306 2400kv or a lighter 22xx
  specifically looking at the dys samguk motors so i guess im asking which of the series will get me the highest top speed
    remember that top speed doesnt mean fastest when it comes to racing something that wins in a straight line race wont necessarily win in an actual race with corners/gates
  check some of the frame manufacturers like armattan and catalyst machineworks and see what theyre recommending for setups most racers are flying 6s and lower kv motors right now and 2206 looks like its a common size
  id check rotorbuilds before listening to potentially shill recommendations from frame manufacturers
  i didnt say buy from them i just said check their websites for motor size/kv recommendations he can figure out what he wants then buy from somewhere reasonably priced
  just dont bother reading the recommended parts that banggood copy  pastes onto seemingly every frame they sell  they still list naze32  20a escs 3
  viral marketing  for the industry standard hardware  ok bro
  yeah theyll just add more weight what are you flying that needs 10 training wheels though
  what you want is a weather balloon a good one is 600
      ok well ive looked around and cant say ive learned mucba but what i was asking it seems people just slap whatever motor they like the looks of into their quads usually solely making sure the kv is good     i guess i really just want to know in general would a 2306 2500kv motor be better for racing than a 2207 2600kv would be paired with 30a escs and probably no more than 5050 props     i have freestyle and hybrid builds now i want something that zips around a track handles well on turns the usual race requirements im aware im asking about cheap ads motors which limits the performance but its what i can do right now
  i guess i really just want to know in general would a 2306 2500kv motor be better for racing than a 2207 2600kv    honestly id say most people couldnt actually tell the difference its certainly not a big enough difference that your skill as a pilot wont still by far be the limiting factor in your racing performance    right now kabab waxes lyrical about 22xx over anything 23xx but give him 6 months  hell probably swear blind that the opposite is actually best
how often to quads experience motor/ prop/ esc failure and what is the most common failure mode also how much more prone to failure are those nifty folding props
i have an old 10 parrot ar drone my neighbor gave me a while back can i repurpose the parts at all is it even worth doing
  props never unless you crash or dont tighten them down correctly  motors will eventually wear out but again they usually break from crashing before that  escs typically fail due to an issue with the build where a voltage spike fucks it up or due to overheating thats pretty common
  well of that list props would be the biggest concern you dont get better at flying without trying new shit or taking a risk and when you do that you crash good crash with fuck up all 4 props     after that the bearings in motors wear down eventually some people replace them most just replace the entire motor since the windings and magnets degrade over the same period a good impact will also fuck a motor up pretty easily though a bent shaft or a broken magnet is a dead motor usually you can try to replace a magnet but youll likely never get the motor balanced    thus far in my journey it seems escs are usually the first part to just give up theyll fly fine one battery and shit out mid flight the next according to everything ive read if you manage to hit your esc in a crash itll magically shit out in the next few flights as well
    so pretty much the only way my quad is going to fall out the sky excluding user error is by esc failure how often does that happen
  very often if theres something wrong with your build or the esc itself as often as every time i push throttle past 50  or as infrequently as sometimes when i push throttle to 100 but not always    if everything is put together correctly and tested it should never happen  though you still might get esc failure if you run 5 batteries back to back and you have poor air circulation which results in overheating
anyone recognize if this is a clone and if so what of on amazon its called the usmile xsu220 about the lightest frame i can find with decent reviews and replacement arms sold     think im gonna give it a try but im trying to see if i can find stl files for antenna mounts and other random crap getting nothing for xsu220 or anything close to it
  theres like 20 different frames on aliexpress that look exactly like that so thats probably one of those
  its definitely one of the frames that looks just like that    while that was a retarded answer you still made me think to just reverse image search it its the xsr220 from banggood or the xbeesr
thedronekingca
  thanks for the virus
  rarely if ever when built correctly ive been flying for coming up on 3 years everything from tiny brushed micros up to a 14 prop pixhawk setup  i have never had a motor prop or esc fail during flight a failsafe is far more likely
    if youre flying hard every weekend and rarely crash the gates on the esc burn shut thus locking up one rotor before anything else typically within 36 months a friend swears he never has this problem because he alternated between 3 quads every battery change but im not sure this is 100 true high amperage/low cost escs shit the bed withing the two month mark for me every time if youre tuned out of wack soldered shitty joints used the wrong esc/motor/prop combo the time to failure decreases exponentially     the pms in your motors lose magnetism after a while but youre more than likely going to bend a rotor before that unless youre flying a photography rig or something that lands itself     a good pc or gn prop only goes bad if you hit something or push crazy hard or fly in terrible wind but if youre not hitting shit youre not pushing yourself keep it exciting for the lowlow cost of a 3000 count bag of props also go with a thick frame so youre not constantly replacing arms too     gyros go out of wack with time just by the nature of how they work so dont plan to have the same board for the rest of your life ive also had a voltage regulator short and smoke both the fc and battery     lastly only fly with fixed props
  if youre flying hard every weekend and rarely crash the gates on the esc burn shut thus locking up one rotor before anything else typically within 36 months    bullshit ive literally never heard anybody say anything about this in all the years ive been flying  even people slamming dozens of packs every weekend on race practice
there is some seriously bad advice in these threads on occasion      the gates on the esc burn shut    no they dont    high amperage/low cost escs shit the bed withing the two month mark for me every time    either youre buying absolute shit or youre doing something seriously wrong    or push crazy hard or fly in terrible wind    if youre breaking props midair youve chosen unsuitable props doesnt matter how hard youre pushing or how bad the wind is props dont just explode anymore    gyros go out of wack with time just by the nature of how they work    no they dont thats not how mems components work    lastly only fly with fixed props    folding props are fine in many situations just look at lots of djis current lineup or even freeflys alta cinema platforms
the guy who invented the lipo battery says that he can make a new lithium solid state battery that is safer has more capacity smaller lighter and basically better in every way even cheap to make when they start to make them
  you neglected to mention the maximum discharge rate
     its good and they charge in minutes not hours
the first solid state lithium batteries are going to be used in the samsung phone in 2019
mr goodenough says the new solid state battery can have 5  10 times the capacity of current lipos     and the battery will last 3 times as long more charging cycles
        its cool and all but im damn near willing to bet there wont one available for rc use at a decent price for years after they come out companies dont just vastly improve a product and sell it fairly doesnt matter if their cheaper to make bet a 1500mah 4s solid state will be 100 or more when getfpv get ahold of it
  this is why you buy direct from china
  well based on current patterns a 100 tattu or luminier battery would still cost 85 from banggood or cnhl
  if one battery can really fly at least 5 times as long its worth it and also really fast recharge means you can have less batteries and just cycle them
the best thing about them is they wont catch fire and burn your house down
any revolutionary new battery tech like this is gonna take years to actually reach our hands so why even bother getting excited yet
    good points    i kinda still think the norm for most people would have 1 or 2 solid states and 10 regular lipos the way some people are in this hobby the solid state would be for 50 of the flying and the lipos would be for the 5 minute window when the solid state is charging
  so why even bother getting excited yet    if its as good as they say it could ramp up very fast unlike most battery breakthroughs this one is already in production rather than and after further research
  well companies have been developing this stuff for years now     and its about to be deployed in the new samsung phone instead of a regular lipo so that is exciting
  tbf if you abuse todays regular lipos a bit  charge them at 5c remember that many of them claim to safely support at least 5c charge rates even if there may be truth to the argument that higher charge rates reduce the overall lifespan of the pack you can fly all day with half a dozen flight packs  one big field charging pack
  i have 3 batteries that claim they can charge at 5c pretty sure the highest ive gone was 3c usually i do 2
  i almost always charge at 1c but i fly with people that charge at 5c in the field  weve never had any surprises even when theyre charging chinabrand packs infinity etc
  im just impatient i guess youre not supposed to keep your batteries charged for days at a time and i dont plan when im gonna fly far enough ahead to charge them i usually charge some packs just before i fly2c gets 3 packs done in 3045 minutes
  so why even bother getting excited yet    if we as a community get hyped for solid state batteries wont the companies want to make them for us     i mean its supply and demand they all want to generate profit      i think the more hyped we get for solid state batteries the faster we will get them      what is the worst thing about our hobby      the batteries for sure short flight times you have to always swap them out you need to buy a bunch of them they are extremely dangerous and make us worry all the time they are big and heavy the weight of the battery is nearly the same as the quad itself they can fail and burn up our entire quad or set fire to fields ect
  do you not have a parallel board with a decently powerful charger you can have half a dozen packs done in 20 minutes via a parallel board without exceeding 1c per pack      i think you overestimate the influence our tiny hobby has but dont lose spirit
  i do have a parallel board at 1s my 1300mah take alot more than 20 minutes though
  whats your charger either it cant actually put out enough power for 1c to each pack or its balance circuity is really weak
  i have a hitec x1mf claims its capable of 10 amps/80w and according to the screen thats what it outputs not sure what to tell you at 3a it takes maybe an hour to charge 3 batteries when theyre all plugged at the same time
  sounds like it has weak balancing circuitry then same problem the imax b6 has  itll charge them up pretty much full then spend the same amount of time again balancing the cells
  not really sure it works so i dont really care i always assumed it was doing them one at a time or some shit
is the pixhawk and px4 the only fc good enough for autopilot/sensor heavy drones    for shits and giggles want to build a racer drone with autonomous capability and it looks like only the pix/px4 has support for a majority of the sensors i might want to use
  well inav can run on a few f4 boards and a couple even have the bootloader preinstalled that being said i dont know shat sensors you want to use and arducopter is way better than inav    also use arducopter not px4 i built a 250 with a pixfalcom this summer and while calibration was easier with px4 i couldnt find a way to mess with the pids so the copter never got off the ground until i put arducopter 357 and some pids more suitable for smaller quads on there
whats the cheapest good 3s4s prebuilt quad with fpv osd all that good stuff  have a q x7
  where can i get a metal grid like in op picture
  its called gridwall its a common shopfitting material
  it seems that there isnt a very well supported miniature board for arducopter i would have to go for the full sized variant
  pixracer is plenty well supported
  look at the pixhawk mini
anybody got advice on simple rc boats i have a 3d printer so that would be my preferable construction method rather than trying to build a hot wire cutter  sourcing foam from somewhere ive got plenty of old escs i can dunk in epoxy  sacrificial motors i dont care about wrecking with corrosion
  hey guys really new to rc i just ordered the jjrc jjpro x5 which i found on sale is it worth it or did i fuck up
  well depends how much you spent on it p    the range youll get controlling it over wifi from your phone will be pretty limited  onscreen joysticks suck compared to real physical ones but it should still be plenty of fun you might be able to use a dirt cheap bluetooth gamepad to give you some physical sticks might be worth investigating
  i spend 120 euros including shipping i got it on cyber monday and im certain it has its own controller with real joysticks you cant move it from the phone just monitor it and enable certain features im not really sure about the range though ive seen a handful of videos about the drone and one dude flew it 1km away and still had connectivity but the others had around 600m if i recall correctly
  oh it looks like there are different versions  the one i clicked on when i googled didnt have a controller but now i see other versions that do
    brushless motors and all those features for 114 im considering one now far as i concerned after looking at it as long as everything works its definitely worth it only thing you should have done was gotten the 2 battery version
  only thing you should have done was gotten the 2 battery version  i was planning to but the website doesnt ship the 2 battery version in my country sucks but im still satisfied with my purchase  this is it btw 
  its called gridwall its a common shopfitting material    thanks anon
  pixhawk mini   seems to be discontinued        is it i dont really see that much discussion surrounding it but admittedly that may be because the software running it is generic
  the only thing holybro still makes is the full sized pixhawk 21 pixhawk 4 and now the pixhawk 4 mini i suppose you could get a pixhawk 4 mini but its only been announced so not out yet that and the pixhawk 4 has been getting shit for bot being as good as the 21 holybro and a bunch of fans say thats because its only been out since this summer    as for the pixhawk mini getfpv has a package for it for 165 includes the pixhawk power board telemetry units and arguably holybros best gps as well as all needed wires theres some general support around the net if you just google it and holybro will still answer questions about it if you email them     its pretty straight forward to assemble all the sensors have a wire and a spot they connect to on the flight controller only soldering you have to do is the power to the esc/motors on the pdb esc signal wires connect directly to a female pwm lead that plugs into the signal port on the pixhawk you just have to keep in mind the mini isnt fully as capable as the full sized mainly it lacks the aux ports to control landing gear or a gimble with the flight controller but you probably wouldnt have that on a 250 quad anyways    if you do decide to go this route look up 250 quad with pixfalcon far as i can tell the pixfalcon and the pixhawk mini are basically the same thing reason i say look that up is i had to use the pids on an ardupilot forum post to get my 250 off the ground pixhawks are defaulted to be used on 450 sized quads so the default pids wont work on a smaller one my built shook so bad it wouldnt even get off the ground until i copied the pids from the forum i mentioned also as i said previously use arducopter not px4
when buying motors how does one tell if a motor is good or a piece of shit  it seems like i can buy motors with the same specs from two different brands and one will get my quad to 90mph and the other will top out at 20mph
     the quality of the components in the build     usually you get what you pay for
  look up reviews for a specific motor or stick to specific brands    pretty much anything made by brotherhobby and tmotor are the 2 top quality manufacturers i see used the most lumenier emax rqd and dys all make some good ones basically just avoid anything you cant find any reviews for or have never even heard of dys and racerstar make a line of 10 motors which have good reviews but they seem to be somewhat hit or miss as far as qc goes on the bearings which you can just replace if you feel inclined
  cool thanks for that advice    do you have any opinion on the pixracer at all
  cool thanks for that advice    do you have any opinion on the pixracer at all
  ive never used the pixracer but just from a quick look on holybros site it looks like the pixhawk mini and the pixracer use identical components cpu ram baro/accel ect meaning the pixracer is probably just the current pixfalcon mini probably cheaper to make or something i dont know for sure    the only real difference i can find between the 2 is the pixracer comes with the necessary components to enable wifi on the board which im no expert but as far as i know a wifi connection to your quad can only do the exact shit a telemetry radio can but likely will less range     far as im concerned i would still get the pixhawk mini the bundle from getfpv includes telemetry and gps cant find a similar package with the pixracer if youre going to be putting fpv on your quad you probably wouldnt even be able to use the wifi from the pixracer i have an action camera that can connect to an app via 58ghz plugging my quad in with that connected to the app my vtx blows the signal away in a second tops
  afaik they use an esp8266 for the wifi module which means the range will be fairly useless if you want decent telemetry above the capabilities of your 24ghz radio then a 433/915mhz 3dr module is cheap effective  has plugplay functionality with arducopter
is uavfutures 99 build any good  if not what should i buy instead
     its a bit outdated and hard to find all the parts in that build     follow this instead it uses the new mamba stack that is pretty good and cheap which saves money    
what do i need to buy to have a plane as manouverable as this    
  i know almost nothing about planes but id guess that its a very light body with a 3d propeller eg the propeller can turn backwards for those instant reverses in direction
  3d profile plane most cant fly backwards but can hover and do the other aerobatics hes using a collective pitch prop as shown at the end of this video     
i have a 6cell 4500mah nimh battery of unknown history when i discharge it with my chargers discharge function at 05a i get 3300mah out of it untill it stops i dont have a point of reference so my question is is this normal ok kinda bad or fucked
  whay kind of lamp is that at the desk look cool
  can you even crash that without deliberately trying to seems like it can escape any situation with ease
    i think i worked out why whoops dont fly very long
  theyre super controllable and very easy to crash if you dont have experience imagine if youre about to crash in five seconds you accidentally jitter a bit with the sticks and instead crash immediately if you want something easy to fly get a basic foam plane theyre usually made for newbs to be able to fly and if you crash they usually dont break and repairs are easy if it does break ultralight 3d planes youll instead be messing with carbon fibre rods and whatnot
  taotronics
  can you even crash that without deliberately trying to  it doesnt fly itself 3d planes are usually stable in different orientations but dont have the selfleveling tendencies that a high wing with dihedral would have to back up what  said theyre not for beginners
for the people who dont have an acre in their backyard where do you go to fly  do you have a usual spot where there are no people that you go to
  most people go to public parks as far as ive seen just fly at times where there arent as many people or places there arent as many    do some google searches id bet there are some public football fields or schools that serve as rec centers on the weekends where you can fly if youre comfortable flying over pavement i see office buildings are popular when theres no one there on weekends
  are you concerned about the legality of it  my issue flying in a park is somebody might call the police or something and also i might hit someone
  depends on the country    most 1st world areas the drone owner probably knows more about the laws than the cops so no most of us dont worry about legality as long as you arent buzzing aircraft control towers frequent low flying aircraft airspace 400m or intentionally pissing people off most people dont care someone bugs you or the cops just show up calmly explain that you need to safely land your drone before you can talk to them then tell them what youre doing in most cases people will leave you alone when they realize youre just messing around some might bug you over noise or some crap but to be completely fair unless the park youre in specifically bans drones they have no business complaining whatsoever    someone threatens to call the cops just leave most of the time theyll ask you to anyways because they dont want to deal with a suburban soccermom bitching at things she doesnt understand either
reminder to register your drone with the faa pass the pilots exam and pay your fee
  pass the pilots exam     i thought this was going to be an online test they want me to make an appointment for some aviation college ffs
i just looked as some of the sample questions and i have no words for how stupid this is    they clearly took these right out of a part 107 test
  in germany thanks to dronefags every rc pilot now gets to do a 0effort online test and pay 30 every 5years thanks dronefags
  where are you seeing this ive not seen any news about them actually having the test ready       dont you feel safer anon
  click how to become a drone pilot and it brings up a page with info    they want us to learn a bunch of airplane pilot jargon
  thats part 107 
    do you have to pass an exam if you registered under 107 i thought you only had to pass an exam if you wanted to fly commercially
      god dammit i dont mind doing the test but i am sure my father wont want to do this horseshit and i was going to get him a drone for christmas i swear when some hajji shithole uses a suas its going to get fucked six ways from sunday and itll be easier to get a drivers license than to fly a drone
fark em the fnaa is running a bluff theres no way in hell they can enforce this thing what are they going to do hire 10000 drone cops give them my name  yeah right     stay away from airports people and below 400 feet    most importantly just fly
  part 107 is commercial do you people even read any of this       just buy it for him see 
  how can they enforce this
  he was trolling they cant
  someone calls the cops on you  the cops show up ask to see your license and the drones each drone must have its own registration printed on it fee paid separately for each drone  just like owning a car
is there any cfd solver that isnt complete ass to use  i have two basic requirements which literally every programmer who doesnt do cfd seems to have no trouble with  it accepts meshes instead of some rare/unique file format  it has a gui instead of being a command line tool
anything missing from this list to get started into fpv with the whoop size category i had to shop different sites getfpv amazon ebay cause of stock missing on getfpv id order everything there if i could or retarded battery shipping restrictions to the 50th state hence ebay assume i have nothing other than a soldering iron
  buy an extra frame and motors
  you can use a 2s lipo in your q x7 you know  just pop out the aa battery thing on the back and it plugs right in via the balance plug
are there specific guidelines for where anticollision lights need to be placed on a drone will just sticking one on top make it reasonably visible or do i legally have to buy as many as it takes to cover all sides of the drone  10729 seems to suggest it just needs to have the lights at all but i figured id ask in case their positioning is part of the definition of anticollision or something
  stick a light on each arm unless youre willing to lawyer up if a policeman decides that the paragraph doesnt imply only one light is sufficient    not that any policeman is going to know anything about this law much easier to go after speeding people
  what are you trying to model  maybe i can do it on paper for you if its nothing too complex    you could just run away before the cops show up theres no license plate to track you or anything fuck this disobey and it will get dropped as unenforceable
  on the underside of each arm  would that be sufficient for planes to be able to see the drone from the side/above at night or do i need one on top as well
  just cover the drone in led strips if you want to be sure you shouldnt be flying anywhere near planes to begin with
just how sensitive are the motors we use for out quads    obviously balance is major but what else can fuck them up i got an order from getfpv today and 2 of my motors look like they were used once bottom bearing on 1 has a noticeable dent in it and the c clip on the second has clearly been removed and put back on bent out of place and rotates
  you shouldnt be flying anywhere near planes to begin with  i know but i assume plane collisions are why the faa requires anticollision lighting at all  can you get led strips that are visible to 3 statue miles
  youre taking this way too serious man you do not need collision lights    every single one oft he faas rules regarding drones are general suggestions they have no possible way to enforce 95 of them and the people that would enforce them dont know about 99 oft he laws in any situation you should be nowhere near any other aircraft that would actually see those lights mainly because the only rules that most drone pilots do obey would leave you well away from planes and well below their minimum cruising altitude     now if you have honest plans to fly your drone 900 feet in the air above an airport then by all means get some collision lights just know that youll still get arrested
  thats why you want lights on your drone i assumed you just wanted them to fly in the dark or something sure you can get leds that are visible three miles away but theyll be impractically heavy and draw loads of power at that point youre basically asking for car headlight level lumens and for a led that means you also need a heatsink and maybe even a cooling fan    just ignore those retarded laws no policeman is going to give a fuck as long as youre not unreasonably bothering people and even then theyll grab you for disturbing the peace or harassment or whatever not failure to comply with statute 38905bd of the federal aviation whatever chances are the policeman wont even know that the faa regulates hobby rc aviation at all
  brushless motors are mechanically very simple if you can turn it by hand itll spin just fine    you should still send them back and demand new ones resale of used things without telling the customer is only allowed if theyre in pristine condition and a messed up ball bearing is actually a real problem seeing as how those are the parts that wear out quickest
  yea thats what i figured just sent them a support message    wonder what theyll have me do something this cheap banggood would just tell me to keep
  i find that the best chance of getting to keep the broken stuff is if you start by offering to send them back in return for new ones it shows good faith
  its actually amazing how good the service is from banggood and aliexpress  ive always gotten a full refund when there has been an issue with a product from either site
    rules regarding drones are general suggestions  hobby rc aviation  im flying commercially under part 107 not as a hobbyist i wouldnt worry about the lights otherwise  im just trying to legally cover my ass just in case      i assumed you just wanted them to fly in the dark or something sure you can get leds that are visible three miles away but theyll be impractically heavy  i want them to fly during twilight since i dont have time for a waiver and the lights are required for that i already found a couple tiny led boards that satisfy the visibility i was just asking about how many of them id have to buy or if led strips with that visibility exist since you suggested that
  if youre actually going to be flying in situations where anticollision lights are required use a proper commercial solution where the manufacturer vouches that they are up to spec  at least then if something goes wrong  your leds are found to be inadequate that liability will fall on the led manufacturer instead of you          you do not need collision lights    except you do in some situations  if i want to extend my pfco to allow me to do commercial drone work at night any drone i flew would legally need to meet certain lighting requirements
  im flying commercially under part 107 not as a hobbyist  those anons are wrong anyway everyone has to register and follow the rules regardless if they are flying recreationally or commercially  just like if youre flying a manned aircraft   imagine if real aircraft pilots didnt have to follow the rules just because they were flying for fun
  wew that ones even cheaper than the one i was looking at i could get one of those for each side just to be safe  does flytron ship to burgerland
  huh i didnt even notice they were a uk company  i just came across them on sale at one of my regular uk stockists  bought some out of curiosity    if flytron themselves wont ship to the us flyingtechcouk stock them  ship worldwide
  itd be like an airforceproud video    fucking awesome
  do those lights come with little battery packs pictured in the diagrams or do you have to buy the batteries in addition/wire them into your drone battery
  i bought them as just the bare pcbs no extras they run from 5v not direct battery voltage
  readymaderc sells flytron leds theyre bright as fuck
  we do follow the rules were just not going to register because it doesnt matter and probably never will    at that anon should have mentioned 6 hours ago he was planning on getting his commercial license probably wouldnt have gotten 3 of us telling him to fuck the lights    anything ive ever messaged banggood about that was less than around 25 they just sent me a new one and told me to keep the old one mind you everything thats happened with me with thus far was unusable anyways
  i assumed that mentioning 10729 would imply i was flying under part 107 with a part 107 license
    neat  itd be nice if you could change the pattern remotely though
blah blah blah in this thread about all these different shades of lipstick for your pigs can not one of you work on making these fucking things silent dont start telling me why it cant be done  it obviously can just think
  here you go anon
  i have some ideas involving magnetohydrodynamics but i want to patent it sorry
  considering how many people are paranoid about drone laws with hobby use i assumed you were just new and thought you had to follow shit very carefully
  im relatively positive the only viable methods that could be used to make a quad quieter would barely work and make it either horribly inefficient
  it obviously can just think  if you have an idea why not sell it to the us military im sure theyd pay big bucks for silent helicopters otherwise im pretty sure that rotor blades slamming into the air are always going to be inherently loud  i dont see why youd want them to be silent anyway people already hate drones because of the perception that people could be secretly spying on them itd only get worse if drones were actually capable of it
  lol i specially wrote dont start telling me because i knew some unreflective moron would write word for word  im pretty sure that rotor blades slamming into the air are always going to be inherently loud  dont just read words on reddit and take them down as fact dude use your mind can you really not think of any things that move up and about in the air without creating a screeching racket    the perception of secretly spying   oh noo except thats what i want it for lol     anyway im calming down because since i last looked it turns out someone finally bothered to even attempt a quiet drone and this is pretty satisfactory to me as a start you can listen to a video of this thing mavic platinum pro and its quiet since it is just done by a mod to the blade tip shape thats evidence to me that more can be done and hobbyists could also shut their shit up if they were bothered
  can you really not think of any things that move up and about in the air without creating a screeching racket  hot air balloons and dirigibles maybe otherwise not really    why dont you give me some examples
  most of american attack helicopters are shockingly quiet at least until they pass over your head if youre ahead of them you wont hear
  lmao   what about a bird nigger   or a dragonfly  or bats
  loud as fuck  ever hear a mosquito fly by your ear fucking loud dude  and they weigh like 0005 grams  a typical drone weighs 50000x more than a mosquito
  why did you say mosquito when listed other animals that are silent x is loud therefore y is loud i will ignore and assume just trolling   anyway   muh bigger   muh heavier   have a listen to this thing    i hope you see how pathetic your excuses are for using shittier brainletsuitable designs that fart up the air because you couldnt control a quadcopter with slightly larger rotors with your downloaded plug and play control algorithm absolute backyard fucktard
  all of which are many times smaller and lighter than drones are less weight means less force needed to stay aloft which means less impact noise against the air  additionally the fact that animals exist that can do x doesnt mean developing machines that can do it just as well is easy or even within the realm of possibility currently only in the past several years have we been able to develop machines that could reliably walk i think were still pretty far from being able to develop something with the flight mechanics of a bird or a mosquito
  that guy is having to put a shitload of manual power into that thing just to get it to move not to mention its the size of a small house  not exactly applicable to portable batterypowered remote control machines    whats stopping you from building your own monstrosity like that if you want it anyway
  thanks thats all obvious and redundant  the vid above not even mentioning animal wings puts paid to the claim  rotor blades slamming into the air are always going to be inherently loud  so its possible ive earlier included an example of a minute change to blade structure that cut almost all the power out of the offending frequency band listen in this video for a comparison starting 240 with the standard blade design      so all of your comment is just whining and excuses
  its big  lmao you told me a drone was going to be 5000x louder than a mosquito because a typical drone weighs 5000x more and now youre telling me you cant make your fartcopter as quiet as a huge 70 kglifting quadcopter because yours weighs 5000x less just stop its pathetic
  see  
the dood with the shaky quad is back
  the giant copters blades arent really slamming into the air so much as leisurely coasting through it its only possible because the wingspan is massive compared to the weight of the thing itd be like putting regular drone blades on one of those drones the size of a halfdollar  if you want the blades to be a sensible size compared to the body then in order to lift it theyre going to have to spin so fast that theres always going to be some level of noise they could be made a bit quieter maybe but if you want silence youre better off just flying a small dirigible with weak fans for lateral propulsion    again if you know so much about aerodynamics why dont you make and sell your own silent drones mister big shot
where do i get these magical soldering irons i see in videos that instantaneously cause solder to melt to pads  they never work like that for me
  if you know so much about aerodynamics why dont you make and sell your own silent drones  because its trivial that you just need bigger rotors  if you want the blades to be a sensible size compared to the body  sensible  so basically the objection to bigger quieter rotors is you think they would look goofy  i suspect there really is a better reason probably that you lose agility and that agility is the key for to how the shitty algorithms that control drones keep them stable with larger rotors youd have to put a too much thought into the control alg   unless you know a better reason
  is you think they would look goofy  its that i dont want to carry around a 9 square foot assembly to get my drone footage the sound is only a problem if youre near people at ground level and trying to fly something that large near people would be impractical in itself    the reason why no largescale manufacturers have built huge very quiet drones is because theres very little consumer demand for them because most people dont have autism
  9 ft  like 2 ft on a small drone would do to make it very quiet but i accept a variation of your answer about demand its not that drone pilots dont have autism its just that they dont give a shit about annoying other people with their obnoxious autistic hobby
  2 ft on a small drone would do  2 ft individual prop width or 2 ft total drone width with props
  prop width theres already 2ft wide drone that sounds like shit
  a drone with 2ft prop width would be 16 square feet at minimum when assembled that sounds like an incredible hassle to deal with
  4x4  like i said 16 square feet
  i delet cos i thought 16 square feet was something big but its not i mean to put an unnoticed drone in someones back yard or whatever  its worth it its not for hobby shitters
  unnoticed  it may be quiet but its also comparatively huge now if the homeowner happens to look out their window or anyone in the neighborhood looks in the houses direction theyre going to easily see it  youd be better off just walking by their fence and clipping a gopro or something to the top of it pointing at their window or find a spot in the area with higher elevation and use binoculars or a telescope
  soldering is more about technique  the quality of the solder itself than about the iron spend 2030 on a cheap temperature controlled iron with at least a relatively fine conical tip  a larger chisel tip to switch between depending on what youre soldering make sure youre using solder with lead in it leadfree solder is much more difficult to work with  then just practice
scenario youre in a rural environment and completely self sufficient however youre going to be under siege by a gang of roving bandits 50100 men who are equipped with small arms rifles pistols as well as improvised explosives    your goal use your /diy/ skills to defend your land and counter the bandit menace what would you build
lava moat
  build a killdozer and you are save
    please take this to /tg/
hows it going over there in south africa
mine field
  unrealistic    pretty sure 50 men are enough to overrun you or well starve you out of fuel and then go for it    that is not what /tg/ is for    would only last for so long
  then youre going to die now take this bullshit somewhere people might actually want to larp it
  blow it out your candy ass pansy
  cool havent seen a south africa thread in a while
  what would you build  an escape tunnel    or an escape vehicle    or a radio to call for help from my  50100 friends who are also equipped with small arms rifles pistols as well as improvised explosives    seriously what is one person going to do vs a fucking siege is this some kind of prepper larping session go to /k/ they love that shit
    can you please stop bullying me
  the mine field would last as long as it needs to once the first guy gets blown up they are going to move on to a less dangerous target
a brothel
  does anyone have plans for diy mines just want to check feasibility
  i dont build shit i pack the car and bail   this isnt the movies one man cant hold out against 50100 no matter what the only way to survive alone is to get moving and keep moving
  how many able bodied frens and senpai do i have with me
  a thousand idiots like you would be useless
burn down my land and make it look like ive abandoned it when in reality im hiding in a vietnamesque foxhole fucking ops mom
considering i would have undoubtedly already built a bunker i would seal the entire house and watch as the bandits enter waiting for a good number inside i would flip a switch that releases a thick metal door hanging between the front door and the house then another switch that releases ammonia and bleach through a sprinkler system
  remotely controlled dud rifles that will draw their fire away from me then silence my rifle as best i can and start picking them off     of course you would die no matter what you did
first of all haha walls surrounding you and a bridge  fill the hole with poisonous bushes and barbed wire    
  your only option is to hide you dont build anything because thats just a target you could hold up in the safest castle in the world and it will become a prison
  fire pit full auto tracking bb guns metric fuckton of them distracting and can fuck vision armored ar 15 gatling gun made with computer controlled instead of rotating barrels large armored 6 gun combo with ar 15 / 12 guage / and 4 22lr guns fire all with 1 trigger pull flamethrowers and diy explosives etc    goal 1 would be mame all threats and then casually pick them off
  fuck that piece of shit stuckdozer you want an armored track hoe get rekt
  run self destruct to heart monitor    rekt
  kek nice try fbi
  this guy gets it
  underground house several exits tunnels stone doors booby traps firing holes surpressed firearms    house site should first be scoured of dirt to bedrock construct stone block house on top of this site should have a lower elevation nearby cut trenches in bedrock to direct water there as well as drain holes in the lowest level    from here construct tunnels same as house leading all over property one tunnel should lead to a rocky outcrop by a pond    construct drinking water cisterns just a wall floor and sides lined with bentonite clay    construct storage rooms workshops armories prison/dungeon interrogation rooms hydroponics facilities battery rooms etc    walls should be 4 feet thick 7 feet tall unless youre freakishly tall or ok with shorter ceilings stone with legolike things so they stack easy no mortar chip each to fit then spray interior and exterior with shotcrete to stabilize    room size should be narrow or supported by columns    not sure how to do roof of stone or ventilation would probably just cut into arch shape and crane into place then cut a slope into top    walls and roof need to hold hundreds of thousands of pounds of soil keep rooms small buttress everything    nearby on the other side of a hill construct a hidden underground pumped hydro storage station and your official house include a few covered trenches half tunnels for quick escape to various areas not all towards fortress to avoid tipping off enemy    once its all built cover it with lots of tar plastic covering and bentonite clay    then cover it with dirt as you do this put gravel and drainage pipes and fabric down for the water drainage/control areas    plant trees that grow fast and have shallow root systems bonus if they keep people out  thorny bushes poison ivy poison oak or fence it off and make it goat pig and chicken pasture plant a few fruit or olive trees dont build structures
    plan is to flee when raiders come then poison food water cistern by official house livestock snipe those who try to flee or are leaders experienced woodsmen or too smart kidnap drunk ones for interrogation slaves surgical practise or baby makers if female    always stay sharp and leave lots of ways to slow down raiders and spot them when they first arrive    beware of doggos but try to capture rather than kill them they are useful though they are very good at finding your hidey holes    compost your poop and dead raiders its good for the soil grind bones into bonemeal for plants but dump teeth with plastic or nongold metal fillings    make sure your tunnel and trench systems are separate have multiple trench systems covered trench is just that a trench with reinforced walls a cover 1 foot above the top of the walls supported by posts and soil on top of that good for firing on enemies and hidden patroling    a stone door is a large vertical stone block with a protrusion in its top and bottom this protrusion fits into holes in the floor and ceiling and serves as the hinge you can put the hinge towards a side but it is hard to counterweight correctly    very easy to lock these doors behind you with steel wedges or log braces that fit into holes in the floor and door take days to get one open    if a raider finds an entrance kill him before he can alert others or get them all in there go above and around them seal the entrances to that room and block the ventilation it will take a few hours for them to die you can speed it up by building a small fire over/in the sole unclosed ventilation shaft then pushing the coals back into it and blocking it with soil should be dead or unconsious in about 30 minutes but the longer the better    you can leave holes to dump bleach and then ammonia mustard gas is heavier than air very useful here
  interrogate raiders before killing them if possible some may have useful skills if you need one alive and you cant trust him cripple him using a calicrate goat bander to remove fingers toes limbs and tongue as needed an engineer doesnt need 2 legs
  best option would be moving all your important shit into your hideously expensive bunker then you rig up a vaguely convincing fake house with explosives and hope enough enter the decoy so you can blow them to hell and hope the survivors are scared off if they fail to take the bait or you are unable to detonate it with most of the 50100 in your decoy shitshack the survivors will be pretty pissed and probably torture you to death after busting your bunker    no man is an island castles mostly worked by delaying the enemy until the cops/your neighbors could get their shit together and chase them off
isnt building underground pretty expensive
  easy land mines and computer controlled turrets best defense is a good offense
invest time in digging a moat or other sort of boundary feature  build hugglekulture not sure on the spelling mounds around the perimeter of my property as cover from small arms  between which choke points i would have dug punji stick pits and other booby traps  have a number of trenches pre dug to retreat to and make a stand    typically an attacking force will lose 3 to every 1 on the defensive but i would expect any such force such as a 50100 men to try and take a small holding by force id worry about a couple of guys making themselves useful and helping out for a few days then getting my throat slit in the night  the best defense is have your lines defined and dont let anyone else in
  depends on the quality you want
  bullet proof rv just stay on the lamb 50 men vs one pack a flame thrower and catch them all funneled into one spot
  50100 men    theres a big problem here in the modern age in civilization barriers to prevent people from getting inside are timebased the stronger they are the more time it takes for the perpetrator to get in the extra break in time allows law enforcement to get to the location and deal with the perpetrator it also allows the home owner to have time to escape hide in a panic room or weapon up and protect themselves in your situation you wont have someone coming to rescue you and you wont be able to hide in a panic room thus your only options are to escape or fight back directly    the main problem is that with modern technology and equipment theres not much you can do to keep these people out if they really want inside all theyd need to do is get a bulldozer or wrecking ball and smash into your place thats because they have all the time in the world to crack your nut since no law enforcement is on its way they dont need to siege you by climbing over way they dont need to starve you out since they have explosives they can just excavate you in a fairly short amount of time    your best bet is to have a good defence to give you some time a distraction that holds there attention as long as possible to make them think you are still inside prerecorded message and insults you can play on loud speakers that doesnt loop for a long time and multiple hidden escape routes to get the fuck out of there    if you wish you can home alone the place up so that it maims and kills people once they are inside and you are long gone poison gas would probably be the best bet for that      first good post for legit reality brother
chemist here  i would use  dispersed explosive compounds  absolutely terrifying fire weapons  truly horrific chemical weapons    thats about it i would hole up in a fireproof saferoom with nbc protection and then just wait for the fireworks the hardest part would be cleaning up without dying
  the answer is obvious    1 a deeply buried bunker that fulfills the following characteristics    cannot be found unless you have specialty equipment    cannot be excavated except with a bulldozer and hundreds of hours    enough food/water/air to live for several months  2 a minefield that can be activated whenever you flip a switch    kill the first 20 with mines and the rest wont come back
    not them but i visited south africa once and i have never in my life seen so much barbed wire tall fences and cameras it was almost as if people were worried    while there i read an interview with a guy whose job it was to provide this security turned out he was very very rich        get dogs you can then feed them what they catch
  it was almost as if people were worried  if i lived in a niggerinfested city i would be worried too not even memeing as the kids say
clear entryway big fuckoff door they get in ant dry to open the door its locked hydraulic door behind them slams down seals them inside from the other side of the walls i turn on my gasoline generators fumes from them pumped into the room as they slowly succumb to the noxious fumes i play hitler speeches over the intercom ive installed in the hall ive probably played too much rimworld
  nobody asked about this  whats the budget  sage
you just need to build a lake around your property they will of course be able to to get to you but not fast enough so that you can kill most of them in the process

  small arms rifles pistols as well as improvised explosives  if thats all they have then all i need is a deep pit around my base wide enough they cant jump over
i would find myself a hill build my house on top of it and put up a pretty decent wall medieval style with crenelations to hide behind and machiculations to shoot down through i would live with three of my best friends and have a bigass stockpile of guns and ammo  i would also have a chemistry lab and a stockpile of gas masks and filters if these assholes attack me ill throw down some mustard gas on them while also shooting at them watch schedule is set up so that there are always two men on the wall the wall also houses a bunch of huge searchlights enough to well illuminate the hill and some of the surrounding ground the glare from these lights also offers some cover to the men on the wall during the night the house is equipped with a well and there are solar panels on everything angled in such a way that they collect rainwater and direct it into basins    the key to this defence is to keep the enemy away from the walls this is why they desperately need to be machiculated and why chemical warfare is necessary if someone approaches i need to be able to shoot them and if they come with some sort of improvised shield the gas is needed to make them drop it if they reach the wall they can attach an explosive to it and blow a hole but if the wall is made from concrete slabs chances are most of the energy will be directed away and the wall will be safe if their improvised bombs are shaped charges it becomes even more imperative to not let them close enough to plant them
step one get one of those drills the bongs used to drill a tunnel to france  step two drill a hole straight into a mountain  step three litter the entrance with czech hedgehogs so they cant move armour inside  step four after about fifty metres of normal tunnel build a wall that divides the tunnel in two and put gun turrets on it  step five cross the tunnel off with another wall and put a steel bunker door on here at an angle too close to the wall to fit a battering ram in behind the bunker door is a short corridor with two pipes to pump carbon monoxide in and another bunker door  pic related
im swedish so i open my doors to these invaders so as to not seem racist
  i use my self sufficiency to barter with local groups at a low cost margin to build a complex and layered social economic defense state in which no rational person would ever assault me and no irrational person could     walls in the mind of the populous will out preform any physical defenses     all the better if i can instantly rally military martyrs to my defense yet have no one know my name
  smoke grenades/machine/whatever  a bunch of speakers playing recordings of shouting and guns going off panic them into leaving  if that doesnt work hide  smoke stuff is realistic and easy to make not ridiculous to get a bunch of speakers either although getting the sounds of shouting/gunshots might be hard  combine this with actually shooting at them to add some sort of actual threat
dual m61 turret on the roof brrrt bitches
  desu in such a scenario small arms limited artillery/tank danger you should probably look at the forts of the 1700s they are designed to channel attackers into multiple fields of defensive fire i remember seeing this on a documentary and being a bit confused as to how it benefits defenders perhaps an engineerfag can help you with this concept pic related but not the best example
  the idea behind the star fort is that you cant approach it without being fired upon from at least two directions for instance if you advance on one of the protruding bits you can be fired on from either that bit and one of the adjacent ones or from both of the adjacent ones if you advance on one of the sunken in walls youre fired on form both protruding bits in either scenario you cant take cover from the fire behind something like a pavise or a wagon because youd be getting fired on from behind instead     theyre even moderately effective against tanks because when the tank advances it can be shot on its generally weak sides by antitank rifles from the protrusions the reason they stopped being used is because theyre super vulnerable to indirect artillery being invulnerable to a frontal assault is useless when the enemy can shell you from so far away you cant even tell the direction  it wouldnt work very well in this situation though you need a lot of men to man it properly your enemy could just have fifty men advance on you from two directions with cars with steel strapped on isis style you could only pin one side down at a time so the other side is completely open to attack
the modern pa system worked well against british troops and their artillery  fight then retreat to the next pa/redoubt  know your area like the back of your hand the invaders dont know whats round the next bend but you do

  never in 10 thousand years would this thread ever have been made by a woman
  why would the barrels have to rotate
build a wall or bulldoze the terrain to funnel bandits into a choke point  adapt a paintball aimbot to actual rifles shit loads of them hidden in trees so they cant all be spotted in advance and disabled by the bandits wait for all bandits to be in kill zone then hit go remotely with all aimbots  basically tower defense except the final boss creep is ops mom
  lol good observation
  realistic version   cut losses pack up and get ready for the hard life until i find a new safe place to start over     fun version   pack my well hidden underground bunker with a weeks worth of food/water/etc and a couple of guns  cook up some slowacting but lethal poison  insert poison into the rest of my food stock  head down to the bunker seal it off  wait for bandits and their dogs to feast upon my tainted food stock   wait for them to die their slow agonizing deaths  emerge from bunker cautiously just in case anyone survived  add 100 pistols and rifles to my arsenal  collect all the food and tools they were carrying  nail the heads onto trees surrounding my land as a warning to future bandits
  woman version show sympathy for the poor starving bandits and offer them food and a place to stay for the night    never consider for a second the notion that they might rape/kill you and plunder your land for all its worth
  for 160 for 10 good shovels and like 100 to pay 20 mexicans for a week you can hire a bunch of mexicans to make punji stick traps around the property all they are are sharpened sticks hardened by fire and optinally coated in shit in a hole covered with leaves you can have 10 mexicans digging holes 7 mexicans gathering and sharpening sticks 1 mexican tending the fire 1 mexican adding shit to the sticks and 1 mexican spiking the traps    also nothing beats the molotov in effiency for weapondry add styrofoam to some gas for easy napalm    even a bunch of holes could trip people up and break legs and shit
  doesnt have to be
so assuming that i have a lot of time and that theyre coming from one direction im building 3 trench lines in a crescent shape facing toward them the first line they encounter is twice as wide and twice as deep filled with spikes once they lay boards or whatever they do to get past that the second line is a normal trench which they will descend into to take cover from my fortified machine gun emplacement     the second trench however will be wired with barrels full of napalm and explosives about 6 inches under the bottom of the trench to be detonated once enough have taken cover from my suppressing fire     after this the trench will be totally blown out and only the third and widest trench will remain this one will be wired with chlorine gas to be released en masse once one of the trip wires attached it triggered     honestly at that point i hope i got my 100 guy quota between machine gun fire the first death trench the gas and the explosives id like to think everything went my way
  id build an underground chamber and rig the place with explosives of my own    i would collect imperial bounty for the ones i killed to repay for my farm    how is a fucking farmer going to withstand 50100 guys with guns and explosives    youre fucking retarded

  just go full on japanese like in okinawa the more hideous your tunnel sistem is the better put as many traps and covered positions from where you van take them one by one never risk it probably after the first 12 or so have been killed they will try to get the fuck out its important that they dont have a chance if your tunneling was hideous enough they wont be able to do so
  sorry i meant iwo jima
  you should find and read the book militant tricks the author gives a plan for a trap building designed to inflict repeated casualties on intruders and win via attrition of fielddeployable forces it was designed in the context of middle eastern antiinsurgency but it would be directly applicable to bugouts hideaways and shelters against raiders of any kind in the daytime it is a biulding for normal use like an office but it is hardened so that during the night or attack season it becomes a deathtrap
  i mean maybe not land mines but trip explosives would work just as well
  deadly traps that violates laws on warfare   think pipe bombs with tainted shrapnel  powerful uv lighting   chemical weapons such as acids and gas   defensive/hostile design think choke points poisonous and sharp plants more traps and armored walls with guns poking out tiny holes  food that will last years   loud speakers and annoying music
hua head to the hills
  i build nothing i go out and find their camp fuck their shit
the absolutely most important thing to so is completely clear as much land as possible around your defensible position if you have a few hundred metres of clearing with no cover or concealment around your position then you can see your enemy coming and have a very large kill zone which is impossible to advance through without taking huge amounts of fire this area should also be able to be illuminated at night and have discreet markers indicating range at intervals throughout it     to take advantage of this you need discipline sentries and lookouts must always be posted and have a way to alert others in the event of an attack or else your efforts will be wasted as for defenses i would consider sectioning off areas with fencing and locked gates walls are probably prohibitively expensive fortified buildings and trenches are probably the most efficient way of building defenses and they are easy to fall back from    just bloody go and watch the siege of jadotville
  something along these lines befriend your local gun club goers barracked in with more provisions then them make sure the first floor openings are near enough impenetrable to 50100 people carrying small arms which isnt difficult to do unless they bring specialist equipment which is unlikely in this scenario and wait them out while sending out flares sounding a siren periodically and attacking through upper floor slitholes till they decide to move onto an easier target or starve out if they decide to wait out and work in rotation then youre hoping your external friends can mediate or pick some more off or have with you enough weaponary and improvised chemical/explosive devices to hurt their numbers to such an extent that even rotation is going to help them supply themselves more than your food stocks
  has op been killed yet by bands of roving nogs
  i live
  not entirely true youre forgetting about enemy morale and desire to continue a siege when there are many easier targets to go for if you were to set up enough traps or a way to pick them off with while remaining untouched the attackers are going to start worrying if this target is worth throwing more lives or resources at it i do agree that they would eventually win a siege but could potentially cripple themselves after throw so much at it
  its a question of who has the most resources per person in this scenario of 50100 marauding people theyre carrying small arms food and other resources trying to steal your shit if you can prevent entry at the lower levels a smaller house with less windows would actually be an advantage to a larger house you could take the steel frames maybe wooden boards in some countries they use on the windows and door frames of empty homes and put them on the inside instead unless the marauding group are carrying welding equipment theyre not gaining entry anytime soon and all you would need to do it loosen a brick above the entry points like slitholes and rain down from above when they tried to penetrate you can also reinforce the steal frames theyre not going to wait you out if you have enough provisions as its unless theyre rotating between looting elsewhere so as you said you just have to make enough damage to their numbers via loses or medical supplies where rotation becomes an issue

watchtower  enough food and water  this thing
pic related    so i have this 28mm diameter 1mm thick 304 stainless steel pipe that im cutting into many 25mm rings  currently im using ss pipe cutter and its very time consuming tricky and easy to make mistakes that result in bent pipe or damaged cutter because 25mm barely is not enough to get a grip so i have about 60 good results once i have it cut i need to put it on a special wooden handle i made and lock with steel clamping ring it all sits on a ordinary drill that i then press into sandpaper to polish the clamping ring is bulky on one side so the drill wobbles and damages itself a little everytime i use it that way    so the simple solution  buy a mini lathe solves everything even polishing great but im poor and also buying multi functional tool for only one job is kinda stupid is there any cheaper way to part steel pipe into 25mm pieces i mean maybe some rare machine that not many people know exists or maybe diy it make some lathey one size pipe parting motor with pipe handler machine    gib help
and this is what i do with them
    tile saw with mitre slot and abrasive blade cheap at least at harbor freight in the usa    metal chop saw
  i thought about that but it the second problem is still there polishing with lathe i would just press wooden block with sandpaper onto the pipe before cut and its done so im kinda looking for something that rotates the pipe from the start
  you could use a hacksaw in a miter box or spin the pipe as you are and use a hacksaw to cut instead of the rolling cutter    or buy a metal cutting bandsaw from harbor freight
  i thought about that but it the second problem is still there polishing with lathe i would just press wooden block with sandpaper onto the pipe before cut and its done so im kinda looking for something that rotates the pipe from the start    the abrasive blade would solve that although you will have to be ok with wasting about 1/2 your material because of the kerf
  breddy cool op    just a quick check though are you lubricating the pipe oil alcohol etc before making a cut doing that and cutting a lot slower by turning very small amounts may help    the main problem i have with parting pipe with the pipe cutters is the flareout so i might also recommend making the rings significantly thicker then taking it to a belt sander down to size much more even than hand sanding and would reduce time overall    a portable band saw is also an option if you are very steady handed or know someone with a hand stand    if youre already doing all this sorry
  wasting half of pipe is okay but i really dont think abrasive blade would give me the mirror finish im making now with 1500 grit sandpaper
  i actually use belt sander to flatten the cut side because it has a little slope and burrs after the cut yet another step that i would gladly skip
  shove it up your ass and clench
  horizontal bandsaw will get them close  buy a used one or try to find a baby sized one    pic related is a mini sized one but i couldnt find anywhere to buy it  i personally bought a full sized horizontal bandsaw on craigslist for 50
  shove it up your ass and clench    whats with all the eight year old mentality posts im seeing on /diy/
  they started when /diy/ became a clover default board and hasnt stopped influx of faggots essentially
  clamp a drill in a vise insert a 1 inch drill bit slip pipe over the bit and duct tape it to bit at base  instant lathe  spin drill and cut rings with hacksaw
  okaaaay thats something because i have already a way to spin the pipe on drill for polishing so apart from stability of the whole thing what hacksaw should i use some specialized type i guess it should be as thin and hard as possible made for stainless steel
  i mean maybe some rare machine that not many people know exists  the right tool for the job in this case would be an orbital saw often known as a fischer saw after a popular brand    fast clean square precisely repeatable cuts however it is a tool made exclusively for professional use and you probably wont find one cheaper than a mini lathe    or maybe diy it  if your fab skills are decent you might be able to rig up an angle grinder with a cutting wheel to do something similar it would leave a burr though similarly if you have the tube spinning in a stable manner touching a cutting wheel to it in one spot would give a pretty nice cut rig up something to work like a lathe steady
i know this is /diy/ but what about just buying some metal rings from a hobby supply store or aliexpress or something seems simpler and cheaper than buying a cheap tool for the job
  i tried searching for it and i think its way too specific to find i designed the whole process around this exact sizes and nothing else would work
  does it have to be a ring what if you took sheet metal and pressed it with a die to make a shallow cup the thing could be put into rather than a ring    you could have a machine shop make you a die set once then you could just fabricate a press using a bottle jack or just buy a cheap bottle jack press from harbor freight the die could form the cup and trim the excess in one go and then all youd have to do it polish the exposed edge on a belt sander
  or even easier just use freeze plugs glue the plastic part into the freeze plug and youre good to go im sure theres some engine that uses a freeze plug thats close to the diameter and depth that would work for what youre doing just buy a bunch in bulk
another option cut strips out of sheet metal and use a small ring roller to form a ring then braze/weld the ring closed would be way easier to work with since all the cutting and polishing could be done while its in sheet form then you form it into a ring last
    this might be promising for op    i cant find a good deal but pic related is close stainless steel od 286 mm cost is 299 for one
  you could also probably get them cheaper from a bulk source
      the freeze plug factory carries over 250 different plugs in stock we carry them in several materials and finishes cant find your size no problem the freeze plug factory can custom make any size for you
            ive never heard of it but checking the images i see that the finish is pretty rough and couldnt even be able to mount it to polish on what i have now  even this company would make me custom ones fully polished there is the shipping cost from usa to poorland it was a good try though maybe ill find something simmilar locally      i was intrested in jewelry making some time ago and this method would be way way more time consuming
  drill hole in center put bolt through hole put bolt in drill chuck
  get a bench sander you can get combo discbelt units also a spindle sander get the bandsaw like  if you can afford a bigger beefier setup get it cutting steel pipe is no joke and not instantaneous even with a full size milwaukee corded bandsaw  also you need to ream these things to eliminate burs maybe something attached to a bench grinder
  i would cut it with the saw and make a jig to hold them that you could polish a bunch in a single operation
or save up 250 and buy a little bench lathe off amazon that will allow you to do everything
  250 and buy a little bench lathe off amazon    the only amazon lathes i can find in that price range are for turning wood can you post a link
  250 bench lathe    what can someone really expect in this price range
      or you could possibly pick up a used lathe thats a bit larger
  what can someone really expect in this price range  cant see it being worse than some homemade drillmounted contraption and a pipe cutting wheel

    i guess the nicest aspect is being able to carry it around in your pocket item weight 855 pounds
ausfag here tired of el cheapo shit tier vices   any recommendations got my eyes set on old dawn cast iron vice which i plan to clean up
  old cast iron vice    anything used pull the jaws apart and look for welds    welds  no buy
  why did they choose to build it canted over like that    genuine question
  looks like theres nothing blocking the bottom of the jaws if they kept an anvil flat on the back that would be prettyl cool
  wilton bullet 1755 is probably your best bet for an entry level quality vise        they ran a promotional offer for around 400 with a 4 lb hammer months ago but most places are out of stock
  because if you have anything long/large itll normally hit the bottom of the vice so usually you can only use the edges of the jaws if your vice is big enough    that design cleverly avoids the problem by having offset jaws
  cast is garbage only forged is worth owning
    cast is alright if you just want a cheap vice    but if you want to drop some bux on a vice forged is the only way to go
  you can usually get them 2nd hand off scumtree for 5060 bucks   theres also a fabricated steel version of the offset vice as well which isnt a bad unit either
  which i plan to clean up    old doesnt automatically mean better its still a vise and they are still used hard  if the jaws are not in good shape and if the jaws dont line up perfectly dont buy it wear bends and cracks are common in old vises a lot are just scrap metal    with that said if you find a good one worth cleaning up itll a lot of the times be cheap and a good deal      also this cast vises dont hold a candle to forged vises  yost makes a budget forged vise that is an absolute beast for the price not sure if you can get it in aussieland though
  you couldnt pay me to take a cast piece if shit
    ok
  the factory i work at has dawn cast iron vices on every work bench that are at least 20 years old with a fair bit of wear and tear and are still good
  thats the one made from welded plate yeah  pretty sure my mates workstation has one
  yeah i found a welded plate type one at a 2nd hand store for something like 30 bucks and just spent an afternoon wire brushing the rust off it bit of rustkill primer and black paint and she was good to go   aint pretty had a hard life but theyre a fairly massive construction out of 3/4 plates and basically for all intents and purposes unkillable really
  ill see if i can pick one up at a garage sale or something   i really want one of those green heavy duty offset vices but holy fuck theyre expensive and heavy
  pretty sure theyre nodular iron not grey iro   manfucturer calls it sg
    /thread
  so you can hold thing vertical
  pretty sure amazon doesnt ship to aus anymore
  burns slant vice co
  what does that mean
  formerly sneeds slant vice co
  a simpsons reference is it ah
op here ended up finding this thing at a garage sale   pretty banged up but still works alright   thinking of wire brushing and perhaps abrasive blasting
  all of the us made vices are all made from castings
i inherited a vice from my grandfather it has a quick release lever would recommend as a feature    pic not mine but has the lever
  might be a bit hard to find
i have one of these swiss gressel 100mm vices got it cheap in a garage sale turns out to be worth 400 strange vice it opens up over the bench top and opens up insanely far for such a small vice over 230mm when you get a vice take replaceable jaws in consideration
  wow ive never seen one like that  is it forging
  im not sure think cast dovetail slider really pimpy the backward opening supposes to be a german thingy boley leinen and schlegel vices have it too brockhaus heuer/heuer front are also really really good traditional vices forged
ridgid mathador really nice big anvil
dolex vice fkkn animal
  lets see how close the jaws line up
kanca anvil vice
2 axis rotation vice capritools
  if they have any vices made from ductile casting id be really tempted to buy one
  is this a good sign i stripped off some of the paint with the wire brush on the angle grinder
  also thinking of filling the gouges with weld but dont know if i should use oxyacetylene or nickel electrode
  also thinking of filling the gouges with weld but dont know if i should use oxyacetylene or nickel electrode    why you arent restoring a vintage duesenberg its a fuckin vise that has been used and abused and is beautiful as is paint it and use it or do what you suggested and start a vise museum
  i know but i whenever i look at it just makes my eyes twitch a little
    then fire up the torch and fix it    or better yet find a hobby more suited to your autism like knitting
  ew knitting is ghey tho   apparently ill have to use a oxidixing flame to extract contaminants from the cast iron so the weld wont be shit
  i there a brand on it get some new jaws or flip the old ones powdercoat or epoxypaint coat the base and it is good to go dont fill weld it up leave the scars any more fance vice pics
  what are you 12 fucking goof
does anybody know what mechanism is in this vice apparently you manually close the jaws onto the piece to be clamped then cinch it tight with the lever move the lever back and forth to tighten morehow does that work mechanically
  its a dawn   the jaws are in alright condition but its in imperial size so itll cost a bit more
  youll remove all its character and history leave the gouges theyre not weakening it
  thats a hydraulic vice  the lever operates a pump
  knitting is ghey tho  you do know knitting was a male preserve when it was first developed as a pastime in the civilised world right women werent thought to have the mental capacity to cope with the cognitive challenges it presented
whats stopping a manufacturer from casting a vice and heat treating it as opposed to forging and heat treating it
  pretty sure they are heat treated
  ook
40yr  offset dawn i have at work
  really want of these but dont really have it in me to dish out a grand for a vice even if it is locally made
  fuck that other guy man if you want to put the time into restoring it and making it look better thats your prerogative personally i agree with you id love to see it a little restored and prettied up because god damn did someone abuse that thing
  i have one of these great vice it follows the boley pattern pretty common in europe
  keep in mind that the strength of these is greatly reduced when opened to the extremes  the dovetail can fail at the root ask me how i know this
  how do you know this
  i guess this is true but here in the land of gressel ive never seen a broken dovetail     one disadvantage is theres a max size you can get in the jaws and still clear the table probably designed in probably to avoid people overloading a vice thats too small
  what is the advantage of these style of vices compared to conventional type
  they just use ductile iron instead
  the sliding jaw is way more rigidly held than your average conventional that said they arent inherently better than a high class vice like a real wilton
  those bullet ones whats so good about them aside from the worm screw inside being sealed
  he never said he would answer you fell right into his trap
  american here i fell in love with these vises as i visit my companys manufacturing plant in germany quite often  i own several myself never broken one  a buddy of mine farmer had me buy one for him leinen jr 125 and bring it in my luggage he had it broken within a few months    ill see if i can find the photos
  i call bullshit feels like it belongs with weaving etc
  curses
  wow arent they supposed to be made from ductile iron
  doesnt matter what its made of really farmers will always find a way to break something
  shiiieeet
  yep they are insanely strong and any vice labeled jr doesnt stand a chance
  these are forged and usually get used in tool making for filing etc so they open very far so you can work on the long sides of a piece of steel    because they open to the back and run on dovetails they are pretty stiff and dont wobble      there also cast and not made for heavy hammer blows and can shatter       these are made from forged steel and are basically indestructible   these give you more clearance for long items like pipe or rods and also have pipe jaws    so these would be better for plumbing or welding light forging
  wanted to post this vise its floormounted and big as the workbench
  fuck thats huge   any markings on it
  i suddenly have a desire to build such a tool but with a hydraulic ram to close it
  thatd be fucking sick
  also the stationary jaw would be an anvil
  dont think that is a good idea
  their bullet ones look weird as hell
  only found this
i was in an industry where youre using your bench vise 6 hours a day    cast/forged doesnt matter much what breaks over time is the tightening mechanism that has to be higher quality go easy if youre really reefing on the vise to tighten it    look at surplus sales from big institutions ive seen them thrown away as scrap craigslist also as not many people work with their hands in the us any more
my father got a quality old vice but it doesnt have the swivel mount for of like pictured here        im not sure it can be mounted without the lower swivel piece so where can i find one to fit
  noice   any chance of a translation
  yeah my bosss older brother said more or less the same thing and told me off for tighenting it too hard saying i was going to fuck the screw
    my german is pretty rough but ill give it a shot    nr 3092 freestanding deep throat vise  made of cast steel  with removable steel jaws    the movable jaws on size 2 also comes with a changeable insert  all sizes can be shipped with a rolling assembly
  wonder how much that bastard weighs
  this one weights 550lbs
      dont screw with the vice its beautiful you might want a nice set of copper jaws make them yourself from copper stock ive never seen a situation where ive needed steel jaws in particular and plenty of cases where i didnt want to scuff up a finish with them     other than that clean and relube it maybe apply something protective and then youre ready the scars are awesome and youll regret forever ruining the vice in search of perfection     think of a hot girl who ruins herself with bad cosmetic surgery thats the kind of improvement youre proposing here
  then sell it and put that money towards something newer
  the manufacturer sells soft plastic and aluminium jaws but i dont know if theyre compatible with this older model since this was when the country still used the imperial system
  any good clear lacquer to appy on metal to stop rust
  quick release is fantastic my dad has an ancient record trianglejocks vice like pic related there are a lot of things that i just cant be bothered clamping because of how far id have to move the jaws not with quick release fuckery
  boiled linseed oil wipe it on wipe it off let a thin film dry the rags may ignite if youre not careful with disposal
  is the hardware store stuff good enough
  should be
i need some soft jaws on this  thinking about using these scrap off cuts of aluminium extrusion
better pic
  how should i go about putting magnets on aluminium plate
shes not much but shes all i got
  wheres the rest of it
  if theyre thick jaws cut a recess to fit the magnet and epoxy it in end mill for round magnets for example if the jaws are thin like in the pictures use a backer plate to hold the magnets and epoxy everything together
  sounds good ill give it a try after i clock out at work on monday
  nice spinning anvil bro
  i told you she wast much
  old cast iron vice  look for welds  pro tip for anyone looking at cast iron stuff welding cast iron is exceedingly difficult without the proper tools honestly avoid any welded cast iron if theres even a chance that it comes from china or has been diyd by some dude in his garage
hey everyone sorry if this isnt the right board but im in need of help     model  is 394gaw000100a stickers/stamps inside the unit says it is either from 1985 or 1987     repair clinic link here     problem furnace turns on but blower fan doesnt causing the unit to overheat and shut itself down and sends a burning metal smell into the house problem started during the middle of the night w/ no warning besides the burning metal smell    action taken national fuel the household gas supplier sent their guy out to test the unit to which he found the blower fan wasnt activating we tested it twice he says to first test for power getting to the fan then to test if the fan itself is working the person who owns the house qualifies for heating assistance so national fuel sent a guy from a local furnace shop down to look at it     pic related    1/2
2/2    concerns the guy from the local shop literally just took the furnace cover off looked at the date codes and said the unit has to be replaced he said the blower fan was stuck but i was able to turn it freely with my hand i asked the guy if the replacement furnace will be on par with the power heating capacities of this unit or will it be one of the energy savers to which he said because national fuel is picking up the bill they will choose to use an energy saver this concerns the people in the house because some are very old and have thin skin and need adequate heating and dont care about the heating bill as an example they still have a washer from the late 80s in the house that i was able to repair for them so they didnt have to get a energy saving washer because according to them it would just bless the clothes with holy water and not drown them like the old washer would     that said i did watch the repair clinic video about likely causes of the fan not working but dont know how to test for power and a faulty blower im also concerned that having to replace the whole furnace is overkill but i dont know it is a 31 year old unit w/ a malfunctioning blower right now but the elderly in the house need damn good heat as they dont give a crap about saving money     that said i hope you all can help me if you need anything please let me know and ill gladly do what i can     thank you    pic related
  electric motors fail three ways that i am familiar with capacitors bearings and shit you likely cant fix    if the fan spins freely and it is turning the motor then a bearing is likely not the issue    that leaves the capacitors there are two types start and run some motors have one some both as the names imply they are used for getting the motor up to speed and keeping it running once it is this type of blower likely only has a start capacitor when they fail you get exactly this problem disconnect the blower from the unit and try to power it directly if it spins up hey its not the blower it is some shit with the unit if it doesnt spin up you can try replacing the starting cap they dont cost much and are a stock part i wouldnt think it would cost more than 40 to get a replacement likely less    if that doesnt fix it and the issue isnt with the unit itself then the motor is likely fucked it can be soft fucked like a wire broken or something easy fix or it could be hard fucked like it not spinning up but power was still going through it and it overheated cooking the windings you never know and likely you wont be able to tell without taking it to a motor specialist if you have a lot of ag in your area there will be one or two in the county they are not cheap though think hundreds replacement blows are hard to find though they change them a lot so finding one that fits and has the right duty cycle can be a problem
  thanks for the reply     i am able to turn the fan freely so in regard to the starting capacitor i would need to take the blower out to test got it     as for the motor i didnt think they would change them a lot i figured given the unit and design of them they would have stayed relatively the same
  the motor needed to be oiled thats why it got stuck the motor is a shaded pole and thermally protected so hopefully it cut the power before it damage the windings you can test the motor by ohming between pin c and 1 with the white and red wire disconnected
  the motor needed to be oiled thats why it got stuck  they were not putting motors that used plain bearings and needed oil into blowers back in 1988 they used permanently lubricated ball bearings just like every other fractional horsepower motor has used for 70 years
oh your shit is a week old yeah time to replace it    hvac is such a fucking scam if you cant find the problem just look for part numbers and search online you should get plenty of results although sometimes it can be costly
  that furnace is old af its time to replace it
  ive found this out way too many times about a lot of things      thanks for letting me know on how to test the motor      huh interesting to know thanks      just looking at the parts list i put in the op i can see how costly it is to throw parts at it      i knew it being from 8587 was old but i thought they could go longer than 3 decades regardless because they called national fuel and they qualify for assistance natfuel is picking up the bill and having the 3rd party install a new furnace so i guess for now they will have to tolerate until the guys come on monday/tuesday
  i second the capacitor check if its got power to the motor thats first step hopefully its stamped with the capacity theyre like 40 you can test it with a dmm from any box store youtube it
i have and maintain twenty of these  they were all installed in 1989  theyre simple reliable and inexpensive to keep repaired  i wouldnt swap one out unless the heat exchanger died    that said if youre getting one for free and the new one is covered by a maintenance contract for the life of the new unit go for it    it takes about fifteen minutes to pull the blower  i could just stick a new 5 capacitor on it in five and spend another fifteen putting it back together but theyre usually dirty enough to spend an hour disassembling it and cleaning it properly before the reinstall   unbolt motor mounts three 7/16 bolts  loosen setscrew on blower wheel hub  slide motor out  remove 4 screws holding an access plate  remove blower wheel   wash and dry it all and reassemble in reverse order
  the photo op posted has blower motor oiling instructions printed right the fuck on it good job
furnace should be replaced old 70 ribbon burners are the type to kill families in their sleep no induce draft motor or safeties    go to the thermostat turn the fan switch on if the fan doesnt start its bad if it does you have thermostat in the furnace that turns the fan on after it preheats that has failed
  thanks ill look into this check      thanks i agree that it shouldnt be replaced due to the simplicity of it my elderly relative did get a call today from national fuel and they told her that they national fuel is going to give her a brand new one at no cost to her so yes she will be getting a brand new one for free she didnt mention what the length of the maintenance contract is but i will give the gas company a call back     also good instructions thank you      i do see those instructions but am unaware if the motor was ever lubricated as it doesnt belong to me      i figured it should be replaced just given its age 3133 years old but there is a carbon detector in the house and the unit does have a safety shutoff switch if its get too hot so unless im misunderstanding your point i do think it has safeties
  just jump the fan to hot and common and see if it comes on if it does then its the board youre looking at like 6500 if it doesnt then its either the capacitor or the motor itself caps are like 7 the motor probably 90 ive replaced dozens of those furnaces and ive never seen one with a cracked heat exchanger
  co detectors should be changed every 5 years  a co detector only goes off when levels are an immediate deadly threat   people go weeks feeling sick having terrible headaches without their co detector go off   this is especially bad for elderly and young     a limit switch is good but not enough   a furnace should have a roll out switch   also furnace should have inducer motor to make sure the products of combustion are being properly vented out
  adorable when the guys come to install the new furnace show your grands the exhaust dollars to dime bags its a pvc pipe that runs out the side of the house due to the extra heat the furnace pulls out of the fire before its through with it in my experience they heat quite adequately
help me
what brand shatula do you use
  
  nice poo
have you plungered it
  yes it went down so i will stop it
  next time take a pic before you try and flush if we dont know whats going down the drain we will never be able to diagnose and repair it properly
flush your shit all by itself without paper firstsee if that helps
  or poop knife whatever
  look if youre constantly clogging a toilet keep some really inexpensive dish detergent next to it and squeeze a bit int the bowl before you go it will turbo flush your toilet and help everything go down and if on the off chance it does still clog at least it has a slightly lemony fresh smell
  here you go
  no mang before we gotta see the logs before we can fix the clogs
oofjpg
  pour a 5 gallon bucket of water down quick as you can if it goes through good but the flush is slow from the tank when you push the handle the rim jets could be clogged and may need to be poked with a hanger also some wax rings have a plastic horn that can shift over time and make it easier to clog if you want a great pooper replace it with an american standard titan   a good life skill is augering a toilet to remove a clog some augers extend 3 past the toilet into the pipe   hope it helps
  just shove a plunger down there and leave it for a couple of hours
  when you flush just hold the handle down longer
is it only fill up and clog when massive poo or also with normal flush
get one of these     how old is your sewer system do you know what kind of pipes you have in the ground
  i dont know how long my apartment is but its pretty old    with normal flush
  eat more fiber
i recommend going to a gun shop and buying a grenade chuck it in the toilet the grenades gun stores sell are heavily modified to only create a tiny bang which should be enough to send the water down the drain breaking any blockages
  have you tried unplugging it and plugging it back in
  apartment     some mongrel flushed a maxi pad tell management   in my state you can give written notice to the landlord then fix it yourself and stick them with the bill if a basic amenity like the stove plumbing or hvac is out of order
  ok so after some pluming i fixed it thank you guys for helping me
  obviously you worked it support    
  what was the problem
  clogged toilet
  couldnt you tell by the pic
op is probably some weirdo who likes showing people pictures of their shit
  no   the toilet could be clogged or a vent could be blocked or it could have been clogged by a diaper down the line the water not draining is a symptom not a problem in and of its self
  is this real
  are those bootys
whats a material thats flexible breathable soft like flesh and can be purchased as raw material  im trying to stuff a body pillow
  flexible breathable soft like flesh    urethane foam  you can even buy the two part mix to make your own
  is that short for polyurethane foam or is it its own distinct thing
check out burman industries in burbank calif they sell stuff for the movie industry they have tons of different stuff 
  dead link and it might surprise you to hear that not everyone on the internet lives in the us  nzer here
have you tried crab meat yet you can warm it in the microwave before humping your anime wifu pillow
  in organic chemistry contexts urethane usually refers to carbamate and its derivatives in pretty much all other contexts it refers to polyurethane or its unpolymerized precursors polyurethane has some similarities in bonding structure to carbamate compounds but they are otherwise unrelated and carbamate is not an ingredient in polyurethane
  cant afford a real sex doll 
  please dont tell people youre a kiwi theres so few of us and people will think were all the kind of people who want homemade body pillows    also materialwise i suggest making it out of pallets or shipping containers if pallets arent durable enough for you
  people will think were all the kind of people who want homemade body pillows  we already do  and the anime trick isnt working  we know you want sheep pillows
  
  fill it with real snakes
go to the amazon and fuck an anaconda
  would bone desu
  youre not supposed to post threads about making sex toys op
  maybe try latex foam pillows
  latex foam is what im leaning towards but buying enough of it is a problem  i need 7 square metres  latex foam is available to me as either  extremely cheap material on alibaba  extremely expensive fancy mattresses  if i get it from alibaba i pay like 100usd plus whatever shipping is but its a huge hassle  if i get it from aliexpress i pay like 300400usd  if i get it locally id pay around the same amount if its even available    i wish aliexpress sold more bulk material
  why even bother find a person to cuddle theres plenty of them around
  leather it literally was flesh at one time
  girls dont exist on the internet is extremely true for new zealand
  im a kiwi too there are plenty of girls here
  im too autistic to hit on them in person though and anyone i meet online ghosts me
  do you think a body pillow will change that social skills are like any other skills  practise them and youll improve i believe in you
    to be fair we have more dairy cattle than sheep also use wool
  not everyone on the internet lives in the us  this is wrong     everyone on the internet is in the us and some just larp as pussy euros or chinks
  yfw 20 of posters in this thread are from nz
are memory foam mattresses worth it im a lazy cunt and want to be comfy as fuck
  yeah they are great buy a cheap one though i paid like 200 bucks for one
  lol at that memory foam illustration you get like 2 inches of memory foam on a 5000 mattress
  not really you can get better results with a water bed or if you really wanna go cheap a simply air mattress
  not sure if this is a breaking point for you being 4chan and all but while they are mad comfy to sleep on they make sex surprisingly lackluster
  i dont know what they run now but about five years ago i bought a sealy when they first got into memory foam ran me less than 400 bucks and i love it doesnt get overly hot it was alittle bit firm when we got it but it breaks in eventually
i sell memory foam mattresses at a furniture store for a living  1 dont buy a mattress for any hype ever  2 everyones sleep needs are different you need to test each mattress for at least 15 minutes in the store before you decide  3 buy a mattress based on how you wake up more on this  4 know your sleep type  5 a good salesman will only give you advice to choose the best mattress and will never say they have the perfect one for you
for at least a week before your purchase record the position you wake up in seriously this is the position you are buying the mattress for    the last two hours of your sleep are when you get all the benefit and rest for the next day    during this time you stop rolling your body temp drops you enter sleep paralysis and you start dreaming
if you wake up on your back look for firm mattresses   this part of your body is the most armored shoulder blades ribs and long muscles you will get better rest from a firm mattress    if you wake up on your stomach buy a plush or soft mattress your front is where you keep your soft bits and you will be much more comfortable on a plush pillow top    ignore every commercial that tries to sell you the firmest mattress even if they quote chiropractors this is because they know you will eventually return to buy a mattress pad to soften up the pillowed brick you bought like an idiot
memory foam is a very warm material be prepared for this all the body heat you put into a foam mattress will be given right back to you   if you are a warm sleeper you may need to look for a gel foam or gel top mattress usually this will cost a little more  gel top and gel foam work to dissipate body heat faster so you dont drown in your own sweat while you sleep if you cannot afford a gel top mattress consider sleeping with thinner blankets or a lighter comforter
try your mattress first   i see retards walk into the store each day push a fist into a mattress and say  that feels nice ill take it  these are the same shitforbrains that pop their mattress onto craigslist after 6 months because they had no idea what they bought and wasted 2000    wear pajama pants or something comfortable you can sleep in go to the store and literally try to fall asleep in the showroom   get into the same position you wake up in and try to hold that position for 510 minutes if you have to shift yourself a lot within that time move on because your body is telling you it doesnt like that sleeping surface
memory foam is not an instant comfort material it takes 510 minutes for your body heat to get into the foam and for the mattress to soften up if you hop onto a mattress that immediately say ooh i like this one you are going to waste your money and regret your purchase   get on wait wait some more and then give it another 5 minutes after that  after the mattress has warmed up try to roll a little bit if you are still comfortable its good otherwise please refer to previous post
buy a moisture proof mattress encasement  you warranty will be void if you do not have this on the same receipt as the mattress  warranties are void if your mattress has any smells or stains it doesnt matter if there is a huge manufacturers defect if you have a sweat stain in the middle of your sleeping surface you have no warranty  rotate your mattress religiously every second time you wash your sheets rotate the mattress end to end the foam and other materials need to settle and break down evenly this will prevent your mattress getting a body dent and will also help retain the warranty a warranty can also be void if you do not rotate the mattress
do not buy a solid memory foam mattress unless wasting money is your fetish    at most you will get the benefit from 4 of memory foam most people get the most benefit from 2 or 3  of memory foam the rest should be support foam
if you buy a mattress in a box open it up and wait the full 24 hours or more before you use it  memory foam is actually fragile when it is highly compressed and using it before full decompression can damage the inside of the foam causing hollow spots tears and lumps salesman can also void your warranty if you dont allow the mattress to puff up properly read the damn instructions    also you might notice new car smell from a new foam mattress this is because foam is a plastic product and needs to air a bit its not harmful and many mattress companies already preair their product just be prepared
                  yes this is all the same poster its just late and i have a lot of advice to administer i have been selling this stuff for 16 years noncommission and every day i get hillbillies telling me they need the firmest mattress i got and i dont know shit about what they need because they just pressed a fist onto a piece of foam and know its just perfect
  for about a million years people have managed absolutely fine sleeping on the ground  whenever someone says to me oh i slept shitty on a bed it was so uncomfortable immediately you can say its a lie because they slept the same what do they know they were unconscious  if you wake up every day with aches and pain then maybe you need to go mattress shopping but a mattress topper get to fuck  anyway they are fucking horrible its like an alien organism trying to absorb you and also you can feel the rough foam surface through sheets its awful why do that to yourself  in case you cant tell i hate them
  thanks anon my wife and i are considering a new bed/mattress and this is very helpful
  i bought a memory foam topper and use it on a spring bed very comfy
my wife and i bought a king size bear mattress one of the best purchases ive ever made both of us talk about how much we love it at least a few times a week full disclaimer some of the satisfaction likely comes from the full to king jump its fantastic to be able to spread out roll around at night and not really disturb each other also not a bear matress employee
ive narrowed my focus down to a few mattresses including the dreamcloud avocado and purple mattresses i will fall asleep on my side but find myself waking up on my back the dreamcloud and avocado both look good but seem to be rated too firm for what i would want
i got my mattress from craigslist for 20 no stains no smells no wear its a spring mattress that is relatively soft if i want to sleep on something hard i can always lay on the floor im not above it
  also im 65 and roughly 250270 lbs dont buy anything but a king sized mattress unless you are a manlet
  i sleep on my couch because my mattress is a piece of shit so im not sure what side i wake up on usually notched into the corner between the seatcushions and the backrests what would you recommend
  60 165lbs queen size 10spring with an attached 23 inch foam layer ontop purchased online in compressed baginbox form for some 250300 bux steal of a deal a good mattress is a tremendous benefit so theyre sold at tremendous markup highmargin dont pay topdollar maybe some of the nice ones are nice but i wanted a foam somethin with pocketspring coils all foam is upsetting to me i liked my hybrid
  manlet
  i get called skinny but i work with my hands and am in good athletic shape i eat clean this is after being 195 at a doughy alcoholheavy fastfoodreliant bum with a sedentary lifestyle
dear matress pro anon    im in need of a queen size memory foam matress for a small camper ive read that 4 inches thick is about as tall as i should get for the camper model most then but some kind of gel matress topper on that most seem to order off of amazon any suggestions     i also live in a humid climate any suggestions for avoiding having a giant sponge    thanks in advance     anon
i bought an eve mattress back when they still were latex topped which feels like the best of both worlds since the latex doesnt overheat but it does contour to you nicely as you settle down so if you can find a latex topped mattress whilst shopping around op then its well worth testing it out
  they are 100 worth it and so are those contoured memory foam pillows i felt like a nitwit spending 35 on a damn pillow but it turned out to be the best 35 i ever spent cured my chronic neck pain and more than paid for itself in pain relievers
  never buy memory foam for a camper or trailer because it is a heat sensitive product it will break down within 3 years i assume during some time in the summer you will not be using it and campers can get extremely hot out in the sun     go to a outdoor supply store and look for uncovered camping foam in queen size that will probably be the only foam you will find that is 4 inches and still firm enough to support an adult
    king sized and queen sized are literally the same length at 80 inches long if you morons dont even know this basic fact how can you know anything else about mattresses
look  you are going to hate me for this but this is the site the only site        their forums are amazing its lots of diy latex mattresses there is no better mattress resource and you will spend a month reading shit there     and im a convert we have a latex matress and it is fucking amazing shit aint cheap but there you go
they are indeed comfy as fuck but they wear out in a couple years and develop a permanent sag that will fuck up your spine    only get one if you can afford to replace it regularly
mf mattress toppers are decent as mattressanon sbuy ys you need to work it out for yourself i will chip in with my bed advice    buy egyptian cotton bedsheets minumum 400 thread count dont be fooled by percale or anything that says luxury  200 tc its not find decent egyptian cotton and go for 400 thread and above whatever you can afford also look for the triangle mark of authenticity lots of dodgy pakis and indians fake this if you are going to spend 1/3 of your life in bed and a ton on a good mattress buy some decent bedding that will last years
what you guys really need is a fifty dollar pillow made in my homestate of minneh soda
  we have a latex matress and it is fucking amazing  really i was leaning towards the dream cloud mattress but the avocado is dunlop latex    the avocado mattress with the latex is rated as high durability if so this might tilt it back to the dream cloud    buy egyptian cotton bedsheets minumum 400 thread count dont be fooled by percale or anything that says luxury  200 tc its not find decent egyptian cotton and go for 400 thread and above whatever you can afford also look for the triangle mark of authenticity lots of dodgy pakis and indians fake this if you are going to spend 1/3 of your life in bed and a ton on a good mattress buy some decent bedding that will last years  so egyptian cotton is the premium standard for bedsheets what about silk or bamboo sheets how does it do with heat dissipation    theyre so expensive because of all the marketing they do
  they make sex surprisingly lacklustre     what ive had sex on a memory foam mattress and i didnt even notice it was memory foam until the next morning after having one of the most comfortable sleeps in my life what was your experience
  not him i can confirm missionary pounding is lack luster on foam try it on the floor for comparison
  the foam absorbs a lot of force as is its job guess what pounding is force
the type of sleeping surface you have should never influence sex unless you are so fat and out of shape that rely on the springiness of a coil mattress as long as you are on a soft and comfortable surface sex is not affected either way between coil or foam   please stop larping as a chad about your sex life   the only difference you might notice would be the heat of the mattress when you lay down afterwards
  long short memory foam will have you build some new muscle memory expect early exhaustion the first few times as the matress absorbs quite a bit of energy youd usually have reflected back at you not a problem if youre good christian server is laying seed for the purpose of procreation think running on a cork track spring vs on the beach memory foam its going to be a little rough at first but youre going to build up some new stronger muscles that will really show when you take it to a track   this is coming from an early 30s 150155lb quite athletic male whom classy boinks for the purpose of a mutually enjoyable experience   end of day there is a memory foam in the bedroom thats the day to day/night to night and a spring matress in the spare bedroom if the desire arises
i have a purple mattress and its quite cozy1
  i want the purple 2 opinions how is the purple for sex matress has two jobs need it to perform in both categories
used to manage a sears and when customers would return mattresses we would cut an x corner to corner on each side and toss it in the compactor got a 4000 tempur pedic climacool cloud whatever for free because some asshole ordered a firm instead of soft amazing mattress but its foam all the way through
  hey guys remember that time that the purple mattress guys came here and shilled their products and then got caught they were complete assholes    good times
    holy fucking shit thats a black hole thanks for the link anon     i feel like their overview posts are an infographic waiting to happen
  4chan  you seem to be lost what website do you think youre on
  i remember that thread are you sure it wasnt the ghostbed shills that got btfo
  better yet chaska go hawks
  please anon this is top notch inormation you cant easily get  say anything else you know about this
hey guys i actually sell mattresses for a living i dont mind to give a good recommendation there are a lot of memory foam beds out there and they are not all equal    if you want a decent bed in a queen size expect to pay around 800 for something thats going to potentially last longer than your car
    your doing gods work anon always cool when someones very specific personal knowledge is suddenly really useful
be wary of the purple mattress  mine has this dust crap appearing in it and the company wont give a straight answer on what it is  im not the only one either apparently and i know its not external dust for a fact because of the protector on it    the bed itself is basically layers of squishy plastic so if you want to sleep on a trampoline then go for it    im considering a decent hybrid bed next because this purple bed is crap
    you rock     ok so heres something from left field im looking for something portable that would go with my campaign furniture is quality  portability or are there options that make both possible i mean i can settle for a crap air mattress but i feel like there ought to be sone option out there     hard mode something that is also murphy bed capable without permasag in the middle layers
  thank you based mattress man much appreciated
  mysterious dust crap  pic plz
    i read it was an antibinding agent used to keep the purple part of it from sticking to itself in transit like talc powder only theyre own special formula for when its vacuumed and rolled
  you gotta be shill for ghostbed  they very clearly state what it is what its used for and that its not harmful right on their website in plain non hidden english    side note look into ghostbed vs purple lawsuits interesting story where ghostbed ran a supposedly unbiased review website that trashed purple based on the mystery powder as well as their ceo independently posting a bunch of videos and full scale powder mystery smear campaign when purple issued a rebuttal he doubled down on his shilling then purple took the review website to court and had him btfo because they were able to prove that the ceo of ghostbed in fact owned the unbiased review website as well as using other channels to spread fear and misinformation unfairly and straight up lying purple won that lawsuit and then the asshole remade the website with a minor change in the url and now its owned by his wife and purple is suing the new website since he was not to operate another review website as part of losing the first case look up purple vs ghostbed lawsuit id recommend leonard frenchs videos about it on the ol jewtube if thats your thing    not a purple shill or even a customer was looking at em a few months back and went with spring mattress from the local store since i couldnt test out the purple
  thats exactly what it is its the same powder used in industrial rolled vinyl reduces static and prevents self adhesion from tearing holes in the rubber
im gonna throw in a vote for latex some of the latex mattresses have a lot more bounce but still give u the movement isolation that other foam does i hate the totally dead feeling of all memory foam horrible for sex
  get better results like youre some kind of fucking somnologist get outta here
  they slept the same  what do they know they were unconscious  mattress toppers are useless  wow do you ever show your power level did you know the world keeps going on behind your front door even when you close it something to think about
bought a loom and leaf extra firm 2 yrs later no regrets   only effect on sex life was positive turns out you can both hump way better without chronic back pain   spend money to get an ok mattress you spend a 3rd of your life sleeping give or take   loom and leaf has a 100 night return policy as do several other manufacturers dont be afraid to ship it back if its not comfortable you owe it to yourself to sleep as comfortable as possible
  if you wake up on your stomach buy a plush or soft mattress  i disagree with this i sleep on my stomach without a pillow go to sleep and wake up that way and i prefer a firm mattress
  i also sleep on my stomach and can not sleep on soft and squishy mattresses yet to find a mattress that was too firm they are always best when new and at their most firm
  damn bro thats a devious stunt that ghostbed company did where did you get this information i didnt know the mattress industry had so much juicy drama
  extra firm  are you a stomach sleeper or hefty individual  spend money to get an ok mattress you spend a 3rd of your life sleeping give or take   agreed
  im both hefty and a stomach sleeper my wife is not hefty and sleeps on her back or side mostly the mattress has been great for both of us loom and leaf recommends the extra firm for anything over 200 if i remember correctly we were both experiencing a lot of back pain mine from an old work injury hers from a car accident it took probably 3 nights on the new mattress and neither of us have had those pains anymore i think we paid 1500 or so that may have included the ikea frame it sits on not trying to sell loom and leaf i think there are probably equal mattresses for cheaper out there honestly has to be in my top 3 all time favorite purchases though the only thing id change is a better frame ikea sucks for long term furniture
  its insane isnt it one time i ended up at the table with some industrial designers and they talked about fucking forks for an hour goddamn forks one of the guys spent 5 years making forks in italy its like that you didnt realize there was that much goddamn info about mattresses       nice that is some sweet sweet drama
  it took probably 3 nights on the new mattress and neither of us have had those pains anymore  thats awesome  ikea sucks for long term furniture  oh yeah
im looking to install a drip irrigation system like pic related for my garden ive also considered adding a water tank so that i wouldnt need to worry about watering it while im away any tips on how i could control water flow and have it act like an automated sprinkler rather than a continuous drip 
  all tips and info on the subject would be much appreciated as well
have it act like an automated sprinkler rather than a continuous drip   can you elaborate your idea  anyway you may look for an fully automated garden pump or a simple one that you may control with something like a pi and relay
  hose timers are a thing    
  im currently in the process of building a kickass irrigation system already have 14000 l of storage capacity bladder tanks in the subfloor for the lawn i used 19mm irrigation hose and popup sprinklers for garden beds im using 13mm hose and those retarded little piddler thingies each zone is pressurebalanced and is controlled by a 24vac relay hooked up to a relay array with cat5e    drip system is probably a lot easier than the shitstorm that im attempting just be prepared for lots of digging cutting pipe and a fuckton of trips to the hardware shop for fittings
  im imagining an irrigation system like in the op but i suppose with a tank or even better something like      as well im just sort of clueless on how to get started on this once i know what i need on a project i can usually figure things out fine im just always hesitant to start buying things without having a plan in place
  instead of having to get a 24vac relay or something do you think a lazier person could simply evenly length the piping/tubing/hoses so that each row would get roughly the same amount of water 
  no i can only run about 3 of the big sprinklers from the pump due to limited pressure i have a lot more than that so i cant run them all at the same time pressure loss in the pipe is negligible with lengths as short as mine
    if you put a pi into it you could also hook it up with a sensor in the garden bed measuring the humidity and shit
  theres also these threads fyi 
starting seeds and seedlings on bench  misthead sprinkler system its easy to flood the babies by accident they dont need much water until they have more than 4 leaves     established potted plants house plants/plants with more than 4 leaves    netafim with 20lb regulator and a hose timer mounted vertically they work best like this and drip emitters branching off directly into pots they make different emitters based on gal/min you should do a little math between the pot size emitter flow rate and watering time so you dont over water you can put a higher flow rate emitter on larger pots and lower on smaller ones off of the same mainline
  i live is central florida and tried drip irrigation last year with poor results this year i made my irrigation out of pvc used slip couplings a valve on each bed and drilled 1/16 size holes one pointing down and the other 2 at 45 degrees every 4 inches put it on a timer and so far its great good luck op and happy gardening

if youre pulling water from a resevoir tank into a drip irrigation or sprinkler system youll want a pump to keep pressure consistent otherwise youll need a huge reservoir or a high altitude res    if you are pulling water from garden hose hookups you just need hose timers    on my property i pull water out of a lake which is kind of like a water tank resevoir we use a shallow well pump that cost like 120 from harbor freight which puts out slightly less pressure and flow than a normal municipal garden hose more than enough for most drip irrigation probs not enough for a proper high pressure lawn sprinkler install    i found the tricky part is pulling enough water with your drips to match the flow rate of your pump its easy to not pull enough water the pump will turn on and off constantly if this is the case you need to run more drips or run them all higher rates the turning on and off will kill the pump prematurely     most drip nozzles allow you to adjust the flow rate just by twisting them or with a lever
  this is the pump i use  i run the intake to the bottom of a lake nearby and try my best to filter the water and the output to a sprinkler controller for automated lawn sprinks  i can only run about 3 at a time and also to a network of pvc pipes to hose spiggots almost all my outdoor spigots are fed by the lake pump    i have to run about 50 drips at the same time a distance of 150 feet to my garden to match the flow rate of my pump mix of dribblers and mini shower heads
  sheeeeit
  oh and i use 1/2 black pvc hose for the main drip lines and 3/8 hose for the individual plant veins there are handy 1/2 pvc to garden hose connectors and all my drips are hooked up to multi hose adaptors mostly 4 way manifolds there are also many hose timers involved programmed to specifically run as many zones simultaneously as necessary to match the rate of flow from my pump its pretty frankensteinly with the irrigation but its so much nicer than watering manually    i also run this to an entire garden thats about 50wide by 250 long not a small veg garden like in the pics im seeing here id still be using a pump like that though even for a smallmedium sized veg garden
  is the water pressure sufficient that youre able to water them all at once 
toughest trades    my vote goes for drywalling
  toughest trades  labor for money
  if i take those masks off will they die
  cement rendering/stucco or tiling
  kek    step aside manlet we used to pray for rain hauling 2000 bales of hay a day so we could go pull wells
  no but breathing the shit is bad for you i am sure
roofers rise up
  sad
  general labor because no one wants to take you under their wing for apprenticeships after 1 year of experience
  roofers rise up    all roofing is hell in midsummer and mid winter but putting hot tar roofs on in the summer is incredibly hard due to the literally boiling hot tar you have to wear gloves long sleeve shirts boots and long pants and you are on top of a roof so there is almost never any shade once the hot tar has been mopped out and you are spreading the gravel layer you are hot as fucking shit and try to imagine how heavy that mop is its an oversized mop to start with and has who knows how many pounds of tar soaked into it    if you have never done this job you cannot imagine the hell it is
  it could be extremely painful
  my vote is for roofing as well those fuckers work hard as hell and roofs suck in almost any weather  watch skinny as fuck roofers wolf down 4000 calorie lunch every day   never gain any weight
    youre a big guy
    for you
  live in the far north tropics of australia  working on same housing estate for 2 years  get to know most other crews from other trades pretty well  middle of summer  one morning a ranga red head shows up in the roofers crew  we chuckle to ourselves that he is not going to have a good day  36c 96f  95 humidity  5pm knockoff time  drinking beers   spot the ranga  the absolute most ridiculous shade of red i have ever seen a human being turn  close to a deep purple hue  skin is shimmering and shiny  throbbing almost  bloke is definitely getting melanoma one day from this single days sun  next morning  no ranga  never see him again  he lasted one day
    here in the caribbean even black people hide from the sun a lot of the guys i know who have to work in the sun wear sun screen and long drapy clothing and large floppy hats    its only the tourists that seek the sun
  tool and die
  this is bait right
  this tough is a state of mind not physicality
my manual labor has consisted of commercial painting landscaping and masonrymasonry was pretty rough did that for a while until i went back to school
did framing for a bit really sucks when you gotta fuck with the metal after its been sitting on site over night in the cold or all day in the heat
    the landscaping i did was pretty rough    used to have to climb into quarry pits to hand select stones for dry stone walls and when i wasnt doing that i was digging holes for days
  i dun get it explain
  whatever a heart attack or silicosis will get me long before huffing drywall dust idgaf
  back in the day hay bales were gathered up and stacked by hand none of this big round and square bales loaded with air conditioned tractors business and pulling wells long story shord there is a long metal string of around here mostly 5/8 and 3/4 rods inside of 2 pipe half a mile deep remove head off a pumpjack and proceed to pull it all up out of the ground until you find what the problem is    its bearable with descent help and a 3 man crew worked a 2 man crew for years and refused to operate the rig for fear of suiciding someone by the end of the day lifting heavy wrenches all day long or litterally jogging non stop for hours at a time with the long metal rods takes a toll not to mention you are typically covered in grease crude oil and salt water mixtur so you cant even sweat hardly through anything exposed they are almost always at the bottom of a hill in a gully with 0 wind flow hot in summer and little sun in winter also soaked through cloth gloves is really hard to use the heavy elevarors that snap onto the rods and pipe shit sucks    if you are in great physical shape it is still demanding the 6 months or so it tales an average noob to really get into the rhythm is absolute hell     both of these are just dumb repetitive heavy motions    probably didnt help i hauled hay since 3 years old stand in drivers seelat and idle to the end of a row dad hop in and turn truck for another row until i was big enough me and a buddy could both lift 1 bail started pulling wells at 13 had to have someone snap the rods apart losen them so i could unscrew them
  almost all tropic shitskin nations have an informal siesta all day and come crawling out at night
did brick laying and painting before going to uni tbh painting is underated in terms of how hard it can be you could have a nice job in a clean house one day then be up on a roof in shit weather painting chimneys bent over on your hands and knees to get at skirtings can be s fair bit of heavy lifting depending on the job too
  pipe tripping
  in summer here you see roofers hosing down their roofing iron before handling it because its scorching hot from the sun
    drywalling isnt hard its just shitty work hard work would probably be anything involving welding because not only are most of the materials heavy but you also have to take safety extremely seriously or the entire building blows up    runner up would probably be concreting because any small mixing mistake is a multimillion dollar fuckup on most jobs
  once had to do matte black sheet metal roof on a 42c day with long pants on
  hehe
  drywalling  lol no cant be the toughest if youve always got a roof over your head in residential construction i would consider the toughest most physically demanding trades to be  formwork  roofing  masonry  framing
    we dont siesta     thats the spanish
  my vote goes to wetbacking
for me its a threeway tie between brickies painters and pipefitters    brickies are always the most miserable on the jobs im on breathing in silica dust all day plus they seem to be on the job the shortest so i imagine they sit alot or do other shit on the side    painters are basically exposed to all sorts of chemicals on a daily basis every older painter ive met on the job had some sort of cancer    pipefitters have to deal with heavy pipe all day nuff said    tfw sparky who bends and slams shitty runs of 3/4 emt above ceiling tile all day and calls himself a skilled tradesman
      why do you faggots think this is funny
  my bends arent that shitty
  industrial maintenance   ranked 2 in most job site deaths second to coal miners

fought in vietnam 2 tours grunt  fuck you pussies
    crap i am in industrial maintthought it was safer then offshore oil
  nobody thinks its funny its the autistic spergs with ocd that need shit like this so they dont kill themselves
  proof or fuck off
  that smell was in your nose dude you need saline menthol nose gushers to clean it out    t worked in a cannery and finally found that out after like 3 years
  literally beaner tier work
  beaner tier as well
  roofer here never done hot but everyone i have met who has done hot has some fucking tragic story about some other poor bastard that did hot and made a mistake fuck hot tar have illegals do it and then call ice before you pay em

  t faggot that doesnt like to work hard
  pretty much the ones only mexicans do roofing laying floor electrical drywall painting house framing    it makes me sad that our society only values college degrees if you dont get a college degree you are deemed a failure we need more kids to be encouraged to get into vocational/trade schools
  i dont have to prove shit to you boy  stop by im 70 and ill still stomp a mudhole in your pussy ass
  calm down ojisan
  id be a tradesman but all the jobs require working with a ton of people
  groundworks contracting is much harder more dangerous and less faggy
    id be a tradesman but im not retarded and didnt flunk out of 3rd grade math
  yes over a period of 40 years and quite painfully
  odds are youre a neet regardless
  respect i did hay bailing and shit for a couple years taking care of horses on a farm for a friend   had done some interior remodeling/landscaping/some masonry before but farmwork  hay was a special sort of difficult
threw hay at 12  roofed for 10 years  concrete for 10 years  tower climber 8 years  remodeling since  nothing hard about any of it after your body adapts the hardest part is working around lazy fucking idiots
try working in a steel forge     2200 degree steel in hand  probably 30 machines that weigh tons and tons slamming with hydraulic pressure that you gotta put the steel in to  so loud and hot inside but you gotta wear long sleeves pants tinted glasses ear plugs  muffs  air is tinted black from steel dust everyone has respiratory issues similar to mining air quality so bad that osha let us smoke indoors  6 days a week mostly 10 hours  rain snow or shine     had 3 people die in a little over a year shouldve taken a hint when the guy that trained me had a permanent shocker from losing fingers my vision is shot covered in scars i got the fuck out though its hellish
  i dont know why someone in first world country would willingly do that kind of work even if you are from a poor small town just get into shape and join the military instead being on a ship or a couple years in a combat zone are safer and healthier than heavy iron work or mining
  what the fuck do you think grunts and sailors do exactly finances
computer science
i stand in front of the french fry station all day  covered in grease and salt smell like grease all day my house smells like grease its much worst than any roofing job and we get no respect at all
    the military half the time is more stressful on the mentality i could have done nearly anything in the raf but i chose not too because my afternoon freedom and regular pussy were higher on my priority list
  i am in a somewhat poor rural area no experience at the time beyond labor and drafting just needed a job and they had a revolving door i was 18 leaving a shitty home situation did what i had to     but pay was actually good despite no time/energy to do shit with it but get fucked up and i had insurance from the company on practically everything but my goddamn car because they knew youd get some sort of ailment eventually    one day i had just had enough and went on drove right up the street and got another job     but its so loud there i can still hear the hammers slamming when i go out to smoke at new job
is /diy/ the biggest larp board or is it really filled with groggy old farts with dozens of occupational ills
  why do americans pretend to be vets all the time
  i wonder the same i have plenty of occupational ills but still stupid young    im steel forge anon
  no there are stupid millineals like you queer
  more true than you know nigga
  military is nothing without mining and refining as is society  id like to see your first world country after all your mines and refineries and mills shutdown cause its not first world work youll starve in a year if you didnt all kill each other first technically it should be the soldiers mining and making their own fucking guns and bullets
    and the miners shoot the bullets
  drywalling  yeah i couldnt do it mindlessly drilling screws into sheetrock all day years on end kill me
    cant handle the graft    bet you need to sand your compound after you tape up takes a real man to compound smooth first time around
    thanks guys for calling attention to this but im starting to wonder if getting caught was part of his plan
    but im starting to wonder if getting caught was part of his plan    what would have he been caught doing

  they must find one of us in the wreckage brother

toughest trade is safety man everyone hates your guts and wants you dead
  why the fuck not if you can cut an 8000 foot pass with less than 1 foot variance you deserve to fire a bullet at least youll know how to make use of one instead of taking potshots at civilians      this guy knows
  yeah that or a foundry worker look absolutely horrible  t cozy shop welder
    for a normal human that is a problem but i can guarantee you that the vast majority of safety inspectors are psychopaths and get off on trying to hit you up on shit that doesnt exist if you are to the book    had fucking health and safety try cite my restaurant for the bartenders and waitresses not wearing hair nets on the floor
  drywalling is just below tiling in not exactly hard but incredibly annoying and labor intensive anyone could do it if they wanted to waste their fucking life
    i remember one time osha kicked me and another worker off a construction site i was framing and a helper to my framer buddy and left for a minute and when i came back he told me we had to leave he said an osha guy saw him on a scaffold without his harnace on or connected and they took pictures and find the guys we were working for
  tough  hahaha    try this one faggot  underwaterbasketweaving
toughest trade i would say plumbing but i am biased from just the labor intensive of running pipe and gas lines on new construction to climbing under houses or going in attics with your pipes pulling water heaters from attics and getting into tight positions where no man was ever intended to operate in climbing into wet muddy tunnels to repair underground pipes under the slab running drains and getting splashed with piss/shit/grease dealing with customers who dont care about the masterpiece of work you put behind their walls but about the scratch on a piece of trim not to mention the mental labor no plumbing job is the same the amount of variables is endless and a good plumber with 30 years exp is still gonna find things he has never seen before     a plumber is their for every step of construction from before a slab is poured to after the paint has dried
    well i suppose you can take into consideration it can be super easy can be about a week ago i literally called a plumber out to take five minutes to literally tell me what the issue was and didnt have to do shit and still charged me 65 i aint mad at him because he saved me a shitload of money he let me know my shit was clogged at the city line and told me if he did it he would charge me like 350 but the city would do it for free since its at the line called them up and they showed up like an hour later and sure enough they had to fix their crap
  lol yea your 6 inch city sewer was stopped up takes a plumber to diagnose it ya know a plumber is a dumb guy some dude that comes plays with shit but a good plumber understands and profits off sanitation human society operates sanitary societies because plumbers know how to direct potable water and direct sanitary sewer so thats why i charge 9500 an hour
    i told my wife he deserves the money his experience let him know what not to waste his time with in order to realize the issue my brother in law works at an apartment complex as a maintenance guy im guessing you know how it is a jackofalltrades/masterofnone kind of guy we went to him first he started ripping parts of the drywall off and shit and i was like all right fuck it i can tell he doesnt know what the fuck hes doing and hes going to rip the house apart to still not figure it out wouldnt be the first time the shit has happened so i called the plumber and said its worth it
  fought for israel 2 tours goyim
  ugh im a 51 woman and i want to do pipefitting shit is going to be hard but damn its great money i cant do ironworking/underwater too much
  a plumber is their for every step of construction  you might drop in for a couple of days every now and then but carpenters perform the vast majority of work in residential construction you can survive in a house without plumbing you wont survive a harsh winter without a roof over your head
  yeah on a residential build they will be there for 1 day for slab piping 12 days internal framing plumbing and maybe a few days for fitoff meanwhile carpenters are there for months on end dealing with all the fuckwit subbies day after day
    cant do underwater too much    females are normally better at diving so i dont know what you mean
      i work on commercial and industrial buildings and the plumbers are hardly there unless the building has sprinkler head fire suppression
  literally false
  plumbers dont run gas lines on new construction
    stop putting yourself down pumpkin
bricklayers laborer     i have been doing this for 3 years it sucks in the summer but the winter is worse here in hamilton ontario it seems like the tarps and propane will be coming soon    should have stayed in school
  if the weather is that much of a factor to you then youre clearly not working very hard also drywallers have to go into a house thats had 220v heaters pumping all night so the mud dries even in summer
   im on the lot from day one before the pile drivers and framesman show up i layout my drain and vent stacks before any wood touches concrete im working around framers while i run iron gas pipe after a carpenter is done the plumber iz still in the house setting fixtures and trim plus i make money off 24 hour plumbing usually nasty drain cleaning but i never heard of a 24 hour carpenter service lol
   lol ok  then who runs gas pipe in new construction please tell me what trade runs iron gas pipe
  sparked    this sounds like a post by a pipefitter who was confused for a plumber or a faggot to many times
  the bad ones do but it was accidental
  wish i hadnt wasted so much time in college i am making more in a trade then 90 of the guys i went to college with
  plus i make money off 24 hour plumbing usually nasty drain cleaning but i never heard of a 24 hour carpenter service lol  because im skilled enough at my trade that i can pick my jobs and hours why the fuck would anyone want to be on call
  t drywaller  have you ever roofed in 100 degree heat framed in sub freezing temperatures whens the last time you had your clothing melt on a job have you ever walked a 2x4 wall with an icy plate those are a few times ive personally considered weather to be a factor in my work conditions i also know that are other guys that have it worse stop sucking down that moondust kid i think youre going retarded
   and im skilled enough to be useful at any hour of the day my services are needed day and night when the work beckons and justifies double money why wouldnt i jump at the work you can pick and choose your job hours sure but i dont see any trade having the opportunity to pull overnight hours like plumbing

  well it isnt very labor intensive and if you are an antisocial cocksucker then it is a good fit pays good to biggest danger is getting fucked up by guys like us when they fuck with our lively hood
  fucking lol
toughest ive ever done would either be plowing snow or demolition course i imagine demo was only so hard because i was hungover and havent really done anything else like it/dont have the same muscles a guy who does it everyday would have    plowing can go either way you might get 3 inches get in a few hours and go home no problem   or you might have a blizzard like in 96 watch the sun rise 3 times over and have to fix dam near every driveline part on your truck and whatever fucks off on your plow  alas i dont remember most of those days and so when i got the check i shit my pants
  is moped tar still a thing why not use asphalt/bitumen sheets
  wish folks would realize this in regards to pixel plumbers aka it guys
  i didnt know vietnam had a sequel
  painting can be pretty demanding a lot easier with sprayers imo     worst trade for me was plumbing drilling concrete fixing fucked up pads lugging a bunch of pipe fuckhot brazing in humid 105f sun on a tin floor 2nd floor of a building no roof yet they pour concrete on the tin ribs i was in great shape until my back was fucked unrelatedly would have helped if the outfit wasnt so fucked    i think it was slowly killing me lol
  my favorite moments were the concrete pourers pushing the drains in when pouring the pads or knocking them over here we have to use flexible couplings for earthquake bs people shitting and pissing in the notyetdraining plumbing tubs etc one site was a piss war everything was covered in piss oh and the dumbfuck electricians dry wallers ducters etc punching holes or screws in the pipes flooded a whole wing of an apartment once when they hit a 2 pex line lol
      theres a reason every toolmaker youll ever meet will be crazy an alcoholic or an asshole
    one site was a piss war everything was covered in piss    working in a site now where the client is a woman    the first couple times she smelt urine on the site the whole labour force was fired now guys watch eachother like a hawk if the move away from the works    site just smells like sawdust concrete and metal its actually for the best
im a steamfitter    concrete formers do the toughest job
  13 yr journeyman electrician here we arent posting because we know our jobs arent the hardest/toughest in terms of a physical sense i didnt get into this trade because it was hard i worked a few years as a glazier that was tough climbing a 6ft ladder with a 250lb sheet of glass in my hand and then setting it gently made drywall feel light weight as fuck    electrical is tough in terms of the amount of volume and organizational efforts one must do to be decent at it feeder wire sucks to handle digging sucks on a roof in a blizzard or middle of the hottest days of the year and setting gear can suck but usually its so heavy you use equipment same with 4 rigid pipe that is threaded into place    no trade is physically easy but glazing steel think about weight 50lbs of safety gear and tools and being on hot/cold steel and framers all have it pretty rough in terms of physical work
  aluminum work like trough fascia and soffit is the same sucks the heat right from your hands
  anyone can be a tradesman but you still have to be good at math to be a good tradesman
nobody even mentions cutting wood srsly
id say stone installation good pay but youre moving hundred pound of stone with no chance of accident they have to be cut and installed precisely with little chance of adjustment
    chainsaws took all the hard work out of it    now its just dangerous
  kek you serious whats the longest youve held a chainsaw
    i clear cut 13 acres of tropical jungle last year with an ms381 and a pickup
    and some labourers of course
  noice
  by yourself
    see     we did it during the most hurricane filled and wetest hurricane season we have had in 30 years which meant the pickup couldnt get within 400 of the what was once a field was for 7 months a swamp we got that fucker stuck 4 times a day    the actual felling is the easy but dangerous even when the stand is tight enough that every fucking tree got hooked up on another even if it was falling away from the other it became technical and dangerous but not hard
  kind of funny
  1st year apprentice
  first reply that made sense to me
  13 yr journeyman  you are still a journeyman after 13 years of learning how to be a sparky or you are a 13yo underb learning to be a sparky either way consider an heroing
  not sure how i offended you but you should go suffocate in a bag of dicks   im gonna assume you are another drunken drywaller mad at the world for being your own failures
  2nd year used to be real hectic now i am basically doing routine maintnance easies job ever compared to press shop and on site assembly in heighs
  felling is easy but chopping the wood into pieces on steep terrain aint
  and youre proud of it killing innocent people
  shoutouts from waterdown
      sorry pissing in bottles and hiding piss bottles in walls is only difficult if you have a big dick none of you drywallers are girthy enough to have a problem doing what you non toilet trained disgusting subhumans do
    i didnt go 11b because my asvab was to high    youre exactly the same as those faggots
  riggers/ironworkers
    coyotes dont deserve to be grouped with nuisances and pests they are something below a class of its own i dont have a name for it but there are no words to describe the spite i feel for those creatures
  commercial ablebodied seaman   no definitely not the toughest      im trying out for the local ironworkers union in 10 daysfor the 2nd time  hucking 85 lbs of rebar for half an hour  tying rebar  written test  climbing a ladder walking the iron 14 ft up and hoisting a 50 lb bucket  simple knots    42 applicants 28 made it in my first tryout  practicing tying rebar and hiking uphill on a treadmill my calves were on fucking fire during the tryout and i will land this apprenticeship
  you need to pass a test to join the union in the us
  for a couple ive looked into yes you have to tryout for the apprenticeship
  i used to landscape in netherlands fun but cant do it till 70 yo now live off the money i made back in my cheap as fuck motherland and study engineering i couldnt care less about drywallers
  or at least i couldnt do it till 70 yo im barely average athletically compared to other manual labor workers not to the office drones
    hes fat    the two times you bucked some trees doesnt count    also you have no idea what a hill looks like we have roads here that only 4x4s with low range can make it up even my v8 half ton needs low range on a concrete road    when we feel an buck trees on those hills you have to tie a rope to every section you buck or even a 12 length goes sliding down long ways
  air quality so bad that osha let us smoke indoors  holy shit bro thats a new level of fuck
    he has to stick his dick inside the bottle to piss in it    do you stick your dick into the urinal as well
i know its not considered a trade but hear me out salesman    i was a salesman for a few years and it was pretty fucking bad we used to talk about how we wished we could just go do a job get paid she go home to have a few drinks/smoke some pot/whatever when youre a salesman youre constantly worried about meeting your quota sometimes a daily quota your livelihood your bills your mortgage or rent your food it all depends on whether or not you can sell enough to make it through the week its psychologically heavy you cant go home and relax you go home and you have to worry about being able to sell enough tomorrow  paranoid about whether or not a deal will go down the way its supposed to whether or not the customer will come back and buy whatever you were trying to sell giving you a little bit for your stress and efforts id get about 10 on the profit which roughly translates to 35 of the actual cost to the customer    that shit was brutal i worked 1214 hour days 6 days a week for about 8 years i lost 50lbs the worst thing was that i was never promoted past the senior manager position still required to meet sales quotas because i was considered a great salesman and they couldnt afford to lose their best salesman    i got out of it and got into the medical field years ago i will gladly go into heavy physical labour of i have to  i worked in a factory for years before i got into sales but i will never ever ever ever go back into sales
  im not fat just a bit chunky i buck trees everyday and i have a pretty good idea what a hill looks like ive cut trees standing on vertical stones  we dont even think about going with trucks there its only for 4x4 tractors and we use bulldozers to cut roads in the hillside  we buck the wood in 1meter logs for firewood and we just let them roll downhill untill they hit the road or winch them up if there is no road below or if its in some hole
  literally me
   harnace    yea i see
  sorry man no sympathy here ive been fucked by too many sales people in my time to feel anything but hate for 99 of the sales people out there most of you assholes dont even take the time to learn your product and them just straight up lie    see us tradesmen have to work hard while still thinking and then have the integrity to do what we said we were gonna do even if its tough all you have to do is place an order talk some bullshit pass it to the supplier and collect a check but hey when something goes wrong it wasnt your fault right
  cs is a very apples to oranges comparison to a lot of the things in here  high stress computer science is hard i remember nearly shooting myself over a machine learning problem that needed to be solved right now but there was weird data constraints and our startup was about to be dissolved and i had to solve weird math i barely understood fast or else  the company didnt make it lol  unstressful computer science is easy my new job is fixing email and printer servers for angry old lawyers and rebooting their computers my coworkers who are younger say its soul sucking woth no advancement but i make as much as i did before and havent once wanted to kill myself  i suppose before i was still young and after glory and not wasting my potential    i think steel forge sounds like the hardest thing in this thread  i suppose theres a psychological torture and physical torture 2d graph  steel forge would get a lot of psychological torture points from the noise and repitition with obvious physical torture  stressful cs would be high phycological mainly though extreme stress programming has destroyed my health a few times  unstressful cs is the bottom of the chart literal lawyers arguing with you on whats wrong with their computer is slightly draining but not that bad comparatively

third world crack head    they get used as septic tank cleaners no safety equipment other than their pants and shirt if they even had a shirt
  they get used as septic tank cleaners no safety equipment other than their pants and shirt if they even had a shirt    that reminds me of old time chimney sweeps who were usually small boys first there was some kind of testicular cancer they got then there was some reason that they were supposed to clear the soot above them as they went up meaning they inhaled a lot of it and finally they would sometimes get stuck occasionally when an old building is torn down they will find a skeleton in a chimney but usually theyd try to tear out the bricks and get the guy out before he died because when you get jammed like that sometimes you cant breathe too well
  4chan was made for anime regardless of the board friend
  theres a reason every toolmaker youll ever meet will be crazy an alcoholic or an asshole    i worked in td from 95 to 06 and i pretty much covered all 3 of those i always hear the well you always have that skill to fall back on if you ever need a job i tell them ill suck dicks at a truck stop for a living before id go back to that
    i tell them ill suck dicks at a truck stop for a living before id go back to that    i kind of understand what you are trying to say but you need to realise that not everyone shares the same hobbies that you do
restoration can be a real fucking bitch  scriping up 90 year old asbestus tiles  while wearing an oxygen mask  and suited up in a vinyl suit  have to strip down and shower if yoi want to leave your room  you only get to drink water before you go in and when you have a lunch break  seriously when your sweating your balls off thirsty as fuck and exhausted you lose your shit i tore my shit off and just walked out once i thought i was gonna have a brain aneurism
  honestly grunts and sailors do almost no work a couple months a year you go in the field and its pretty gay but other than that its just a whole lot of waiting around
  get a load of this guy
the hardest thing about any trade is dealing with guys like  and  who aggrandize their own work ethic and expect people to match their own inflated efforts work hard not smart type guys who make everything much harder than it needs to be because youre not a pussy right
  thats not true st paul local 34 plumber just ran gas today for a lab  i think theres a btu limit as well as what the pipe is serving
  oil or natgas
    they are the kind of guys that walk around talking about work and telling everyone else how to do their job
regarding outdoor work my vote goes for jobs in the mountains like mining and logging and at sea like fishing they are both physically and mentally exhausting jobs  regarding trades and industry i think steelworks is the worst
  always feel conflicted explaining illustration to a plumber like no matter how good you are at draftsmanship or figure painting or composition or even getting likenesses from real life or reference easily you always know in the back of your head to never complain because these guys literally soak their hands in shit almost every day i try to treat working men and women with respect if they come into my household thank you for fixing my house guys

  underwater welding
  oh whatever  4 hours of dive time a day and the polarity makes it easy as shit to weld underwater   you spend more time getting shit ready on a dive crew than doing the actual job  hurr stick welding underwater is hard  so is tending umbilical  gtfo you dit greenie
  and the polarity makes it easy as shit to weld underwater   shop welder here how different is it from normal stick welding is it even i thought about doing some sketchy shit with a bucket to find out but i realized this might be a bad idea
  you dont need to manipulate the rod like you have to for stick welding like overhead and vertical welds    its just point and shoot   also dont go to underwater welding/dive school its not a super badass job and welding underwater on the job is extremely rare
  huh thats pretty cool  didnt intend to that job looks like a pain in the ass more than anything and also i hate water
  mining
  thought mexicans pretty much owned those jobs
  i just got into the ironworkers union today    top of the class im stoked
    this happened to me as a gyprocker in west nsw im a ranga too
  yeah those guys are pretty insane they have to be kept at pressure in these little pods for weeks at a time and if they go outside the pod they die if something happens it takes a couple of days to depressurize no matter what
  no thats called saturation diving thats not underwater welding    and did you ever learn grammar
      theres something about trying to rush something that has non existent tolerances that if you fuck up goes in the scrap bin and you get to start from scratch that just makes people want to drink this is one line of work that is so unique its hard to even explain to people sometimes    ive been working at shim/sharpen place for the past few years its a nice change of pace but still a little hectic when youre the one who gets championed to go fix a press thats holding up 8k/hour when its stamping     should probably add hearing loss and balding to that list atleast 95 of people in this trade are bald/balding
  electric safety man here  greetings customer you have been haunted by grave danger but worry not for am i have spotted and protocolized the danger oh the whole plant production goes this machine oh it has to be stopped and causing millions of financial damage well then dear sir lo and behold these  for am i have the power to stop this shit at once before one of your workers maims himself and sues your shit and your plant and you see wrath like no other than a fist of god almighty so help me osha so dont tell me i didnt saved your ass right now pal  you can of course reject my offer then i really dont care because i have you warned and it stands on paper so any lawyer that wants something from me can piss off gday
i got some free cable leftover from a fiber optic installation from a company what can i do with it can connectors be put on this for networking my only experience is with cat5 connectors/pliers but i have never ventured into optics
  its a couple hundred bucks for the tools needed how many fibers are in there 1 2 12    cat5e or 6 and 1gbit networking fulfill any networking needs just fine for most people if you are running a long distance or to another building its worth thinking about but you need media converters then which is another hundred bucks  i assume you dont have an enterprise grade router that has 10gig ethernet ports on it
  tldr its basically garbage     outside of the box maybe you could make a fiber optic concrete display or other light art project check bigclive on youtibe on the other hand that is probably single mode fiber and you might have a hard time coupling the artsy light to it without putting connectors on it
  the next time you are burying something add that in as well just for fun  termination tools for your roll are more expensive than just buying that much already terminated a guess requiring toilet paper on the length about 500      ive never tried to use fiber in this way as the strands are so thin but now want to cut up some old sc terminated fiber at least st has uses in the audio world the strands are so thin i cant imagine how many an art project would take     as for op be a badass when yer freinds ask what is this weird rope you are using to tie this mattress to the roof of your 90s honda or whateverwith bro thats just burial rated fiber money aint shit     another option on the same idea would be using it for one of those dog lines you stretch across your yard
  the core is way too thin he wont be able to launch any significant amount of light into it      just put it on ebay and see if anyone wants it let them deal with the splicing and the small glass fragments travelling through their body and fucking them up from within
  1gbit networking fulfill any networking needs just fine for most people  nobody would ever need more than cat5  also gdmi/dp/whatever apple gas stolen this week takes piles of bandwidth fiber is the only will never need to run again option that has survived the jump from internet connections being measured in baud to today
      op here    thanksthis is what i figured worst case i was gonna use it to tie down things in the backyard theres probably no art or woodworking value was thinking wiring for a garden trellis or something to hold plants
  if you cut the black plastic off there should be two white pieces of fiberglass rod these are the strength members they will stab you real good keep the black plastic on in between the two strength members there is a plastic tube inside the plastic tube there is probably goopy gel and a blue fiber
  deep and the only really strong part of any of this is the fiberglass strength members like 100 lbs all day long 800 lbs is probably a comfortable max
  small glass fragments travelling through their body and fucking them up from within  true dat i used to terminate single mode and pm fiber for 8 hours a day those splinters work their way in but wont come out for weeks then you dig at them and they just shatter and work themselves in further this time as ten splinters rather than one shit is nightmare fuel      the place i worked at was building thousands of 100gbit transceivers a week to run on existing infrastructure this was 8 years ago so lord only knows what speed theyre up to by now
  i dont get this i guess its because im fusing not making new connectors never had any fiber fragments yet the worst thing is the strength members
im thinking about buying some cheap truing stand to start building some wheels for profit  i have never done it but i have some mechanical skills in general    im thinking about buying cheap rims and hubs off the internet and putting them into complete wheels and then selling them for a small profit     what do you think about this idea would it be viable obviously im not expecting anything big just some spare bucks
  what do you think about this idea would it be viable     your one and only shot is to compete and undercut already dirt cheap wheelsets on ebay and the like  are you going to be able to do it and will it actually be worth your time and are you willing to potentially let a niche sort of item sit with your money invested    thats all up to you to figure out  the real money is putting together high end wheelsets but nobody is going to pay a bum to do it when its usually reasonable to have a licensed tech at a shop do it     i dont see how youll make enough money for the effort involved
  i have never done it but i have some mechanical skills in general    what happens when your wheel pretzels   wheel building is an art takes skill to understand offset spoke lengthtension not just anybody can do it    prepare to get sued if anyone gets hurt because of your wheels especially a child  the liability is outrageous  the first thing the court will ask where were you trained and what licensed bike shop do you work for   million dollar settlements against bicycle manufacturers are common  most consumer goods are built with a safety factor of 4 4 times the strength it needs  bicycle safety factor is 12 because children use the product  buying cheap rims and hubs off the internet  youre setting yourself up go fail
    there was a time about 40 years ago when there were still lots of mgs and triumphs on the road built by the utterly incompetent british leyland and you could have made decent money rebuilding their wire wheels which got rusty and loose within 10 years or so    i found an old guy out in the country who showed me that his rebuilt ones would ring like a bell when you tapped it with a wrench only problem was he wanted more than the car was worth to redo all five the main issue was that you had to have an inner tube and the rust would cause a flat about every week or so so i got solid wheels at the junk yard and the tire shop switched them and told me that of the 50 or so flats that i had had not one was an actual puncture
  cheap truing stand    is that just like a junk bike and dial indicator
you cannot compete with chinese sweatshops dont even bother trying
  is that just like a junk bike and dial indicator    those three adjustable guides make it a bit better
are trades worth it they completely ruin your health
yes
yes
only if your father owns the shop and youll inherit when he retires otherwise no
working always has a downside  white collar jobs can also ruin your health the best thing to do is to rise up as much as possible so you can either live your old days as a boss/administrator or accumulate enough for a nice pension
get into one of less common trades    elevator repair  stationary engineer  machinist cnc  millwright  appliance repair  windmill tech    shit like that less physical labor    if i was 20 years younger i would become an elevator mechanic and get into the repair side
  oh yeah if youre smart dont just be a laborcuck learn hvac or electrician or sonething then you can make a livable wage while you study investing and fumble around until you can replace your income then quit and invest full time    start reading personal finance and investing books now any if them and dont stop until you are free    should take you well under 5 or 10 years to retire if you are single and smart    5 years running wires aint shit
  this guy has it right its not about getting into the everyday trades its about getting in niche trades that help with the everyday every building has a elevator and the fact is only liscened techs can touch that thing when it gets stalled or how about fire alarms/sprinklers every single building has to be up to code with them who do you think changes them a plumber nope its just a specialist hell theres even a fire extinguisher guy the best is calling in the carpet guy for repairing a tiny ass rip stares at it for 10 mins spends 5 mins actually repairing and then charges 2000 trades are the ultimate darwin game you get paid your worth/time/effort and doubly so if you actually know your ass from a hammer its not about a question if its worth it its a question if your gona make it worthwhile at all
  if youre relatively smurt and college isnt an option due to family obligations or whatever learning hvac or how to paint with proper ppe youll be fine and will do fine with money if youre not one of those jackasses buying a truck far too big and in fact detrimental to the job   get a half ton pickup with 4wd and a long bedand go the fuck to work
  this cnc machinists do well and if you start out as a tech a decent company may send you to programming school if you can handle it  its also fun to watch desu   i was a security at a big oil tooling company they had a computer lathe as big as a train for oil drill bits the german dude who programmed it was making 6 figures
  seeing as the alternative was throwing myself out the window after a couple months of office work id say so
im a watchmaker easy on the body loads of work well paid
quit being a bitch and go get a cert in whatever interests you
  only when youre dumb as shit  working with your mind is much better paid
im an apprentice gunsmith decent gunsmiths end up with months of backlogged work at any given time but you have to constantly deal with people that are like the dunningkruger effect given corporeal form theres always repair and refinish work to be done and people pay retarded amounts of money for customizations
  just dont do the shit ones that dont require schooling  construcion labourer since hs  now doing restoration  already had surgery on my knee  inhale aspestos etc every single day  theres worse shit better than being a coal miner or at the fucking pork processing plant other burn outs in my city work at
    like this guy said go to community college you dont want to do an apprenticeship with asshole boomers who will break your back and give you shit all day
  go be a damn electrician or something then    an engineer counts as a tradesman right
  get a half ton pickup with 4wd and a long bedand go the fuck to work  truths
  thats pretty neat anon howd you get into the field any background beforehand or is it one of those fields that takes anyone who is willing to learn and work
  an engineer counts as a tradesman right  no engineers are not tradesmen an electrical engineer is a different job from electrical technician technicians often dabble in the engineering side if theyre clever but its mostly maths and that scares a lot of white americans away from actual engineering as opposed to figure out whats broke and unbroke it engineers always at least have a bachelors degree from a university tradespeople are usually certified by the trade and depending on the trade might have gone to college for some instructional time or apprenticed under someone fully licensed
  only if you fall for the college meme
  true was a carpenter/laborer for a year after i graduated inhaled silica a few times didnt know it was so dangerous until a couple years later no benefits worked 12 hour days paid under the table etc money was good but quickly realized i needed something more legit
  hitting the back end of this currently gathered skills in forestry carpentry stone masonry and landscaping also have permanent damage to my shoulder from an accident that i then worked on for a month instead of letting heal like i should of fuck er suck it up right i can build a house and a brick shitter to go with it but i fear hard labour may be in the past now      op the smart money is in running your own operation foreman or busted
  did you go to texas tech
  only when youre dumb as shit  shut up retard
  no i got out 10 years in and became an engineer office jobs mo better
grass is always greener i work at a welfare office and every day am closer to taking a swish of shotgun mouthwash but i love doing /diy/ stuff in my spare time making or fixing something gives my autism satisfaction that no amount of shekels can give just wear a mask when you think you should and lift with your legs and your health will be fine
  if youre a britbong an engineer is anyone who turns wrenches i dont know what an actual engineer is called
  how does a bullet get stuck in a barrel like that not cleaning
  called a squib load   rare misfire where the powder doesnt all burn and the pressure is high enough to push the bullet but low enough that it doesnt exit the barrel  this guy didnt notice and kept shooting rounds into the squib causing a traffic jam  lucky it was a revolver that can vent the pressure or he wouldnt have a hand
  my assumption was that they were reloads and dude forgot the powder
  electrician/wireman work is still a bit tough on the body esp if youre commercial instead of residential
  whatever trade you choose go into it with the goal of having your own company by the time youre in your midthirties or so your body can only work so hard for so long before it wears out you need to be the boss before this happens i know too many carpenters and framers that cant work anymore because of blown out rotator cuffs in their shoulder my cousin is a flooring guy and his knees wore out years ago hes in his 40s now but hes the boss too owning the company now he pays the young bucks to fuck their knees up hazards of the trade all trades have them choose well anon
id say it was worth it for me   left highschool early with ged  wanted to do electrical engineering but couldnt afford school  started electrical apprenticeship in ibew  hated being in the union  joined nonunion shop  learned a bunch of shit  worked my ass off  fast forward a little and now im 25 making 140k working mostly at home doing a cushy easy job at ge i feel bad for the guys that stay in the union for 30 years and get brainwashed into thinking thats the best they could ever have but it was an excellent experience for me and several of my friends to springboard off of     they completely ruin your health  this isnt 1920 bro theres this cool thing called osha just wear your ppe and wash your hands
  are trades worth it    depends  i dropped out of high school and had no job experience of any type and walked onto a job at 27 years old no questions asked    so if you are a neet burnout who has wasted a lot of time they are worth it if you are someone with genuine metal deficiencies and arent smart enough for any other work they are worth it    if you are 18 and just getting out of high school the sky is the limit pick what you are good at not something that is easy to get into and pays ok right off the bat
well you can always make a pedagogical training of sorts and teach
  you have to be a certain type of person willing to get your hands dirty and not in it only for money i dont think youre right for the trades
  not only in it for the money  its a fucking job  what kinda commie shit is this   you know what union labor suits guys like you perfect
  a college near me offered a watchmaking program    kinda regret not doing it since its shut down now

ill post some progress from my shenanigans this summer i converted a 50 year old ffa barn in to a garage   pic taken after metal was removed and started jacking up and replacement of main posts
  brought back to grade overheads framed up and getting ready for concrete
  concrete poured carport framed up walls studded
  more framing all this hard work is about to get covered up
  roof on ready to start wrapping and finish metal
  metal installed insulation and wall boards in progress
  and current state started hanging metal ceilings yesterday was quite time consuming cuttingedge around garage door openers and wiring up flush mount lighting as i went pic from carport
  and the inside ive got another full day of lids a lot of paint and i still have to lay up a chimney im getting very close   your turn /diy/ lets see what you guys have cooking
fixing an old water damaged ibm model m  seems a path somewhere is cracked   jesus they should have kept using model f pcb circuits
  looks comfy and well done anon actually im not doing much besides uni work but i hope to fix my car during christmas break
    im trying to design a loft bed so i can compact the shit in my room to make space for a power cage spoilerwhile fighting depression/spoiler im unsure if i should make the corners with 4x4 or two 2x6 at an angle ive got basic tools like a table saw skill saw router etc etc but i dont want it fancy i just want it solid if i used 4x4 i could cut outuhnotches at various points along the corner posts so that some support boards would fit into and make it all look flush and neat but a lot of my tools i mentioned earlier really struggle to make straight cuts and i dont know how to fix them also kind of poor at the moment and while i can expense the cost of some lumber i really dont want to throw a lot of money at fixing the tools just yet    im a 62 230 lb dude im on a cut again and dropping the weight but im worried that the boards might not hold me i really dont want to drop and destroy my computer i have a tendency to overenforce things and my friends call me a dwarf because of it fuck em i love the feel of a solid ass piece of furniture
  wtf dude just chuck the bed on the power cage and bolt that fucker on  light weight baybeee
    at first i laughed but now youve got me thinking anon
  4 day vacation from work today is the last day didnt do much besides for work on my work room i live in an apartment so i cant do much to how i want to set it up got my shelves up and filled and tables set still got to set up my soldering equipment and a computer in there
  so fuckin jelly
  dont do it inside waste of money and echos bad
  i think a waste of money would be trying to heat an open loft a few years back i hung metal in a friends shop and hes set up like me with insulated walls with osb and metal ceilings the echo is not an issue with his but i do have more area either way ill deal with it considering ive got over half of it installed already
  oh well shiti think insulation and wood would have saved you some effort but youre in it now    been in 2 shops and a shop style resturaunt we built where we had to sprayfoam it after because of the noise
i want to start work on a pipelike tobacco pipe  i have a 2x4 of some hard wood but im not sure what to make the stem and mouthpiece out of any suggestions im debating between making the pipe and stem all one piece or doing it in two seperate pieces  and i was wondering what kind of finish would be good for it i dont want it to be bare wood
  use a plastic ink pen for the stem heat it up and shape it i clear bick would look sweet if you crammed an led in the pipe
making staked chairs to match my staked dining table steam bending the chair back hard to tell from the pic but its a curve that hugs your back was a masssssive pain at first but after making 4 of these dudes i think ive gotten the hang of it
  god dammit
this is one i did the other day now i am building a real sybian
  lol nice work bro they are so fucking expensive i considered building my wife one    when you get it nailed down post a tutorial if u want
  wemb  now
  cool idea pass on the led but i like the idea of shaping my own mouthpiece from a bic pen    does anyone know if theres any issue with using a simple hardwood instead of briar
  i bought a model m a few years ago for 100 came really dirty and some jackass told me you can clean it out easy in the dishwasher never worked right after that
not sure if this counts as a project but im teaching myself how to braze aluminum with an oxyacetylene torch  im also rebuilding an xy table i got off an old ultrasonic mill for use with a drill press both projects have been in limbo for a couple days due to time constraints/injury
  i have the same problems except im not 62 but 59 it would be nice to buy a premade solid structure id happily go for a metallic one if existed and then work to add the bed and fittings
  did you microwave your iphone to charge it as well
im working on a potato cannon that makes 5 ignition sparks at the same time    so far i just need to glue the fuel injection port and itll be functional but i havent figured out how to attach the trigger to make it ergonomic
  there is no easy or good looking way imo i just used a roll of electrical tape and a 15 dollar universal propane grill ignitor from lowes     good luck tho and post results
  it may crack
anyone know what the electronics in ecigs are called the chip with a display part
  nevermind found one    evolvaporcom/products/dna200
  that works for charging the newer models but if the thing got wet you need to drop it in a bowl of rice and then microwave it    bonus part is you end up with a dry charged phone and some rice krispies
  you never did spoonfeed it to me    i forgot what i even asked but people just bitched and moaned rather than posting something informative and useful    here comes the train  chooo choooo
my latest knife    aluminum/copper/burned maple/superglue    steel is some stupid hard waferizer knive out of a sawmill
  nice good job anon       i would go 4x4 just so you have more meat to anchor your horizontals into itll resist twisting more than 2xs tacked together       hella /diy/ post pics of the xy table       that profile is sexy af       i just finished this little quad for my kid it was some ugly pink/purple barbie thing i dropped in a fat new 24v batter and put in a motor thats 4x the power of the original my 3 year old can barely hang on lol
gonna go to the hardware store and build pic related soon for gayming     people actually paid 200 for some shit this due literally has laid out to recreate guess people who play sims have more money than sense
  grabbed a dewalt air compressor out of a job site dumpster manifold was cracked regulstor shot and the gauges didnt work fifty bucks in i have a good working air compressor
  im working on my loft bed right now i have acces to my school tools workshopcurrently in last year of hs i used 70x70mm posts for tye legs on my bed you could probably use reinforced mortice joints like pic related if you dont have access to tools or machinery  also ensure you have proper clearance theyre called loft beds for a reason  
old highschool project i have yet to finish will hold a hand gun someday would love a red back with some leds displaying contents

boatbuilding general anyone
  why the commies flying sorcerer at buzludzha tho
  sure i got a little 12 or 14 foot fiberglass john boat that ill be fiberglassing speakers and shit in and using padded chairs on the bottom for the top level armrests and coolers
  didnt have a picture of a boat handy
  plywood frame  fiberglass mat  fiberglass cloth  gelcoat    profit
   a boat  have one on me anon
    eй пeдaлчeтa 
boat maintenance and repair guy here hows things
you want you lose  
  buy shipping container  buy old hull  attach containers to hull  cut in doors and windows  launch boat    profit   its really that simple
  the amount of freeboard on that thing is scary it looks like  but with a junk rig which is its only saving grace
  plywood  fiberglass  if youre not going full carbon in 1800  218 then i dont know what to tell ya
  buy old hull  too expensive just make your own out of used 55 gallon barrels and shipping pallets
  how long would it take the coast guard to scuttle it as unseaworthy
  they cant scuttle it if youre keeping refugee children in the brig
  well yes its a barge/houseboat for extra comfy postapocalyptic living and light cargo service to rate it on looks alone would be shallow
use to enjoy watching the america cup 12m races now they are not televised
  how much heel angle before it flops why no outriggers just for safety sake
  i got well into the volvo ocean race this year it was all done through yt and was awesome
  a 16 wide flat hull shouldnt see more than 10 should it
  the boats they sail now a days are so far removed from actual sailboats its a pointless race they need to make it a multiday all weather race so they stop sailing toilet paper with plane wings
  communist flying scorcerer    ronnyget the pershings
  the cars they drive now a days are so far removed from actual racecars its a pointless race they need to make it a multiday all weather race so they stop driving toilet paper with racing slicks  not every car race is a rally and not every sailing race is a tea race
  well if its flying youd have better luck with m15s or m42s
  most of the boats they sail nowadays were built in the 70s mate what the fuck are you smoking     not every race is the americas cup     not every race is between moths     what is the golden globe    what is the solitaire du figaro    what is the vendee    if you put a bit of effort into watching races that dont have a dedicated app and marketing team youll find things are way more interesting
    guy is replying to a comment specifically about the americas cup race and boats you autists bring up other races and other boats
  good to know
  wouldnotsail/10  just buy a cat
  you will not be sailing that in heavy swell it would be a terrible experience
  ffs
this is my boat that i built and then took to canada currently building a cabin for it i also went to nwswb and have built several other boats that are much nicer than mine
  this is the cabin i built this weekend the time consuming part will be epoxy coating the entire outside and fiberglassing the inside
i built this one as well by myself
  thats really nice looking
  thanks its still for sale unfortunately i cant afford it right now
  nice
  is a model
  thats beautiful
so i have been working on designing this dumb ass pipe dream custom ferrocement/aircrete personal island inspired hull there is a shit ton of variability with the specific material composites mixes and densities so everything below the water line is still hard core wip but what do you guys think about landscaping your deck with grass and trees and shit
  you had one job
  so the americas cup
  what about the future of toilet paper development
  salt or fresh water
  this guy needs du keel weights
  or a hambeast on the trapeze
where to learn how to fiberglass so i can fix the sailboat im going to buy
      west system stuff is expensive there are generic alternatives of basically everything of theirs

i wish i had a shop to build a boat in i live in hawaii and protesters killed our interisland ferry project in its infancymeaning the only way to get around is by plane for most folks
  wow that sucks even california has several ferry routes
  its kinda rough cant really do interisland travel anymore unless youre pretty welloff its prohibitively expensive to keep a large vessel and the old flyingboat services are no more     i guess the real irony of it is that by keeping people using big conventional interisland jet flights they probably ended up producing a lot more pollution than if theyd just let the ferry system be
  protesters killed our interisland ferry project  why
  protesters killed our interisland ferry project    communists never cease to amaze me they literally vote to imprison themselves
  anyone who doesnt submit to the rule of money is a communist  talking point usa shill spotted
  no talking point its the truth hawaii has a huge communist population the largest grouping of card carrying members of the communist party outside china or california
    as i understand it the law required a pair of environmental impact statements to be undertaken as opposed to the singular one which had been obtained the legal battle over whether or not a second one was to be required of them ate up so much time and money that the company went bellyup    as for rule of moneywell i cant really fault the protesters motivations its a shame the project was killed but i cant help but empathize with them somewhat as someone born and raised here theres a very legitimate concern over the infectiousness of urbanization and bigmoney landgrabs and projects escaping from their containment zone in honolulu and the history of the islands is one of environmental catastrophe after environmental catastrophe     maybe one day well get a staterun system one can hope but that days far off i reckonwe have a light rail project which has been a testament to the ineffectiveness bureaucracy and graft of our oneparty government going from a 4 billion initial cost to a current one of like 10 billion     whatever im rambling what i mean to say is its a bit more nuanced than hurr dang commies git if anything it is ironically crony capitalisms faultyou cant get shit done in the island unless you grease the right palms and said government palms are always holding onto the hand of private interests with their free hand
im looking at buying a used jon boat to modify  if i screw a plywood keel to the bottom could it help stabilize it in waves  whats the best way to add an inboard motor
  this is advanced trolling
  completely unironic im just an idiot will it work
  not really since there is wave action beneath the water outriggers would be better what kind of inboard
  ideally the cheapest  could i make the outrigger out of pvc since its buoyant
    superb photo
lumber planets and 2x2     hand saw bench/drop saw    tar    a homemade wood steamer    moveable jig board with pi ns for bending wood    imagination
  yeah urbanization of hawaii is the problem not hawaiians and (((hawaiian politicans)))    the ineffectiveness bureaucracy and graft of our oneparty government going from a 4 billion initial cost to a current one of like 10 billion   you are like little baby our 6 billion high speed rail project costs 100 billion 999 billion of which is (((graft)))    its a bit more nuanced than hurr dang commies git  this is incorrect     if anything it is ironically crony capitalisms faultyou cant get shit done in the island unless you grease the right palms and said government palms are always holding onto the hand of private interests with their free hand  thats called communism ya dingus
  that is one happy doggo good work with the refurbish
  thanks m8 took her out fishing last weekend and she handled like a dream
anyone got experience with farymann diesels or small diesels in general i have a problem where when i turn off mine after running say for 20 minutes it becomes a bitch to handcrank so i am wondering is it a problem or is it natural 
cant believe this thread still lives op here loving it
anyone have an interest in the jester challenge  its the sort of project i really fancy getting into
  jester challenge is the real spirit of sailing wish i could do it one day
i kinda want to buy an old scalloping boat or something and refurbish it to make it a nice house boat
  what kind of varnish do they use on woodenhull boats below the waterline is it uv resistant too my guess is that no matter what you use you have to refinish it every couple years
  are you talking actual wood hulled boats or fiberglass/wood core boats    with fiberglass/wood core boats you can just use a clear spar varnish over lightly sanded fiberglass and it will give you the appearance of a wood hull without having to deal with waterlogging or other associated problems of wood thats been exposed to water
  i see so essentially theres a layer of transparent fiberglass over wood im youtubing this process now  i wonder if anyones ever tried fiberglassing exterior wood trim on his house
  it would be expensive and time consuming not to mention that the backside would still be uncovered and it couldnt breathe and youd get rot that moves from the inside out
  it would be expensive and time consuming  yeah but if you dont have to refinish it very often then hey it would be funny to try
if its just a plain old fashioned wooden hull you should just paint it with tar
  shipping container boat    the meme has gone too far
  come on at least the crab meat is real
a german student built his own houseboat for 3000  
  buy one on payments and charge people cash bruh
  welp moving to hawaii then i can fuck people over make money and not feel bad because they are a filthy fucking commie    fire up the chopper boys
  yup plastic drums are cheaper tho
  imagination    planets    yup just let me grab uranus and a hammer be right back
  2019 will be the year of flying shipping containers

    how much are you selling it for
my issue with boats can be summed up with this handy mspaint chart you can really only pick two   if you want a cheap seaworthy boat its gonna be some lame ass canoe or 80s fishing boat that totally cant pick up chicks   if you want one thats cool and cheap itll be a money pit  and if you want one thats cool and seaworthy itll cost you an arm and a leg
  damn anon good stuff
  i know it is a stupid question but how do you bend the wood to do that
  make a box or tube that your boards fit into and steam them then you can bend them to shape and as they cool/dry they stiffen up again make sure to clamp them in place while this happens
  building a boat for chicks
  if its thin enough you dont even have to do that just laminate it
is there any way to call a payphone
  depends they used to have their number written on them     see who the ilec is in your area and see what their ani number is like verizon is 9591114
  the one we looked at had what looked like a phone number on it but the second last digit was replaced by an x we tried calling and each time we replaced the x with a different number nothing worked though im also in aus so not sure if that changes how to call them
you wanna play gta
  1800801920 or 12722123 telstra
  what do these do
  what do these do  dont  they make chlorine gas
try a search engine  i found it in like 2 seconds
  can you r call a payphone
go to payphone  call your mobile  look at incoming phone number on mobile    profit
payphone  wut 3rd werld cuntry you skwat in op
  ffs call yourself with it and save the number and delete this thread and yourself faggot
  have it call you then 69
  checked and op is a certified retard  
  i havent seen a pay phone for like 10 years
    they come up as private number retards
a few years ago i found a list with supposedly a bunch of numbers for pay phones in new york city   i called a bunch of them and they were all out of service i like the idea of being able to call a pay phone and have some random person pick it up but i think this ship has long since sailed
  i know all about payphones  being this poor
    there used to be a website called greypages that had every single australian payphone number     when i was in highschool in about 20082009 me and my mates would call all the payphones in our part of tassie it went viral and when nbn came out they switched it off to stop all the pranks  a lot of government buildings and places like banks at the time had phone boxes inside their offices    you could also use it to call inside prisons schools police station etc all offline now though afaik
  there used to be a website that listed payphone numbers in the us and their locations it was great fun to call them and mess with whoever picked up
any of you interested in diy radiation experiments been trying some myself will list specifics if any of you want  pic not mine
  too bad good neutron sources are rather strictly controlled they work very well for heavy metal imaging like engine blocks where conventional xrays struggle to penetrate        imho there is not much you can diy besides imaging
  what you can do is buy some rid1 smoke detectors from russia/ukraine they have about a millicurie of plutonium239 and are pretty cheap im gonna try it myself  already made a neutron gun
  you can diy lymphoma
  i usually joke about doing that  i am trying to build a breeder reactor myself consulting richard handl because he did try it
  designing a geiger counter myself though its more of an electronics project than a radiation project
  pu239 has 50 times longer a halflife than am241 why bother
  no get a job working in nuclear and it will quickly become the most boring tedious and annoying shit in the universe    surrounded by radioactive trash at work  need to dispose of more radioactive trash  see pile of bagged buckets stacked up by a drum possibly containing a source strong enough to cause radiation poisoning   no one knows because no one wants to get near enough to measure it  see one bucket that isnt sealed  duck under the barriers and hazard signs and try to pull the bucket back from the pile without setting off my dosimeter because the powers that be will know if i do and call me in for questioning  gamma meter immediately starts alarming  struggle to pull the lid off the bucket while bent over it  the rad tag on the lid of the bucket says its decently hot enough by itself  sweating bullets and swearing out loud  finally crack the lid open far enough to throw in my trash and shove it back into the pile  look down at my dosimeter didnt register much because i was quick and kept my chest away from the source  breathe a sigh of relief and continue with more bullshit
i have a small company and some of the systems we research falls under highenergy weaponry or directedenergy weapons the em radiation we intentionally create is mostly nonionizing though    as for actual radioactive substances im not a fan even weakly radioactive substances giving off alpha can be extremely /extremely/ harmful if even a small amount enters the body  through the lungs for example make sure you take materialappropriate precautions and then some
  what about a farnsworthhirsch fusor   ive seen people diy it looks cool too  would it be able to expose decent images    id like to image engines without needing to take apart to diagnose internal problems
  op here im also doing a geiger counter though only because i am broke af  gonna use some argon gas and a metal detector gonna be a pretty easy modification since i only have to change the receiver coil    honestly sounds like a dream job    only chose it because it is a millicurie sample and because i can use it as fuel if i ever need a small fission reaction
  farnsworth fusors are okay im planning on one after the breeder use some of my left over equipment
  youre making your own geiger tube neat i just bought an sbm20 from ebay instead oh and i think am241 is fissile
  yeah but i am super broke in hs so i cant afford it for a hobby no matter how fun  am241 is fissile but the critical mass is extremely high though critical can be changed the amount you get from smoke detectors is small the rid1 provides 1000 times as much material enough to get me arrested if i were to buy american smoke detectors
  the rid1 provides 1000 times as much material  oh really ive got one of those am241 buttons lying about for testing my counter no luck yet though
  had to get photoelectric detectors at my parents house so i didnt take them apart got only about 4 but using them as a breeder for an242 as the second stage of my neutron gun
  careful anon  
  david charles hahn october 30 1976 september 27 2016
    top fuckin kek    i wanna make paracord beads    anyone know a permit or something where i can legally have tritium besides on night sights
  no mutherfucker    yall sumbitches not see that retard that built a nuclear reacter
  keychains    
  cinema xenon projector lamps are radioactive
  how do they have some radon in them or perhaps thoriated electrodes
  i think theres thorium in them they write on the box radioactive but dont explain anywhere what that means exactly in a typical cinema staff would throw these lamps down say an elevator shaft and listen for the boom so potentially someone could collect that and melt it down or something its trash to them they dont follow environmental regulations
  anon if you get it to work half assed reliably i can hook you the fuck up mang    not even fucking kidding    we could make some serious cash the chemicals we use in the oildfield make shit irradiated sometimes and all of that pipe and shit we use is a consumable meaning it gets scraped or repurposed a geiger counter is fucking exoensive and unless you have one then its a gamble every 30 mile trip to to scraper    i unloaded an entire pickup bed of pipe and shit and had to pay a kid 20 to scan it all while i found the 1 fuckinging pipe that was so hot we thought the damned trailer frame was radioactive    if you can build a shit geiger that just beeps or flashes when something is hot and do it affordably ill have them sold faster than you can make em if its affordable
  wait is there anything regulated or controlled inside of those things if so never fucking mind i like my asshole unraped
  fuck that would be awesome    head has a crack in it   thatll be 20 please  set uo at roundyround track
  maybe not breaking the law tho lretty sure gun sights or soecial guages and watches are the only legal means to possess it    im honestly not even sure who the fuck to ask to buy a permit if it exists
theres some place in us where you can go to collect uranium ore used for the manhattan project apparently its the highest concentration occurring naturally
  if you just need to know if something is hot or not you dont need a geiger counter buy a scintillator material and watch for lights
  there are better sources than i for diy geiger counters id recommend getting an sbm21 tube 2cm long for about 17 usd on ebay and following one of the various circuit diagrams on google images when you search for diy geiger counter use one of the arduino/mcu ones because an attiny85 is like 1 each make your own pcb and youve got a pretty tiny geiger counter though only for hard beta and gamma for alpha youll need an endwindow geiger tube or a simpler ionisation chamber do it right just a bit of codemonkeying and you could integrate two tubes/counters seamlessly into one device if you can spare the space an sbm20 tube should be more sensitive especially to beta dont solder geiger tubes directly buy fuse clips instead      unsure what you mean by regulated but basically they consist of a highvoltage power supply 300v or so nice fun boostconverter project a large resistor to limit current into the tube and a tap to measure the fluctuating voltage from the tube while blocking dc a lowpass filter  capacitor in series then a bit of fuckery to get that into a nice digital format so basically a comparator wired up as a schmitt trigger that then feeds into your microcontroller or all in all i can see it being done with less than 12 parts on a pcb if you try hard      breaking the law  if its legal to own a smoke alarm its legal to own a glowing keychain thousands of people have bought these things it shouldnt be an issue
i just discovered proportional counters unlike a geiger counter they give an output spike/dip thats proportional to the energy of the particle which could be really useful for figuring out what an isotope is since they have fixed particle energies most importantly they can discriminate between alpha and beta particles which you could use along with the relative particle permeabilities to give a far more indepth picture of the incident radiation than a geiger counter    but finding tubes is looking to be a pain
i am concerned about this thread
i have an old geiger counter got for like 30 bucks its the kind you might see in an 80s movie i just tried the circuit check and nothing might need to change the batteries no reason for anything to be wrong with it but i dont think i want to do any experiments with radiation
  do not attempt to melt radioactive material    college modern physics lab  get a point source forget exact material  measure the number of nutrons flying off by counting detections and using the 5 detection estimate of the tool  get a moderate amount of steady clicking and some nice charts on my labtop  get to do the same thing with with a penny that was placed near a plutonium source also dont remember the  it required about a foot of water on all sides to be safe it was maybe the size of 2 half dollar coins  penny makes that counter sing for a few seconds penny released all captured nutrons or whatever in 15 or so seconds    was a fun class teacher was a russian so being taught nuclear physics in a russian accent was a highlight of my college courses
  i wanted to build an 8bit microcontroller circuit on a pci card that listens to a uranium sample using a geiger tube as noise for random data then send that along to the cpu the problem is there is a lot of material i have to look through to build the circuit safely mount and shield the uranium and get it to properly interface with the computer through the pci interface
  why use uranium instead of americium from a smoke detector you could potentially even use the things ion chamber but i suspect since the chamber is built around the sample youd get far too many counts per unit time such that it would be near impossible to convert them into discrete counts
  please stay away from radioactive materials unless you have the proper training handling tools and dosimetry radiation is a silent killer    t physicist
  not op but thats why im building a geiger counter also a physicist
  also a physicist  i dont believe you
  dont forget your high voltage crowbar    tee
  hiterally  litler
  poor guy had a really shitty downward slide to the end
  what is the taste of the forbidden soda
  david wasnt a retard  actually pretty smart just got the concept of breeder reactor wrong a little bit
  there was one deposite in africa which had enough to fission also had tritium leaked in it to act as a moderator
  you can just walk around and collect pitchblende in some spots in the us its basically useless though because the uranium is only a small part and unenriched uranium puts out tiny amounts of radiation
op here i am thinking of getting multiple sources of thorium to act as a breeder lantern mantels and microwave magnetron thorium    some saying that i should stay away from radiation well i put at least three inches of lead between me and my experiments so    if any of yall are wondering why i would need them plutonium rather than other materials for my breeder reactor a breeder requires fission to produce the adequate amount of neutrons to breed more fuel of course you would need a moderator  just wanted to have an update for yall havent checked this thread for a while
  some nice corium at chernobyl im goin hunting for elephants foot
  not bad not as tingly as people would say of course i am at an early stage in the development  doing my best to address everyone sorry for so many double posts
op update  saw something online saying that some density gauges contain large amounts of cesium radium and/or americium  thinking of getting some
  this would make a great keychain
  richard handl  does experiments in his home  good citizen wants to be sure his work is legal   contacts the radiation police to inquire  gets arrested all his shit taken away   fined 13000 swedebux  because he tried to stay legitimate    sweden yes
  3 out of four charges were dropped the fourth was for having too much material  turns out in sweden you cant have one freaking smoke detectors worth of material  literally they have a legal limit on the amount of radioactive material allowed in a smoke detector one microcurie is above the limit
  what is it
  because he tried to stay legitimate  more like breaks the law and then asks the cops if hes breaking the law thats pretty fucking stupid you check the legality first or keep your mouth shut
  idunfuckinnow
  where could i acquire an rid41
  also before you report me i have a permit
  rid1
  fuck this 50s tech and look up silicon photomultipliers and scintillators
  if you could actually lift it by yourself
  theyre not very good for anything other than photons plus theyre hideously expensive not going to want to detect alpha particles with a scintillator and doing so with a silicon photomultiplier would probably break it
  he means first year open studies into physics desu
  that is to say thats why im only building a geiger counter and not messing about with anything more radioactive than a smoke detector ill use it for paranoid radon sensing uses for continually monitoring background radiation flux as a function of solar time and possibly as a random number generator i understand radiation and thats why im staying away from it for the most part
  where are you check on applicable regulations on radioactive substances generally nrc epa and fda but some cites and states have their own regs mostly governing radiation sources but some control possession of detectors and instrumentation
  but some control possession of detectors and instrumentation  lol wut some terrorist hysteria shit
  1  dying with radioactivity at work be very careful before its too late
  new york city controls the possession of instrumentation capable of detecting nuclear devices they dont want the public to discover the warhead in the basement of the israeli embassy    
  heres my polonium that im using for a cloud chamber hope it doesnt burn out before i build the thing
  polonium  jesus christ
  my si29bg geiger counter and bme280 temperature humidity and pressure sensor all coupled to arduino nano and a 35v liion battery it detects 5070 cpm background radiation   gonna get it calibrated this week cya lads
  whoops attachment   also it was tested against my am241 smoke detector barely moves it to 90 cpm
  northwest arkansas on the edge of the ozarks and oklahoma   basically detectors are not radioactive themselves and would in fact help improve radiation safety in the area  welp just makes it easier for me to basically burn tritium gas and use it as a dirty bomb   cool whats the amount microcuries to millicuries carl willis showed off a 5 millicurie source in a gold matrix that he rented for a year that only cost him about 170 usd  i myself would refrain from buying polonium as i just think that the extremely low half life makes it not that good    i myself have been up to some research and experimentation not too complicated i am trying to build a geiger counter from the gasses inside of a plasma lamp and a metal detector just to see if i can and see how good it would be  also turns out you can buy 4050 millicurie americium sources for density gauges and 8 millicurie cesium sources for another aspect of the same thing
  barely moves it to 90 cpm  thats because youve got a hardbeta/gamma tube not a mica window alpha tube
  whats the amount  can you not fucking read it has the amount printed right on the button
  how do you even have that
  have you been to mtest
  i looked after posting and realized i was a dumbass but no need to be rude  on the internet nobody is usually rude
  rip in peace op
  im still here you overestimated the danger of a few microcuries and soon to be millicuries of radiation
  yes i know but am241 decays with gamma emission 2 at 60 kev i was just testing if it actually made a difference from background    how did you acquire this check source  did you buy it yourself or is it just one at your authorized lab 
  at that percentage it could just as easily be the alpha particles bouncing into stuff in the cylinder wall/atmosphere and producing betas or gammas of their own that youre detecting
  what country is this story from
  1st world fanciness just saw off the anodes cathodes and throw them in a garden leaf fire maybe add some coal or something to get higher temp use a leaf blower to add more oxygen this is prolly how a blacksmith would do it
  5g is rolling out soooo yeah youll have put this test to good use
i work at a facility that manufactures radiation measurement instruments for homeland security applications ask me anything
  how many fucking curies is a tritium stick like this    also are there chaeaper manufacturers i bought one from aliexpress it was like 50 
  i dont know although tritium is so weak the beta particles emitted by it probably cant even penetrate the container its in    youd probably need a huge amount of it to be even close to the exempt quantity threshold around 1gbq is the exempt activity threshold according to some random thing i looked up    what do you want to do with this tritium anyway
  what do you want to do with this tritium anyway  an atomic bios battery
  just dont break the vials and youll be fine if you think theres a risk of them breaking wear a mask
  i want to write on the battery box how many curiesie  002 ci so if someone by any chance comes across it in the future they dont call some government agency just to find out its not worth bothering with i bet if they phone up some agency and give the number in curries they guy on the phone will say thats too low to be worth bothering with throw it out with normal trash the dumb public is radiophobic
  the general public has no fucking idea what curies are better off just write radioactivity within safe bounds fragile do not break glass etc on it if you call the nrc about tritium theyll probs not give more than two fucks about it
  i see news articles all the time about how you should throw out your ionization type smoke detectors because they will kill you or people thinking that anything having to do with radiation is automatically you building a nuclear or dirty bomb which is completely impossible btw    what price do you usually sell them for and what is the difference between that and the manufacturing price  also what types of radiation do they usually detect and maybe how as if it were not a geiger counter it would be cool to know    what are you talking about sorry i may know how to transmute isotopes but what exactly is 5g and why do you assume this is a test
  i would write you would need thousands of these to give you a small burn radioactive materials inside
  cont  even though it is a weakly radioactive sample always keep alara as low as reasonably achievable in mind it is still radioactive if only mildly we handle many sealed samples with activity less than 01 microcuries but we still treat them with respect we keep them far from us and we wash our hands after handling the samples even though they are perfectly harmless
  we make geiger counters scintillation counters both in portable and stationary type decontamination tents gas masks and we do contracted surveys
  also im on my way home ill be back in a few hours and phone internet is poor
  thanks for responding  on phone aswell  for when you do get home how do you think the counters would react at 12 millicurie plutonium sources
  cont  pic related
  so this is accurate
  where is your gravity gun
  im this guy      forgot to add that i dont know the prices of our equipment since its not commercial equipment it is mostly contract work      honestly i have no idea we never got our hands on plutonium and our division doesnt work with high activity materials we did test our scintillators with ambe and pube neutron sources however and the results were interesting to say the least      what this dude says radioactive materials are not toys you dont have to fear them but respect them at all times and always keep the alara principle in mind
op just went to an antique store got a pre1930s radium clock
  neutron sources  that sounds quite incredible id like to know if scintillators are even sensitive to those
  that sounds quite incredible id like to know if scintillators are even sensitive to those    i just read an einstein biography and another book about the development of the first atomic bomb    so this was in the 30s for the most part whenever someone would publish a paper about a new development all these physicists would run into their labs and somehow duplicate the effect fucking amazing they could somehow look at their oscilloscope and tell electrons from neutrons and whatnot     and the part that i cannot comprehend is that immediately many of them realized that you could probably build a bomb 1000x the current bomb tech
  immediately many of them realized that you could probably build a bomb 1000x the current bomb tech    after fission was shown
  united nuclear sells them but the cheaper ones arent good for calibrating anything
  he died from combining fentanyl and alcohol
  bet he would be proud of me  pic related is some of my radium for my soon to be neutron gun
  neutron gun  youre nuts
  already got one just that it is not powerful at all and i am waiting for it to breed some americium242 from 241  right now as i do not have any thorium or uranium to aim it at i have a cap on it  i contain it in a flashlight that i have lined with old school drawing lead
  also gotta learn from the only living master of the art so i have been emailing richard handl who has attempted a reactor and the op pic was his  i am just glad of my radium in solid chunks
  i know my stuff is very sexy indeed but only cia niggers go on 4chan
  scintillation counters are the most versatile detectors their response is dependent on the crystal material naitl the most common crystal type responds to gamma rays only
ops neutron gun not yet lead lined
  aaaaaaand under a uv light
  what in there is fluorescing
  under uv light radium is fluorescent but also in the dark
  radium is fluorescent  i didnt know that i suppose it fluoresces under its own emissions and thats what made it desirable for clock hands no
  the radiums radiation hits some phosphor in the paint mix causing it to glow  you can also just cause the radium paint to glow by putting it under ultraviolet
  oh its mixed with a phosphor
  yes though the radioactive decay makes it work without any input energy  thats how tritium glow in the darks work the gas is in a phosphor capsule
  i wonder if it would be viable to make a phosphor that is itself radioactive by beta decay such as willemite with si32 instead of si28 halflife of 153 years of course youd want to pick an element that is commonly produced from commercial nuclear processes like selenium or cobalt    
  i honestly am no nuclear physicist or chemist but if it can be applied as a paint unlike the modern ones that use tritium then i am all for it    best thing to do is aim a neutron gun at some match heads
  well i was thinking more to aim it at a cfl bulb or crt screen but good enough i wonder if the neutrons would trigger fluorescence themselves
  not really as i understand it  the phosphor works i think because of either beta particles gamma rays or the most likely one alpha particles
  anyways i am going to be spending a little time looking for a guys contact information they have an account on amino but that is all i know    they made a neutron gun of americium radium aluminum and beryllium  what i am hoping to do is eventually get us a whole connected community of home nuclear hobbyists  there are quite a few of us out there the fact is that is known that the first was able to all by himself endanger the lives of over 40000 detroit residents
  betas work pretty well as evidenced by the use of an electron gun within a crt screen      endanger the lives of over 40000 detroit residents  so nothing changed ill likely not be able to join in at all since im in a nuclearfree country and ill not poke at the laws while im in my right mind but if i end up working in a physics lab then i might contribute from there how are you thinking of setting up such a community some sort of wiki or perhaps an sql server
  i do not know just came to my mind as i have literally just stumbled upon a couple scattered hobbyists    the 40000 part is a proven fbi report on david hahn the report was made after they suspected him of building a second reactor the number is about the first though from some information i have gathered i can almost confirm that david did build a second    the reason i put the number there is because that is how powerful we can get our efforts are unparalleled    you can still join in as long as you have an interest if your country still allows any radioactive materials they probably do for civilian purposes if they want to have working smoke detectors
  or you could just make a fusor also what country is it that you are from
  that is how powerful we can get  our efforts are unparalleled  thats not something to be proud of    personally im interested in setting up standardised geiger counters 35 each about the globe to monitor stellar background radiation which will also be useful for monitoring the progress of fallout in the case of a disaster    im from new zealand one of a small fraction of countries that can actually afford to be antinuclear since weve enough hydroelectric to refrain from burning coal but for anyone else nuclear power should be prioritised instead of carbonbased fuels    fusor sounds like a nice project since im rather partisan towards highvoltage power supplies
  yeah though i do think that having the ability to make a neutron source/breeder reactor that radioactive is quite something to be proud of    on another note a geiger counter for 35 has got to be one of the cheapest ones on the market i would buy that as i currently have no counter and need one to measure my neutron guns power
i tried to order radioactive cocaine from a lab company once
  just smoke some burning tritium man
  the sbm20 tube goes for 10 gbp 13 usd and the peripheral circuitry could consist of a handful of smt passives and ics and such mcu included for no more than 5 alltogether a display for 5 inductor and switching fet for 3 and a pcb for maybe 8 so id say 35 is a pretty good estimate pcb cost would go down if you massproduced them but shipping them to all the right places might wind up to be more expensive if the chinks catch wind of this the things would wind up on ali for 25 with no way to undercut them which would be fine by me there are barebones models currently on ali and ebay for 70 usd but theyre all tht not smt so you could almost certainly cut down costs with a smaller pcb and cheaper ics
  drop some in a random ersoms tea
hi very new to home improvement so please forgive me if what i am asking is obvious recently decided i wanted to hard wire a ceiling lamp in my room however ive noticed that most of the diy instructional videos show junction boxes or brackets already installed where the light fixture were to be installed or they just created a hole for the junction box    my ceiling however only has a small hole with the wiring sticking out no junction box i was wondering how i should go about installing a light fixture in my situation thank you
they sell these at most hardware stores they insert into a hole in the ceiling then expand to attach to nearby joists easy to use but make sure you have a rough idea of where the joists are before you cut the hole because they only expand so far
  thanks anon how would i be able to tell where the joists are when installing that
  id go into the attic and see what the heck is up with those wires you may only have to cut a small hole in the ceiling big enough for a box to fit through and it matters if youre wanting to put in a ceiling fan or just a small light fixture as to what kind of box you can use
  i wont be installing a ceiling fan or anything just a lamp that weighs about 7 lbs
  just better off doing it correctly install a box
  just better off doing it correctly install a box    what sort of craptastic house would have just wires i bet if op cuts some sheetrock out he will find a box
  well thats part of doing it correctly inspection of what is there and correcting any potentially dangerous situations and having some standards
  thats why i said see whats up no one said dont install a box like anon said theres a chance theres a box there already if so all he has to do is cut out the opening its probably a clusterfuck ill give you that but until he looks he doesnt know
  best method is to use a magnetic stud finder they are 5 or 6 bucks they find the nails/screws that hold the drywall up which will also be where the studs are    alternately you can go into the attic space and look you can use the wires as a reference point    lastly you can measure starting from the wall the studs are probably on 18 intervals but you can verify that just by poking your head into the attic with a tape measure no need to crawl around up there this way youll need to know what direction they are running this is the least accurate but should be good enough for this task
op here i managed to locate the joists got myself a ceiling box/kit like  mentioned cut a hole around the wires and there was no junction box so when installing the bar i discovered that the joists are too far apart and the bar will not reach the joists in full extension and i cannot access the attic    i tried looking for alternatives like the carlon ceiling box but i hear youre supposed to cut the hole a bit smaller so the box can fit snug however it seems the hole ive already cut is exactly 4 inches are there any alternatives or any options i have left
  cheapass homeowners do shit like that all the time op must have bought from one of those
  the us standard is 16 stud spacing not 18
  it sounds like the trusses for the roof are 24 spacing  typical in my previous houses can you exchange the ceiling bracket in that size  as for having a snug fit  thats the ideal case if you can mount the box securely  like on the side of a truss the excess opening can be packed with insulation or drywall compound
  the studs are probably on 18 intervals    the us standard is 16 stud spacing not 18  correct standard stud spacing is 16  there are no studs in the ceiling  ceiling joists are normally on 24 centers
  most ceiling brackets max out at 24 inches my joists are a bit wider than that could you elaborate on mounting the box on the side of a truss im having a hard time picturing that for some reason
  you need attic access to install those  go get the round carlon box its 45 diameter  if you hole is just 4 youre good to go
  do they even make them in that size all im finding from google is the 4inch diameter
      scroll down and click specifications  45 across  25 deep
  depending on the light it can have enough space inside the light fixture and all he will need is a few toggle bolts and a romex connector its not wrong if the light was designed with this in mind like the like in  pic could easily be installed that way
well in the uk youd just buy a light fitting and put it up make sure you know which wire is your switched live neutral and earth
    if your fixture isnt too heavy then use plasterboard fixings
the fuck is this thread you attach the lamp directly to the ceiling wires hide in lamps base are the ceilings in your stick homes made of cardboard
  what a fucking clusterfuck explain im curious
  explain how thats wired or explain how its fixed to the ceiling
  depends on what the ceilings made out of if its just sheetrock or plaster then its standard to get the fixture box mounted to actual framing
  looks like a jbox and light fixture all in one
  i suppose you could think of it like that yeah  most light fixtures will come with an extra connector block as well for a permanent live loop
  the safety code intends for electrical connections to be in a secure fixture you dont want the light being held only by screws into gypsum board to protect the electrical connection
  odd coming from a country that doesnt even require sleeving on the earth wire
  doesnt even require sleeving on the earth wire    why would that ever be an issue do you sleeve every metallic part in your country
  if its designed to be installed without a box it would have a wire clamp otherwise youre doing it wrong another clue to box required is 350 spaced screw mounts
  and the idea is to ground anything metal it touches
  the purpose is not to cover it up its for identification so you know its supposed to be grounded
  nice bait 8/10
  how is green or whatever color a better indication that its a ground wire than having it bare do you understand the point of the ground wire do you realize that its always connected to the frame or some other bare metal     if you think having a bare ground wire is a bad code choice then i dont think you truly understand why its there in the first place
    maybe its bait but i actually think hes clueless     and then maybe hes doing the im totally retarded troll i do that from time to time    anybody remember the farkels what are you young or something
  remember the farkels    thats some old shit grandpa
  why would you want to do that
  just curious is uk electricity 220 volt 2 hot no neutral
  is uk electricity 220 volt 2 hot no neutral  im not in the uk but i think its 220v with one hot and one neutral and an earth  so the hot wire is 220v relative to ground/earth/neutral
  youll have to run new wire all of those are neutrals
  if you feel like a project and dont mind moving the light you can cut a new hole next to a stud attach your box and just run the wires through there    just because they are white does not mean it is neutral  i am assuming whoever did the original work is a fucking retard snd didnt have any foresight  as is typical with boomers they are too smart to have to follow any logic sense or really have any critical thinking ability period  the idiot probably took the casing off the wires and just ran the individual wires from the switch because they are too retarded to know how to do it right  that being said you shouldnt have to run new wire you just have to find out which ones are which  also next time you do something like this mark your wires so you know which are which
  close its 230 / 6  used to be 10))) but harmonised with europe which used to be 220 and uk used to be 240 and because 240 is 2306 you will find its probably closer to 240 because why change it  neutral is bond to earth at the cutout earth is what uk calls ground cutout is where the big main fuse is and the service cable turns into tails for the meter  and of course 50hz not 60
    why dont you read the fucking manual before you start talking about shit you dont understand dickhead take it up with the bsi if you dont like it      dont screw fittings into plasterboard find a joist or noggin ffs
  youre right i shouldnt have been so quick to judge them based on their color theyre all the same on the inside
  op are you aware your ceiling is asbestos
  theyre all the same on the inside  even the black ones
  take a small 2x4 and attach it to the side of the framing to reduce the gap still too small put 2x4 on both sides then mount the arms to your new and reduced gap
how would you do it help me think of some kind of a contraption for this job
  be sure to at least smile for the camera
  use a key
  always think twice before mailing that threat
  heat it until it smolders and combusts then collect the smoke and reconstitute the data
  just piss in it nobody wants that
  tape
pick 3 tumbler lock with a paper clip  save paper clip to escape hand cuffs
    op if you actually want to do this then jury rig up a 1000 amp power cable and connect each end to both sides of the box within five minutes everything inside will be cooked but the box will probably make it through unscathed this can be done using rented arc welding equipment and a generator or power outlet this technique is also capable of breaking locks deforming metal doors and fucking up cars be sure to wear ppe
that box is thin the lock cheap  use two of your finger nail files to pry in door groove as you slide your useless man card in the crack to flip the latch try not to break a nail
pick the lock fag get a piece of spring steal and file two humps into it and cut a piece off and bend it 90 degrees    i did that today at work to get into a lock when one of my picks broke
op here thank you all for your suggestions is it illegal to pick the lock of a mailbox that belongs to the apartment that i live in and that has my mail in it like isnt it the post offices property or smth
  its a federal crime
my belt is squealing when i spray it with belt conditioner the noise will instantly stop but then the noise starts again after a very short amount of time visually the belt is in great shape is there anything else to try before replacing the belt i dont think i can tighten it as the car has an auto tension pulley
  replace the tensioner
  do the tensioners fail regularly any insight on how complicated of a job it is
  1 maybe  2 no
    that depends on what engine in what vessle youre talking about
  you could sand the tensioner all the pully wheels actually they get polished and glazed
  you could sand the tensioner all the pully wheels actually they get polished and glazed    dont forget to put sand in the intake to polish those valves
  this is why people make mechanic stethoscopes something is about to fail and it probably isnt your tensioner it could be your power steering pump it could be your alternator no way to tell without knowing which pulley is squealing ive used dowels ive used tubes doesnt matter just find something that you wont let get sucked into the belt or fan you can even buy a professional mechanic stethoscope if youre a dr moneybags with a too much money problem    once you find out whats squeaking youll still need to take off the serpentine belt if you dont need any tools to pull your belt off change your tensioner you should need some leverage to take that belt off youll also want to grow about five extra hands to keep the belt in the right path while putting the belt back on i find a wire coat hanger can be bent into an extra set of hands
  visually the belt is in great shape  you cant go by how good the belt looks modern belts wear like tires unlike the old ones where cracks will form  the local auto shop should have plastic belt gauges for free or just replace the belt if its old anyway
  dr moneybags  15 tool on amazon
  probably the belt if it goes quiet with water    also dont get dayton or gates belts they can squeak within weeks go for continental belts the cont belts run quieter and are more forgiving if there are slight alignment issues with your pulleys
  the cont belts run quieter and are more forgiving    2 has been deposited into your account
  replace your belt first and see if that fixes the problem since belts are cheap if its still squealing then replace the tensioner really simple fix either way
  i had a similar problem once i just couldnt get it to shut up for more than a day or so no matter how much i sprayed it    it turned out that i had misidentified which belt was actually squeeling there were a couple of belts close together and i thought i knew which one it was but it just turned out to be a different belt that was close by     once i sprayed the belt conditioner on the right pulley all of my problems were solved
  remember the idler roller bearing can shit the bed too if your vehicle has an idler its common to buy kits with belt tensioner and idler roller which is what i use on my personal vehicles so i dont have to do the job twice either a seized idler or seized tensioner pulley can smoke a belt in seconds most of them are easy to change
  run the car and watch the tensioner if it moves a lot it might be bad hard to tell if you havent seen a lot   remove the belt spin each pulley one at a time they should be dam near silent if not replace the parts making noise could just be pulleys might be the alternator new belt shouldnt be too expensive match it up next to the old one before putting it on if the old one is slightly longer it stretched out youll need the new one if not and youve already replaced some squeaky pulleys or whatever fuck it try the old one and if its quiet return new or keep it for when you need it later    pretty basic job youtube should be able to get you through it
    correction some accessories might make noise that is normal youre lookin for a squeaky type noise or like a bad bearing dont go replacing power steering pump because it makes a pumping noise thats normal
   belt conditioner    thats why its squeaking you mongrel   clean all the pulleys with rubbing alcohol and replace the belt because you done fucked up
  do this    then do this before you put the belt on
  thats why its squeaking you mongrel     citation needed        dayco agrees with you and says that the change came when belt manufacturers switched from neoprene to epdm     so i have to dig now and find out if they switched to edpm for vee belts too like i have on my old trucks and which seem to like belt conditioner and never squeal anyway
  vee belts    so are vbelts neoprene or epdm     gates    gates is the first manufacturer to implement epdm technology in the design of industrial vbelts        but dayco still says this     three plies of neoprene impregnated fabric resist heat oil and grease        hmm
wood stove kit for 55 gallon drum has anybody used one if these kits also how long does the drum last
runofthemill steel barrel a few weeks of heavy or hot use theres a reason wood stoves are heavy as hell    may be a thicker gauge steel would be ok but i wouldnt bother with anything that i could lift by myself
  it clearly says cast iron
    look at it its a barrel text can deceive
  had one for 5 years works great  keepa bed ashes in bottom so it dont burn out
  in the army we used basically steel barrels to warm up our tents they were fine at least for the year i spent there
  thats just the door a lot of those kits actually dont even include the barrel     as long as the fire wasnt directly on the bottom of the barrel it may last a bit but really just go buy a cheap old wood stove online they are like a dime a dozen
  thats just the door a lot of those kits actually dont even include the barrel  you dont know shit  it includes the door feet and flu attachment none include a barrel fuck off
  my googfu is shit today they make an add on kit pretty much just throw another drum on top run pipes through it like pic related and out the exhaust from the top opposite from the intake from the bottom drum throw a box fan behind it    shitpost from a fucking tarp room in a blizzard naked
  kek damned sure keep hedge out of it
  craigslist and a couole buddys because     muh back
  ahahaha    rekt    like they said ashes a big cast grate is nice or a few pips or window weights keep the wood off the bottom so it can suck air under the fire if the kit comes with it throw it in the trash
  dont use a grate makes the wood burn too fast  once you establish a bed of coals youre good
  oh and kits dont come with a grate fuck off already you have no idea what youre talking about
you should look into rocket stoves instead of just normal stove much more efficient
hi /diy/ never been on this board just need some input and pointers on the plausibility of this plan and what steps i should take  ive always had a dream of essentially dropping out of society for the simple life not quite amish but definitely more self sufficient  i want to have my own off grid homestead grow my own food have some chickens and goats maybe a dairy cow im going to school for at the very least my masters maybe phd too in other words im planning on being in debt for a while  so ive been weighing my options what i could do to make my dreams more realistic for today and ive seen a lot of videos about people constructing tiny homes on wheels like full houses all the amenities of a normal house maybe with a composting toilet instead of a normal one and moving to their desired state with them this allows them to construct them at their own pace as they can afford it a lot even use cheap/free recycled parts  i just dont want to get out of college to bury myself in more debt to buy a house   if i take say maybe a year year and a half to save money to start this project do you think itd be enough time for somebody with relatively no experience to really study enough to get something like this done not like id immediately be diving in head first id be taking time to save money and do research
  youll need at least four years of practice and training some strong friends who can help you and a licensed architect/structural engineer before you can even think about putting together a tiny house dont forget land as well and all the zoning permits variances and all that youll need good luck
  do you think itd be more realistic to save towards having a tiny house built on a plot of land for me i mean ill be here for 4 more years the time frame isnt the issue but going to school full time and working just wondering how much time id be able to devote to it
  you want to drop off the grid and live simply but youre in college and expect to go all the way through postgrad  what are you studying and does it explain your desire to combine two largely incompatible goals
  not completely dropping out of society not in post grad yet either id want to live somewhere i can commute to work not a major city or anything  and i plan on keeping it less than an acre so its more manageable
i guess i should state the goal a little more clearly  1 acre or less homestead on a plot of land less than an hour away from a commutable town/city mostly for work  i want to be off grid in the sense that id prefer solar panels purified wellrain water and gardens a few animals i know its a long term goal and i know id have a lot to learn just wasnt sure how doable itd be
a tiny house is a bad house for homesteading your going to need big freezers canning storage and lots of space for meat processing and diy workshop stuff tinyhouse doesnt last either youd be better off with a cheap cmu building that will survive for centuries you really cant do any of this until your out of debt anyway since homesteading brings in almost zero income and is a net drain on savings good news is that if you go mississippi alabama missouri arkansas or any of those other low cost states you can be set for life on as little as 200000 with easily 100 acres i think small acre homesteads are a bad idea just because your constantly exposed to your neighbors and you really dont have to manage a huge acreage if you dont want to so the only advantage is the upfront cost which is already low in the southeast
  i just dont really know how much itd cost to invest in a house big enough for all that and how long itd all take
  look at realty listings for hobby farms near you thats basically the lite version of what you are talking about  20 acres an older house with an outbuilding or two some goats n shit then factor in spending 100 more because you want to cover it in solar panels and dig geothermal wells and fill tires with dirt or whatever it is you kids do thats your budget
  ill look into that shit thank you my dude
  if your fine with ongrid food theres really no point maybe you just want to get out of debt in a cheap suburban apartment off grid anything is a major time sink and i doubt you could maintaim a farm while working commuting full time much less setup a farm while doing that i mean its already extremely hard and your doing yourself no favors with solar solar means no washing machine electric stoves power tools refridgerators so include extra 1700 per year in propane include hours cutting wood or 1000 buying wood per year expensive battery bank diesel emergency generator theres a youtuber couple homesteading in pacific northwest pure living for life is channel name on solar and they got severely fucked by it and went back ongrid
  looks like ive just got a lot of rethinking to do in general
  ive always had a dream of essentially dropping out of society for the simple life not quite amish but definitely more self sufficient  see   basically if you dont have 14 million then youre just larping and have paid a lot of money for a different view out of your window    in other words im planning on being in debt for a while  if youre getting a masters and phd youre already a failure unless of course its in a saturated meme field like chemistry or math
  those modern conveniences were invented for a reason    homesteading was a shitload of work even when the land was being given away and you could force your wife and four kids to do the drudgery
i live off the grid as much as i want to i dont want to pay hotels 100 a night so i just live out of my car 3 days a week because my job is 2 hours from my house only sticking point was showers but found out that the trucker station has 5 showers so thats how i do that i know someone who literally sold their house with dreams of living in an rv wife was gung ho for it too within 6 months they were divorced and he was living with one of my friends 46 year old with 3 kids the first month they were plastering fb with pictures everywhere of their journey people fall for the dumbest shit watching that tiny house tv show
  i keep thinking unibomber with this one
    i live in a house 100 solar with a well for cooking and hot water i still need gas but i can only tell you this things for 12 people that knows hot to economize energy    at least 15 kw in batteries  at least 2000 kw in solar cells  fireplace with hot air distribution fot heating  keep your buring wood dry start thinking about that in summer not on late october  all appliances a    and last but nearly most important thermal isolation thermal isolation and also thermal isolation
    ease your way in its way more difficult than you realize money work expertise buy some land build a house and reduce your dependence on the outside world one step at a time     also tiny house  trailer when you scrape off the smug layer of limousine liberal elitism if thats cool with you then great for many its a revelation and also reveals classism they could have sworn they dont have
building a tiny house is fuucking retarded its basically a diy trailer   just spend 1/2 the money and buy a trailer much less if its used you can even get them free off of craigslist if you want to fix it up  then you can add the panels/water sewer hookups as you get a well dug and dig out a hole for the septic system
  tiny house  you mean a trailer   composting toilet  you mean a bucket with some hay in it that you paid 1500 for  dont act like its anything its not you people make me fucking sick
    composting toilet    true is a bad idea if you can use an excavator dig and build a nice and oversized 3 compartment septic tank and forget about where it goes your poo forever    just be careful about what you throw there just biologic material and toilet paper and if you use a water bidet better no toilet paper
composting toilet    do a bit of research on biogas methane generator basically all black/grey water and farm wastes go into it and microbes turn it into biogas methane and high nitrogen fertilizer the systems are super easy to design the hard part maybe storing the methane safely for some people some people use it only for cooking/heating gas while others actually use it for electric generation the gas will need to be filtered to make it less corrosive to the rest of the system and thats probably the biggest headache and resource requiring problem though with a simple system you may not need to filter it as most diy ones dont filter
  go for it dude    build your trailer house it can be bigger than your vehicle can pull if you dont plan to move it often even if all you do is sell it later you learn a lot you can add a porch later when it is in place    regular mobile home trailers are an option but the cheaper they are the nastier they tend to be installing them is getting more expensive as well depending on local regulations    regulations on structures on wheels are much less regulated if there is a problem just move it    lease or buy some land    growing all of your food is a major pita have a garden and some rabbits and maybe chickens i hate dealing with chickens    get the rest from the store    do this in the south where winter is milder longer growing season the south also has more woods that are close to cities than many places    put in a diy septic tank hire a dude with a backhoe to dig the hole or build some muscle by diy if it is one person a classic outhouse is easier to start with they can be built to be sanitary you might get away with buckets of kitty litter    run electricity if practical you can limp a fridge along without running it 24/7 but it is not wonderful  propane fridges are great but expensive maybe worth it    solar is expensive if you want it to power a lot of stuff    if you can get enough land to hunt on let dudes go hunting in exchange for cash or venison a cabin could eventually pay for itself if hunters are involved    you can pay for food and electric and still get ahead by living in this lifestyle  ps cute pic nice set up and the pallets made me laugh
cont    live somewhere warm very important to cut costs    the best part of all of this is building real equity by owning land even if it is lousy for 5 years you can save a ton of bucks    if you have to commute a long way to work skip the garden and be a vandweller 4 nights a week in a buddys driveway and pay them for a powercord to the vehicle   might be worth it if you can get more land for less    2 years of saving and research and willingness to bust ass for another 3 to get ahead in this crappy world can be successful go for it
  maybe a dairy cow  if you buy one cow for milk youre going to be disappointed i think
    propane fridges    i have one well i had one now i dont use it the thing is that they are good if you dont have enough electrical power to use an a normal fridge     the problem is that although usually can work with electricity too they consume watts like a motherfucker    use one only if you dont plan to go full electrical in 2  3 years
my grandpa has gifted me his old hunting cabin it was built in the 40s and has no insulation at all the exterior siding is vertical tongue and groove the walls are just studs no drywall or interior covering picture semirelated from google    back in the 90s my uncle tried to insulate it with fiberglass bats and drywall after a few years the insulation got moldy and was ripped out i was told this was because there was no barrier or air gap between the exterior siding and the insulation the building is weather tight and has no leaks how can i insulate the place on the cheap and not end up with the same problem was that really the problem
shipping containers
  the cabin is square it is both too wide it fit inside of a shipping container and too short for one to fit inside of it thank you for the suggestion though
fill the wall cavities with imitation crab meat it doesnt mold
  lay a plastic vapor barrier over the studs keep it tightly contoured with staples
  sadly it is illegal in my country so the cost is outside of my budget      when the previous insulation got mold it moldered on the side facing the exterior siding not the interior of the building are you saying i should install the vapor barrier between the siding the insulation the cabin generally would spend no more than 6 months out of the year with anyone in it and would often go a few years between uses would that have anything to do with it
  are you saying i should install the vapor barrier between the siding the insulation  this is how its installed its not rocket appliances
  imitation crab meat is illegal here    you know hes talking about owen cornings pink fiberglass insulation   the owen cornings pink fiberglass insulation should be good enough if you do it correctly it has its own moisture barrier for the interior which helps immensely with a draft but honestly you should put some tar paper or permeable building wrap under the siding on the exterior because the owen cornings pink fiberglass insulation on its own can only do so much     owen cornings pink fiberglass insulation
  i dont want to pull the siding off the building though 
  and honestly id go with the more expensive r38 or some thick shit because honestly its a small shed
  you can pull it off and put up smartboard or whatever the hell in like a few hours anon siding is easy   you can either tear off the siding and put on building wrap or you can have a cold shed
  you dont pull it off my god on the interior you apply it to the bare wall youll just have to contour it around the studs typically it would go outside between the sheathing and siding but you dont have sheathing just siding from what i understand
   if you dont know what the hell youre talking about then dont mislead some anon   that is how houses get idiot mold     interior moisture barrier and exterior moisture barrier are two different things   the interior moisture barrier goes on over the insulation and under the drywall most insulation for walls comes with it exterior moisture barrier which is what keeps a draft from coming in and causing condensation that thereby causes mold goes between the siding and sheathing
  ah i got you      i doubt the walls are deep enough for insulation that high of value but i will look into it
  probably not   honestly r19 should be good i was just getting jethro because its 20 degrees and all i have in my house right now is a space heater im fucking cold
  not true depends on your climate i think in cold climates the vapor barrier is installed on the interior wall and in warm climates its installed on the exterior
  i think  there you go again you should do more studying instead of guessing     yall are pissing me off   in cold places there is two vapor barriers jesus christ
  hurkadurka onry pretending  
  thats why i said asphalt tar paper    in cold climates you ad tar paper to reduce draft it is extremely more permeable than plastic   plastic goes on the inside   swing a hammer then come back to me
  in cold places there is two vapor barriers  thanks for confirming that the exterior vapor barrier tar paper isnt really a vapor barrier but a permeable rain guard good to know that you were only pretending to be retarded back there
  the building is weather tight and has no leaks    then how did the previous insulation mold     it may not leak water but humid air condensating is still a factor
  thats generally a tyvek wrap you fucktard
  only  its referred to as a vapor barrier because it is it acts differently than a plastic barrier which has different applications than tar paper   in my area we use tar paper on the exterior unless its cheap shit corporate office or some shit that no one gives a fuck about because its easier to use tyvek the fact of the matter is that he doesnt have any vapor barrier ie tar paper under the siding and the siding is directly on the sheathing allowing condensation to seep into the inside of the wall when its colder outside than inside instead of being wicked away by tar paper because the sun is warming the building before the rest of the air outside    condensation is the usual cause of mold on wallsagain  it remains warmer in the building than it does outside because of the insulation it gets wet on the surface of the cool wall it molds when you have felt paper it wicks it off of the wood and into the air   because its unattended for months at a time i assume it wont be climate controlled this is a contraindication for an interior moisture barrier because the air wont be warm inside to cause condensation inside the wall the entire reason you put up plastic inside is to prevent mold on inside of the wall if the air is warmer inside for a long period of time
  rationalize all you want my point remains also everyone knows most common cause of mold is a leak do you even into homebuilding
  not if every piece of insulation has mold on the exterior facing side
  im assuming it was condensation build up      so can i just put tar paper inside the cavity between the studs up against the tongue and groove siding then put some fiberglass bats against that or is there something else i need to worry about
  anyone who uses the term gifted like that instead of just saying my grandpa gave me deserves all the cringey fucking mold he gets how about you google insulating a shed and try that out first
      ive got a house in ga with brick on the outside that was built without any insulation in the 2x4 walls i have been considering just packing rockwool insulation in the wall cavities whenever i get around to it and not adding any vapor barrier it gets hot and humid in summer and below freezing in winter i figured this would be the simplest and least dangerous solution to the structure the rock wool seems to be much more stable than fiberglass batts and holds up against incidental wetness so i have heard     why would this not work well in ops case
  jesus no anon     you need the tar paper between the sheathing and the siding tar paper goes outside between the siding and the exterior side of the building   siding  tar paper  sheathing  studs
  that should work fine since you have bricks
  not if every piece of insulation has mold on the exterior facing side  if its on the exterior what does it matter      yeah it shouldnt matter i live in a block house in pa and my interior stud walls are insulated with unfaced insulation and i never had a problem op probably has a leak or two somewhere in the roof or a dripedge problem
  he may not be a native english speaker some languages have multiple words for giving people things eg german has geben and schenken
  siding  tar paper  sheathing  studs  the cabin is not built like that it is siding  studs that is why i am here asking how to retrofit this on the cheap im not going to pull the siding off and i just wanted to know if there was another way to get it done      how about you google insulating a shed and try that out first  ive read an article that said i could try putting some strips of wood running vertically between the studs to provide an air gap and then use rigid insulation over that but that stuff is expensive i couldnt find anything else i wanted to know if there was another option or if i could make straight fiberglass batts work
    tar paper  sheathing  studs  the cabin is not built like that it is siding  studs that is why i am here asking how to retrofit this on the cheap  a run down old house i bought is like this so anyone reading this feel free to offer a range of suggestions
    i assume most people here know about this guy
  those tongue and groove joints are imperfect so im assuming you wouldnt need an outer wrap and the interior one alone would work perfectly any water behind it would have an escape
  spray foam a nice even layer over the inside walls and studs with pic related if that isnt enough to keep some heat in then insulate with fiberglass on your brand new waterimpenetrable layer of foam
  the rvalue of the insulation is not dependent on the thickness of it the rvalue of the wall is
  dont do this perfect way to get mold on both sides of the wall the solution you found yourself with hard insulation is probably the best when the house isnt in use make sure it can ventilate so you dont get moisture build up over the winter
when keeping it cheap goes wrong the thread    either do it right or dont do it at allcutting corners is why it failed the first time    sub freezing temps is not the indicator to start thinking about insulationplan ahead for these kinds of projects    do not run a space heater inside as the sole means of heating a buildingsomeone in the area just died after a fire caused by that exact scenario
  the vapor barrier prevents the humid air from penetrating the wall cavity  is moist air does  no vapor barrier  it will cling to the inside of the cold exterior sheeting and freeze then thow and run down to the sill plate
put a wood stove in the bitch and crank it up like they did before they had insulation
vapor barrier wood fiber insulation more expensive than glass wool but way more insulating plus its quite easy to work with and non toxic
tyvek over the old siding then install 4x8 smart siding insulate drywall fuck off
  you should be able to just put vapor barrier over the old siding and put new siding on top of it if its flat enough doesnt have to be perfect
  basically this tyvek or tar paper   id go with tar paper since its not climate controlled most of the year tyvek tends to degrade with temp extremes and moisture it works best for dryer climates
  he doesnt use zip system sheathing and tape  the current year is 2018
  tyvek tends to degrade with temp extremes and moisture  bullshit
  consider using roofmate panels  i dont know what do you call those in your country but those are special styrofoam/polystyrene you can cut with a regular cardboard cutter/knife then tighty fit into existing walls    i did the whole insulation of a small cabin in the french alps 3 years ago and its fine  in winter heat gets kept pretty well like im heat the whole cabin with a small woodstove for a night then i come back in ther evening temp is still comfy like a 1819cish    bonus points  its cheap as fuck i dont how big is your cabin but i doubt you would have to pay more than 20/ to get the whole thing insulated
  roofmate isover de saint gobain   il faut quand même 120mm dépaisseur pour être en bbc 2012
  look it up senpai
  i am not sure but i bet you 100 that you can even buy this as a spray able thing
  siding  tar paper  sheathing  studs    i have a similar issue i have an old detached garage i use as a workshop no insulation it is siding  tar paper  studs it uses diagnol bracing so no sheathing was used can i install fiberglass batts in the cavities since it has tar paper up already or do i need to do some funny shit like op to make it work and avoid problems
  and lots of imitation crab meat
  been building houses 30 years armchair fucktard
  bbc 2012  op wants to insulate a fucking hunting cabin definitely not to live in a vegancompliant shed      checkem  1488 dubs never lie
  this is probably the best scenario
  riiight and i repair your mistakes for a living     just saying
  i know what i got no low balling 150000 for my rusted out old camero take it or leave it
  what shithole are you from
  bob dole
  what about closed cellinsulation it doesnt require a moisture barrier
  build a cuck shed over your cuck shed
    air gap  what is the purpose of this air gap
  you want it done right  take a week off bring a couple of workers to help   remove tongue and groove siding   add sheathing   add tyvek wrap vapor barrier   rehang old tongue and groove siding if you like  or   add new siding   add interior insulation   add drywall   paint
just paint truck bedliner all the inside then staple plastic tarp to the frame then spray shredded newsprint insulation inside that bam 50 and youre golden youre welcome scrub
  just leave it as is  6 months a year its mostly pointless especially if you winterize fixtures properly
  add drywall    then op needs to keep it climate controlled otherwise it will decay over winter
  no insulation  the building was designed to not be insulated your hunting cabin in fact is not weather tight and does have leaks it just doesnt matter because your house is so leaky that the humid air has a way to escape      if you want to properly insulate it youre going to have to tear off the siding this is nonnegotiable you need to be careful about condensation and letting air escape if you dont want the cabin to grow mold
  dont know what his setup is but if its just a cabin with no electric running water septic he can use other materials like wood paneling if he wants to keep the rustic look  my cabin has all the amenities i dont have time for the roughing it shit
  breathing for the wood since it absorbs moisture if it was right up against anything like a vapor barrier it could not let go of its moisture and rot but it could be fine also
  insulation works by making little air pockets if you get super thick insulation and compress it to fit in the walls it dont do jack shit
  i second this actually drywall and mold go together like flies on shit   get some treated osb and put it over the insulation
  i apologize for this post as i was intoxicated and cold   but some r19 wouldnt hurt
  as far as a house goes youre going to want to take off the old siding and cover it with building wrap or tar paper depending on your climate or be cold in the winter hot in the summer and feel wind all the time   its not a good feeling feeling the wind when youre on the couch and the condensation makes painting the drywall difficult either get some lead based paint from a chinese toy company or building wrap and manual labor from home depot and your friend who will work for 20 and a few beers
  this is untrue from the outside in it should go siding  sheathing  insulation in between studs  vapor barrier  drywall      outside gets a moisture/air barrier  prevents moisture and air from entering a building but is vapor permeable to allow moisture to escape  inside gets a vapor barrier no passage of moisture or vapor or air      rockwool is an awesome product and would work in your scenario get the highest rvalue that can fit into 2x4 construction remember dont squeeze it into place you want it to just fit nice and snug i believe r15 is the highest rvalue you can get from rockwool in 2x4 batts      get with the times and use rguard by prosoco liquid applied is what all the cool kids are doing      the siding was probably considered both a sheathing/siding material when the garage was built my house was originally built this way consider rockwool batts instead of fiberglass no itch easier to cut and work with its literally rock cotton candy and is fire resistant up to 15002000 degrees mold resistant etc etc you could put batts in the cavities and if you want to get fancy plastic over the studs/insulation make sure your garage has vents in the roof or skip the plastic      good but expensive op asked for inexpensive options
  outside gets a moisture/air barrier  prevents moisture and air from entering a building but is vapor permeable to allow moisture to escape  inside gets a vapor barrier no passage of moisture or vapor or air  ive been reading online that it depends on the climate what youre describing would be for colder and less humid climates the other way is for hotter and more humid climates
  you  this is untrue from the outside in it should go siding  sheathing  insulation in between studs  vapor barrier  drywall      hurr durr im mentally retarded and cant understand the context of ops request and think were building up a fucking house instead of a run down hunting shed that was slapped together out of scrap     neck yourself you fuck
  closed cell is like 400 for a diy pack and its done in a couple hours    pulling off all that siding to install a vapor barrier is going to be a fucking nightmare then having to put it back on and add batts youll be at a similar cost all in
just build some interior siding and stuff sawdust between the walls makes for great insulation
  zoned a residential    if not you can bypass the drywall and just put up cheapo wooden paneling especially if its inna woods and never gonna be seen by any inspector it will be a firetrap yeah just dont set it on fire    i own a similar cabin so far into ontario they can barely tax us
  we didnt have access to sawdust so we used gasoline and oil soaked rags
im sure its been mentioned already op but just go with this its closed cell rigid foam so you wont have to worry about mold
  finally this guy thanks guy
  kekd
  but you know we were happy in those days although we were poor
just       just use roxul by rockwool its an insulation that does not ever mold or retain moisture     
  vapor barrier goes outside of the insulation if you wont take off the siding do like the pic where the gray is plastic sheeting    2 stryrofoam with the edges sealed with latex caulk would also work at about twice the cost
  what an asshole
  fill the wall with perlite add new siding and leave some gap for ventilation    the other option is pic related maybe the best approach and most expensive
  they make rollled insulation covered in plastic its fucking amazing to insulate ceilings with
anyone here have some good sources of ebooks on building guitars  ive been interested in studying it for a while but just never took the plunge ive got a few books on order but i was hoping to find some in depth pdfs/ebooks or even good videos that go into detail not just quick overviews or timelapses
  do you want to assemble a guitar from a kit or start with lumber
  i may consider doing a kit build but ideally for now i plan on studying for a few years before even worrying about cutting any wood   i have plenty of woodworking experience as well as shop machines and tools hand tools sanding staining etc plus im pretty much a life long guitarist   and during this time ill be able to slowly build a catalog of tools/machines    i want this book to start with  isbn 9780387743684
  its not really that hard you dont need years of study just go make one you pussy
  i make electric basses its not that hard ive never read a book about it except for wiring id recommend buying the neck pre made so you dont have to do the truss rod unless for some reason you want to it just easier to not
motorized bike general aaaaaaaaaaaaaah edition    bought bike 2 weeks ago ran good for 3 day then wouldnt fire up now its worked into a pattern fires up runs good for few minutes turn off wont fire set for a few hours fires up runs good for few minutes turn off wont fire repeat has spark when it wont start has compression has fuel wont start tried disconnecting the killswitch same pattern theyre simple engines so its got to be something simple im missing
  the pickup coil is starting to fail
  motorized bike general oh its this piece of shit bike again edition    you bought a pile of garbage this is the first in a long string of problems you are going to have with this bike and it is only going to get worse from here you can either fix this issue and flip the thing to someone slightly dumber than you or you can keep riding this bull until it chucks you off with someone like a cracked piston scored cylinder walls or a nice case of steel cancer    just get a real bike and adapt a chainsaw engine or something like that to power it both can be had on cl for less than a hundred in most places
  wont fire  has spark when it wont start  the spark is frequently called fire so thats kinda confusing    does it have a float bowl if so clean the needle valve and/or replace the fuel filter its not getting gas fast enough and sitting gives it time to trickle fill the float bowl then it runs until the float bowl empties my experience is mostly with riding mowers so this may not apply    had a push mower with similar problems once and it was a sticking intake valve iirc
  needle valve  err float valve
  it seems like its flooding out i pulled the airfliter and it was full of gas       im too deep in the pocket book to turn around now ive never heard spark called fire fire is when the fuel ignites and causes a fire in the cylinder hence the name fire
  sorry i got my replies all m up just got out of bed
  it seems like its flooding out i pulled the airfliter and it was full of gas  if it has a float bowl thats another symptom of a sticking float valve valve sticks open not shutting off the gas once its full pretty common problem when gas isnt drained before storage
i want to put a coat of polyurethane on my wood floor before it gets any more worn out and i found they make special polyurethane for floors  is there really any difference i tried a test patch with some regular oilbased polyurethane i had left over and it looks great so why get anything else
  apparently the regular polyurethane is a lot harder than the floor one which is made to have some flexibility to it
  other way around it literally says right on the can that it contains aluminum oxide which is the same shit sapphire is made of
  solid aluminum oxide is very hard aluminum oxide powder dispersed in a polymer does not affect the polymers bulk hardness though it can increase its wear resistance
i figured floor poly can take more abuse i am about to use floor poly to seal a new bartop your standard lower wall to half height wide wood board as trim open up this pit type of bartop
  what are u talking about nigga the manufacturer literally says this    youve come to the right place rustoleum varathane ultimate polyurethane waterbased is not recommended for application to a floor this product will not remain flexible enough to withstand foot traffic and can delaminate when applied to a floor instead we recommend rustoleum varathane crystal clear floor finish be sure to follow the application directions on the label for best results   rustoleum product support 4
price
  pay good money for nice wood floor  cover it with thick plastic coating  why  oil is all you need to protect wood  and if it gets worn out just sand it down and reoil
floor poly has a higher percentage of resin solids compared to thinner aka it goes on thicker    it may also have hardeners added to it depending on brand
  idiot or trolling
  helpster
  idiot or trolling  no honestly wondering  might as well get laminate or even vinyl flooring in the first place and save a lot of money  if a smooth plastic finish is acceptable to you
  no honestly wondering    you sound more like an idiot if you think putting polyurethane on a hardwood floor is a bad idea and you suggest sanding your floor periodically and reoiling it
  putting polyurethane on a hardwood floor is a bad idea  but it is because it makes your nice hardwood floor feel like cheap plastic    sanding your floor periodically and reoiling it  how else would you fix a worn out/scratched hardwood floor
  no honestly wondering  natural wood and imitation wood laminate do not look the same for those who care and notice the difference its a big difference also its a status thing  anything expensive will attract stupid rich people also laminate echoes while solid wood absorbs sound makes for a comfier room environment imo id rather have rugs because wood is also drafty and cold but i at least get why some people want it    as for why coat it with plastic its literally the only way to make it last and not look like shit wood is an organic material and its semi porous not only does it shift with time it absorbs everything it comes into contact with  especially water a bare wood floor may last a long time but itll be stained and ugly as shit within a year or two also it expands and contracts as the humidity changes because it absorbs moisture right from the air over time this means popped joints raised seams and creaky floors oil does jack shit to prevent that the only way is with a thick hard coating and polyurethane is the hardest nonepoxy coating on the market you could technically do epoxy but theres a lot of reasons not to like cost    oil also impedes refinishing since it makes the wood gummy and clogs up sandpaper it easily takes 5x as long and 5x more abrasive consumed to refinish something thats heavily oiled oil also does nothing to stop moisture changes from humidity its not the occasional spill thats the problem its the expansion and contraction of the wood with the weather cycles that fucks up the entire floor and makes the boards pop out of place oils great for tools or simple stuff but anything with joints will be better off with a coating that actually seals it
  just use the god damn floor polyurethane on your floor dumbass
  funny how this guy is just an ornament in her picture how he tries to guard her by having his arm around her and how she has her hands on his arm as if pulling away showing the audience that shes not really his mate and ready to move on to something better at any time    and this guy obviously has no clue what is going on standing there thinking this picture is about him    man this is a fantastic picture where ever did you get it
  not that anon but floor replacement on hard wood can normally be doneboard by board you by in excess an extra box or two of boards and can replace a board as it wears down there would be no need to replace an entire floor
  what the fuck is with chinese escalators
  finally a good answer
alright my dumb ass just broke this how can i fix it without a soldering iron can i just connect a wire from one side to another and stick it with hot glue    already used krazy glue to stick the piece together    is a n64 power supply
  youll need to bridge the broken tracks use a fine sandpaper to get the green varnish off and expose the copper tracks then use a fine tip soldering iron to brigde ocer the cracks with solder do not hang around on the tracks for too long or the heat will lift them there will be plenty of demo videos on jewtube if you google cracked pcb repair godspeed
  what if i dont have a soldering iron and i need it done asap could i just bridge them with a wire and hot glue
  you cant lrn2solder dont break shit
  just confess to your brother that you broke his nintendo im sure your dad can bring you a new one home from work
  then you are fuckered there m8    they do make conductive pens but those are more expensive than a cheap soldering iron    just dont bake the traces off the board
  just confess to your brother that you broke his nintendo     how the fuck do you do that kind of damage anyway
ive fixed some electronics in a pinch with some solder a gas lighter and a nail and a leatherman    hold the nail in leatherman regular pliers will do too  heat it with lighter until its really hot  drop lighter and put the solder on the place i want to solder  stick the nail on it and melt the solder on to the trace
  ffs no a usable soldering iron is sub20 new  resist the urge to nigger rig this when there are better options available    if op is too much of a dumbass to diy this take it to any electronics repair shop
  well yeah of course a soldering iron would be better but if you really really really need to solder something thats the way i would do it without an iron
  no no a big arse nail will be plenty fine to heat the track and solder that narrow narrow trace without bridging everything especially with the leatherman working as a heat sink on the nail you need to relax anon everything is fine      take it to any electronics repair shop  a hackerspace is fine too
  i tried to open the psu to clean it due a reset problem tue console has but nintendo diphits glued the entire system to the top of the plastic box requiring to pull it hard to get the psu out and ended broken it
  anyway ended buying a new one for a dollar in a flea market
  how can i fix it without a soldering iron  you dont  can i just connect a wire from one side to another and stick it with hot glue  hahaha no even if you could get it to start the contact resistance will fuck your bodge in short order also theres more than one broken track there
    im honestly a little surprised you think gluing a pcb back together will magically reconnect all the broken traces its like gluing back an arm thats been chopped off and expect all the veins and nerves to work
    how cheap do you have to be to prefer using a hot nail instead of a 5 soldering iron
  ghetto style is extremely appealing to some people
  the part thats broken off entirely is supposed to be like that the jack is freefloating so theres no insertion/removal stress on the rest of the pcb the problem is the crack running through the corner where the silkscreen reads q101
  wat  so the thing is still working   this has to be bait
  how would it still be working ground and 12v are broken by that crack
  how do i repair something i broke when i have no knowledge of how to repair anything and no tools oh and i need it done right now and there cant be any risk of me breaking it more    you dont any other questions
  look at the topright corner of the main pcb  also get some glasses
  any other questions  why is life so hard
  the problem is the crack running through the corner where the silkscreen reads q101  nice catch anon
  whats your deal thats the exact spot i described
yes you can fix the traces  just figure out which line connects to which and run a small insulated wire leaving that corner off
  judging by the pic it doesnt look like there are any connections to the board from the break points so you might just hot glue it at the tabs where it is broken need a better pic of the bottom of the broken piece
since there is no qtddtot   i got a ps4 that needed a hdmi replacement so i desolder it and pull it out one of the pads came off as well from what i read its a ground pad so my question is does it really fucking matter can i just solder a wire to it and run it to a different ground or just leave it alone also pic related
couple years ago i found a old dentist kit from the 30s on a yardsale this kit containes a small box of mercury can i do something cool with it mercury is very illegal in my country and almost impossible to obtain what can i do with it
  what can i do with it  not much    mercury switches  mercury fulminate  amateur dentistry
  put it on a block of aluminum about the best you will get out of it    
read the following articles very carefully and consider if you want to risk mercury exposure            then browse these images      yes thats mainly mercury poisoning via organic mercury but i cannot emphazise the immense dangers of mercury and its readily created compounds enough  especially in a laymans hands like ops     do not play with it do not throw it away do not keep it contact your local authorities and have them dispose of it safely    there are many other cool experiments not involving heavy metals
  just adding that you should absolutely not do experiments with it as this will introduce it into the local environment and it will then bioaccumulate  and this is of course much more likely once the mercury has reacted with something else in some cool reaction and formed various mercury salts please dont    kind regards  biotechnologist
yeah id probably do the switch thing
  
make sure when you open it up you do it in a bin inside another larger bin to catch any if it spills   you cant do much with it other than pour it into your hands for the novelty of it   metallic mercury isnt toxic its just mercury salts and mercury vapors that are harmful you must clean up any spills because if it just sits in the floorboards youll get exposed to the vapor over time   the safest way to dispose of mercury is to keep it as a metal so definitely dont try any chemical experiments with it that would create waste   just keep it and appreciate it   pics of the bottle
feed it to crustaceans
  codys lab    mercury vacumn chamber    more vacumn than a car ac vacumn pump can pull    also somehow generates electricity and will shock the fuck out of you best pay attention
    mercury switches    yup 80s cars here had merc switches in the hood raise hood light comes on they dont live long tho 1 backfire with the breather off and it gets cussed and beat at    they do work great for bike alarma tho set it up with a toggle switch and a level put the bike on level ground and level the switch when the bike is tilted up right alarm goes off
  well this also a bro lived by a river and got mercury poisoning from fish its not cool
put a cast iron skillet on the stove high heat  once skillet is red pour mercury in it awespme rainbow reaction as the vapor diffuses any light it encounters like a prism  the whole room will be a giant rainbow
    get stuffed you woosy my dad worked in a lab through a phd and then in a battery factory with pounds of the stuff around in the 70s and hes fine    just dont fucking drink it and its very cool stuff to have around
is it red
  what a fucking killjoy
  metallic mercury on your hands for 10 minutes isnt going to have any affect on you unless youve got an open wound on that note op should make methyl mercury and sell it for a million dollars to a terrorist organisation make sure you filter your tap water properly for a few weeks until the news comes in
  wow thats amazing clearly we should disregard all we know about the dangers of mercury poisoning through work exposure and environmental exposure      nope way to be a killjoy is spreading a very illegal heavy metal in the environment and risking immediate exposure to yourself and others    lets assume that op has a small vial containing only like 1 fl oz 296 ml of elemental mercury which is about 400 g almost a whole pound    that amount of mercury is enough to make 800 000 pounds of fish dangerous to consume and then youre not even assuming theyre highend consumers    would you like to poison someone and make die in the same way as the female chemist above just methylate it and you can induce a persistent vegetative state with spontaneous episodes of violent agitation and crying in several thousand people
  look methyl mercury is fucking nasty stuff for sure but he doesnt have methyl mercury he has metallic mercury its like a guy says he has a jar of fluoride salts and youre saying hes going to blow up his house with all the highly reactive fluorine
are there any liquid metals that dont give you neuroaids

  people now is so gay when i was a kid i always was waiting for a mercury thermometer to break to play with the fucking mercury balls
  pack up your vagina and get the fuck off /diy/
  he has metallic mercury  which readly forms mercury vapors  the mercury in the inhaled air has near 100 bioavailability  it is instantly absorbed by the lungs the particles easily penetrates your bloodbrain barrier and settles down in your brain  the parts of it that doesnt are converted to free mercury ions in your body and goes absolutely everywhere  but mainly in the cns and kidneys    say he doesnt get exposed to it himself but this harmless metallic mercury ends up in nature somehow   its then converted to organic for example ethyl and methyl mercury in microbes and outside of microbes converted to various inorganic salts and is bioaccumulated then we get waterfowls that look like picrelated    youre saying nonsense  nope the topic is perfectly clear to me im just informing you all of how reactive and damaging this is      make me faggot theres an asbestos isnt that badthread for the scientifically uninformed you can fuck off to
  which readly forms mercury vapors  the vapor pressure of mercury at normal temperatures is very tiny 160mpa thats enough that mercury sprengel pumps can make a high vacuum or reach about the estimated atmospheric pressure of pluto though this is still significant if youre in an enclosed space for enough time to avoid that sort of issue its important that you deal with mercury outside or in a wellventilated area and always keep it with an airtight lid on when not in use    theres already huge amounts of organic mercury being released into the atmosphere from the burning of coal anyway so the mercury vapors from your little jar will not have any comparatively significant effect if they are dispersed enough it would be like petitioning new zealand to stop using fossil fuels to prevent global warming when china increase their emissions by more than nzs total every year if he plays it safe like codys lab and does everything in a waterproof tub outside and with gloves on theres basically nothing that can go wrong unless hes retarded and drinks the stuff    still better safe than sorry but youre the one overreacting mercury thermometers are still vastly superior to alcoholbased thermometers thanks to their stability and modern liquid mirror telescopes use vast amounts of mercury
  sure im just trying to kill off the myth that metallic mercury isnt that dangerous since it doesnt harm people that much at all topically and to a limited extent orally    your little jar will not have any comparatively significant effect   i disagree given the example above lets combine it with some other pieces of information for example      the concentration of mercury in coal samples from the usgeological surveys coalqual database averages 017 ppm for inground coal in the conterminous united states    017 ppm assume all of the mercury is thrown out into the atmosphere upon burning 04 kg of mercury thrown out into the environment equals 2360 metric tonnes of coal burnt or slightly over 5 million lbs      negligible    if they are dispersed enough  thats the thing about heavy metals they accumulate    interesting you should bring up liquid mirror telescopes ive done various chemical silver deposition techniques for glass and related coating procedures for some amateur telescopes havent read that much about lmts
  coal burning in the united states alone results in release of some 802 tons 73 tonnes of elemental mercury to the atmosphere each year  out of total anthropogenic mercury emissions in the united states of 158 tons 144 tonnes/year  the volatility of mercury is 0056 mg/hcm2  what i was trying to say anyway is that the vapour given off by your jar of mercury will be absolutely minuscule a tiny fraction of the whole per hour because of the very low vapour pressure so it would be more like a few hundred nanograms per hour than the whole lot 80mg/yr  9kg/hr  300ng/hr negligible if he boils the fucking stuff in open air then hes a complete retard    and accumulative mercury refers to inside bodies or the soil but in the air it disperses like any gas and its the vapour im referring to    silver deposition techniques  i always failed at getting a good mirror off the tollens test in the chem labs
  oh let me clarify i dont want people leaving jars of mercury open 24/7 the point is if you have it open for 30 minutes in a week theres not going to be an effect
  ah right it seems weve talked past each other the vapor issues were merely related to its impact on personal health that metallic mercury can have as some earlier poster said it was fine vapor wasnt at all accounted for when talking about environmental concerns     the environmental concerns were re what would happen if op did some cool experiment outside like previously suggested and removed things earlier in the thread i just wouldnt want to have even a small amount of mercury turned in to watersoluble salts and introduced to the local environment    getting a good mirror off the tollens test  the trick is to preclean the vessel use quite high concentrations of most ingredients for the silver ammonia complex and letting the reaction take its time to deposit itself while maintaining the heat treatment throughout heres one of the old jars that we tested one formulation in
  better pic of an early test
    oh those are nice im guessing part of the problem was that we just had highschooltier concentrations that were a bit too low and no acetone or anything similar to properly wash out the test tubes
  get out of here with your pc bullshit i used to play with mercury balls when i was a kid now everybody bitches a out everything dont play with mercury dont eat paint dont drink and drive
  cheers you can probably acquire the chemicals for it easily if you want it try it out again some time if you do just mind the contact explosives formed      i used to play with mercury balls when i was a kid  and now you have evidently have brain damage  gg no re

  ive already said i work in biotech i dont do too much pure chemistry nowadays  im just telling you how these things work and that there are plenty of experiments you can do that dont pose as great a threat to yourself  or the environment the screeching itt is commonly seen when people on here are told to not do something even when given good reasons kids will be kids    cheers
pour in cities water supply

  ahahaha
  sure then again he had a phd and knew how to be careful you can still have an accident    i too am a phd and survived quite a few accident in my time as a researcher i contributed to the accident threads on /sci/ a while ago i was careful i was still hurt due to sloppiness by others i am mostly fine now other than a burn in my wind pipe due to an idiot messing up a fume cupboard    mercury is no joke please do take care
    do not play with it do not throw it away do not keep it contact your local authorities and have them dispose of it safely    for fucks sake you faggot how did people in order times manage to survive then
  have them dispose of it safely  the safest way to dispose of mercury is to keep it as a metal in a container and dont let it spill   its an element you can never truly dispose of it you can only keep it somewhere
  oh books i guess that proves it let me be the first in internet history to apologize for doubting your intellect
  mercury is very illegal in my country  lol what country outlaws elements
  red mercury is a big troll     the only red mercury is mercury ore

  drink it
  really here in the states mercury is in like everything all over in light bulbs computers etc
  go play with some mercury then you fucking retard
mix it in with a gallon of paint and paint your bedroom it gives a really cool subtle glow in the dark/ shimmer effect super relaxing
  fluourescent lamps of all sorts have mercury in them which means every cfl and tube light read every fucking country under the sun has them but breaking a cfl or two isnt going to make a significant amount of mercury still id quite like to see where it goes in a room whether it evaporates but condenses on cool windows and walls or if it is spread about as ultrafine droplets about your floor or if it says as a vapour/suspension of airborne droplets and is carried away by natural air flow
  coal burning in the united states
  if youre in the room a big amount of air circulates through human lungs we dont absorb a lot of it though
    the same countries that outlaw numbers

  mercury is fun make it into dimethylmercury dont forget to wear latex gloves dispense via aerosol to freshen a room use as sweetener in coffee or antifreeze literally millions of uses
  why do they put it in amalgam fillings  i have 6  am i going 2 die
  amalgam can only be made with mercury its quite an incredible material that is easily workable for a few hours before setting into a very hard material making it ideal for dental work as a solid mercury leeches out of it far too slowly to ever be a major issue unless you make a habit of drinking solutions that can dissolve it which are few and far between

      ha i have an iceland flag buff that i havent used yet we have perfect weather for it now    normal outdoor wear is anything carhartt   recently bought something new of theirs and it wasnt made in murrica so well see how that works out
  i live in south east pa its not brutal here but single digit american temperature happens often enough   if i know ill be out in it for a long while thermals tshirt hoodie and something on top of that to block the wind i have a burton jacket   for legs pj pants jeans  feet socks over pjs and boots  then just any old gloves
  also  tfw ive lost my thermals pjs and boots since last winter and my sneakers have a hole in the sole so my feet are soaked
  huh
this is my first winter working outside and my second in pennsylvaniaim originally a arizona desert boi but what works great is deluth workwear like their pants and jackets i am now comfortable in freezing temps without a jacket but only because i wear level 1 ecwcsextended cold weather clothing systemcurrently just got level two for below 20f poorfag thermals if you have money get all synthetic deluth thermals or synthetic carhartt thermals cause the ecwcs fit is inconveniant with how high the rise is on the pants is basically i wear a wicking layer long johns wind pants and deluth firehose pants which are better than carhartt i still like carhartt but deluth is far tougher and has more comfort than carhartt also wait for a sale to try it
  do you do shit outside for 12 hours at a time those warmers look sweet but i dont wanna burn alive inside
  you go from a warm car to a warm home just suck it up
ontariofag here i have to spend a lot of time outside or in an unheated warehouse and i mostly use gear thats made here in canada kamik boots raber globes osc parka all rated for extreme cold  its important to have an effective wind blocking layer here no matter what you do wind thats very cold and full of humidity feels like blades slicing into your skin as it whips past you  psa if you order any canadianmade gear esp canada goose online and it comes from asia or some african shithole its counterfeit and you will fucking die if you try to use it in 40 weather    theyre catalytic no flame
  tried duluth pants and hated myself for buying thier overpriced meme crap back to usa made carhartt b01 ill never cheat again
  full body wool underwear is all you need usually wear a hoody on top and normal pants in winter even if 20/30 celsius itll be fine if you have earphones/plugs and there isnt a completely genocidal blizzard going on northern norway here you need gloves to use a phone tho
sometimes i carry some freshly hardboiled eggsor a baked potato
  anything from carhart and most items from dickies  it depends on your budget and location  levis corduroy sherpa lined jacket is top tier just make sure you get the classic one as the new one is modern fit that means it looks kinda gay
if youre on a budget check your local tjmaxx/marshalls/burlington    i bought two carhart jackets one hoodie type other is shearling/regular collar and flannel lined carhart pants for like 25 each     my usual winter getup  uniqlo heat tech ultra warm long johns  uniqlo heat teach underwear  wigwam or mukluk winter socks  uniqlo heat teach ultra warm long sleeve undershirt  coldweather sweatshirt from nike/under armour  duluth fire hose fleece lined pants or same carhart  carhart jacket or north face down if not working
i follow the finnish school of winter survival  t yooper
milwaukee heated jacket with jacket on top tuque gloves and two pairs of pants  t winnipeg flag
  stfu ontario fag  québec fag here  get a normal jacket thats good for diverting wind like a bike jacket and wear two sweaters underneath coats are for yukon fags  for your legs wear jeans on top of a warm pair of loose pants for your noggin get a lumberjack hat shits amazin
    an old army fur coat from 1913  swedefag here
im from northern in and i can attest that carhart is the sht its a little pricey but worth it 32 degree heat products are also good theyre super cheap if you buy them at costco
my main issue in the cold is my fingertips and toes getting cold especially if skiing or something even liners  gloves fingertips still get cold i have all darntough socks this year i figure my darntoughs  thicc wool socks on top not sure what to do about the hands though
  quit smoking you wont have so much eczema if you do either and yes vaping is still smoking
  not a smoker and i do cardio fingertips are still fucked
  cowboy boots and a long sleeve shirt   south texas here
  baise mon cul queeb come stand in this lake wind for eight hours in your queer jacket
  fellow texan here yeah when it gets too cold for that its time to panic and shut down everything
i prefer layering over thick jackets   long sleeve soft cotton shirt  a pure wool sweater  a wool coat wool scarf and beanie thats good enough for 20c
norwayfag here  wool underwear wool sweather jacket and what ever pants   i have a insulated onesuit for when i hunt basicly a sleepingbag with arms and legs would recomend for sitting standing around when its really cold
  fellow texan here yeah when it gets too cold for that its time to panic and shut down everything    50 chance of snow next week    dfw salt everything sand everything then shut it all down
do you guys have any advice for my ski season ive only used handmedowns and i wanna buy a new wardrobe for when i go off to france
  central ohio must escape just wear drunk outside and freeze to death
  all adidas everything
  canada goose
  those things are garbage battery lasts an hour at most and they generate fuck all for heat better off just spending the same money on literally any down parka and youll actually be warm
  their firehose stuff it way tougher than carhartt they used to sell polartec mens underarmor also     but that store has become very lumbersexual i too hate most of their bullshit
  what about one of these under a parka would you simply melt
  itd probably be too warm really problem with heated jackets isnt so much that they dont generate enough heat but they lack the insulation to hold the heat generated they are more of a fall/spring jacket where the jacket itself is good for most days but you have the heat for the cooler days when it comes to actual winter nothing beats a good parka with as many layers under it as needed    i work outside in 30 to 40c all winter and never need anything more then a good wind proof down parka insulated boots and thin gloves i only wear regular clothing under like jeans tshirt and wool work socks most days i actually end up taking the parka off fairly often because it gets too fucking hot to work in it
california   usually coldest when im at work is 25f  jeans long sleeve shirt long sleeve work shirt over that wool socks boots  im in and out of classrooms in a school that was built with courtyards no enclosed hallways here til 11 some nights
   think you gor ripped off bud mine lasts 10 hours and keeps me cozy and warm
  something tells me that aint a hot coffee thats a cold beer  because you know finnish tradition demands a beer mug
recent pic of me going shopping
  you obviously dont live somewhere that sees freezing temperatures then even in the lowest setting youre lucky to get 4 hours and its nowhere near enough heat for a real winter
  their firehose stuff it way tougher than carhartt    i disagree duluths material is heavier but i dont believe it is more durable what really pissed me off was when i dripped some super glue on the duluths and the fabric actually cracked and split after the glue had dried just moving around normally that never happened with carhartt even after rolling the glue spot between my thumb and forefinger ill add that the only base layer that is worth any money is made out of wool the rest is garbage without exception
  finns drink more coffee per capita than anyone else like number 2 is america and number 3 is norway and combined they dont equal the finns
  how do people afford the 66 north stuff i went to iceland two summers ago and found something i really liked but it was like 500 how do fishermen afford it isit really that high quality also proxy from outlet store
  when the alternative is fucking frostbite you pay whatever you have to
get yourself 2 sweaters  put em on  put a jacket overtop  any kind of thicc mitts thinsulate is pretty good  steel toes winter boots again insulated kodiak is legit  wool socks over your regular socks  toque balaclava if its really cold  bib chest level ski pants are goat but if you dont work outside even long johns under your pants are okay  i live in central canada so its around 40c typically this is my go to gear so you could rock less sweaters if its warmer all this heated jacket shit is garbage you just need to move around your body will generate its own heat

what does /diy/ think about new stihl ms 500 i with fuel injection and no carb
  their newer saws havent pleased me very much weve blown through a number of saws over the years and the stihls have lasted for fewer and fewer hours with each model that comes out    not that huskys are a lot better their saws are almost frozen in time they last but they dont change them much i guess that is the tradeoff    meanwhile we have an old warhorse of a homelite light blue that wont die only the old timers use it because it has no chain brake and it is heavy as fuck but it easily has 5x as many hours on it as any other saw were ever had i guess sometimes the assembly line gods bless a machine to last forever like that 1 of 1000 kinda of deal
  no carb    i picked up a 5 used and abused stihl 017 from some landscaping company with a broken handle to play with took it apart  found teh carb was spotless and seemed to be original all the fuel lines looked original and still flexible put it back together and it started right up also got an old macullough  the lines rot out every year and so do the damn diaphragms/gaskets/primers
  my problem with husky was always weight sure they last for ever you can make anything long life if you allow yourself all the metal bearings and reinforcement in the world stihl has been making an increasingly worse product every year for the last 20 though
the china carbs on their newer models are junk  i hope the fuel injection is better
so does the saw have a battery on it to run the injection
  yo bro get the cables i need to jumpstart my 2stroke chainsaw
  most likely it has a stator
  its got fucked up gas caps i wont buy
  this dont know about this new fi system but stihl has been a garbage brand for at least the last 10 years still popular because of their legacy but its just chijese shit now when my old stihl from 1991 ever finally shits the bed i dont know what ill do
  holy shit this things cuts like a hot knife through butter
  take your archaic garbage and shove it up your ass
  makita  buying chink shit instead of american hardware
  chink shit  there was no mention of milwaukee there
  visit arborist sites instead of this place if you want serious saw info 4chan is for bantz
  that wont run with a serious gasser saw nice for dadcore shrub maintenance though
  oh yeah i forgot everyone needs those 8kg saws to take down some swiss mountain pine silly me better get some gas   
  wranglestar  dropped in one fucking heartbeat
  am i supposed to be impressed sorry for not knowing any of your eceleb youtube faggots
ecco saws 4 teh win
  you should know that faggot is a faggot
  no thanks i want my saw to run for more than five minutes and i dont want to spend 10 000 american pesos for a truckload of batteries just to get what an one gallon tank of gas gives me
  yup they use alkaline batteries totally unrechargable and gas and 2 stroke oil is free
with fuel injection and no carb    sounds like they added more components that can potentially break like you need an ecu for your chainsaw now come on      electric    my man
  once makita comes out with 80ah bats this thing will be able to run around 3040 minutes theyve been slow on the battery front so therell probably be a new version of that saw by the time that comes out
  i bought a ms382 this summer and im very impressed
  3040 minutes thats great but stihls are used all day every day by landscapers loggers and others stihl makes a rescue chain for firefighters and other emergency services for example battery cant do what gas can
  at least the huskies fucking last echo is also good stihl has really gone to shit over the last decade and a half they honestly couldnt pay me to use a stihl these days
  it only takes 5 seconds of watching to realize hes just a faggot shill
  3040 minutes  and while your sit there recharging your pussy ass saw ill be actually working
  anon just described the toyota tundra of chainsaws they last but shit never changes
  i didnt know there are electric sockets in forests
i have a shitty landlord who doesnt let tenants control the thermostat and my room is always really cold its usually 1618 degrees the other rooms in the house tend to be better though and i cant really tell why the building is concrete i think it might be my window but i dont really feel a draft from it    i was thinking of buying one of those cheap plastic window insulation kits but i dont know if they actually work or they are just junk if they work do you guys have any brands or specific products you recommend
  i have used them in my garage and they worked great but the windows were drafty it cant hurt and they are cheap and easy
ive used them over single pane aluminum framed windows they were a lot better than nothing no specific brand recommendations i think the cheap ones like the ones i used are more difficult to see through
  be like me and buy these instead of fixing my broken window already lasted 3 snow storms
  they are cheap and easy  i find these things impossible to find in canada for cheap
  buy 36 mil plastic by th roll  i use 4 mil and tape its cheaper than a kit i buy it at menards
  in my state thats illegal but whatever    yeah i have a house that has old shitty windows and they worked for me i have them on three windows and it has noticably helped the draft     but i used trashbags and double sided tape for cheaper
if you dont care to look out the windows bubble wrap works quite well
  i have a shitty landlord who doesnt let tenants control the thermostat  wait what hack that shit or buy a space heater
  just use flextape clear
i use ones where you put double sided tape around the frame then slap the plastic on  trim it work very well for drafty windows  have one window that i cant feel a draft but the plastic poofs out once its on  used to use rolls of plastic as another anon suggested but if you want the easily installed and removed double sided tape you really dont save much over a more convient kit  i buy up 3m kits from goodwill in the spring for 23 some cheap kits i bought in the past have shitty tape    since the rest of the house is warmer a small fan on the floor in the doorway blowing out would help circulate the warmer air into the room
  cant you cool the thermostat wouldnt that work
buy an electric heater brainlet
  fucking space heater bro   a 1500w will warm a small room up toasty
sup i want to buy a mini lathe but all i find around is chinese dogshit rebranded over and over ive seen some youtube reviews and i found they are quite abysmal  are there good mini lathes around new or vintage preferably made in uk or europe i live in italy  i can find the mystical schaublin 70 but prices are prohibiting not to mention that i need screw cutting and the relative attachment is even more money
  prices are prohibiting  so the cheap chinese one will do the job there should be a ton of info on how to fix the quirks and features since its so mass produced
what do you want to turn
  the schaublin 70 is an high end swiss precision lathe very sought after by horologists and even collectors for my purposes it is overkill and insanely expensive  the sense of the post is is there something in the middle   im aware there are dedicated forums to improve chinese mini lathes but eww you have to be lucky to not get a bad specimen in the first place and that wrecks my nerves
  mainly brass max 30mm in diameter and 120mm in length id like to have around 500w
  im aware there are dedicated forums to improve chinese mini lathes but eww you have to be lucky to not get a bad specimen in the first place and that wrecks my nerves    a bad specimen is one that has a particular problem without a fix online if it did you would be able to return it to the reputable retailer you bought it from    essentially buy it from a good retailer check that everythings there make sure all the parts seem fine  no chipped teeth on gears leadscrews move freely you can change jaws on the chuck etc  and if anythings bad  complain to where you bought it from nothing to get anxious about
a watchmakers lathe but your looking between 100200 price    or make one  
  vintage  stuff like the unimat db200 was the goto for many years insanely popular so expect to pay good money for a good tool  new  proxxon fd series also horrifically expensive and popular not entirely sure if good and costs a bit more than its probably worth in saying that theyre one of the few new lathes which is made to some quality standards    dont even waste your money on the chink shit its really not worth anything but landfill and fixing one is just throwing good money at something you shouldnt have done in the first place
  the hell read better anon i dont need a watchmaker lathe just something small and of better qualoty that chink shit i can spend up to 1000 also 500w chinese lathes cost no less than 450    proxxon are very low powered and yikes overpriced imho
  just as a word to the wise see if you can hunt around for torque specifications on their motors  basically someone throwing 500w on something means its either drawing down 500w and inefficient as a hitmiss engine from the 1920s or theyre just making up a number which is kinda around 500w or it is actually a high quality motor which is both efficient and produces good amounts of power    thats sort of where ive seen the big disparity on power tools is the plethora of garbage motors and you will have to pay money for a legit one
just make one  plenty of plans out there
  machine your own lathe
    what makes you guys think i have access to an entire machining workshop when im on the werge to buy a fucking ching chong turds turning mini lathe
  electric motors are very efficient even a shit one is able to put out 90 of absorber power  the problem is the transmission in order to obtain a demanded rpm in cheap machines gears or belt pulleys are way preferable over digital rpm contol since the circuitry will be inevitably poor and will dissipate tons of power and probably giving shit torques  a mechanical transmission might be less practical to use but the motor will always spin at its optimal speed
  just buy parts and put it together
  or make one    just make one  plenty of plans out there    machine your own lathe    just buy parts and put it together    lololol
  maybe you can buy an already modified chink lathe from someone who has found something better
  its quite odd i cant find used chink lathes in my area    im doing a research on enco unimat lathes they look lovely and definitely cheaper than fucking schaublin  do you know a model with built in screw cutting
buy chinkshit lathe  use lathe to make metal gears to replace chinkshit plastic gears  machine better lathe with shit lathe  become lathe god because so much experience  checkmate
  mini lathe  ive been interested in this too lately  i just stumbled on this yt channel recently      he specializes in minimachining equip like mini milling machines mini lathes and stuff  fyi i think he does have a website that sells the stuff too but his yt vids are 100 just straight honest info no crap like hopped up loud music hipster commercial marketing crap    pretty good down to earth basic info has some pretty good comparison vids where he talks about the features of different models
  yikes  
  is for wood only
  do you know a model with built in screw cutting  i think the dbs bigger brother the sl1000 might have had that not sure if it was standard or a bolt on
  op stop acting like a twat    im building my own lathe  i dont have a machine shop      i have aluminium and steel stock hacksaws a power drill rasps files and a fucking set of wetndry paper    2x 12v dc motors with a combined power of about 1/2hp    a little tip for you  there are firms out there that will send you free samples of their leadscrew driven linear rail systemsfree  use one of those for the ways build an aluminium mount for the motors buy some gears and and buy/make your own chuck    now fuck off
  im building my own lathe  i dont have a machine shop  i have aluminium and steel stock hacksaws a power drill rasps files and a fucking set of wetndry paper  2x 12v dc motors with a combined power of about 1/2hp    please show photos and videos of your progress because this is awesome if it works dont wait until you finish or fail please but go ahead and give us some info whenever you can im particularly interested in that free thing you use for the ways and how you made your own chuck with those tools    thanks for any info you can provide
  the hunk of shit you are building will only good to make plexiglass dildos if you are lucky  you clearly have no idea of all the issues in building a machine that works metals and can hold a reasonable amount of precision reasonable im not talking about high precision  you can diy a wood turning with the tools you listed but forget a metal one
  sexy af  i know thats probably a little wierd for a human to write but stillllll imean just lookit the attachment set 
  still in design stages but im absolutely convinced it can be done manually also my pleasure comes from the making of things that move ill get bored with it once ive built it probably    im using pic related for inspiration if this 16 year old can do it with 3d printed parts i can do it with metal and a hacksaw  mine will be stiffer because his looks wobbly as fuck desu    ill follow with a pic of the module ill use for the ways i actually have a few of these so i might hack one up and use another for the cross slide    the company that produces them has a manual dial with a readout of up to 100microns so you can move it accurately but i might just fuck that off and use a stepper motor and a coupler to dial it in electronically    basically a hybrid manual cnc lathe    getting there    and how you made your own chuck with those tools  the plan is billet  cut 4 channels for the jaws and use some threaded rods    ill post a pic of my sketch in a minute    link to 3d printed lathe 
  precision linear motion rails  carriage  lead screw im using for the ways      the hunk of shit you are building will only good to make plexiglass dildos if you are lucky    ah nice i see ive found my first buyer then
  overall sketch plan
  ah cunt its upside down sorry      prelim chuck design
  and finally the motor clamp
  you cannot make precision components by hand  heh    anything youre doing as a home gamer can be done by hand if youre careful enough   this isnt a silicon die 5nm transistor factory  op wants a lathe to turn brass bushings or some shit    also  /diy/  do it yourself  you realise where you are right
  have you never watched clickspring the guy is making a astrological clock with files and handmade drill bits
            nice plan keep us updated make your own thread if you like        the guy is making a astrological clock with files and handmade drill bits    making implies its his current project the antikithera or whatever is not being made by hand are you referring to another project and yeah clickspring is incredible and makes excellently edited videos without tons of useless chitchat and pointless footage like so many youtubers
  the only thing i see clickspring not doing by hand on the antikythera is cutting the blanks for the gears and drilling    everything else is done by hand right he uses files for the gear teeth laps and polishes everything manually    what other machinery has he used i dont remember seeing a lathe but i might be wrong  its been a while since i watched it
    i watched the first one or two where he made the frame and almost all of it was done using machinery that i would love to own        im a big fan of his and yeah he does lots of stuff by hand but the precision steps often use very nice machine tools
    most people arent going to be dedicated and autistic enough to bench fit an entire homemade lathe when unfucking a chinese minilathe would be easier other than learning to fit as an apprentice or being a shirtless 7 year old in a bangladeshi sweatshop there isnt really much reason to make parts by entirely by hand    out of curiousity how much fitting experience do you have and what tolerances are you working to
  out of curiousity how much fitting experience do you have and what tolerances are you working to    zero and around 000dunno  making shit is basically just a cheaper version of therapy for me since my parents became severely ill    being able to file down bits of metal really slowly over a period of days cutting teeth into other bits of metal and having them fit together just right is just heaven for me    ill likely just build it then use it to turn more accurate versions of its own parts fit those  rinse and repeat
op here        making small precision parts with files stones and abrasives is one thing making a machine that deals with high forces and has to keep precision like a metal lathe is a whole different deal you need casting iron facilities heat treatments massive parts just to have rigidity and low vibrations  also horologists do a lot of hand fittings but they also have a lot of expensive tools and machinery    thats actually a good channel might consider the unfucking the chink way    what i want to build with it are custom trumpet parts heavy caps boosters and mouthpieces they are all made of brass
  need casting iron facilities  no you dont you can use concrete  any cunt can cast high cement low water concrete in their garage your homebuild would be stiff as fuck
  yeah look if you want to go hardcore diy just for fucks sake then just go mine in an ore and smelt your own iron and build the first tools using rocks  i dont want to build a lathe i want to make trumpet parts
  you are a fucking trumpet mate
  uhok
  this is looking cool as fuck anon   good work
  my mini machine shop is sherline  i got it all at an estate sale  theyre expensive american made tools but they do what i need
  punishable face horse like teeth
  precision matthews is slightly higher quality chinese shit    the madeinchina south bends might be good i dont know    having a hard time finding the mini lathes online though for some reason maybe they didnt sell very well    in other news new surface grinders dont need wheel balancing by hand    
  this thing looks like the creme of cheap chink shit lathes    
  coming from someone also making machine tools from linear actuators drylin style ways are not the way to go
  why
    that pos is not even close to being a lathe look at that ridiculously thin spindle and the overhang that linear ways have 0 stiffness       this pretty much    dont get me wrong i think it is doable in fact im in the process of building one myself but it is way way more work than youll think if you want a decent starting point look at the gingerylathe youtube makercise that thing when finished is somewhat close to chinese machines but less stiff and may creep alu the very least youll need is a surface plate and a scraper my machine uses a granite block as a base and scraped steel rails for the ways steel is a pita to scrape but way cheaper than durabar were i live     building a spindle is next to impossible if you dont have access to precision ground round stock     overall you need a fuckton of time and skill even to reach the lower standard for chinese lathes and sometimes you can get them for under 200 its only worth it if you see it as a educational project
arent the chines mini lathe just mounted on tslot extruded aluminium
  i do agree that spindle rod is waaay too thin    might cut plastic though
    tfw didnt know tapers should contact more toward the thick end
  hes usually down to business must have been an anomaly
where are you in europe op im in switzerland the land of schaublin have a couple 102s one screwcutting and watchmaker lathes ive seen myfords go for around 1k here they would be the best bet for your size and budget plenty of spares available and lots of established mods out there    theres the czech tos mn80 which is more rare than the myford but apparently a better overall machine similar size screwcutting
  building a spindle is next to impossible if you dont have access to precision ground round stock     i hear they may have such things on the internet you might have heard of it
looking into buying a lathe for a beginner as a gift hes interested in them but didnt mention what size 8 x 12 or 12 x 16 which would i be better off getting him im not sure how limited hed be in projects going with the smaller size is the extra 200 for the larger one worth it or this the kind of machine that after hes been at it for a year or two hell want a bigger more expensive lathe anyway    t brainlet
  for the hobbyist chinese lathes are more than enough     i suggest you find an old textbook for working on a lathe these usually go in to much deeper detail on performing accurate work on a mediocre lathe but i doubt you will be machining motorcycle pistons     the working methods described in older textbooks are from the time when tools and machines were much more expensive and the industrial maintenance network wasnt as built out every factory was on its own so grinding your own cutters chafing the ways adjusting the crossslide on an unevenly worn production lathe and other stuff was a thing the lathe operator had to know
  im from northern italy i can easily find old full sized industrial lathes there are plenty of them around but i dont have the space and a tri phase power source  since horology industry is virtually non existent here compact lathes are not a common sight there are aficionados that have vintage schaublins and i can find them quite easily but the prices are obviously high  i will look into myfords thanks for the input if i cant find anything i think i will buy a chinese mini lathe at this point      well i did a technical high school so im familar with machining even though i never worked in the field i already have some old us army machinists handbooks in pdf they are quite exhaustive and well written
  never trust anyone with gums like that
  the real yikes is chucke2009 pretending to be an authority when he doesnt even understand how a regular tailstock works  be wary of who you take counsel from
  im using pic related for inspiration if this 16 year old can do it with 3d printed parts i can do it with metal and a hacksaw    you know how children on youtube make shotguns out of paper mache thats essentially what this 16 year old kid and by extension you are doing
  and    this is /diy/ not lathescom you fucking mongoloid
  this is /diy/ not lathescom you fucking mongoloid    but he was right
  and
  only ones i saw he was machining metal parts
what kind of things can you even make with such a small lathe
  because they are made of plastic and aluminium even the lead screw nut  everything here is very light load application       building a spindle is next to impossible if you dont have access to precision ground round stock  you dont need stock exactly a collet chuck from china is already ground and makes a good spindle shaft
  this      a lot of stuff mostly new tools for the lathe small stuff for repairs around the house pieces for models or clocks etc when i bought my milling machine i thought it was way too small but in reality most projects i do are smaller than 3x3x3       you dont need stock exactly a collet chuck from china is already ground and makes a good spindle shaft    if you dont need a chuck yes that would make a mediocre spindle shaft i thought about that too some of them even have a thread in the back which may be used for bearing preloading though you loose through spindle capabilities the surface in the front is a bit small and probably not even close to being square considering chinese quality at some point i will probably try to mod one as a high speed or right angle spindle for my mill
  
  that feed reverse is a very nice feature
        how to build a lathe and other machining equipment from fucking scratch
it only takes 5 min to build a lathe  
  though about  ive made 7 they are already preground square or i just do it my self i susually hjave a klabyrith seal in the front anyways so its not much issue i use male threads on the rear shank to preload my bearings so i dont loose through hole  the chuck is not an issue sherline/taig use chucks with er16 collet threads on them
   i susually hjave a klabyrith seal i    right you have made 7 chucks or whatever and you cant post coherently    next
  and  and if you want a usable tool to diy things with you dont waste your time and money doing something stupid like this    much like you didnt waste time digging up raw silicon to try and build your own microprocessors so that you can post this drivel on the internet  at what point does it end should i be bashing rocks together and gathering raw materials in the name of /diy/ is buying a proper tool too much buyfag    this isnt the /nonfunctionalart/ board
  believe it or not some people value building things that are functional especially in a thread where the op is concerned that a chinese lathe is not going to be functional enough   dont be surprised when your suggestion of wasting lots of time and money on something completely nonfunctional gets shit on
  yeah the gingery lathe gets mentioned all the time  makes me wonder how many guys actually manage to build it  also how many guys end up buying a lathe after considering building that thing
  cast aluminum bed    im assuming they all just buy a lathe immediately afterwards
  im assuming they all just buy a lathe immediately afterwards    correct except immediately afterwards refers to them abandoning gingery while trying to make the first way    so many blogs start off with enthusiasm but after two weeks of scraping they sorta die off
  i downloaded the gingery books years ago and planned on doing it   once i realized how much scrap you needed and scrap isnt super cheap like when the book was written i gave up on it its as expensive as just buying a chicom machine
    making your own lathe from metal is the equivalent of mining silicon for microprocessors    wow im going to stop lurking here because these posts literally infected me with the posters brain damage
  good riddance i hope the people encouraging him leave too this isnt a kipkay tier hugbox board    people dont like to hear the truth but they clearly have never touched a lathe before in their life blind leading the blind then whining when people with experience tell them to get a grip     its made to machine fucking metal by being hundreds of pounds being large and stiff in the hobby machining world 500lb machines are considered toys that arent really stiff enough to take decent cuts    if you are looking for a tool you can actually use its not going to happen in any reasonable way  if you are looking for an object that you will brag to ignorant people to feel all smart and special go ahead   notice how the faggots inspiration is a tool that doesnt even have a tailstock and was prefaced with it was made by a 16 year old not its a functional tool  he would be lucky to turn balsa wood on it
      some people enjoy making things for fun sorry about imposing on your super serious important life on 4chans /diy/ board    on the plus side at least weve identified one big stiff tool in this thread
  unimat db200  ive got one   the biggest problem with it is the rod ways theyre not very rigid at all and theres not really much you can do to improve that i also have the column that mounts the headstock vertically for milling and drilling but the rod ways again make it wobbly as hell especially with the vise mounted on the cross slide cantilevered way out   the biggest advantage is that its tiny and for the size it does a lot its great if you move around often i had mine mounted to a board with a handle with that plus a toolbox i had a machine shop i could carry in two hands       screw cutting  no the db200 just has an optional power feed option they did make a threadchasing attachment that copied a thread from a master mounted behind the chuck its rare but my lathe came with one its rare for a good reason its totally useless and impossible to make a thread with any degree of accuracy
  some people enjoy making things for fun    i agree    is a great board for people building ornamental things mimicking the real thing    super serious important life    it has nothing to do with my life its simply being objective about the machining hobby in general  a ton of anons over the last 2 years of so have bought lathes and mills on this board im all for more to do it    im not for turning someone away from my chosen hobby by sending them down the wrong path that will waste time and money
  why would i make any chucks i make tiny spindles and tiny cnc machines from linear actuators that arent made of plastic and aluminium and can cut more than chocolate and candle wax the fact that you dont even know what im talking about despuite the typos means your toy lathe for cutting doll house furniture that was designed by a 16 year old  means your pipe dream candyass lathe will not get off the ground i was trying to offer up support for diy lathe while trying to not be discouraging even though its obvious you have no idea what your doing or how to make it even though you are being a dick you can still ask what ever you need and i will try to answer
  the main problem is a smaller lathe has less mass and less rigidity so less precision while small parts need extra precision so theres kinda a soft limit to how small a lathe can be  and thats why they dont make them small unless its chinese crap
  serious question    how long has it been since you came here from reddit    you take yourself way to seriously consider killing yourself
    that spindle shaft is weak as fuck and the chuck is unnecessarily far forward of the bearing that bearing block should have been part of that long peace where all your rods end so the chuck is as close as possible to the main bearing the way it is nowi doubt it will do much in aluminium    pic related a mini lathe with a thic spindle shaft and no overhang aka chuck mounted close
    look into optimum machines they are german made of course thats a lie its chink tech but its suppose to be a little better than the usual in terms of quality control and such    i have their mill that i converted to cnc with their bolt on kit and it has served me well for years
            engineer here i design steelwork connections for tall buildings     did you guys even look at the sketches before mouthing off    they look like design concept sketches this guy is probably a designer/engineer    there are even things in those sketches that deal with the spindle problem the massive overhang and the stiffness issue    for hobbyist machinists you retards clearly cant read drawings
        stepper motor as spindle drive motor for mini lathe
  out of curiosity why would you cut threads like this instead of using a die
  because threading dies fucking suck and you have more control over the thread fit
  
    is it better to use a regular old electric motor and add an encoder and everything to make it like a servo instead of using a big servo as a motor    with a servo you could use the motor torque to hold a part at a certain angle for milling on it too instead of adding in a mechanical brake to hold position
    i didnt look at anything other than the green plastic machine i just assumed he already built that and commented looking at the first sketch now yes the overhang issue is remedied
  i dont know a lot about lathes but i know a little bit about steppers it seems to me that it would be unnecessarily difficult to build a reliable closed loop feedback system for a regular dc motor to maintain the speed in such a high speed and high force application     i dont think youd want to use the motor torque to mill with not stiff enough    there are servos and steppers with brake systems though so that if the power is cut the rotor says put again dunno bout stiffness
    at least read his post before you start criticising otherwise you just wasted all the time you spent criticising him and other peoples time who bothered to read your post
  bigger the better get the largest minilathe available even thats only a 16 or 18in between centers and weighs just a little over 100lbs
  thats a wood lathe anon
    nah to save time i only read posts with ether pretty pictures or 4 replies as a result of that my comment too contributed to the cesspool but such is life im just here 4 teh lulz im a pretty cool guy
  well its an upgrade from that rusty trombone
    that intro scene was unwatchable
  on the plus side at least weve identified one big stiff tool in this thread    more of a floppy sad little feeler gauge
  they look like design concept sketches this guy is probably a designer/engineer    they look like drafts you learned to make in high school shop class
  lack of set screws to hold the tang means its shit    there are a lot of reasons to hate the tailstock on mini lathes not enough travel tanged mt tooling taking up a full inch and a half of the travel of the quill etc
    guy is probably a designer/engineer  funny thats the first thing i though based on his replies   that deal with the spindle problem the massive overhang and the stiffness issue  yeah he still made it use 608 bearings and 8mm rod so no he didnt solve anything
  in the hobby machining world 500lb machines are considered toys  the boomerest post  muh big iron  muh usa  i make useful components on a 90lb chinese mini lathe you geriatric retard  anything that spins can be a lathe  accuracy is a result of skill not rigidity  go build another model train
  i make useful components on a 90lb chinese mini lathe you geriatric retard  anything that spins can be a lathe    i make lots of cool stuff on my harbor freight 7x10 but compared to a tool room lathe it actually is a toy in the sense that the diameter that i can work with is more like 3 inches for aluminum and maybe 15 inches for steel i can do lots of real machining so its a real lathe but the limitations cannot be denied    this is one of the funnier meme arguments on /diy/ and i hope it never goes away which reminds me whatever happened to the shot of black meme
  a sharp positive tool anon
  a sharp positive tool anon    this a sharp positive tool can cut any material at any feed rate    marry me
  accuracy is a result of skill not rigidity    maybe a certain amount 
  basically just making bigger cylinders of metal into smaller cylinders of metal so basically nothing useful
  with lots of precision features on said cylinder
  oh boy my cylinder is 0552 instead of 055    honestly what projects could you really do with one of these they seem like an expensive way of making replacement pins and washers
  grooves tapers angles etc    use the damn compound
  and all of those little derivatives of cylinders result in  im asking about projects not features
  taper shanks oring grooves etc    plus there is much to be said for the ability to true up something round
  
  most can turn a buttplug to the exact shape of their colon    you cant do that on a mini lathe though youll need a lathe that turns 12 billet at least
  a lot of it is just an expedient way to modify or make basic hardware true i used mine too make a forge burner out of brass and stainless tubing though i eventually upgraded to a larger size burner that was made of black iron pipe which i only used my drill press to make i used it to modify journal sizes a little on some of my ak builds when a miss matching kit gave me a fairly large interference fit for a gas block or whatever i tried to use it to make a quick change tool post for the lathe but i was working with scrap stainless of unknown type and the lathe lacked the rigidity and the motor lacked the power to effectively cut past the work hardening do i ended up finishing it at work on a real machine my lathe is one of the chinese 9x20 lathes i do not recommend it i mainly use the work machines now if i can help it the inconvenience of waiting for a chance to do it at work is worth it given how shit my lathe is
  true enough on the low power part gotta do stuff at a much higher rpm usually
  anon surely you meant to post a die and swage set
  yes
  i used my mini lathe to make shims spacers standoffs and bushings and to turn the right diameter for threading with a die   you can buy all that stuff in any sizes you need but when youre broke its very liberating to be able to make your own hardware
  people complained about his machining it later episodes are all done by hand
  proxxon are very low powered and yikes overpriced imho  remember for lathes you want rigidity if you have two lathes weighing the same one with a 550w motor and one with a 2kw motor the one with the 550w motor is the superior lathe overpowered  understiff you can always turn the same part more slowly you can never make your lathe less flexible
was reading a forum post and came across something called nro nonrepetitive runout        thought yall mind find it interesting     in the rotational runout of a bearing there is repetitive runout rro for short which is   synchronized with the rotation and there is nonrepetitive runout nrro for short which is   not synchronized with the rotation rro is attributable to mismatch biased thickness   between the center of the rotating raceway and the center of the mounting surface in the   case of rotation of the inner ring the mismatch between the centers of the diametrical   surface of the inner ring and inner ring raceway on the other hand nrro is attributable to   the structure of the rolling bearing the geometrical form errors of the bearing parts and so   on for example it is well known that the physical relationship among the inner ring outer   ring and balls does not restitute in the nrro of rolling bearings it was made clear that the   largest element was the frequency of cage fc for short and fc was affected by the mutual   diameter differences of the balls anisallocation of the balls 1 and conducting electricity 2    furthermore it has recently been clarified 3 that the fc component is affected by the   fluctuation of lubrication inside the bearing in the case that the runout accuracy of a   bearing is measured on the nanometer level the affect of factors other than geometrical   form errors is not negligible one of the authors previously performed experiments under   the purposeful fluctuation of lubrication 3 in such a case the condition does not imitate the   actual situation
  i make useful components on a 90lb chinese mini lathe you geriatric retard    post pics id love to see what kind of tolerances you hold
  a common misconception is that weight equals rigidity which is not inherently true you want the weight in the right places 85 in the base wont do you any favor yes it may dampen some vibration if its cast iron but you wouldnt have to deal with those if you had dynamic stiffness in the right places to begin with thats why you dont want rod bed lathes of any size     id go for a mid priced or used china lathe look for a decent spindle 001mm halfass scrape to some bearing or moglice and put on a solid toolpost thats probably the best youll get in a small package for a decent price the bedways should be quite straight from factory even when made in china      useful / tight tolerances   you can do simple bearing fits and press fits on a small chinese lathe if you want to build machine spindles for a living yes its not the right machine
  flexes cutting air
  proxxon is literally autism  never ever go near it
  1 tool to cut 100 different threads  100 different dies to cut 100 different threads
  post pics of your useful projects you have made  make us believers
  what does that have to do with my projects just read a book or documents like principles of rapid machine design or look at stefan gotteswinter on youtube his lathe is chinese and modded they way i said     the worst thing for stiffness is not too little material but to little contact between parts that is the reason why moglice/dwh works so well i may post some pics of glued and scraped linear rails for a mini lathe i havent been in my workshop for the last 5 weeks due to time constraints but threads on here may live that long i tested if i can just copy dwh by using jb weld which actually worked quite well though it doesnt make that big of a difference as jb weld is nearly as expensive as the real stuff where i live     my chinese machines are nearly completely vanilla i only took them apart deburred and lubed everything spindle runout is way below 001mm i cant measure more precisely parallelism and flatness of the ways is not perfect but good enough the only problems are the really bad gibs  low stiffness already bought moglice but didnt have the time yet and the quill fit is not good     my guess is that the really bad reviews of mini lathes are from people who bought from the ultra low budget sellers i bet those machines are the b stock of chinese manufacturers the mid and highpriced machines are mostly useable out of the box
  mini lathes are most often bought by beginners who dont yet know how to fix everything wrong with them which makes them sort of a poor choice for said beginners
  yes but compared to old industrial lathes you have a gigantic amount of tips tricks mods and plans on the internet without the ability to learn nobody is going to be a capable hobby machinist and gears spindle bearings etc for the minilathe are very affordable if one gear or spindle bearing brakes on an old industrial machine chances are the cost to repair is more than the complete machine cost     also no restraints modding fucking around with cheap chinese lathes on a schaublin or hardinge i would really hesitate before filing the tailstock base for fit like some guy on youtube did to his minilathe
  all true but without the machinery to actually do said things mills grinders bigger lathes etc big enough to work on the lathe parts they may be limited to buying aftermarket parts half of the time    reason to upgrade the shop with used industrial equipment too i have a chinese mini lathe and a 7k lbs pratt and whitney from the 40s a taiwanese mill from the 80s and a tormach 2018 a harig 618 ballway usa and working on converting the mini lathe to cnc
those little sherline lathes are pretty nice    
  my guess is that the really bad reviews of mini lathes are from people who bought from the ultra low budget sellers i bet those machines are the b stock of chinese manufacturers the mid and highpriced machines are mostly useable out of the box    you talk a lot and have been giving recommendations that go against convanteional wisdom btw   your guess is that everyone but you is retarded and quote  i make useful components on a 90lb chinese mini lathe you geriatric retard    prove it fag you dont get to be an authority and talk a lot without proof  make us take you seriously anon it should be real easy with how great you are and how adequate your equipment is
  im not him but i have made a few things on my mini lathe that you could consider useful    lathe  mill is of course a better combo for making stuff
in other news the tormach m machines are lower in price now    
  not making the cuts offcenter
  it works pretty well btw
  nobody needs a military grade sniper rifle flash stealthier
  okayjpg    burning chunks of powder slinging out the side aside works okay
anyone know if its a good/bad idea to change the gearing on a mini lathe for more reduction not going to use the change gears at all on the cnc conversion but i think if i can run in the motor at a higher rpm it will have more torque    yes it will limit the maxrpm and as stated i dont need the threading gear box
  do you need to harden it just mild steel    i wouldnt mind building one either seems like it could be cool
  i dont know if hardening it will help it to resist the thermal/chemical/mechanical erosion of the gunshot or not but it wouldnt hurt as long as you draw it back down so it isnt brittle
this is my southbend 10k lathe the day i brought it home  it was from a high school and saw little use  using a vfd with the original 3 phase motor  runs like butter and will hold better than a thousandth
  was from a high school  go over it carefully it may have been gang raped
  some notes because im having a hard time understanding your discussion of engine output    power  torque  revolutions per minute  power  torque  revolutions per minute  convert to units in watts newtonmetre/second  convert to units in horsepower poundfeet of work per minute  torque  force usually poundfeet or kilogramdecimetres or similar  rotations per minute  speed  work  distance  force    if you change your gear ratios youll either go faster rpm at the expense of force torque or youll increase force torque at the expense of speed rpm some engine types have a predisposition to certain kinds of output diesel engines have longer strokes and acting on this leverage have higher torque but they dont go as fast because they trade rpm for torque these are all based on circumference ratios between driven  driver wheels or absolute circumference of gears which is teeth still driven  driver    as long as your gears are laserlined they mesh well and theyre appropriately lubricated you should be able to transition up gears pretty far before you experience problems in vehicles higher performance engines sometimes are equipped with overdrive gears 6th and higher which actually multiply the output speed and drop torque like mad i expect something similar to happen as your lathe spins up into the equivalent of sixth gear the torque is very low but the speed is really high so depending on what youre trying to lathe it might or might not be an advantage as the engine encounters resistance at these speeds it doesnt have the torque necessary to overcome that resistance i dont know what the threshold would be for a lathe with our equipment for systems of immense resistance eg really fucking heavy machines they crawl along on hydraulic final drives because when you drop 1000 horse into a hydraulic pump low res your engine wont stall even though youre pushing something that weighs 300 tonnes
  prove it fag you dont get to be an authority and talk a lot without proof    you talk a lot and have been giving recommendations that go against convanteional wisdom btw    what i talk about is conventional wisdom besides the fact i dont even own a mini lathe and i wasnt the one claiming to make good parts on a mini lathe what proof would be one example there are thousands of reports and threads of people making stuff with mini lathes just open your eyes read and combine with a bit of common sense you can even find a lot of spotting patterns from people checking the scraping     pic related my prototype of a homemade lathe stiffer than the mini lathe i know how long it takes and that its not worth it unless its for educational purposes btw those rails were prepared on a shitty chinese lightweight machine before scraping flat and parallel to 003mm that was mostly the steel moving because i fly cut the surface and it was a low quality scrap piece     after scraping these are as good as i can measure 001mm one could build a lathe bed like that without any machining tools at all the base for building a lathe in my opinion is a surface plate and a good dial test indicator
  i have that exact model     do not buy     do not buy any 7 mini metal lathe    video is made by a shill completely ignores huge fucking flaws in this lipstick pig piece of shit the ways are butter soft dont drop anything harder than plastic on there ive dented the ways with fucking aluminum dropped from 3 inches    nothing on it is straight or true the tailstock base isnt fucking cut anywhere near right its so fucked up i cant type it all    yes it can turn and cut metal it does have some power and its over the whole range of the rpm but thats not the full story despite the power and nice controls like fwdreverse quite handy the fucking thing has so much delay between input like turn fwd and anything else that its practically useless for stuff like turning threads    its dressed up shit avoid at all costs a beat up rusted south bend left in the rain for a month is ten million times better than a brand new fucking nigger minifaggot piece of shit
  you scraped the sides of the bedway why
  its a box way you need confinement in 2 directions the other possibility would be a third rail in the middle just for front to back confinement like some machines use the normal reason would be to get less cantilevering plus symmetric and small distortion when the machine warms up which i deemed overkill for a small hobby machine but scraping three rails parallel can be about the same effort as scraping two parallel and one parallel at right angle or any other angle i just used scrap i had so 2 it is
  oh thats how that works thats badass
  ah ok how stable are those ways with just cap bolts or are there tapered pins too
    tfw once bought a proxxon mini mill  easily one of the worst decisions i ever made basically had to caress the steel off 05mm at a time or it would overheat in seconds
  true enough though with my g0752 mini lathe i eventually figured out if you crank up the rpm to 800 or higher and use a sharp positive rake tool you can actually remove a decent amount of material with its max cut maxing out around a normal/medium cut for a bigger lathe at 350 rpm or so    also position the tool closer to the center line of the crossslide for more rigidity it made a huge difference
  dude i appreciate the effort but this cant be called anything but a toy you could machine plastics maybe no prob or maybe light brass work but it wont be clean or accurate if youre serious about wanting to make a lathe look up gingery lathes ill be honest i tried to go down that path a couple years ago its a bitch and a half to get it to spec scraping the ways with tolerance is an art in itself and very time consuming understanding how you obtain mechanical accuracy and precision is important too if you ever need to actually use a lathe honestly the best thing to do is to go with a chinese lathe the grizzly line is kinda upgraded from wholesaler and theres tons of online support for them fuckers not to mention you can use itself to upgrade itself thus ridding yourself of the pitfalls of a shitty lathe once you understand the foundations then maybe try building a lathe to your specifications it will be a much better experience     i spent 4 months fucking with greensand casting only to get stuck on scraping the ways
  scraping is singlehandedly the biggest challenge for completing the workshop from scratch series the same reason i dropped the project and went with a hazard fraught mini lathe
  lol chucky is the last guy with authority on machining hes at best a glorified welder hell half the comments on that vid are shitting on him for being incorrect he bitches about plastic gears when those are very easily upgraded using the lathe itself
    goddamn how do you get past the first minute
  surface plate  a requirement honestly
  i think the difficulty of scraping is exaggerated theres a lot of very good information coming out since a few years getting a machine scraped in perfectly takes years of experience yes but even a beginner can extremely improve a chinese lathe as it doesnt have to be perfect getting things flat is actually pretty easy and for the alignment and measuring stuff theres youtube and instagram
  even a beginner can extremely improve a chinese lathe    what surfaces would i scrape on this the back side also is finished and what sort of improvement would i expect in my machining    and the real question what are the odds that i ruin it
  i wouldnt even touch the bed unless im absolutely sure it is not flat even then youre probably better of tweaking it by screwing it on a sturdy table you can untwist the bed by that you can spot the carriage on the ways and probably get 3 point or even less than that bearing when you scrape to half decent bearing youll improve the rigidity of the machine a lot if you want you could correct geometrical errors like the squareness of the axes you want the lathe to cut very slighty concave when facing     the most you can gain is stiffness and smoother operation/no binding by better bearing you cant really ruin it as it is probably in a very bad state to begin with people even use lapping compound on their ways which is comparable to random scraping blue spots without respect for any measurements the worst thing you could do is scraping every way concave so everything is rocking and wearing really fast or taking so much off that a screw will bind if the geometry is off you can always correct it with more scraping as i said i wouldnt go for perfect on a chinese machine medium is way good enough for hobby use
    thanks ill give it a look lapping might make the most sense after securing it to a solid surface
  i would always prefer scraping but of course youll need the tools for that lapping will help with binding but has no geometric constrains so it will definitely make the geometry worse most probably in the way i said btw convex not concave basically like a accelerated wear of the ways also theres always the danger of embedding lapping compound in the soft cast iron which promotes further accelerated wear     btw a lapped finish is a bad choice for cast on cast hydrodynamic bearing at least you want some oil pockets in the shorter sliding partner
    thanks i wont lap it
  start with buying some blue and just try to inspect the state of your lathe take an indicator and play around trying to measure the geometry like din8606 and play till youre confident in your measurements after that you can decide if you want to scrape/lapp or do nothing
  start with buying some blue    ive been meaning to buy some anyway so now i will
  that blue is the complete opposite of what you want though it is fast drying while spotting blue never really dries i use diamant blue but i think theres also a similar dykem produkt
    thank you sir
  this one is what youll need
  lol oil based dont get it on your hands it will never come off it will take a few days of washing
  and if you do lap it use the timesaver stuff that turns nonabrasive after a few minutes of being mixed with water so if you do imbed any in the cast iron it wont wear the machine faster
  i heard from a lot of people that they have problems with that i use isopropanol to clean stuff between passes and only clean my hands because of the iron dust which gets everywhere i have no problem with the blue going somewhere i dont want it to
  the best spotting blue is water soluble paints and a die spotting ink called canode blue canode red etc    still available and if you actually end up doing scraping/spotting a lot it will be well worth it by not staining your clothes hands and surface plate    nor requiring alcohol to clean it off just soap and water
  and dykem will work for checking fit between two parts like a taper not optimal but certainly will work    they used to use the soot from a candle flame to blacken a part for doing that kind of fitment
im from the states and purchased a schaublin 102 well equipped for under a grand keep your eye open for a schaublin on ebay you wont regret it it should be easier to find one over in italy
and for screw cutting use a die head    
  scraping does remove material remember that    checking contact would be a good start which will involve taking it apart and examining what the chinese workers sold you clean it out while you have it apart
  myford super 7
  nice
over a decade ago while my wife and i were dating she had a thing for care bears we were beyond broke college kids so i called in some favors from a few bros and turned a piece of shit emachines into a fairly descent pc for the time she needed a pc for school and had some older games she liked to play graphics and lag was aids but i was able to raid in wow in place of my geared up bros when they couldnt the lag was insufferable and in vanilla questing was aids i xp farmed to 60 and played in the auction house a lot    not sure why any of that shit was important kind of an odd day    anyway bad ass /diy pc builds    nb4 reee other boards    fuckoff i mean scratch built or repurposed cases and cool shit above care bear wrapped memecomputer quality or ylyl pc    im planning to finally build a good pc and i want to build something that will be eye catching for years or that i can sell to help funding my next build
before pic    used kylon stickers 3m spray adhesive and care bears cloth from hobby lobby    stumbled accross these old pics and figured /diy might want a couple of keks from the pics below
yeah i know colors are aids and nothing matches i was working with a 2 day timeline and 20 of borrowed money from a buddy get off my nuts     protip do not ever under any circumstances try to cover a fucking keyboard in cloth it took 4 tries and i had to finally steal a nail file rom her roomate and file 3 keys down so they would work absolutely aids
speaker
mouse was a pain in the duck also
only clean line on the build like i said it took 4 tries had to call a buddy over to help smash the board together properly and help screw it back together    glad i did because in the next pic he helped me fix the monitor i broke trying to get it apart for covering
good job op feels good when old warhorses are remembered
the piece of shit monitor power button was fastened to the monitor by melting 2 peices of plastic together and it broke     had trouble finding a pin or something to glue it back in with told my buddy he could have the 5th of crown we were sipping on if i could have his toungue ring after convincing him i was serious i heated it up and jammed it in there still works to this day
heres the ultimate kek this mutherfucker right here    i didnt understand how internet works and rather than buy a router i just bought another nodem and then proceeded to try and get internet to the pc    after i understood what a retarded faggot i was i caredully peeled off all of the care bears cloth the glue stained the shit out of the modem case and i used a credit card to buy it for about 80    borrowed another 5 from my buddy and did the best kylon job ive ever done on the modem case the store i went to only had black for some reason the factory case was grey    still feel like a piece of shit for it but i traded it back in at walmart for a router    hopefully someone at the factory got a good laugh or they just threw it back on the shelf and someone bought it without a clue    after working at that walmart 6 months later i feel a lot less bad now fuck walmart
pic related    i can build a house now can pretty much rebuild a small block chevy blindfolded and pretty much any tool or part i need for a /diy lroject i can make or at least go buy without checking my negative bank account    we were all dumb kids at one point i remember replacing a door in a rental we lived in because i couldnt change the lock
  op your pictures are small it is probably because of the camera resolution back to the time you made that stuff    i cannot say if it is well done or not but from what i say here it seems more than decent also it was a gift it is not odd at all you made it to please your wife if only more people where into making things themselve those are the best presents you focus on something she cannot have in any other way    good to see that op isnt a piece of shit looking for a robot dildo or some related stuff
  if you set up a load balancing vlan with a router like ddwrt or ubiquiti that would actually work fine you just order another service from your provider you could probably get better speed by just calling and asking about higher speeds from your provider though
    i like care bears too but even i wouldnt sperg out that much with the care bear theme holy fuck dude shit thats some obsession level shit right there throw that mofo in the trash
  if you set up  over a decade ago    your late to the party
  i came to that redhead
  op your pictures are small it is probably because of the camera resolution back to the time you made that stuff     filename 20181127_081058jpg  op is just a potato
good thread
    wrapped cloth around the ventholes of a modem    yeah you were retarded on many levels bro
me carebearsta but please post bigger pics even on my wxga laptop from 2008 theyre tiny
  i had the same emachines tower  cool job but ill tel you what when i was a kid watching my sisters care bears tape i wasnt watching for the bears i was watching for that shrill angry screaming cunt bitch qt with the heavy duty eyebrows
so i recently decided repair an old gypsy guitar from my grandmas attic   ive been sanding the fucker for the last fee days because the thing was initially finished with some sort od oil which became shit after 20 in the attic luckily my grandfather was awesome and took the strings off before kicking the bucket so the neck is in relatively good shape  anyways the tuning machines are a nightmare pić related  the b and d keys are bent and it looks pretty shit is there any way to get them back in shape would baking soda paste make it shiny again  what do /diy/
  fugg sorry  i was trying to make a thread no bulli pls
  oh i was not paying attention to the filename
  that photograph  so whereabouts would you say your barycenter lies
  thanks bro
  kek well i am the dickfarmer but thanks i paid about 350 for a 3mp kodak and another 120 for a 1 gig full sized sd card i put that thing in a beer koozie and carried it in my pocket for 3 years
  this was back when cable internet just came out lol good call tho
  no u    meh    wtf else was i going to do for 20
  lol ty i married the prom queen litterally named stacy kek    still have no idea wtf she is thinking being married to me but whateves
  both are correct
  and it didnt even imvolve pallets
  the vent hooes were in the back    think before u shitpost faggot lol
  i think 2004 or so photobucket is to blame i have originals burried in the abyss and they are way less potato even at 3mp
  ahaha that bitch haunts my nightmares
  i would jump on it with some pliers and profanity
  muh dick
  you could try taking the pegs to a wire wheel with some light sanding
guess who has to buy a snake because their girlfriend kept flushing her feminine products down the toilet and now there is a literal tampon dam inside our toilet drain whats the best way to go about this
  whats the best way to go about this    get the landlord to do it and bitch at her    dump her
    i would if they didnt charge us for is since its the residents error and not the fault of the building retarded i know
do bolts like this exist    basically a set screw with a flanged head
    what good is a flanged head on a set screw
picture does not match description probably exist as a part for some random application what are you trying to do
  picture does not match description    the grey part signifies threads
  im trying to use it as a set screw but the set screws tip is a bit to small as its gonna press against a semicompliant material sadly i dont have enough room to make it a normal pressure foot dont know translation so i hoped there would be a din/iso standard for this this would be like m5 with a total length of 10 mm
  ive never seen one like that you can probably make one fairly easily do you have a welder or a lathe
  the hex socket will fuck me over i think  im no machinist but i think milling a hex socket for m5 will not be easy
  milling a hex socket for m5 will not be easy    probably a tiny rotary broach 
  tiny rotary broach    fuck you my nigguh i didnt know these fuckers existed our suppliers probably have a whole range of those broaches thanks senpai
  there are brass shims you put between setscrews and the part to prevent damage
  yea but i dont want loose parts as they will get lost etc all i want is a set screw with a wide flat head basically
  its easy as fuck with a 07mm diameter endmill 8min start to finish 8 for the first 1 for the next ones
  a button head or something with a hex socket on the end    maybe a washer too    check mcmaster i bet they have double hex ended screws
  
  damnit my cnc lathe conversion isnt done yet
  all i want is a set screw with a wide flat head basically    when you say head i take it you mean the part that presses on the thing you want to lock in place and so the set screw will have to be inserted from the far side first then youll use a hex wrench to snug it back down    just out of curiosity could you show a diagram of what youre doing if its not too much trouble
  going off of what you have in the image  flat head  hex drive on the end of the bolt not the head  the closest fastener you will find that meet those features are hiloks
    hes already said the flange needs to be on the end that presses against something and none of those seem to do that
  none of those seem to do that  yes they can you thread them into the object from the other side then use the hex socket to turn the screw in/out to apply pressure by the flange
    yeah if he has that huge monster gap the ones i see are only threaded part way like in your drawing here which might work op needs to show us his invention so we can dissect it properly
  see 
    how would op use any of those im under the impression that he wants a set screw with external threads
  oh my bad    could be a case for beppu and his chinesium tap  die set
       these look like ideas if you want to do something with a fastener there is somebody who is already doing it hilocks were originally used with a disposable break away section but it looks like i may be behind the times look at mcmaster carr catalog or tap two washers and put me on your set screw and and doink the thread so it cant back out not sure if im imagining shit right
bruh use a regular screw with the head ground flat threaded backwards into the hole then double nut it
  basically this but the red part is a bit compliant so i dont want a 5mm flat tip but more surface and yea like you drawn i have to insert if from the right but after the red block goes in i can only tighten it from the left  but yea my stupid ass didnt know you could turn/mill a hex socket i thought those came straight out of the forming line for bolts
  sadly no space for nuts i could like 6 mm of binding thread 15mm for the flange and the whole thing is like 10 mm with m5 thread
  thread 4mm washer
no one manufactures anything like that op  industry just uses special set screws that are a softer material    link related     this is something that could be fabricated if this job came into my shop since i dont have the tooling to rotary broach anything nevermind a tiny fuckin 2mm hex inside a 5mm diameter screw i would have to weld the larger diameter onto a set screw and then turn it down so its concentric and square to the threads it wouldnt be cheap something that small is going to take effort to finish properly i would decline accepting this job im going to assume you want to pay something like a buck a piece when i would have to charge something like 150 bucks for 10
  buy a set screw and weld the other pieces to it
  every bolt exists in germany
take a bolt cut a slot in the end with a hack saw cutoff wheel file etc use a old fashioned standard screwdriver    done takes 30 seconds
  
    then why did you post a pic that has nothing op could use      /thread
  wow i want to live in germany
  its all grey dude
  its all grey dude    some is grey some is blue you need to get new eyes
could you just use a wider set screw drill a larger hole and tap it
  this is also a good idea thanks senpai
i would fill the hole then tap to size and use two grub screws back to back so the clamping action doesnt slack off
turn thread off small portion of business end of set screw  slide fender washer with id smaller than thread on threadless portion  peen end over    has some give in its wobble for the material  if you want to have more give you can use some shaped foot instead of a normal washer like a cup or star    this is how old fucking cclamps are made you retards do you never go to a flea market
low profile socket head cap screw    on a 2 week old thread
  low profile socket head cap screw   a 2 week old thread      posting a worthless reply to a thread because you didnt read enough to see what op wants
diy i still have a miswired 3 way switch    when this switch is down upstairs switch works right
when the downstairs switch is up this switch doesnt work in either position    my assumption is this is wired like a typical light between switches    which one is wired worg and why
  arent all two switch circuits wired that way  both have to be in the on position for the light to turn on once one is in the down position the other switch is rendered useless
  yes you have the line coming in attached to one of the poles disconnect everything igure out which line is hot
  side note im not an electrician just a retard who knows how these switches work so i dont know the correct wiring color for this shit i believe it should be white and red at the poles black is hot going in and out of the 3 way switch circuit so youre wired incorrectly on the op image but you should really disconnect everything and then figure out which line is hot entering and exiting the circuit before doing anything else
  no both can switch it on or off
  remember the neutral wire white does not get switched it gets patched thru from the source to the light or outlet   between 3way switches you need 2 carrier wires  the black and another often red or a white thats been blackened with tape or ink at the ends for awareness
  when the downstairs switch is up this switch doesnt work in either position  when the downstairs switch is down does the other switch work right
  if the traveler connections are at he switch end where the red wire is then it looks like the downstairs is wrong the black and white should be swapped there it looks like youre using white as a traveler  it should have black tape on the ends to show it could be hot  and red as another traveler and black carries hot from the source on one black carries hot to the fixture on the other
  i always use red and white as travlers then the black is feeding power in to one end feeding out to the light on the other end
  right but you mark that white one black as a reminder that it not a neutral
go down to the local hardware store and get a cheap1015 meter with a continuity tester  if not avalable a resistanceohms setting will work use the lowest ohms setting  test by touching probes together  should beep or show low ohms never use ohms setting on a powered circuit  turn off breaker  remove both switches    now to identify the 2 travelers  its wb or wr or br  well start with wb  connect wb together on one end  check continuity between wb at the other end   if theres continuity youve found the 2 travelers if not move on to the next combination    once youve found the 2 travelers   hook the nontraveler to the odd switch terminaldifferent colored screw marked common or something at both switches  hook up the travelers to the other 2 terminals doesnt matter which one goes where    some aligator clip jumper wires would make the process easier
  op here yes that is correct
  we have some lights with 5 to 6 switches for it
    this idiot has no idea how 3 way switches work please shutup as you are dumb
  then you need 4 way switches inbetween your two 3 way switches
  give him a break he thought this was a single throw thread
op here i want to learn this for myself logically wife wants to kill to me over leaving this unresolved
    if both switches are up the light is on if both are down the light is on otherwise it is off
  give him a break he thought this was a single throw thread    the title says 3 way its not like he had to read the whole thread or do any actual thinking
  except this one uses 3 conductor wire
  and this one seems to be wired with the light in between the two switches
      all 3way switches need an extra wire and the light is not between the switches in any case because then the 3way functionality is impossible     pic related is what you do physically but electrically its the same as 
  trouble is this is how the wires look red to one side but white on top and black on the bottom    the box with the light is in the attic space somewhat inaccessible
    wire color in a 3way setup can be confusing especially when you did not wire it originally since the wires between the switches can be hot or floating or neutral color sometimes makes no sense and by that look at         as drawn the red line is hot between the switches and the black is floating if you switch the right side switch down the black line is electrically neutral via the light while the upper red line between the switches is still hot as seen in both diagrams  and  the originating hot wire goes to one switch find that wire by disconnecting enough wires from both switches so that only one wire is hot anywhere     then make sure that switch is wired properly so that the two output screws are hot and floating then floating and hot now attach the wires to that switch and leave them disconected in a safe manner at the other switch and switch the first switch up and verify that one of the wires on the input side two screws of the second switch is hot and the other is floating     switch the first switch and make sure that the other wire at the second switch is now hot    now verify that the output of the second switch is hot or not whenever you switch that switch then go flip the first switch and come back and verify that the second switch has hot at the output when you flip it if so hook up the output wire that goes to the light and it will work
      in that post i assumed that the switch physically looked like  meaning the input is on one side and the output 2 screws are physically on the other side which is likely wrong look at your switches for labels and if necessary use an ohmmeter/continuity tester to determine which is the input screw and which two are the outputs look at  and that should make sense
  i was hoping for a way to figure this out by using logic and how the light currently works
    does your switch have one black screw on the side that has two screws maybe three counting the green ground screw    if so pic related is for leviton 3way switch
  this is the answer
i hope op solved the mystery of the ages and got his wife to resume having sex
holy shit please do not use the stab terminal on the back they are responsible for more house fires than you can imagine use the screw and get that nice and tight
    dude    step 1 pull both switches out of wall  step 2 safely disconnect all the wires in both switches one at a time cap it with a wire nuts  step 3 identify the hot wire the wire supplying power to the switch there will be only one one switch be be completely dead the other will have the one hot  step 4 identify your travellers these will be two wires going from one switch to the other   step 5 you should have one wore left over and that goes to your light    your neutrals should be tied together in both switches and the light so should the grounds    label your shit process of elimination
you should explain which upstairs three way switch is connected to the light youre having problems with is it the one in the front or the one in the back since the travelers dont match on the upstairs switch closer to the camera im going to assume thats the switch connected to the light you want working if this is correct you need to go downstairs and switch the black wire with the obvious code violating conductor identified as a grounded conductor but not being used as such white wire it will still be a code violation but the light should work as expected dont make the upstairs wires different although the electrician used different colored travelers for reasons electrons dont know they are traveling through the wrong color wire dont fix what isnt broke unless you want to fix the code violation and use a wire not white gray or green for the traveler you probably want it to work not be wired correctly there is a difference
how many times do people need to post different paragraphs and pictures all saying the same thing
  i dont know the difference between using a voltage meter a voltage detector or ohmmeter     of course everything you dont understand is the same dont you have some electronics to fix until it stops working
i want to make a translucent red/orange grip for a revolver ala bladerunner    what would be the best way to do this
  also this is the revolver id be making the grip for
  make a silicone mold of the current grip split it into two halves partially fill a half with clear epoxy push the inlay into the epoxy and hold in place with some jig once its partially set fill the mold the rest of the way with epoxy
  this but urethane over epoxy i make car lenses out of them for a living let your mould set properly though dont be retarded
    would these materials be available at a generic hobby store
  try the darkweb
  hey thats not very helpful 
  pics more description is it a factory job or u custom 1 offs i want to diy my own quality light bars and headlights hidden in my grill
  checkout these sites lots of resources on blade runner stuff      
    try using hard polyurethane resin you get the mechanical properties of a hard thermoplastic but can mold it at home and its uv resistant unlike epoxy resin     this site has a methodology for very small precise parts they include suggestions for transparent/translucent pieces and color additives     
pls no booly    i tried 
real shit go look up cosplay guides on how to make props thats exactly what youre gonna need here theres some cosplayer named punished props who has a pdf on how to do exactly this  basically  make the master of what you wanna cast in resin usually sculpted from chavant    make silicon mold theres a bit of technical stuff you gotta do to avoid air bubbles and it might take a few casts  do your resin pour  clean up finished product or re pour if it came out bad    they use this process for exactly what you wanna do fake weapon parts etc except you just wanna make a cosmetic part for a real weapon
  also if you wanna offset the cost of it you could probably cast several grips from the same mold and sell it
  a cnc router
  here is what i would do   make a silicone mould of the original grip drill holes in the old one to the depth you want to take off in a whole bunch of places probably wont be able to take off the same amount all over go to work with a rotary tool abrasive cylinder to grind it down using the bottom of the holes as a guide to how deep to go trying to preserve the original shape as much as possible center it in the mould cast 2 part acrylic around it
update    i created a mold out of the grip and now im gonna pour some resin in and see how it turns out
  congratulations you made a fleshlight
  are you going to have sex with it
    you are actually one of the few anons that actually made something during the thread do not let others bring you down
micarta dyed orange
  pink solo slut i fill you up
  good op but you should watch several videos about using urethane resin before pouring there are techniques that help prevent bubbles in your casting that you can use
    well i didnt watch any videos about that and bubbles ended up being a problem    that being said as a proof of concept it turned out well i just need to improve my technique
  the inside part of the mold/grip got bent so its all wonky and offset
  not only did the bubbles cause issues throughout the entire grip they also bubbled to the top and created a big pocket it still fits and screws into my revolver though    good experience and definitely a lot of lessons learned for the second run
  good work anon
  ive seen people create a slight vacuum for degassing by putting acrylic/plexiglass over top of a container and some kind of small vacuum pump
  i agree good work anon
  whats a good vacuum pump to get    theyre pretty pricey so i want to get something good
mold take two less bubbles edition
  i want to see how it looksssssss
  bump
well boys ive had success and massive failure    the model itself was in much much better conditions at first very little amount of air bubbles it didnt shift at all so it was a perfect fitting replica and the color turned out much better    unfortunately the resin didnt cure in the time it was supposed to and the thin top part of the grip was only partially cured resulting in a catastrophic failure
  conquered the bubble problem to the best of my abilities without a vacuum pump but i guess i should wait for more hours past the maximum wait time for the resin to cure
  make a 2 part mold with fiberglass also you can place your resing in warm place/hot water to minimise the bubles before use
  well good job making it anon unfortunate that it didnt cure fully
      you just need to let the resin cure inside of a pressure vessel   you can use a pressure cooker with a needle valve and pressure gauge or one of these crappy paint pots from harbor freight but any vessel that can hold 40psi will work fine        using a small mold wont require any modification to the pressure pot so as long as you are careful about not spilling any resing inside you can probably use it to make your one part then return it
      part of your problem is that the act of pouring the resin into the mold is going to result in trapped air inside your part you either need a vent sprue in spots where you are trapping air in the mold cavity or you need to mix your resin inside of a large disposable syringe and pump it into the mold from the bottom or an area where air entrapment is likely to be the worst mold orientation relative to the fill point is important    you also need extra headspace above the actual mold cavity so that once the mold is filled the extra resin in the reserve volume helps to continue pushing air out of the mold as the part cures    once you fix the above issues use a pressure pot and fill the mold effectively you will get much clearer parts out of the process bjb has some helpful videos on the subject    
  i think i can salvage it itll still fit on the gun i just need to let the rest of it dry maybe sand down both sides equally and sand the side that didnt cure and itll look passable      would that do the same job as a vacuum chamber and get all the bubbles out if so that seems like it might be perfect since i simply dont have the assets to make my own vacuum chamber and complete sets are expensive
  can you polish it see if that makes it shinier  the opaqueness makes it look like hard candy
  yes i can polish it the texture of the actual grip is what makes it opaque
  would that do the same job as a vacuum chamber and get all the bubbles out  no you use vacuum if the resin is compatible with it to pull bubbles out of the resin when mixed prior to pouring it not all resin systems are compatible with vacuum and frankly i found that the vacuumpulling step was a waste of cure time that could have been used to be more careful during the pour or was a bandaid that was preventing me from doing a better job of planning out my molds    pressure helps to crush any remaining bubbles or ones that result from gas generation during the cure down to a size so small as to be invisible 40 psi will shrink bubbles to 1/40th their original size the pressure also helps push the resin into places that it wouldnt otherwise reach due to surface tension
  not all resin systems are compatible with vacuum and frankly i found that the vacuumpulling step was a waste of cure time  i forgot to note here that vacuum is much more useful and essential for getting bubbles out of the silicone when making the mold if you dont do this with silicone molds and later use them for pressure casting the pressure can pop bubbles in the mold even after it has cured and if those bubbles are near your mold cavity they can become abnormalities in your cast parts that make them hard to remove from the mold or require postwork of your cast parts in order to remove them
  ok nice then it seems like a pressure vessel would solve the the rest of my problems
bump for update
bump
ive been tracking this on /k/ and i wanted to tell you that i love what youre doing i appreciate that someone is actually taking the time to make something up and i fucking love blade runner  godspeed anon
resin
bump 4 update
  make holes where bubbles accumulate so the resin goes up them too when you end pouring the resin shake the table to move bubbles to the top i would also reccomend you to use a slowcuring resin to give it more chance to get the bubbles out
  sexy
waiting for v3
grip anon here i got the hogue grip and i have a shipment of silicon rubber coming today so i can make a mold for the new grip    ive been in the field for the past 3 days so i havent been able to work on the project at all
  we moldin now boiiii
  i await your grips  did you figure out the resin coloring  the grip on the deckard blaster is close to a deep solid color tortoise shell
  im going to figure out the right color tonight while this mold cures
  towards achieving the color patterning  make a few cups of resin instead of one big batch if you only have one color dye use a different amount for each cup if you have different color dyes even better start pouring the different color resins into your mold maybe tilt the mold around so you get a little more flowing and less just stacking layers of resin   thats the best i can figure anyhow polish the end product too maybe coat with clear resin to get a really glossy finish
  i have red blue and yellow dye so ill probably do what one anon said and mix lots of yellow some red then a tiny bit of blue to get that brownish amber hue i will definitely polish the end result if its worth polishing grip 20 never fully cured so i need to make sure to mix everyone completely and equally
inspired by op im copying him with a different funs grips been posting on /k/ too but ill post updates here    tldr heres my mold after a few days of curing and cleanup
heres my second resin test for color was working out bubble control
and heres the mold filled up before smushing earlier today need another 1218 hours cure time
  what dye did you use
  castin craft epoxy resin transparent amber on amazon in various concentrations the last mix was a lot like 45 drops in 100g resin though anon shitting on epoxy and shilling polyurethane  has me thinking about trying that if these dont come out solid enough idk if ill need a different type of dye for that
  thats actually pretty cool  good work  what caliber is the gun and how do the new grip hold up to the recoil 
  believe adam savage walked through this for his bladerunner gun build on tested on youtube 
  well this is new a picture of your handguns without the filco keyboard
  38 special i havent tested the resin grip in a live fire yet but it feels pretty solid that specific grip may not hold up simply because the back of the grip is thin rubber for a recoil dampener and that translates into a thin hard section of the resin the hogue grip should be a better grip overall to mold
  looking very much forward to an update on the hogue mold  maybe a short webm of test firing it 
  i will definitely test fire once the first version is complete
man i want to peel this open like an old scab its so alluring    but the resin on the outside is still flexy and its accepting fingerprints i dont wanna wreck it also no bubbles at least on the outside    one more day to cure      its not a keyboard thread posting a keyboard would be off topic
  make sure you let it cure all the way its not worth jumping the gun cause it could fuck up the mold itself    also pocket pussy grip mold pt 2
  fuck off faggot      taking the g10 grip out was like giving birth the grip isnt called pirhanna for nothing that shit took a layer of my knuckle off trying to pull it out the mold is looking pretty good though hopefully the textured pirhanna grip didnt take a chunk out of the grip    also  ribbed for my pleasure
  thats the weirdest looking fleshlight ive ever seen    i have to wonder how stable the inner part is going to be during casting if it likes to move around you might have to make a new mold with supports in it    also depending on your resin you might have been able to cut a wavy seam down the side which would make it easier to demold
  its worked so far with the other molds i just need to make sure its all flat
shouldve been more careful with mixing it i really should get a pressure pot    24 hours and we got grip v3
  post pics
  this
    clear acrylic epoxy resin    heat gun    tooth pic
  best get a little thump barrel or f for pump
  any car ac vacummn pump is fine
a pressure pot is more what you want to use to remove bubbles you just need something that can go to 50psi or so    you could probably modify a thrift store pressure cooker into one
  you afraid of a little carbon fiber mesh go for strength
  what a loser this is an easy diy project no need for that
welp    at least there are no little bubbles
the detail is great
  looks delicious
but despite the manufacturer claiming it cures hard as a rock this stuff is not very stiff at all    even my older test batches are still bendy i need to try again with some urethane or somethin harder
  you might have added too much dye that can cause curing issues
  if it cant be orange then the whole projects a bust    gotta find another resin or urethane that hardens properly and i think it needs more red this looks like lego ice planet
  you might have to mix your dye your self or use a more concentrated dye
  that looks badass good job anon
  nice
i want to get in on the action too what other guns would look good with bladerunner grips
  just replace everything with colored plastic until it looks like a nerf or nothing then slowly remove the most offending bits until youre left with cyberpunk
  its my filco nigga  n i c e
here we go bois we bladerunner now
  resin cured properly and is hard
  this is where the mold itself was poured    i have to shave off the bottom and drill a hole where the screw will go to secure the grip
  the color turned out to be a nice dark amber there are a lot of small bubbles which isnt ideal but its a great first version    im gonna polish it and clean up some of the edges and itll all look like the bottom
  ooo  wow my dick got hard
  very nice stuff with that design it would be a little more difficult but there is a smoothing method for 3d printed stuff that makes rough prints smooth if you dont mind losing some detail it may be worth looking into
  polish that bad boy up and invest in a pressure pot to get rid of those bubbles
  the actual grip has that texture so i just have to polish it out once i get all the bubbles out and polish im gonna make a mold of that so all the new grips will be smooth
  i like your color better than mine but more importantly apparently your hardness wasnt affected which dye are you using and how much
  based based aaaahhh god bless you anon its beautiful
  too bendy i think it might be advantage in shock absorption for the recoil and whatnot
  its just red blue and yellow dye from michaels i took one anons advice and added a drop of blue to lots of red and yellow it was like 10
  there was about a 30 chance my advice would have ended in disaster and im glad it didnt
  clean futuristic icyberpunk      grungy old bladerunner cyberpunk
heres a progression pic
  also i think its worth noting that the resin grip is much lighter than the original hogue grip
i need to find a better way to take cyberpunk pictures
    i am so much stealing this pic
  goddamn it anon stop making me want to buy an lcr
  hit the grip with some light
  it looks great though it doesnt immediately strike me as cyberpunk i think adding an aluminum base like the picture in op would push it over the edge though either way looks good lets hope it handles shooting well
  its was a shot of black tho
  im glad to see it work out dude i saw your thread on here when you first posted and immediately figured you were just another retard that had a kinda cool idea and zero skill to deliver  i was planning on stealing your idea and making fun of you for failing while posting results but youre totally on the right track as some other anon suggested adding an aluminum base to the grip would help complete the look    also im still going to steal your idea good luck with any future refinements
  ahh sexy beast when do you test fire it 
  thanks i think im fine with other anons ripping off my idea i never would have done this if anyone else actually made grips like this i only did it out of necessity      i have to drill a hole first so i can secure it to my gun will be going shooting on saturday so i plan on having it done by then
    decided to just do it now its a rough test but i was able to actually attach and secure the grip so its a success to me this angle also gives a good look at what the rest of the grip will look like once polished
  soo many bubbles  nice work still
  i was wrong a vacuum chamber should get most of these bubbles out assuming you have a slow enough work time
    ya i wasnt as careful about how i stirred the resin for this one but they wont be as noticeable once i polish it i was more worried about mixing it enough since my last grip didnt cure all the way i really need a vacuum chamber or something so that i can properly mix and not have any bubbles
  keep in mind working time when dealing with vacuum chambers it takes a few minutes to degas the resin and if youve only got like a 10 minute window to work with that shit may harden under a reduced atmosphere with bubbles still in it  pressure pot shrinks the bubbles to levels that may be unobservable while a vacuum removes the atmospheric pressure so the bubbles grow huge ideally theyll rise up and out of the mold but could get trapped  best results is to vacuum out as much bubbles as possible then pressurize the bastard so any remaining trapped air is tiny as fuck if just using a vacuum chamber make sure you release the negative pressure to shrink any remaining air back down to normal levels before the working time of the cast is up    also most casting material fizzes up when under negative pressure so have a tall barrier to funnel it all back into the mold when its done degassing the volume of casting material will generally shrink when normalized so be sure to have extra material in the reserve funnel trimming off extra cured material is always easier than than adding more to a cast that wasnt completely filled
i tried another cast of undyed resin and its just as bendy as the dyed stuff it feels like hard wax or a jolly rancher or something so this art n glow clear resin is not good for this purpose i have some smoothon task 9 urethane coming well see how that stuff does hopefully it isnt a tradeoff of rigidity for controlling bubbles    but i discovered that icy clear grips look pretty frigging cool on this fun i bet it would look really good in blue too
  maybe you got a bad batch i believe if they go too far past their shelf life they can have curing issue
i imagine a magnetic stirrer would do you guys some good  i think these things dont really introduce air into the mix
damn anon these look great keep it up
  smoothon task 9 urethane  what is something that has the strength of task9 with a more clear coloration than amber   pls respond
any recommendations for polishing
  sandpaper and polishing paste
trying again with smooth on task 9 urethane and smooth on so strong urethane dye orange only for now pot life is only 7 minutes so no time for progression pics but its in there    this stuff is much less viscous than the art n glow epoxy resin so no bubbles formed at all during mixing and what few bubbles appeared when pouring were taken care of with a lighter though i forgot to check for bubbles against the mold at the bottom crap i also think i might have overdyed it crap too late now      task 9 is the clearest urethane i could find its not perfectly clear but its barely tinted it wont look icy like  though
cure time for this stuff is only 1 hour though im going to postcure in the oven for 4 hours as suggested
    cant wait to see the finished product
im excited about the possibilities of this stuff its at least 5 times harder already than the art n glow epoxy was after a 3 day cure    ill keep going until i either run out of this stuff or get a bubble free grip
  best advice
the color looks great also this stuff is super hard it feels like the factory grips    now i just need to learn to control bubbles without pressure
  those look bretty good
  getting there
  polishing translucent parts is a bitch best to make a mold over something already very well polished generally a couple clear coats of spray paint will smooth out the surface enough for a pretty good molding surface  if thats out of the question a rubbing compound is your best betbut will likely deposit itself into little details and be difficult to clean out    an idea would be to use a tooth brush to grind a very fine polishing compound all over the grips and use that same toothbrush to clean the part under running water
  looks like some bubbles formed when you put on the top of the mold you might want to make a hole in the side that you can pour the resin into instead
  gonna try degassing
  i may have to another grip set is curing now if it has bubbles after i tried to reduce them and saw none before squishing then i have one more thing to try heating the mold up before pouring ive just read that differential heat can cause bubbles and this urethane gets hot if that doesnt work then ill have to find a maker space or something because im not gonna spend 300 on equipment
  if you crank the speed up high enough theyll blend air into your mix just like a regular blender     also they are very easy to make just glue some magnets onto a computer fan basically neodymium works best if you want it to be a hotplate too throw on a peltier
  it held up  said it before ill say it again  good work there 
  whats a maker space youre in portland right
man i just dont get it there are no bubbles when i close the mold the big bubbles i get thats me trapping air the little bubbles just show up on the surface several times more on the back side of the panels than the front      yeah there are several here a maker space is building with tools for rent tldr
  im in portland too so i guess ill check one out and see if i cant get my hands on a pressure tank
  big bubbles turn into small bubbles as the resin heats up and reacts with the heating up material youll never get a totally bubble free surface with a 2 part mold alone even vacuum degassing youll probably always have that issue
  gotta find another resin or urethane that hardens properly  alumilite performance 80d        with only a drop or two of their fluorescent orange dye    
  there are no bubbles when i close the mold  many resin systems generate gas while they are curing also your mixed resin has lots of bubbles in it that you cant see that are from the mixing process these consolidate into each other to form larger bubbles during the curing time the only way to cast perfectly clear parts is to use vacuum or pressure i found pressure to be more reliable and has wider compatibility with resin systems of varying kinds
  how to remove bubbles from curing epoxy  1 start with dry precursors if you can keep water out of your monomers water will absorb into both especially the amine hardener  2 after mixing degas in a warm vacuum chamber the heat keeps the resin fluid and allows entrapped air to leave dont degas for too long however or it will cure before you cast  3 cast into warm dry molds store the molds above 100 c to keep water from absorbing into them slowly fill to avoid trapping air  4 once cast put the entire mold into a heated vacuum chamber and pull out all the air and shit you have in your resin  5 cure slowly    i can try to answer any other questions you have about epoxies or polymers in general
bump 4 update
i stopped trying with urethane the little bubbles cant be controlled without vacuum or pressure very frustrating    the art n glow is significantly more rigid when used with the so smooth dye than it was with the chink dye i used the first time so thats what im sticking to the color is better redder too i found out i can patch big bubble holes with fresh epoxy so thats what im doing    i tried to polish both the urethane and epoxy with flitz and nah thats not going to work so when i get a set thats bubble free or bubblerepaired itll be frosted and im doneski    once i have access to a vacuum or pressure pot ill try some more with the urethane
  speaking of a pressure pot just converted this pressure tank for resin molds    unfortunately i live in an apartment in the city so i cant run the air compressor at night since its so fucking loud but ill start the next mold tomorrow morning then ill be gone all weekend so ill hopefully ill have a nice surprise once i get back
  these materials and coloring agents are available from online suppliers i would probably opt for the urethane over epoxy
good enough for now
  thats really cool dude
  very nice
bump
  damn thats sexy
bump for update
  it looks like a water pistol
grip anon here    sorry for such a long delay im missing one go damn bolt needed to create a seal on the pressure tank and ive been trying to find it but for the life of me i cant get the size right    shouldnt be too long for me to get this done but ive been busy i will finish this project i promise you all
  and i think it needs more red this looks like lego ice planet  heh
whats the best way to silence an air compressor i dont want to get evicted
  atf on their way god speed to your doggo
  kek
use a blowtorch to heat the resin as it sets to get the bubbles to raise to the surface theyll pop under the heat of the flame

this is one of the best threads ive seen in a long time good job guys    great book
since this is the designated mold thread i have a few questions im working on making some shift knobs that are oem replicas but with steel cores to increase the weight im planning to cast the epoxy around the steel core its going to be black so im not too worried about bubbles but how can i make sure the epoxy bonds well to the steel i was thinking of drilling holes protips appreciated
  rough up or cut grooves into the steel maybe
  good job op looks great maybe nexttime try to use a degassing chamber then you will get rid of most of the bubble i love the look of it
  fucking transparent ice chainsaw boye    godspeed to you
  shoulda put it in a vacuum chamber to suck the air out of it that was added when you mixed youre gonna have a shitload of bubbles mate
  you should run a sander with no sandpaper on it right after you pour it so that the bubbles all rise out     that is to say your fleshlight should vibrate
  thats where you are
  if this stuff is urethane can you not polish it up with a quick acetone bath rather than hand polishing i dont know myself but i do know thats how some folks clean up acrylic lathed parts
  in the field for 3 days  what did he mean by this
    its a racist reference ignore it
i live in noguns land but you guys make me wanna buy an airshit gun so i can try this myself
i bought an lcr cuz of this thread
  i think he is military and he has been doing training exercises thats what in the field most commonly means
holy fucking shitballs batman this is incredible     i have an old model 10 revolver with peeling nickle finish and a blued cylinder now yall got me thirsting for some sick translucent grips goddamn
  sandblast grind or otherwise rough up the surface as  said    but a different way to do it that might be easier if its an irregular shape or you have a lot is to etch it in an acid bath nitric acid and alcohol godspeed
  almost a month and no update brah whats up
is there a way to turn goldpainted plastic into looking like antique gold/brass    i guess the question is can i stain goldpainted plastic    pic related
just paint over it
  sure you can stain it with paint
    i was thinking more in terms of shoe polish to stain it irregularly but i guess it wont stick    will painting plastic not look bad though paint streaks
  you said yourself its already painted gold do you think it looks bad does it have paint streaks   shoe polish  i dont even
  just dip it into a brass paint no streaks no mess no getting high off shoe polish
  see pic i unfortunately will not be able to dip anything will also be hard to spray paint      well painted and painted factory coloring and my dumb ass with a brush feels like different things
  do you think those pieces dont come apart
  they dont unfortunately
  youre fucked then just eat that shoe polish and be done with it
  just think about what antique brass looks like  marred dented scratched and if its not polished then it has a oxidized patina  replicate the look with overspray of other appropriate colours  would be best to use one of those tiny little modelers paint sprayer  in order to learn about the tools and techniques for this type of detail painting go study model painting
  youll never get painted plastic to look better than painted plastic
  pretty much this desu
    what do you guys mean
  unless you have the kind of intricate technical model paint detailing and crafting skills shown here   painted plastic just looks like painted plastic trying to make it look like legit aged brass is going to be damn duce difficult
  masking tape airbrush    failing that rubnbuff maybe a little fine sanding to get it to stick
  stop trying to scam people on etsy  just fucking make something hipsters will buy damn near anything handmade no need to rip people off
  wtf i just want to repaint a bottle for me do you think id be this autistic over a color choice if it wasnt even for me
just a general sharpening question whats the best range of whetstone grits to buy to get a blade shaving sharp thanks
  600 1000 1500 anything more is autism
  get a decent 1k and 5k but the naniwa specialty stone is what is going to be what makes it shave ready just buy it dont argue
technique  gear    a coarse stone 300 a fine stone 600 and a leather strop with polishing compound are all you need the rest is all about keeping a consistent edge angle dont be ashamed to use a jig if your freehand skills suck    unless you are doing a literal shaving razor then more is justified
    i use 120 320  600 then i have a strop on a glass strip with taped 1500 sandpaperi rarely change it so its very worn off on one side and paper with polishing compound on the other side if i want it a bit finer after the 600 i pass it on makita 1500 and then to the strop  and if its a kitchen knife after 300 i directly go to the strop
start with a norton ib8 and get fucking good with it once you can shave arm hair without scraping get a finer stone    it is a waste of money to buy stones before you develop technique when sharpening you receive a constant stream of feedback from the stone and all stones give different feedback  you will know what you need once you can make use of it
the key is using a strop you can even just use a basic sharpening stone like the puck ones on amazon more important is getting your angles right which depends on the blade to get good at this use a sharpie on each side of the edge of the blade and slowly change the angle until the sharpie starts to get rubbed off and get used to keeping your hand at that angle then use a strop and use it after every use of your blade to keep it as sharp as possible and decrease the need to use the stone
  get yourself a high quality ferro rod it will keep youre knoife sharp as your starting fires on weekend outings
    i always use figurative shaving razors am i doing it wrong
  no its fine as long you have a figurative beard
grits are not standard across stone types    water stones have an inflated grit number or oil stones have a deflated grit number whichever you prefer this means a 15k waterstone is roughly equivalent to a 3k ruby ceramic oil stone a black arkansas is in this range as well sandpaper also has inconsistent grit rating but where it lies depends on which country standard the manufacturer follows     stropping creates a micro serration this is for knives/razors only for chisels/handplanes/etc you want either a very fine stone or lapping film on a hard surface do not use polishing compound its not for sharpening stropping compound is only good if the manufacturer has it at a specified micron dont strop on a buffing wheel either all that bad shit will only improve an edge if you sharpened wrong in the first place    that said the minimum i would recommend for a homeowner is actually simple and gives you a decently sharp blade without autism  a powered grinder with coarse wheel whatever you can get for cheap if that means the first you find is an old cranked grinder at a flea market then get that you dont need to bust out the cc for a tormek if you pay attention make sure it has a usable tool rest protip dont quench hot tools in water unless you can dunk them tangfirst you can cause micro cracking which will make the thing dull quicker as you use it just swap to a different tool while that one air cools    a coarse norton crystolon stone  a medium norton india stone  and a reasonably flat brick the same width/length flatten one with the brick then flatten them against each other you need 3 stones for it to work    if you have no selfcontained work area like living in an apartment get a bd workmate so you can do it outside on a relatively stable surface extension cord and small enough grinder if youre close to ground level cranked grinder if youre sol on that regard    please hold small items to the grinder using locking pliers and wear ppe
as other anons said dont go full autistic get a coarse one and a fineish one or if you dont plan on restoring much get a double sided one mediumfine and low grit sandpaper when you are establishing bevels and repairing tools    tough for water and oil stones be really autistic about flattening them dont wait till they get dished flaten them after heavy use and/or/if/when starting and ending sharpening srly they are a bitch to re flatten ask me im fixing an old one i used before buying my chinesse diamond plates
just hold the fucking thing straight and dont overdo it    the more you sharpen it the more you round dull it    hold at a bit under a 45 degree angle and swipe flip over swipe check edge    usually i do this about 3 times    im assuming you mean honing and not actually sharpening which is a little more involved
  everything in this post is wrong and the poster is an obvious idiot you would do well to ignore it
  the more you sharpen it the more you dull it
  do you have any experiance sharpening knives op if not then just buy the cheapest whetstone you can find and practice practice practice sandpaper works pretty well as well especially 600 grit and higher
  that shitty chinesium cordwrapped tanto  that makes me more angry than the ferro rod
  how do i flatten/resurface oil stones  i have an old white translucent stone and a black arkansas stone that are currently unusable
  the more you sharpen it the more you round dull it  
  all of them
  thread reminded me i needed to flatten my stones    dont buy a flattening stone they are all shit they wear out too fast and then you have to flatten your flattening stone just pick up a piece of granite and some 220grit mark your stone with a pencil and rub it back and forth until all pencil marks are gone you can bevel the edges if you want but these are for my straight razors what are you sharpening if its just kitchen knives i just use my belt sander with 1000grit belt super fast and easy
  how do i flatten arkansas stones
      you need 3 surfaces a b and c a is your stone b and c are flattening stones which can just be big enough bricks flattish rocks or one being a different stone dont buy a flattening stone for oil stones theyre for waterstones rub b and c together until reasonably flat rub a and b together until reasonably flat rub a and c together until completely flat you need to have a common plane between 3 surfaces using only two will make one concave and the other convex even sandpaper on glass will wear unevenly and cause issues    this is how a surface plate is made by the way they just do it with granite or cast iron    if one is seriously dished like the old one in picrelated you will need to grind it down on the sidewalk or something til the points of contact are not so narrow then you can go as before    you dont want to do this with belt grinders/sanders btw since it will kick up a shitload of dust and load the belts real quick      flattening stones are for water stones and you need to flatten them for the reason i said before theyre grooved because water stones wear very quickly and the grooves allow the slurry to escape i am not a fan of water stones because of how quickly they wear down they do cut pretty fast but thats a minor issue compared to spending so much time flattening them in between
  pretty much what  said id get the cheap sharpening stone from hf and just go to town rubbing them together if your arkansas stone is really fucked up untill it is pretty flat then finish it with the granite and sand paper method you can wet sand it in the tub or sink just make sure the sandpaper is wet sandable lots of elbow grease
  funny you mention that the hf/dollar tree/discount oil stones are actually serviceable in and of themselves the catch is they require you to soak them in at least an entire bottle of mineral oil for days so theres a hidden cost behind them and the size is kinda shitty if you dont do that they clog real easy not worth compared to a proper stone
  220 grit isnt going to do shit just get some 60grit diamond lapping plates from china
  what do you suggest leather or intestine
    220 isnt going to do shit    i posted a pic of all my stones just i flattened with 220 grit
  lapping plates work great i wont name mine unless asked because i have had several and they all seem to work well with mildly varying degrees of durability corrosion and surface efficiency some take slightly different techniques to be most efficient with but its pretty simple in all ive used i will say that ive never used a sub 50 one aside for the fact that they were much cheaper than that when i first started sharpening as a kid so i cant vouch for those i avoid them because i have used honing rods with similar surfaces to the cheaper lapping plates and those like to wear out stupidly fast
  i sharpen my swiss army knife with the victorinox branded field sharpener has sharpened other knives with no issues     no need to get fancy anon just use what you find works
diamond plates
  only dmt or diaflat are worth it the exception is if youre just sharpening utility/camping/standard kitchen knives which dont need 100 flat exactness they wear out faster than oilstones but you will never see some people talk about it because the durability difference is on the magnitude of decades oilstones cost less up front and while you do have to buy mineral oil you should have it anyway for cutting boards lubricating foodcontact machines and as a general purpose safe oil    diaflat will last up to 5 years or so depending on use  dmt will last up to 15  cheapos maybe 3 years  oilstones depending on thickness can outlive you as long as you keep them flat and dont drop them    diamond plates will gradually cut slower and finer as the diamonds wear down dmt uses monocrystaline which means they break down at a slower rate than diaflat or the cheapos i dont know about how good nortons diamond plates are
  stropping creates a micro serration this is for knives/razors only for chisels/handplanes/etc you want either a very fine stone or lapping film on a hard surface do not use polishing compound its not for sharpening stropping compound is only good if the manufacturer has it at a specified micron dont strop on a buffing wheel either all that bad shit will only improve an edge if you sharpened wrong in the first place    this woodworking nigga  uses strop and compound for his chisels and planes
  everybody makes mistakes
  i use 325 coarse and 1200 extra fine diamond plates from dmt on all my chisels plane irons and knives plus stropping with green compound they work great
  paul sellers is a great guy but hes not correct on everything hes wrong on sharpening what a modern at least cap iron/chip breaker does and he claims cast iron planes will flex when you try to flatten them if theyre not done assembled    here is a sharpening autist that goes into way too much work for a perfect woodworking edge     he also compares different steels  i dont follow all his shit because going through loads of lapping paper isnt in my interest but i will never strop my tools again     the proof for this was in a video by a guy called plane collector on youtube but he went on a big hiatus and hid his whole channel on plane restoration a year or so ago 
  to clarify cast iron plane soles do not flex if assembled or not so you can take them down or put them together to lap them it makes no difference
  treated leather will hold up longer before rotting
    wat is shagreen
  it depends  first off grits are not standardized among countries so you cant say a 1000 grit is the same for an arkansas stone a japanese wetstone or a piece of abrasive paper it varies a lot even among brands and for high grits its wild west    this said do you want a set to mantain already sharp knives sharp or to restore dull or damaged blades  in the first case a single combo wetstone like an 800/1600 or 1000/3000 and everything in between and a strop is all you need of you dont have leather a piece of denim make a very good strop  in the second hypothesis you need to add something like 150 or lower to restore geometry and something around 400 to prepare the blade for the sharpening in this range you might consider getting diamond stones they stay flat cut fast and last long if well built a good and not very expensive brand is ezelap
    depends grit sizes mean different things for different kinds of stone     diamond dmt anyone try ultrasharp see pic     arkansas see dans whetstones the site has an explanation basically all novaculite has the same grit size and the difference is the density of how the grains are packed     waterstone start with norton thats what people usually mean when they say grit shapton if you have tons of cash     scarysharp wet/dry sandpaper in various grits plus a piece of plate glass and some spray glue you need to go to higher grits w sandpaper than a waterstone     get a sharpening jig id start with scary sharp and master that once youre used to it youll know what to go with theyll all work its just a balance of speed/convenience/money for oil and especially waterstones youll need to flatten the stone to fight dishing usually via a diamond lapping plate     i prefer diamond stones they last forever in my case 12 years so far dont need to be trued and only require water sellers suggests windex 325 to create or recreate the bevel if necessary then 600 and 1200 then strop usually start with just the 600 theres a medium extra fine 4000 plate that i want to try the plates are all good to within a thou i dont see the point of the lapping plate thats good to half that when its so much more      dont worry about stropping yet just get the basics down
    get a coarse diamond plate and use that it will stay flat
i mainly use a cheap 400/1000 diamond plate and a dmt 8000 grit   something to consider is that the high hardness of diamonds make them to cut deeper than regular stones so the 8000 diamond actually produces a less smooth finish than a 3000 grit oilstone
  maybe you right but it helps that i see on video how his planes and chisels cut wood like a butter
  they cut wood he does it consistently so he gets a good edge most people are fucking awful at sharpening hence the seeing of gains from stropping     the advantage of using a super high grit stone or lapping film to hone your edge is that you barely if at all have to sand the piece after and the methods in the link above make it take very little time it also provides you with an assurance that your blade is evenly sharp all across and will reduce tearout in complex grain    it will also slash through the wood with greater ease
  fucking went full retard didnt ya  the more you sharpen it the more you round dull it  dont even try to wriggle yerself out of it  you said it there it is for all to see quoted and requoted  full retard in full view  hold at a bit under a 45 degree angle and swipe flip over  oh it gets worse 45 flip over 45 so if my math is right snicker snicker that should give you a noice 90  edge   please enlighten us all  what do you use that bit for no really i would almost pay to hear that  usually i do this about 3 times  during tools lifetime or there and then im not even sure if i should be asking   maybe perchance you were viewing /lgbt thread and though about an answer but somehow mixed it all up and posted it here
  forgot appropriate pic
can i just get an autism free answer whats the most efficient cost/knowledge/effort way to keep my kitchen knife sharp enough to cut vegetables and occasionally meat can i just buy like one or two whetstones from amazon in different grits and be like 10 away from perfect
  yes i kept my knives sharp for years with a single 300 grit stone     i learned by ruining a few dollar store knives that were made out of some sort of hard cheese and moved onto the good kitchen knives once i could cut a tomato with the shitty ones without cheating by leaving a burr    if you want low effort those work sharp machines are pretty nice     if you want zero effort just pay someone to sharpen them for you
  samurai shark or some equivalent
  if you want absolute efficiency then you just bulkbuy crappy knives and throw them out when they get dull nothing is more expensive than your time    a good balance is having 3 knives so you can rotate them out to get sharpened by a friend/neighbor at cost    you can get just a combination india stone to maintain your knives as long as you dont drop them and fuck up the edge or let them rust    absolute /diy/ efficiency is   since you can use them on all your knives and tools excepting serrated knives which you can get a little tapered diamond rod for you do sharpen your shovels dont you anon
  i have 400 1000 3000 6000 and 10000 you can do without the 6k and 10k which are meme tier unlike  says there is noticeable improvement up until 3000 so id suggest 400 1000 and 3000 as a starter pack at least thats what i did the 6k and 10k were a bs purchase
is this a good book  
  paying money to get a book on something very extensively covered on jewtube and blogs and forums
  i keep a double sided dmt 40micron/9micron in the kitchen all kitchen knives can shave all the time if gf gets overexcited and runs an edge against a plate or something its back to shape in seconds     theres really no point in bringing a kitchen knife any further unless youre a sushi chef same for pocket knives when you get into really fine grits the edge is so delicate its only useful for very specific work face shaving fine woodworking even there not always etc
    yes thats one of the two great classics
  starting a thread over something you should have googled  youre worse than a tripfag
couldnt sharpen a knife using a fucking guide  my mum had no problems freehanding it the first time  can i still call myself a man
  how much time did you spend trying
  can i still call myself a man  mommas little man
  youre adorable anon    more than she took for that one and all subsequent knives in all honesty i blame the guide it was for big knifes and used on a small one had the wrong angle
  but this was your first time trying sharpening i wouldnt worry about it keep trying no guide start with a paring knife and work your way up
im a brainlet so i use one of these because you cant fail with them

whats a cheap stone and strop combo for a literal straight razor
  bottom of a coffee cup for a stone the unglazed ring    a piece of fire polished tempered glass for a strop car door windows    
    same happened for me and my wife shit just happens practice eclipses talent given enough time
    be proud with your mom lol  with some practice you will learn too 
  the 12k chinese waterstone   it doesnt have a brand name and can be found a lot of places online    i paid 20 for an 8x3 one a few years ago      your a completely idiot
  as long as you have a strop ive been able to get a hair shave using a brick as my stone stropping is the most important part of sharpening imo
  thats worse than a coffee cup
just to chime in before anyone ruins a nice razor on a coffee cup or brick dont do it i dont know how the chinese water stones are but 20 years ago an 8k jap stone was considered ultra the old norton barber hones were a bit coarser but harder a lot of the natural stones coticule and such are coarse compared to modern super fine waterstone but still renowned among razor fags razor forums are full of sharpening autism     you should only have to hone lightly once or twice a year stropping before each use on a regular leather strop no abrasives ever on strop
  thats worse than a coffee cup    incorrect   it is a great natural stone albeit hard and slow and well documented online
what do you do for stone maintenance if anything faggot on jewtube says soft nagura stones used for cleaning the metal debris are best and you dont really need anything else
  most stones have a coarse side and a fine side should be fine for your purposes  if you wanted more of a straight razor experience you could look up how to set up a stropits unfinished leather like suede and you put a compound on it to make it finely abrasive
  most of the brands that sell stones sell maint stones that you rub against
  brands  my brand is chinkshit so i guess i should get   
  a better knife with a 90 degree spine
  can i just get an autism free answer whats the most efficient cost/knowledge/effort way to keep my kitchen knife sharp enough to cut vegetables and occasionally meat  dollar store water stone maintain the same angle as you try to slice thin pieces off of the stone
  when my water stones get dished out i use the shit out of them after i harden and temper a new knife im making i put sandpaper on a piece of glass and rub until they are flat
dear sharp bois i need your aid    i recently got into straight razor shaving and instead of buying a new one i asked my dad and he pulled an old one of his out and game it to me along with a strop and this old looking water hone however no matter how much i try to sharpen it on the stone it just doesnt seem to get sharp enough could the blade be too old or something wrong regarding the stone ive tried to follow guides online on how to sharpen it so i dont believe its from wrong technique
  how are you using the hone you want to lay the blade down so the spine is in contact as well as the edge and stroke edgefirst flip over keep the spine in contact and flip over the spine stroke flip stroke if the edge was abused this could take some time it should be able to slice a hair held in the air before going to the strop
  yes get a 240/1000 grit whetstone then strop on an old pair of jeans you can get and keep your knives razor sharp for 15 total
  ive been doing that but due to tue age of the blade and lack of use for so long iam guessing it might just need a lot more sharpening i also dont have any harder grit stones to start with before this one so for now ill keep hacking away with just this stone
    from this post it becomes clear that you dont know basic stuff about sharpening this is not an insult  and sharpening straight razors is even a bit more complicated than sharpening knives also you are asking for advice when there are so many good videos  where you can see how exactly its done     maybe you need to apex the edge on a bit lower grit and then hone it and strop it

    the guy asked of autism free answer  not turboautism one
  
  wow thanks for the tip buzzfeed
    dude i sharpen and make knives for living believe me  this is not a viable way to sharpen a knife the surface is so small that at the second pass with the blade it will be clogged with metal and it will stop removing material dont believe to everything you see on the retarded  life hack videos on the internet
  belt sander not a joke 300 motorized knife sharpeners are literally purposebuilt belt sanders with a guide to hold the knife at roughly the correct angle  get a cheap belt sander use a ceramic belt 150250 grit mount it to a bench hold the blade angle right and thatll be enough to cut your vegetables  people use belt sanders to sharpen chisels too
    i agree  its one of the fastest and easiest ways you only have to be careful with the overheating or over grinding
  harbor fright sells a 1x30 sander for 30    you can get a lot of different grits but personally i find two passes on 180 will bring back a dull but well maintained knife then i use a fine india or a hard arkansas to finish it off
with pre primed skirting do you reckon i could paint it with a spray can or do i have to use a brush im thinking hi gloss
also im installing it into brick with tile underneath im seeing mixed results on the best installation method any ideas
  why the hell would you want trim high gloss semi or flat is best its trim not a new car shit son
  semi or flat is best its trim not a new car shit son    nobody puts flat on trim son
  depends on if you want a crazy smooth finish youd typically do a real fine like 2000 grit sand between coats if using a brush but youll end up sanding through to the timber on the high edges of a skirting board like that rattle can will give you the smoothest finish assuming you layer it on properly if thats not an issue a paintbrush will be easiest
  youd typically do a real fine like 2000 grit sand between coats if using a brush    2000 200 is fine enough
  yeah typo my bad
  high gloss enamel gives it a nice pop and stronk against dings
  honestly it was more for time than anything          damn idk maybe flat would look nice too
  damn idk maybe flat would look nice too    flat is never used for trim because trim usually comes into contact with things like people brooms vacuums etc and flat paint is rough which makes it flat so it picks up dirt and scuffs and in general cannot be cleaned because the dirt or whatever is embedded in the nooks an crannies that make it look flat
typical interior house painting is   flat for ceilings   eggshell to semigloss for walls   semigloss to gloss for trim      youd typically do a real fine like 2000 grit sand between coats if using a brush  ive been in the construction business for over 20 years and ive never seen a painter sanding trim between coats of paint all sanding is done first then a couple coats of paint is put on i would imagine trying to sand fresh interior house paint which is probably latex would just gum up sandpaper instantly
  semigloss for walls    where do you live where in your 20 years you have seen semigloss on walls i can almost imagine it in a kitchen or bath but in my 20 years of painting ive probably put semi in one kitchen that had ancient wooden walls
i need a new 4gang box in my living room so im looking at old work boxes that screw into the sheetrock is this a good idea i expect to be plugging/unplugging things into the new outlet at least twice a day    also does it make any difference if i use plastic vs metal
  they hold fine plastic is better for newfags if youre scared of babbys first 120v shock just keep in mind on those blue plastic boxes you dont have much room for error in your sheetrock cut
  use the rework style if you cant cut worth a damn
    they hold fine    even with hospital rated plugs because thats all i got off a job to put in there
  get the new construction poly ones theyre like 2 bucks each at an electrical store they have nails that go directly into the stud and if that doesnt hold them put a couple of screws through the side into the stud
  if you can align one side with a stud and drive a couple drywall screws through the side of the box and into the stud youll be better off than just relying on the drywall clamps
  agreed put the most trafficked devices in the outlets closest to the stud
  just cut the drywall open attach it properly to a stud and a piece of wood on the other side and put the drywall back a little bit of drywall/tap/mud/paint is cheap and there is no way a 4 gang is going to hold with your caveman dick beaters jam things in and out all day
  right but how many recepticles will op need in one place i expect itll mostly be switches  on the weaker side
  this     get the thicc ass contractor box open the wall do it right patch the drywall back     it sucks but youll just end up doing that anyways when the fucking old work box fucks up the drywall i hate those fucking things
im a domestic maintenance plumber in and out of houses all day changing taps fixing leaks and the like last couple of days my firm has gotten me to rod some shit pipes a job usually sent to the ground workers i cant remember where i heard it but it someone told me it was against regs for us to be doing both those things/carrying around shitty rods alongside new taps in the same van     anyone know for sure
  cant tell you the regs but you shouldnt be carrying around shitty rods at all clean them up before packing up ffs you want a shitty van  i cant believe its allowed for you to rod drains at all if you dont know the first thing about it i mean i rod my own drains without formal training but i dont do it commercially huge risk of not just getting infected and poisoned but also suffocated by poo gas in confined spaces and fucking dying
    taa for that mate next time ill soak em all in bleach for 30 minutes and throw my uniform into a 90 degree cycle in the tenants washing machine
  you are in luck around christmas time go to bq get yourself a really useful long box for wrapping paper make sure your rods fit in it some do some dont fill it with cleaner of choice keep your rods in that  you should be spraying down with a hose as you remove them rubber gloves/gauntlets can get washed off too and bagged shouldnt need to boil wash your coveralls because realistically you shouldnt be getting covered in it
  were doin 12 jobs a day m8 ppreciate your help but it aint realistic to carry it or guarantee a clean van or person im lookin for the law and a paper to tell em to fuck that work off to someone else
  you work for a tenants agent or something get dynorod in and bill the tenant its not fucking hard to not flush nappies and tampons
  you need at least 3 licenses for that
im a contractor in minnesota if i can help you with any questions you have id definitely like to do so im currently building this house

alright minnesota anon riddle me this  lets say a hypothetical autist with no faith in the current fiat debtbased system wants to buy some land and build his own house and no not hire subcontractors to do all the shit for him i mean build his own house board by board nail by nail he knows hed have to become at least somewhat competent at things like landscaping and carpentry but he feels he doesnt have a full grasp of what all goes into building a house and it doesnt necessarily have to be of the same architectural sophistication as modern houses are hes content living in a simple sturdy rectangle what skills/concepts do you recommend he research to see if he can handle the full scope of building a house and can you offer any wisdom on being efficient with time and money during the process  this autistic anon has this idea because another anon from another board was bragging about how he did this himself and it was the greatest investment he had ever made and how he practically doesnt have to work since his property gained so much value from all the work he did on it it piqued his interest
  not op but honestly owning an old fixrupper small home taught me a lot about homebuilding just like owning a beaten up car got me into auto repair you could buy a regular house an older one that is low valued live in it fix it up slowly gain a bunch of experience so you dont fuck up your better home my current home is like a practice home at this point ive had a run doing everything from framing plumbing electrical gas hvac drywall cabinet building lots of shit have a roommate who has done contracting odd jobs and he does a lot of the woodrelated stuff but i am just a compsci fag and i do all the other stuff obsessively researching things reading some books reading the code books watching contractors argue on their forums etc is helpful there is very little i feel i could not do at this point though theres a bunch i dont want to do and it takes me longer to do everything    oh also living in the home you are remodeling is a huge pain in the ass so that part isnt great if you do this though you could just sell the house you remodeled in a few years and go build your own
i partied with some folks from minnesota the other day mfers know how to drink
  contractor  im building this house  im    kys jew
  lol what a faggot chillax bro
  you dont like it build your own fuckin house faggot

  not him but go to lowes buy a cuckshead book build cuckshed insulate and plumb and wire it throw cedar panels on it furnish it so it looks nice go to bank for land loan and to move cuckshead cabin innawoods pay off loan learn to garden and greenhouse
hello from the leech lake area   there is one wall in my garage that is not insulated do you have any tips on a way i can insulate it without taking down all the shelves work bench dry wall etc one guy told me you cant cut holes and blow in fill because of fire breaks inside the wall is that even a thing in a residential property on a garage exterior wall  id like to heat it with a propane wall heater so i can use it in the winter
  gotta go with this anyone from mn who isnt a somali is a jew
    what tips do you have for someone who wishes to become a builder in the future to preface this i went to college for a good program but i only went because of a its what you should do type of mentality my plan right now is to start small work for a year as a framer/carpenter while taking building code courses/exam at the end of it at the end of that year and hopefully passed code exam im going to use the money saved up to go hire a small crew and start taking up framing jobs and small renos i would rather be a manager/super of the crew i would use this crew to gain extra business skill solid contacts and more working capital after a couple years start building homes alternatively i could go back to school for an architecture engineering technology program 3 years full time and hopefully land a job somewhere    another question if you needed one what would you look for in a helper as someone who runs the contracting business i have solid organizational/managerial skill and decent business acumen but no formal construction education would you consider hiring someone to help you with the business side like deal with paper work check up on sites maybe fill in as an extra body etc how would i sell myself for a position like that    if you decide to answer bro that would help me a lot
  im currently building this house  so you arent building this house youre the middleman that skims off both parties and uses them to enrich yourself    insurance realtors bankers contractors all jew scum
  how many somalis can fit in that thing 
  if you cremate them and keep the windows open all of them
what are you looking for in a construction manager     residenshul lektrishun here
      kys bitch    i actually build the houses and i couldnt do my job as well if it werent for constructions managers they handle all the stupid social and organizational aspects of the joblike dealing with homeowners and and scheduling when trades should be in the house     the dude may not be building the house but hes adding value to society
  your scheduling assistant makes twice as much as you    kys bitch
  even one is too many
    go do another line in the portapotty concrete nigger
wats up with the plastic temp protection around the house doesnt look like it would hold up to wind / snow is that a midwestern thing why wouldnt you temp out the door openings
  a lot of the groundwork isnt even worth doing yourself renting the equipment will cost just as much if not more than paying a professional to do plumbing/hvac/electrical should be subbed out and probably isnt even legal for you to do but you could do the framing sheeting roofing insulating drywall mud taping sanding painting trim and cabinets doors windows flooring etc but some of these things will generally take you more time due to lack of experience and tools gonna have to rent a telehandler for the trusses probably gonna need an extra hand for those and standing the walls could pour the foundation yourself or build a wood one supposedly its much cheaper
  not a midwestern thing not sure why he did this
  nice mcmansion nice tyvek to choke out the already shitty osb panels nice crappy asphalt shingle nice crap quality of the house    nice mcconstruction
  did you get that picture from pol construction thread
  that plastic is string reinforced and if hung correctly very durable its common in both residential and commercial construction to use this for a variety of reasons such as keeping the work area dry and in colder climates when used in conjunction with a temporary heater it helps warm the worksite for painting and finishing jobs
  if you dont already have every tool you can think of its not worth your time if your end goal is just a house    ive been working on houses since i was 10 i can do everything but rough in the plumbing and electrical and install the heater/blower/ac units     if my father hadnt spent his life buying every tool he could find on garage sales i wouldnt be able to build houses     but even with all my experience i wouldnt ever consider building a house with anything less than 5 guys and thats after the roughing in and foundation being poured    start with something small like a treehouse with indoor plumbing and then realize that when you move to a house sized project the problems are exacerbated 10x    its easy to romanticize but with no experience or tools it would be soooo hard
  if this pic was any other wood it would be beautiful
  ive never seen anyone cope this hard    get a good paying job and better yourself you insufferable freak
      you can do it but the biggest point is take your time  few years not a problem if you have people and skills building your own house used to be the norm just few decades ago    that way you can build a proper house instead of dogshit overpriced mcmansion that will rot inside out within 20 years        
    yeah some architecture said but like  said any other wood would be beautiful alternatively if they stained it dark and changed the finishing i think it would look good
  if they stained it dark    a matter of taste to be sure but that place would be a dungeon if all that wood was very dark here in nc we get lots of jobs where people have grown tired of their old dark stained trim so the only alternative other than replacing it is to kilz it caulk the cracks putty the nails then two top coats of white paint that has a shot of black
  is that a condom for a house
  rate my trailer/ geuss my trade
  no idea    what the fuck is the shit on the left side
  well we wouldnt want it breeding would we
  that shits easy but i caught my house on fire twice as a kid and my best bro got grabbed up by 440 and melted    ill crawl under my house and fight snakes and plumbing but iboay my sister in law to install a ceiling fans    laugh all u want but guess who isnt getting electrocuted
  nice shitpost    faggot apartmentcuck
  shit bruh we built a 45 foot tall house by hand me and 4 bros put the trusses up with nailed together 2x4s and autism    people didnt believe us until i showed them pics    we used a tractor with forks and a lader on the forks to side it and my bro swung by his nuts 40 feet high while his 400 pound brother weeved 2x4s and was the couter weight
  agreed
  anyone whoes ever dealt with a crankbaddict subcontractor knows how dumb talking to them is
  fun fact ashes are just dried up bone dust and mixed with strangers
  siding of some sort bender looks like a pro3 but heavier made will probably bend steel trim stock
  i dont know who the fuck you think i am but i dont build shit faggot    i pay people to do that because after 25 years of franing i descided it was more fun to tell the framers wtf to do then play target practice with nail guns in the heat and snow    also just kys    reeeee other oeople have jobs    lol filthy fucking neet
  rent a foam sprayer will look like shit but who cares
  true    these idiots think that being a gc isnt a job when they have no idea how to run a business only the simple responsibility of having to dig a ditch or operate a nailgun or run conduit or do drywall all day    a lot of you tradesman may not understand because your job is only the one part of the house that you do over and over but there is quite a bit of problem solving as well as work that falls in between the cracks that needs to be done you dont have to worry about the logistics of anything that happens i could talk all fucking day about the things you dont understand because you think that roofing or stucco are the epitome of exerting yourself when youve never been intellectually challenged in your life
  the mixing is rare now too many people got caught doing it so now they try to keep that from happening
i want to build a 15x20 shed to work on my car/projects in during the hot summers/cold winters but i dont want to spend a lot of money or make it super permanent so i dont want to pour a concrete slab should i build a wooden foundation/floor or leave it bare ground
  make tutorials hombre use pens or pencils
  looks like a metal siding  gutter operation
  the green thing is an aluminum brake i use it make flashings    its is a 12 vanmark trimmaster    no gutters i dont like hanging them    if you said siding your right i make a living nailing boards to the outsides of houses
  i could talk all fucking day about  could you hit some high points  im getting to the point in this life where i think i could possibly make it as a gc
  son of a gc here the low points are high stress working with the state and fucked owners and inspectors upside seems to be having you own hours run costs through company and potential to make money  my dad and uncle got wrekt after the 2008 recession and as a smallish company didnt buddy up with the right people and ended up with a couple jobs here and there finally a dmv job fucked us over and 60yrs of a company is going under
tell me everything you know about the term hot mopping no googling
  at least somewhat competent at things like landscaping and carpentry  please dont try if you have this attitude  most guys on site can try their hand at other trades and the smart ones will say they wont touch electrics or gas  get qualified people to do your work reading a book wont make you a carpenter
  im wanting to get into spray foam and epoxy jacking im 38 and tired of playing cars 22 years in the auto industry ase certified tech now working parts any thoughts on learning the ins and outs of the trade
  that crap is not a trade its a boomer franchise pyramid sceme
  pyramid scheme how so
  well yeah you can do it that way but most people appreciate prefab trusses vs stick framing
  thats because any monkey can swing a hammer but dont talk to the monkeys about it because as far as they are concerned they are the hardest working fuckheads they know
  dont leave it on bare ground
  the money is in selling you the franchise equipment and supplies just like alpacas
  what fucking franchise im not looking at anything along those lines that would be s horrible model to slave under the reactor and chemicals are available straight from the manufacturer
  lots of gloves and spelling is shit   you work with metal
  i actually build the houses and i couldnt do my job as well if it werent for constructions managers    no wonder jews take advantage of you braindead faggots so well keep slaving away retard
    very jealous wish i had this i mean for a start just cleaning and making it weather tight would be a start
/b/rooklyn park fag here just swinging by to see whats up op seems cool good thread idea for a change
where can i get windows done for cheap as fuck in north metro
  mighty powerful color choice is there contrasting trim going up what material is going on the roof
  buy from menards and do them yourself then pay someone to finnish
  why are the vikings such a pathetic team
  all blue siding with white windows soffit fascia they used black 3tab shingles
    why arent the cornerboards white
  struct eng anon here im looking to make money providing plans and stamps in il    any tips for me
  not op but  you get a tar furnace tar and cover a shower pan with the hot tar you then plug the drain and do a leakdown test where you fill the shower with water and leave it overnight mainly done in california and a few parts of texas its a pretty cool process i saw an old timer do
  not what they wanted im a siding installer not a designer
how many illegals do you employ
  id take a job as a framer for at least a year before you do anything anon hands on experience will always trump a book for this kind of thing  it may take a year but if you have a friend who will play mexican its doable if you know what youre doing
  and also what other anons said youre gonna need someone to do groundwork for you at the very least
  i partied with some folks from minnesota the other day mfers know how to drink  we have to stay warm and deal with our shitty sports teams somehow    oh and ice fishing
  blue house  blue little windows    wheres the blue corvette
  why that and not rubber sheeting like normal
    why that and not rubber sheeting like normal  not the person you are questioning but id guess sheeting would be done in most cases where its a smoother surface and youre fitting a preformed fiberglass basin for your standard bathrooms hot mop if you want to seal up uneven or rough surfaces
  ayy lmao
  how much should i pay for two panels of drywall install and a 4x4 patch of ceiling plus paint ive got folks quoting me in the mid 600s and that sounds like a load of barnacles
  well imo i think it would work just as well the hot mop is an old school process that has been all but abandoned by everywhere except where i listed the guy i watched do it said that he didnt trust it or that he might not notice if it was punctured it seems like everyone has their preferences on how they waterproof showers      hot mop if you want to seal up uneven or rough surfaces  it probably works well for that too my house was built in the 40s so i think the previous pan was hot mopped too
  didnt trust the pvc sheeting
  dont know if op is still here but ill take any advice is getting into contracting worth it ive spent 10 years as a firefighter/paramedic and a handyman on the side and i did a lot of work as unskilled construction labor in high school where im moving to theres no good paramedic work already hooked up with my local volunteer fire department so ill have my fix what are some things i should know about getting into contracting
what do you think of this old house you still watch it
  i was on it
  some good info sometimes and good production quality but way too fake happy sales pitch bullshit
  you still watch it    yeah one of the apprentices is a qt grill
  you mean the one with all the brand new carhartt and festool outfit you know tommy is knee deep in that puss
  when
    love it
shame roger is dying of skin cancer

apparently we cant be trusted to use stanley knives in a maintenance environment this come after being told we cant use adjustable wrenches either
  safety sallies need to be hanged in the streets
  apparently we cant be trusted to use stanley knives in a maintenance environment  if the sentence we have had a number of accidents this year involving technicians being cut with knives during the course of completing normal routine tasks is anything to go by then no no you cant    why is this a thread
  technically were supposed to use pic related instead of any real blade its the only approved box cutter and theres rules forbidding real knoifes for safety and so we dont scare the normie customers its kinda retarded    i used to use a folding box cutter most of the time but now i carry a tiny fixed blade since it sits on my belt one less thing in my pockets and its super fast to take out and put away i try not to stab anybody with it but i still get funny looks    stupid people ruin everything
we have a similar policy we have to use auto retract stanley type knives or them weird fish shaped ones ironic we cant use stanley knives in a workplace that uses chisels saws and other bladed machines all the time all because one dipshit stabbed himself with one too
  isnt that blue font on red background a health and safety violation in bongistan
  probably knowing tesco they will have fucked up somewhere damn company cant do anything without shooting itself in the foot 
  simple solution claim you need an ethic scottish kilt with nut dagger or religious exemption sikh to own a noyph or invent your own religion
  spring stanleys are fun though legal to carry in bongland too because small and non locking it comes with a stupid fucking round nose blade however which is retarded  if you are cutting tubes of silicone then that blue thing looks pretty good actually knife isnt ideal plus you get it all fucking gunked up and shit and it doesnt retract or cut nice    stop being a whiny cunt and quit if you dont like it      fuck off retard box cutters are so you dont slice the product opening the box also shelf stacker zombies leave them lying around so retard public cant be trusted not that thats what anyone is even talking about stupid people ruin everything like people too stupid to understand tripfaggots ruin this board      believe it or not up in scotland nobody actually wears kilts outside of weddings or hogmanay unless you are the doorman at the balmoral hotel you must be american i guess to be so fascinated with knives difference between americans and scots is in scotland the blade end goes in you not the handle end with a jonny bag over it to dildo your arse with you poof
  shall
  anon you should clean that sand out of your vagina
  another classic shitpost
  delete this  god i hate being a yurokek so much why why why ahhhahghahgahghahghag
  if the sentence we have had a number of accidents this year involving technicians being cut with knives during the course of completing normal routine tasks is anything to go by then no no you cant
to be fair you probably cant be trusted with adjustable wrenches
  no seriously you dont want it to get infected      i dont trust myself with an adjustable wrench either last time i used one i got about 5lbs of dirty black grease on my shirt
  tesco  theres your problem
  tripfag uses a wrench  gets blacked  are we to be surprised
  it was in a dumpster    i managed to wash off about 4lbs of the black but the other 1lb remained on my shirt the rest of the day at work    thats the story of how i got my vise
  is it seriously illegal to carry a box cutter in bong land what a state of affairs
  hey bepis fuck you go buy some more chinkshit tools you wont use    call the cops
  song related        tbf adjustable wrenches are only good for fucking up bolt heads
  i want to buy more tools but xmas is coming so im trying to spend the money on other people i think im going to grab pic related for the gfs dad
  sounds similar to the safety knives home depot employees are forced to use nothing safe about those knives unless youre quadruple jointed youre starting the cut with the blade facing your body the spring is supposed to make the blade retract when you pull out of the cardboard it works great until you actually use the knife once you hit tape there is a chance of the blade sticking open if you are carrying the knife in your hand and walking briskly there is enough momentum to accidentally extend the blade a standard box cutter can be thrown across the room without the blade coming out the safety version cuts into your apron if you move around too much oh and the blades are tightly controlled by the penny pinching management so your knife is permanently dull a week after being hired if you use a blade other than what they are supposed to give to you you get fired    i dont have to know who the inventor was to know it was a boomer its worse than useless its more dangerous than the equipment it replaces it requires you to buy special parts from a specific vendor forever it offers no benefit to the user other than allowing the user to continue being employed it offers the company a clever sounding catch phrase to use when someone sues the company for unsafe working conditions but your honor we are a proactive company that requires all employees use safety brand safety knives with safety brand safety blades we have no idea how the guy cut himself so badly by walking fast
  sheesh and i survived working in a warehouse where we used standard box cutters like this  to close these you shove the blade back in usually by tapping it on the box
  of course you survived those older knives are safer than modern safety box cutters pretty much any knife is safer hell just using the razor blade with no handle gives you more control than those self retracting pieces of shit
its a trick so youll all agitate against real safety measures and clamour for deregulation
  i would invent my own religion bases on hp lovecraft and bs myself rifles swords noyphs and rpgs befor i would let myself get britained sad
  do it anyway get fired draw unemployment off the cucks as long as u can
  these things are the biggest shit meme tool ever
  oi you got a loicense for that crescent wrench
could /diy/ point me in the right direction     dont know anything about water softeners and i have hard water     what do i need for equipment with these levels     when i install my softener should i reroute the outside water spicket to avoid going through the softener
  damn 18 gpg how deep is the well
  its city water
    ph 69    isnt that good
  when i install my softener should i reroute the outside water spicket to avoid going through the softener    depends if you wash your car/s you will appreciate not having as many water spots but if you are topping off a pool and watering your garden for hours rerouted is better
does that system come with a blowjob in the midwest 3k would be the installed price
whats the best way to fix this mess
  put the bar on a stud where it was supposed to be    get one of those drywall patches and compound go to town
  this drywall repair is stupid easy one of the best kept secrets they sell patches at home depot with metal plates innem of all sizes and the smallest tub of premixed joint compound and a plastic knife will cost around 15 bucks to fix a little kilz primer sealer on top and some paint to match maybe another 10 if youre picky
  i made this same mistake when i broke my toilet paper holder while cleaning the bathroom    watched the handyman fix itheres how    enlarge the hole a little but not too much make it big enough to fit a wooden shim in there    what you do is you cut a wooden shim about 3 to 4 long put a screw in the middle of it for a temporary handle then slide the ship into the hole and line/position up the shim behind the dry wall then screw it into place    now you have a shim to screw and fasten into with your busted toilet paper holder    badda bing badda boom
heh americans and their hollow cardboard walls
  are you putting that back or just hiding the hole
      i punched a hole in hallway wall when reeeeing when i was 22 got one of the patches from home depot easy peazy  i also punched a hole in my door when i was 17 i covered that up with a paper
take the mounting plate off the holder  remove the screws and anchors  put mp and mess back in hole  now get 2  6 machined screws and go thru wall behind mess and install two large flat washers and nuts
hope this helpsthank me later
    either these or toggle bolts
fill hole with jb weld mashing enough to mushroom in back  smooth off in front flush  after hardened drill holes for screws  tap holes for screws
    im still a fan of the old ice cream stick screen and string method patches leave noticeable bump where you do the repair if you put your backing behind the drywall you can make it look like it never happened
  new drywall patch and something to actually attach those screws to underneath it
  you sound like a great kid
  my girlfriend fixed her own drywall when she was in college this cant be a real question in an age with google
  what terrible idea
  this   very intelligent
  came here to post this
  heh americans   jokes on you im from kentucky
itt retards that have never had to deal with this bs    the only real way youll be able to fix this shit is if you do  and then cut a piece of drywall that fits about 1/4 loose screw it in apply plaster drywall tape then more plaster on top let it dry sand it and apply more plaster if you fucked up and sand it again finally you apply 2 coats of primer to it and then touch up paint    ie hire a contractor cant be more than 40
  not if you do the mud right tbhfamiliashould go about 8 inches around a hole that size and it wont be noticeable
  idiot  no contractor i know even gets out of bed for 40 buck dumbass especially since it would take 3 trips to finish  day 1 one patch  tape mud  day 2 sand and final mud  day 3 sand and paint
hi /diy/ want to build one of these i guesstimate its not that simple in how it works but i got little experience on electronics in general only some schooltaught knowledge base and so onbut still i may teach myself if im destined to is there any decent tutorials or buildalong posts or something thanks goys
   i guesstimate its not that simple in how it works  so you havent even bothered to fucking google how shit works and you think you have the smarts to build one get the fuck out of here     
  gee go easy on me anon its just what its name says induction with some pancake induction coils
  decent tutorials or buildalong posts o  just spend the 30 or so and a power supply and get a coil/module off ebay
  with some pancake induction coils      the same coils would work for pancakes or any food the important thing is the type of pan it has to be magnetic
  so this is why my stove top doesnt work worth a fuck  because i have stainless steel cookware    fucking assholes that design this shit should be hanged in the street
  fucking kek i prefer crepe coils desu
   stainless should work
  fucking assholes that design this shit should be hanged in the street    idiots that dont understand the things theyve bought should be hanged in the street
  idiots that dont understand the things theyve bought should be hanged in the street    idiots who cant get an obvious joke should go back to redit
  it has to be magnetic  nope
  because i have stainless steel cookware  nope try doing like 2 minutes of light searching and reading next time youre currently pun intended an angry ignoramus
    hes replying ironically to the clown who said     ah forget it today is stupid day i assume
  aaah i get it  you were merely pretending to be retarded
  no my stovetop legit doesnt work properly depending on the pan and where it is exactly above the element fucking thing constantly turns off/on as jittery unstable as a tweaker  very unreliable
  some stainless steel  not all ss is ferrous
  it doesnt work well at all with my ss on the stove i have but yes im lazy and i havent done any research on my stove i shouldnt have to tesearch the damned thing it should just work  i am interested in this technology but when it comes to a household appliance i really dont care i just expect it to work
      so the magnetic clown was actually correct
      
would a nichrome pan work in theory
  would a nichrome pan work in theory    no because it is not magnetic the heating comes from eddy currents which are caused by the varying magnetic field which will be very weak in a nonmagnetic material however i did read that some of the induction heaters overcome this somehow but in general you need a magnetic pan

anyone know if induction hobs are driven in resonance by some sort of sine wave or if theyre just fed a dirty square ill test my own hob soon and ive got an old one that had a broken fan and had to be replaced because nobody sells that fan anywhere sucks that the new hob has a 01hz pwm frequency when set at different frequencies it boils violently for a few seconds before stopping for a few more since the heat capacity of the system is tiny in comparison to the enthalpy of vaporisation of water    op look in to induction furnaces theyre a somewhat common induction project that you could probably simply copy the circuitry from with an adjustment or two they also get really fucking hot if you pump enough current through them which is why theyre always built with a copper pipe as the coil with water going through it as a means to not overheating      spelling aside what does borosilicate glass have to do with anything is this what the glass top should be made of id think pyrex/tempered glass would do the trick but borosilicate would be nice
pyrex is a trade name for borosilicate glass my friend
  funny seeing how most pyrex is made of soda lime glass not boro glass and its been that way for 30 years now
because corning hasnt manufactured pyrex since 1999 but who the heck buys kitchenware new theres a stack of legit pyrex dishes at every goodwill in america
  who the heck buys kitchenware new theres a stack of legit pyrex dishes at every goodwill in america    believe it or not anon some people actually have jobs
hi ive shooting co2 airgun for some time and i now have many of those unfillable cartridges but they are too nice to just throw away so i wana ask you what can i do with them what can i made out of them some diy shit or something i only saw someone chopping them a making lil containers but thats shit if you have any idea write it down here thx
  add a battery with a little vibrating motor and sell them on etsy as clit stimulation devices
    damn i came here to suggest this thing minus the etsy tho    also they can make good anal vibrators
  a lighter perhaps  the cotton and fuel are obvious  maybe an electric spark would be better than a magnesium one
  also maybe a miniature fire extinguisher  you could probably sell those at a nice price
        another idea a miniature little boy with a light parachute that you could throw
  i vaguely remember emptying the gunpowder out of a bunch of firecrackers and funneling it into the 12g cartridges as a kid so it was somewhere between an m80 and a pipe bomb
fill with black powder add a fuse and cap with hot glue    just made your own fireworks
shove them up your ass
    you can experiment with them as a boiler maybe use oppening with burst disc etc     you can also melt them down or use them as fluid tanks in your other diy projects      always be carefull when dealing with pressurised systems
ive made pipes out of them
  yep blew some holes in stuff siding etc be careful
you can recycle them for money which you can use to buy real materials
  you could fill them with sugar rockets fuel and retrofit find for stability you might be able to get them up a few hundred to a thousand feet or so
fill them down and forge something out of it
  you can make a scifi gun and sell it to some kid
  scuba tanks for gerbils
  hampture will become a reality
  throw them away you fucking pack rat
make a wind chime / mobile and hang it on your porch so everyone can hear them clang and ring signaling that a bored retard lives there
  dump them in the ocean so hermit crabs can use them as shells
wastes money on air canisters  too soi to pump a bb gun
sell hand crafted guitar slides on etsy
  hes actually right its really not a good idea because making model rockets from metal is almost never a good idea but the tip of those gas cartridges would probably make great nozzles youd have to drill them out then cut off the other end and fill them from there and youd probably want to use a hollow core grain type seal the other end with epoxy hell you might be able to thread it and put a cap on and make it reuseable     check  hes got great tutorials on surgar rockets ive been making sugar rockets since i was 12 years old using his instructions
  before or after the sharpie
  sugar rocket
  build an airgun that shoots them as ammo
  fuck you i laughed
fishing has to fit in here somewhere    i like this
has anyone here done work through one of these services theyre sort of like uber but for handymen cleaning ladies etc    handy is the only one that doesnt require you to be insured but it has a bad rep of screwing over contractors    any handymen have experience with these type of setups    i have a ton of tools and experience but im sick of working for general contractors and want to strike out on my own i dont have the cash right now to get my gc license but im working on getting liability insurance
  i always think those maid for hire places are actually prostitutes for hire if you know the right pass phrase
  relocate an outlet  5000  so the other ones pay you for them to do the services  are there really people who dont know how to shut off a breaker and run romex
  apparently so  i read a couple articles about these places some people do really well theres a guy in sf who pulls in 6figures doing simple stuff like mounting tvs urbanites dont know how to do anything
hello just wanted to know if any of you guys have any experience in making armors medieval balistic you name it  i was wandering how they attach the lether or cloth to the metal plates it would be very cool to make a gaunlet outta junk can you help me with any usefull info
  i would assume pop a hole in the metal put the cloth there then put in one of those metal pieces that have the latching circle on the other side i dont have any experience with this at all but ive seen them at the store and i feel like using them is a given
modern metal worker and bladesmith here back in the day they would use glue and rivets without modern adhesives they would use resin or tree sap then rivet around the edges
interesting tanks for the info got any recomendation in the type of metals and the hardening process
modern armor is usually made from stainless steel not recommended for a beginner stainless will harden if you dont keep it cool enough while drilling holes if you dont plan on taking a beating use aluminum its soft and easy to work and polishes up very well
  contact your local sca branch and hook up with armorers wwwscaorg
nicethank you guys
rivets
  stainless will harden if you dont keep it cool enough while drilling holes  stainless steel work hardens heat doesnt matter until you get way too hot for machining operations but it is very hard on high speed steel cutting tools so its important to go slow and use coolant preventing work hardening while drilling requires a high feed pressure to cut deep enough to keep the cutting edge below the hardened surface layer
  how they attach the lether or cloth to the metal plates  rivets
  sca stickjocks  knowing about real armor  i used to roll with those guys remember they make their gear to resist rattan not swords take any armoring advice they give with a grain of salt
i made a 3/4 scale replica lorica segmentata out of sheet metal and leather in high school i just used rivets i imagine that something similar would work with thicker steel armors i guess it depends on how many pieces of armor there are and whether they move or not
buying a new house any /diy/ projects i can do im going for a post modern/ minimalist glam look
post modern  just put a bunch of stars of david around yourself and save yourself some money
  i know about tools and materials what the hell is post modern minimalist glam
i want a blue ceramic mug the bluest possible does anyone familiar with pigments know where to start in coating a plain ceramic mug with a deep blue pigment    preferably matte but a shiny protective coating is fine too as long as it is bluelooking    must be bluer than any usual mug    must be food safe     preferably dishwasher safe
  synthetic ultramarine appears to be the strongest blue pigment
  thanks my idea rn is to figure out if it can be suspended in glaze then glaze a mug and reglaze it with a clear foodsafe coat    hopefully it would be safe to drink out of
  kickass its food safe    
  use zyklon b if you prefer a more prussian blue
  get out of here stalker
  redpilled and also bluepilled    ok heres my current plan   1 mix ultramarine pigment powder with a underglaze base   2 paint on this blue underglaze let it dry   3 apply a transparent glaze to finish and fire in a kiln   4 sandblast the outside to make it matte    would this worku
if i wanted to get a good pcb milling machine so i can make pcbs at home what machine should i go with    the obvious seems to be either bantam or a chink shit machine off alibaba although ive seen poor quality come off the cheapo cnc without the autoleveller which begs the question why dont they just add this 1 wire and a bit more code no       anyone have any ideas
  ask /g/
   ask a brand worshiping hive of scum and consumerfaggotry about actual technology  what did op ever do to you faggot
  what are the important qualities a pcb milling machine has to have over say a router or a cnc mill
  seeting this much over a mention of a board
  this  why cant you just pop a copper clad pcd in a generic desktop cnc
guess im just the old bastard that still uses enchant
  fucking spill check    etchant
  someone with ancient cnc mill with good hardware faulty electronics calls up the pcb repair man    fat swarthy man with a giant neckbeard waddles up with his bambam tools cnc pcb printer under his arm    plops it down on the floor next to the giant aged mill    so eh its been down for a hwhile now    shush says the 4chan neckbeard hurridly    locates and diagnoses the problem ahyep thatll be the problem one moment    scans part with phone app fancy pcb printer spins to life and prints a new circuit board for it    is this where maintenance of electronics is headed it almost sounds like a better future where obsolete electronics are still useable
  youve just made a pcb thats crappier then what 210 shipping will get you from china  where you plan on getting the obsolete parts caps and resistors are reasonably easy to substitute with modern ones but good luck finding anything ancient with silicon in it
  granted its not fully fleshed out yet
  thats where iot comes in geberic chip on new board connects to server and either simulates output of the old one or downloads code to program onboard fpga to behave like it
holy fuck you could build an all metal cnc with probably 4 x 8  cutting capacity for the price of that tiny thing and it could still mill pcbs just fine
pic related will mill you a pcb  200 on ebay
pcb dust is bad you really need to manage that shit somehow
  noted                if it works it works im happy      i actually do already have one of those alibaba chink shit cncs but i havent used it yet because    1 it doesnt have limit switches attached  2 i want to put in autolevelling    but if theres something out there that does a good job for cheap im all ears  the bantam one in the op looks to me to just be a cheap cnc with acryllic case and maybe some other random little tidbits why is it so fucking expensive am i missing something
  
  the resulted pcb look ok but the guy just dont know how to deal with smd soldering  also the drill bit he used maybe to big but the machine precision seem to be enough for the job
  you can get a tormach for that money
why not just etch them
  etching is a fucking mess if you intend to make more than one pcb a week then id get a router asap
      i want to make a couple of boards for myself and a bunch of buddies      what product i only saw 8k     i like the rental options though    were a small group but we really dont want to waste time dealing with a cheapo alibaba machine thatll fuck up like in the video i linked above    were also looking at some roland for the rental options but we havent quite dealt with pcb machining and weve got some upcoming projects that we want to churn out
    how accurate does the z height need to be for pcb milling 1 thou 5 halfthou
why not use a laser etcher and copper board with uv resist get one with a blue laser and you can just laser out your design and then use etching liquid    or look for pcb cnc on ali
  alternatively you could use a fairly strong laser and just ablate the copper off
  1 thou is probably a sweet spot        too dangerous with laser dont want to etch    the cnc off ali seems reasonable but we want a good one so wed probably go with the bantam
  that depends on how tight your board traces are
  this has got to be the most retarded thing ive read on /diy/
  dang now i want a dlp board etcher
  hes not wrong though /g/ used to have actual discussion but has devolved into generals showing off consumerism and memeing brands    if you wanted to buy the most popular electronics thats who to ask
  how the fuck is that thing 5 grand its all 3d printed with like 200 in linear hardware it looks premium so id pay 1k at most
  thats literally what im thinking    and whats worse is the minimal improvements needed to get the alibaba cncs to a good level but i really dont have the time to work on it      i already have 3 side projects on top of my 50 hour work week
  basic 440 is 6k
  the problem is not the machine but great scott that just dont know how to use it  and his soldering job is just awful
  this is true the machine by its self is 6k no stand or enclosure or any fancy stuff probably a waaay better machine than ops pcb box though    
  the controller is just a desktop with a parallel port card installed and pathpilot installed on it for 800 you could save a few bucks by building your own but i wouldnt just because their machine is so well tested
design your own machine buy a simple 3d printer and the necessary hardware from aliexpress now just print and assemble a piece of cake
  1 step on an ordinary nema 17 is 18  the lead on an ordinary screw is 2mm so 001mm under half a thou is easily doable with equipment that costs dollars motor 8 and screw 5
i need advice so using a 7024 rod i need to make a weld and then chip off at least 7 inches of continuous slag ive tried several times and the longest ive gotten was about 4 inches of slag pic unrelated
    when i was a kid we had continuous slag from the start of the weld to the end of the weld i still have some slag beauties about 12 feet long from my boiler making days
  well post a related pic so we can tell you what youre doing wrong
  sparkies    electrician even welders call electricians sparkies
does /diy/ have any experience soundproofing a room     i started taking vocal lessons recently and ive realized i probably sound really autistic trying to sing high notes to my neighbors i rent the second floor of my house     i want to soundproof my small shed i have outside my yard instead to use as a private cheap studio but i dont know if the cheaptoexpensive soundproofing tiles that are sold can withstand my voice as i hit higher notes     the shed has no major cracks but should i just reconsider this and just invest into converting my room instead   does soundproofing even work like i think it does or can sound leak
  sound really autistic trying to sing high notes    post proof on vocaroo and we will help
  small foam squares like the ones in your pic are really for treating the acoustics inside a room those little bits of foam wont do much to block sound unless you cover the entire inside of the room what really blocks sound is thick solid walls which your small shed almost certainly doesnt have
  it should also be noted that certain frequencies travel through objects more effectively than others luckily for you its bass frequencies which travel through walls much easier
  i just started to learn sono im too embarrassed       unless you cover the entire room   is this possible i wanna be cheap but it matters more for me to cancel sound so id be willing to pay more     any alternatives/ideas would be appreciated otherwise
    triple layer everywhere walls floor roof anus then ply wood and more matts
  build a structure around your current shed thick brick walls and a well insultated roof    alternatively soft furnishing is great for killing sound sofas thick curtains carpets hung on walls russian style etc
  there are international organizations dedicated to the science behind soundproofing look for their website
  just pound on the walls and floor when your singing and your neighbors will think your having wild sex  they will then recognize you are king of the jungle and will never question you again
  just stop being a pussy and sing louder
so im trying to help my parents out with a new tv they bought no problem right but they want to have it set up as wireless as possible so theyve got me trying to find a way to hook their out of the wall cable to their new tv wirelessly and they want to do it for hopefully under 100     is this shit even possible at that price  pic vaguely related
  thanks mate but ive already got 3 tabs of google open trying to find something that might do what they want
  then you are ill equipped to perform the task    determine connection standard used between tv and cable outlet   purchase correct transceivers for the job  it is literally that simple
  im just trying to find something as retard proof as possible so they arent calling me to fix it twice a day     and they want me to find something that has a receiver that fits hidden behind the tv like a chromecast dongle
  good luck with that youll be tech support for ever more    just chase the cable into the wall
how do i mount your gf without wires
  this run the damn cables in the wall
  how do i mount your gf without wires    you nail her
why the fuck would you want wireless for something which literally never moves a millimetre    i swear people today are terminally retarded
fuck the wireless go for a false chimney breast doesnt need to be too deep or just take the cable through the wall also use remote patch panels rather than direct connections    if you have false walls drop the cables inside the wall pull them out the bottom and route them in hollow skirting boards
  this run the damn cables in the wall    there are 2 rules  1always do a wired connection  2if in doubt refer to rule 1
  telling me something i know
  ok so tell your parents youll only do it wired and their idea is stupid if they say no then you dont do it
    at work they have one of these things      its not wireless it just has an hdmi cable routed through the wall  which is what youre going to have to do if you dont want to be in for a world of hurt
  also its a funny design that lets it be mounted literally on the wall so theres zero clearance
how do i into sculpting whats the time investment cost etc    should i start with marble clay or another material
  are you planning to become a world renown genius at it or is it just as a hobby
  depends anon start with clay build up to wood then try out marble  working with clay will be more affordable/will help you develop better spatial cognition skills is you dont have them to begin with wood will help you understand using more force behind your tools sawing sanding etc you could straight up start with marble but itd be like throwing a blind inner city black kid whos never swam before into the ocean during a hurricane at night    entertaining but not really conducive towards learning
  im not op but what materials do we need for stone sculpting  or the books from that famous italian or french marble scultpor cover this issue
  start with a oven bake polymer clay like sculpey medium or if youre european fimo professional or a soft that youve left out for a while polymer clays can be shaped for months and months after you open them unlike air dired or real clay you dont need a lot of tools to start with a scalpel a rounded thin stick a small paintbrush for blending and a butter knife will be enough just to get started later if you feel like youre getting into it and want to do more details you can get wax carving tools on ebay or amazon and maybe some ribbon tools they work great for clay sculpting
  use modern tools for a modern era  3d print it and wear a sweater that covers your neck
  i mean hes black hes fucked regardless of being blind having to swim
has anyone tried sculpting cement foam when i was in high school we used this mix of plaster cement and other shit i dont remember that made a medium that looked like stone but was easier to carve by hand im wondering if cement foam wouldnt have similar properties
  use modern tools for a modern era  i bet youd tell someone who wants to get into painting to get a tablet and photoshop
  youd be surprised how many watercolor and oil paintings are actually done digitally now   not saying the real thing isnt worth pursuing just that digital tools have come a long way in emulating both the input and output of the real thing
can concrete of some particular mix be sculpted when wet

first time ive gotten a real tree for christmas ive got all led lights everything is on surge protectors and keeping it watered yall got any tips

ive had to do a lot of priming lately over wallpaper and fake paneling basically brown wallpaper i guess and it seems like no matter what you need 3 coats is there a more expensive primer thats actually worth it or is this about as good as it gets
  you do know that the primer coat isnt suppose to be opaque right its just a flat base for the top coat to stick to
  you can always try tinting your primer
  if you are having issues with bleed through cigarette smoke or similar then pick up kilz oil primer if not read  and dont worry about coating perfectly
gripper is the shitthank me later
  priming lately over wallpaper  oh god  if youre going to commit this crime against nature just know that your seams will be visible  additionally do not use a latex primer a latex primer allows water to bleed through the paper into the glue and youll get bubbles behind the wallpaper which really stand out you can cut out the bubbles and mud over them but its easy to mess up    use an oil based primer whatever you do maybe even two coats then you can even mud over the seams without getting bubbles  and addressing your actual question you can tint your primer its normal to see through the primer and put on up to three coats of paint now that lead paint is illegal
hi /diy/  i need to build a new floor in my house i want to use wooden planks the support beams are about 18cm7in wide and 150cm60in apart on those i would then obv nail the planks onto my plan is to use 320cm126in long planks and make them start at one beam go over one and go to the next one see terrible picture blue things are the support beams red ones are the planks how thicc and wide should the planks optimally be to support living nothing heavy like safes only tables and humans and stuff like that    thanks
  the support beams are about 18cm7in wide and 150cm60in apart    the floor joists are 60 inches apart use steel ibeams for the floor boards
  i know its a lot maybe i can use those big support beams to put boards on them those that are higher than wider and use those to put the floor on them
    you can probably find a guide online this one is for american standards i think    
    boy that pic is fucked up i clicked m to put it in metric but all it changed was the spacing which seems to be cm
  as the other anons engineering table shows 2 boards  actually 15  or 37mm  cant span that much my feeling is you need 3 or 4 planks or strong support over those beams you have   25 inch steel sheet 
  nail joists across the three beams  glue and screw 3/4 osb subfloor to the joists  install your favorite flooring
whats the cheapest way to decently paint a different colored camper shell i was thinking of just using rattling cans of spray paint that match the color of the truck but im not sure if thats the most cost efficient depending on how much id use and should i sand it down first or just put some sort of cleaner or oil degreaser and then paint over it ive searched and different people have done it in different ways but i wanted to get some opinions
rustoleum applied with a high density foam roller is the cheapest      aerosol is a good idea because it can be color matched but youll need about 4 to 5 cans     if you have a compressor just get the purple gun from harbor freight instead    for best result pressure wash sand with 320 degrease with panel wipe prime resand with 400 degrease paint and clear follow instructions on the can
you will never get the color right and it will look worse as a near color paint it flat black if anything
  you will never get the color right and it will look worse as a near color paint it flat black if anything    it could be alright i painted teh front end of a 10 year old car all that time in the texas sun using ebay paint and the toyota paint code and i cant tell the difference
  you fucked up the wheels  fuck up the shell
  thats not mine just a picture for relevance
  im actually planning on using the toyota paint code as well so thats good to hear what steps did you use or was it just literally ebay paint it then the paint code      this sounds good ill try to follow the best results advice closely
ive used aerosol cans from automotivetouchup results were pretty good
  just vinyl wrap it will be better looking and last longer than whatever shitty paint job you will do
  of thats the truck krylon it flat black
  
  this use thinned auto paint clear it outside or wear a proper respirator or it will instantly fuck your lungs in the ass
  you will never clean the plastic nozzle and beedle well enough unless using waterborne with paints so consider it disposable and the the tip is over 20mm so too wide for a fine finish     harbor freight has a 20 hand held now  try that if you must
grit it down with an orbital sander and some 400800 paper  clean it with air and then rub it down with paint thinner let it dry  apply primer all over it let it dry to the time it says on the can/container  apply paint all over it first a thin layer then a good layer and then however many more good layers you feel is necessary  apply uvresistant clearcoat if you want a nice shine and for the base color to keep its color longer    rattlecans are the cheapest if you dont already have a compressor and an ok paint gun
  i would just paint it black with that wrinkle paint or undercoating paint w/e
open the glove box  look at the door  find the paint code  go to paint shop/auto body shop hand have them mix paint to match the truck  id you mask it they might shoot it for 100   it will look 100 times better than some rattle can
  this  if you do the surface prep and tape/masking and have the paint for them itll cut down the price for the shop to spray it proper and thorough surface prep is the longest part of painting auto parts stores also have paint and the other hardeners that you mix in if its an oem color youre set nonstandard colors can be a pain if its not a standard color id recommend finding a complementary color that goes with the color of the truck
how do i get the top lights to turn on    plz help it looks retarded without the top lights on
ah telt you tae bring the fuckin cairds its borin wioot the cairds
  check the lights nearest to where the lit ones end one of them is likely burned out just replace it and you should be set
cut the top part off
i struggle with this just about every year and its always user error there is always a green colored plug somewhere between those two layers that just isnt connected its hard to see them all you might just be unplugged
  at first thought short people put on the lights
jizz on it
  i had the same problem a couple weeks ago    i bought a new tree
  thats not a tree
  artificial tree/ doge bed / cat hideout/ ornament holder / night light
  i actually made fun of my family for buying another unitasker tool a christmas light fixer it actually worked    also if just one bulb fell out when rangling the tree out of storage the set may not light start at the beginning and look for a broken off bulb or missing one
  not using a real living tree
  fookin trainspotting aint ait
op is no longer the favorite
  jesus christ that is the stuff of nightmares
  
  what does a tree has to do with lights
  most of the artificial trees these days have the lights built into them      i dont think those trees geow within hundreds of miles of me and if you dont chop it down yourself you might as well buy artificial    we used to do natural trees when i was a kid until one day we got a tree that refused to stand up straight no matter how much we fucked it it it ended up with my dad getting so pissed that he threw the tree out the front door into the lawn and we had our first artificial christmas without having a giant fire hazard in the living room
i got one of these for like 7 and its awesome you pull out a bulb from the dark part put the gun against the part the bulb goes on pull that trigger a few times and it all starts working its a christmas miracle and idk how it does it
  just buy one from ikea they are 100 here you pay 20 then get 19 shopping reward you need to spend in january     pretty good for a real nordmann
  nice
ive got used tosot window ac for pretty low price  its a little bit dirty but i guess simple cleaning of the filters and damp cloth to cleans the fins would do  or is there better options  also for some reason the heating unit doesnt work only the cooling unit how do i know if its the thermostat

    its just a prank bro
  this    i wore a border patrol hat and blew a whistle when we had some roofers working alongside us a
  so fuck phoneposting    at a job site and they all slid down the ladders and ran off  all of my bros i worked with were disabled with laughter and the rooferbros got a good laugh and we had a few beers with them when the job was done because mexicans like practical jokes   muh multiculti carpentry
swap hydrogen into the shielding gas on the mig welder makes it sound like a machine gun just went off in the shop    clip some bar joists below a floor where theyre about to set down heavy materials added bonus of pranking the machine operators working underneath it on the floor below    when someone locks out a circuit breaker take a set of bolt cutters to take them off then activate the breaker so many funny noises    haha lol am i funny yet  its just a prank bro

  at my job you will get your ass canned for doing this shit because the shit we make isnt cheap and run large number of parts per hour    some one offsets a tool in the machine  the machine crashes or the part is out of spec    machine crashes  machine is down till it gets fixed  a lot of money is spent to get it fixed  end up getting behind on orders  have to work 7 days a week hoping to get caught up      part out of spec  check part every one to two hours  you come back from break running parts  one/two hours are up check part and do check sheet  shit is out of spec  stop and go back to check parts before till you find one that is in spec  scrap parts that are out of spec  explain to your supervisor what happen

im closing on my first home next week im pretty much retarded when it comes to any type of handyman work building things fixing things pretty much all of it i want to learn though is there any advice you would give such as essential tools to get or things you wished you knew before owning your home any advice at all is appreciated
  im assuming you had an inspector go through your property and tell you what needed to be replaced go on youtube and lookup how to perform the home repair yourself should have advice on what kinds of tools to get
  i wish i had let the dishwasher run a full cycle rather than just turning it on to see that it worked that fucker wasnt installed correctly and the filthy water drained back into the u it each time due to lack of air gap/high loop it was so rancid i had to replace it
  buy whatever tools you need for whatever jobs come up just google and youtube and come here to ask and youll be able do lots of things no problem congrats on the new home dude
  if you have absolutely nothing a 100200 homeowner tool set isnt a terrible place to start everybody sells these mechanics sets but you dont even get pliers with them grab that a multimeter and one of those ryobi kits with a drill circular saw and sawzall can also just get the cordless drill and substitute the saws for corded because they generally work better and cost less and then grab the rest as projects come up studfinder too youll use that a bit if the wife likes to hang bullshit all over your walls    and the second thing the stuff i wish i knew i was always afraid of electrical stuff until i got my first multimeter for free from harbor freight a couple years ago its amazing how much easier many repairs are when you can diagnose the stuff instead of throwing parts at it until it works    oh and assorted nuts bolts screws etc are worth their weight in gold when you really need them i love those little 5 sets hf sells got them for metric and standard and electrical connectors next time i need an oring or split ring im just going to grab that assortment instead of a single one
  that kit has no wrenches  aside from the sockets and ratchets that whole kit is pretty awful  they usually dont include pliers because nobody wants a shitty pair of kobalt pliers they want sockets and wrenches
  if youre not a fan of the adjustable go with the next set     just saying i have seen a lot of people buy the mechanics tool sets and be disappointed when they realize there is only so much they can do with six different 11/16 sockets
  just saying i have seen a lot of people buy the mechanics tool sets and be disappointed when they realize there is only so much they can do with six different 11/16 sockets    as opposed to buying a homeowner tool set that has huge gaps in the wrench and sockets    are you letting op know that kobalt charges 610 a piece for a loose wrench and that he would need to buy 1416 more loose wrenches to have a reasonably complete set    the sockets and wrenches are about the only thing worth worrying about in a tool set its not hard or unreasonable to buy a small screwdriver set or some pairs of pliers or a hammer   but you get absolutely raped on wrenches and sockets  these kits are a bad purchase
  most mechanics tool sets arent any better with the wrenches pic related unless you buy a 400 set that is giving you 250 worth of filler bullshit and buying the individual wrenches is a shitty excuse when those craftsman sets are always on sale for 20ea so a pretty good assortment of metric and sae for 30    when i first needed tools to take care of shit around the house i got a big mechanics set that i couldnt even use to hang a picture on the wall a few years back i found a cheap no name kit like those kobalt ones that had a few wrenches and pliers and a hammer and goddamn has that thing come in handy whenever i have to help somebody move or the old lady neighbor needs help i grab that thing out of my car and i can fix the problem 90 of the time without going into my actual tool box the 1/2 ratchet and hammer has even doubled as an impact wrench on a couple occaisions helping somebody with a flat tire
  go buy this book off ebay    know where your shutoffs are  make sure there are enough smoke detectors and that they work  check the amount of insulation and or add more  regularly exterminate  regularly have ducts cleaned  change furnace filters
  most mechanics tool sets arent any better with the wrenches pic related unless you buy a 400 set that is giving you 250 worth of filler bullshit    dont buy shitty craftsman sets buy a full 3/8 socket set and a full wrench set and be done with it then you can buy some pliers and a hammer and all that and everything will be golden all of the dumb sets are compromises that hurt you in the end     and buying the individual wrenches is a shitty excuse when those craftsman sets are always on sale for 20ea    so right off the bat you are telling op to buy some tools and then acknowledging that he is going to then again rebuy redundant tools to get to a complete set he could have just bought the correct thing in the first place
  how to handyman in 5 easy steps    1 break something  2 look it up on youtube  3 fix it buying any required tools for that job only  4 put tools and experience away for later  5 repeat until death    this is not a joke its actual advice for real
  meh buy the homeowners set with the adjustable if op owns absolutely nothing then buy a real wrench set when he gets settled into his garage    and of course we could sit here and list off 5000 worth of tools op could buy if he really wanted to be a complete /diy/er or he could drop 100 on something like pic related and tackle most of the everyday issues and get the rest of it as projects pop up and relegate the small kit to the trunk of his car    i only say that after finding my stupid little divorced wifes kit on the clearance aisle at meijer and being amazed at how much it does compared to a 400pc mechanics set
  ok so everyones saying to get a mechanics toolset this isnt going to help very much with house repairs mechanics sets are great to have in general because every now and then you might need a wrench but they are made for automotive repairs if you have to patch a wall you arent going to need a socket set    ive been working on houses and cars with my father for the last 25 years he was a mercedes benz mechanic for a few decades and currently makes a living doing house repairs   things you will undoubtedly need are a set of screwdriversadjustable crescent wrenches a claw hammer a mallet some flat pry bars at least two trust me a good cordless drill ryobi dealt and cobalt are all decent drill bits  nail guns are very helpful for a lot of projects there are different kinds though its really easy to shingle a roof but you would want to get a roofing nailer and a decent sized compressor otherwise a framing nailer and a small brad nailer are good for lots of projects  hand saws r ok but a miter saw table saw and circular saw make things faster and easier keep sandpaper on hand and a sanding block if youre working with wood  learn how to spackle its easy and comes in handy you can get a cheap sparkling supplies at harbor freight  harbor freight sells good introductory tools they dont last forever but if you arent sure if youre going to need something often you can get an inexpensive one there to try and then upgrade to a nicer one later estate and yard sales are great places to find cheap power tools everythingbutthehousecom too  also a measuring tape good yard tools lawnmower rakes shovels pick axe wheelbarrow etc pliers regular and needlenose in varying sizes wire snips too stud finder vice grips channel locks wire strippers butane solder iron solder flux electrical tape etc  you dont need to get all of these at once you can build your collection overtime   hope this helps good luck with everything
if some of my appliances look really old and dont match my kitchens aesthetic should i just throw them out and buy replacements
  op is a homonerd
  this but dont fucking put nails in your wall like some europoor barbarian use monkey hooks so you can put shit anywhere if you have brick or concrete walls i feel bad for you son
as another mentioned new to figuring broke stuff out and diy suggest to buy tools as you proceed the quick kits pictured are respectable start just gauge to your budget ive used pawn shops to pick up unique tools that may only use once or seldom welcome to diy
  i spent half the thread telling op not to buy a mechanics set and expect it to be any good for shit around the house i use my 11in1 screwdriver around the house way more than i open up an actual socket set      none of the pawn shops i have been to around me have shit for hand tools aside from a bin of rusty pliers and loose sockets that are shitty brands anyway and the few places that have snap on are asking 90 of full retail for beat up ass tools      monkey hooks  like pic related those things are great they make a tiny hole and hold way more than a nail into straight drywall anything heavier means i need a stud or drywall anchor
  omg shut up i said it first  calm down
  everyones saying to get a mechanics toolset  where
    we have a 53 year old tripcode now you can just stop
  a kit like this is bs you dont need all those sockets and you definitely need at least one pair of vice grips a longer level and a small prybar
if your first house is in decent shape like my first house you might be able to get away with a hammer phillips/flat head screwdriver pliers make sure you get a pair of needle nose pliers as well
  of course you need a longer level eventually but without all of those sockets it would only be a 54pc kit and wouldnt be as good a deal    my point being if you need a kit to get an idea for what you use and what you need thats a better start than the big mechanics set with seven dozen loose allen keys that will all disappear in a year i would trade half those sockets for some combination wrenches tbqhwy      he seems pretty cool mostly because hes a tripfriend
just stock up during the next townwide garage sale thats how i got the majority of my crap old man estate sales are good too
  electrical breaker locator plug into socket or bulb base go to breaker boxcorrectly identify what breaker circuit is on   toilet auger that extends to 6   18v impact drill with bits for hanging shelves corded hammer drill for tile and cement   steel snow shovel one and done   301 pc mechanics tool set from horror fright is more then youll use   if your gonna take a wall downleaf blower out the window for the dust
check the plumbing too make sure toilets flush correctly you dont want to move in and find out you got a fucked up sewer main
does anyone know why this circuit has this separation in the ground wire couldnt it be just reduced to one
  nodes
  what about them
  im guessing theyre trying to illustrate that that point is star grounded that typically wouldnt be illustrated schematic though in order to keep it clean youd definitely see it in the pcb layout files
  sorry idk how to properly analyze that circuit or how to properly explain it but i think that  tying everything straight to the same ground isnt the same as running certain components to each other someplace else and then connecting one of them to ground        go to part where it talks about nodes branches and loops
hello i stored some paint in the garage and it apparently got a little frozen 5 days ago i took it into the living room because i was planning on painting with it when i opened the paint bucket today i noticed some condensation water on the lid of it could this be bad i checked for mold and didnt find any on the paint i am just a little worried because the process of condensation happened in there is the paint still good to use
  depends on the type but for the most part chuck it if you care how it turns out
is it water borne paint if so nothing will happen  just add some anti fungal if youre worried about fungus
if its separated and wont mix smoothly then its bad if it mixes then its fine also 
  add acetone
  what does that do to water base latex    probably an interesting effect mixed real well
  acetone for oil base  water for latex
  just take it to the paint store set the can firmly on the counter and ask for a shot of black just like the pros
hey my dudesanyone here make a living making things for people to buyif so what do you make and what platform do you use    hot item right now are river fucken tables bluish epoxy filler between two pieces of wood bonus points for leds that illuminate the epoxy    just lost my engineering job and sick of working for dumb ass boomerswant to start my own thingneed ideas

  the 30 year old boomer is a meme for a reason nigger  not even the op but acting like mister fucking big shot on a mongolian knitting forum when you yourself more than likely had your fair share of help starting up your business is kinda pathetic
  the 30 year old boomer is a meme  originallyl boomers were born during the postww2 baby boom 19461950  but now somehow even people born 1520 years later are still boomers  and now you want to include people 209 years younger than that    christ this shit is getting worse than literally and ironic put together    i weep for the english language
  get a big propane tank and make a vac chamber take out bubbles while building another

  the joke is that there is stereotypical behavior associated with members of the baby boomer generation and in particular older millennials have also started acting in a way reminiscent of baby boomer stereotypes

  anybody want to voluntarily discuss ideas while i brainstorm my next career that i will be doing with my body and brain  nope you have to do everything the hardest way possible and i dont want anyone to help you even think because if you happen to not be as creative as i am then you can only be a wageslave  it doesnt have to be binary

ive drawn up some rough sketches of a design id like to make a prototype of ive checked for patents and it hasnt been made yet however i know nothing about electricals or mechanical workings ive designed what i think would work and then wrote out my intentions with the rest     is there a way to contact someone to build what i want to have made based on my roughs if so who do i need to look for
  youve certainly been vague enough  im sure someone will be here shortly with exactly the information you desire
its comical how little information youve given and expect a actual answer if you want a prototype for your super secret hush hush device then start making it no one can make a brand new invention from some scribes
    what information would you like to have to help me find a person to help out     it has electronics it needs at least 2 electrical motors to operate a lever mechanism and a spinning mixer and i need a body for the whole machine is this detailed enough or would you like more info that you wont ask for
  it needs at least 2 electrical motors to operate a lever mechanism and a spinning mixer and i need a body for the whole machine    im visualizing it now   pic related    you need to talk to a patent attorney  be sure to take your rough sketches

hey could anyone please help identify whether this is asbestos or not thanks
  no just looks like some kind of charring from a fire maybe
  yeah its inside the fireplace but the material behind it
  the materials behind it will be firebrick son they dont use asbestos
  could be slate asbestos but typically thats not in the fire box
  who cares asbestos is perfectly safe and i quote     the movement against asbestos was led by the mob because it was often mobrelated companies that would do the asbestos removal great pressure was put on politicians and as usual the politicians relented millions of truckloads of this incredible fireproofing material were taken to special dump sites and asbestos was replaced by materials that were supposedly safe but couldnt hold a candle to asbestos in limiting the ravages of fire
  smell it and tell us what it smells like
  protip the asbestos is behind it
where the fuck do i buy raw latex foam  even people on alibaba want to sell me stuff like premade pillows

  as long as volume is good fucking send it   ported box chambered like this is best
best way to make a passive income on ebay    i have access to escrap at my day job  been thinking about scrapping old circuit boards removing components like ic chips and gold fingers etc to sell to people who want to refine it seems that people are paying more than scrap value for these items which is retarded but profitable for me
  youd be better off selling old junk that still worked than broken junk to scrappers
  even with the most efficient desoldering this doesnt seem like its worth the effort
  seems that people are paying more than scrap value for these items which is retarded but profitable for me  except they arnt  escrapping wont make you money unless you do what  says  people pay way more money for working parts you just have to be willing to have stuff listed for a long enough time
this seems like a perfect thread to ask i have experience reselling on ebay but i recently have been interested in selling parts of appliances buying them cheap or getting for free and taking them apart does anyone have any experience with appliances i have no knowledhe of them just looking for any insight not spoonfeeding thanks
  lots of gold in there son melt that shit down
   you are not funny   you are not ironic  feel free to kill yourself at any time cockfag
  itake apart old appliances all the time to part out belts pumps compressors etc people will buy cheap used parts that still work i even sell to some repair shops so they can fix up and sell other appliances theres a market for it just make sure youre not being a dick and selling stuff that barely works when people expect something to work normally
  unless you can keep your weight under 12 oz and mail as a parcel shipping is going to kill you it makes your price not competitive plus ebay makes 10 of your sale and they harass the fuk out of u about it
i was thinking this too i do restoration and i get tons of free electronics people dont want some guy just gave us a few boxes of circuit boards etc  always get pcs monitors stereos i should start going through them better
go to charity shops  pick up keyboards and mice for pennies  they are worth good money
  do you make decent money i just started today testing the waters and bought a machine at the thrift store after looming it up bought a working and fairly nice starbucks coffee machine to part out im not the type to cheat or jew people ive seen that microwaves dryer and washer parts are the most popular
  ddid he do it praise be
  escrap is a hit and miss    as others say just sell working stuff since the whole retro craze old tech went up in prices and its easy to under cut retards that sell stock systems that cant be upgraded much    seen a tard selling a hp 300mhz celeron 64mb ram 4 or 6gb hdd and cdrom for around 300 no agp for a good video upgrade can only upgrade cpu ram hdd and the optical drive people gone retarded and think because its retro and tech that its worth money    i might be having access here soonish to a basement full of older pcs from early 90s to mid 200xs systems that i can get for free to cheap im going to part most of them out and sell off any working parts and clean cases but im not going full retard and asking a shit ton of money might build a few retro systems and try to sell them off build a few like 3 or 4 and see where it goes
  the moneys not bad i do it full timr and make a comfortable living when i started out it was a bit rough bit you gotta stick with it find clients and get a rep of not being an ass and incompetent make sure the shit works and you should be fine dont quit your day job until your stable tho
use a 3d printer and make keychains and stuff like that    if you can get your hands on some dead cpus and gpus you get pretty noicu keychain       gonna post pic 2morrow
  passive income    that word doesnt mean what you think it means selling shit on ebay isnt passive income
  its 13 for plebs  159 for commies
need to get into girlfriends account and was wondering if anyone could help 
best case is to make some fake phishing site and have her enter her password or use a keylogger on her computer hacking isnt what you think it is
no way of doing it remotely  we are takinga break and i dont have access to computer or cellphone
  then you should probably dump her if you dont trust her more than this
  thats what phishing is you make a fake instagram website send her the link and she types in her info bada boom bada bing fuck the bitch get a new girl theres literally hundreds of million of them
anyone can do it for me ill pay 
just guess the password bro
  then shes not your girlfriend and youre committing a crime you stupid fuck
  but its not a crime if they were in a relationship  grill logic  what you actually need is mad jelly female tell her your target is having an affair with her bf proofs online maybe shit be down within a few hours of possessed activity cia got nothing on mad grills
just run a keylogger on her pc and you are good to go
  this your brain already crossed the this relationship is over line just by asking such a question
  i didnt say that you retarded faggot
  listen bucko if you dont trust her with this little bit of privacy youre just waking down a one way road
  have you seen a woman ever use a pc for instagram its i can hardly think of the last time i saw a woman use a computer everything is done on mobile now
just ask her for the password you fucking faggot
how can you tell if a range ventilation hood is actually able to vent to outside if i open the cabinet above the hood there is an air duct that comes up from the hood turns 90 degrees and goes into the wall but the ventilation performance is so shit poor hardly any smoke or smell is removed when i turn on the hood which does whir pretty loudly when i turn it on     im especially skeptical about whether air ventilation works properly in this house after finding out the fan in the basement bathroom isnt actually connected to anything    is there a way to test for sure whether its actually able to vent to outside without having to rip out the ducts
  turns 90 degrees and goes into the wall  you look on the other side of the wall  but but i live in an apartment  ah so this is just a symptom of a larger problem move into a real house problem solved    hardly any smoke or smell is removed when i turn on the hood  how good is the suction    pretty loudly when i turn it on   that could be a sign of poor suction is the fan blades actually spinning you could have a spun bearing or a stuck fan or maybe even the filter is clogged with grease and shit    is there a way to test for sure whether its actually able to vent to outside without having to rip out the ducts  sure you get to where the end of the duct is and you see you can feel a breeze when the fan is on
  whens the last time you replaced the filter fabric  the idea is it traps grease and dust so you dont have to rod out your ducts but you gotta replace it regularly maybe even monthly if youre deep fat frying
  the fan in the basement bathroom isnt actually connected to anything  i lived in a house with a basement bathroom and the ceiling vent just had a coiled plastic duct that went into the drop ceiling and out into the utility room unfinished room of the basement lol none us really questioned it
  use a short piece of tissue paper place it near the fan vent to see if it gets sucked up to the mesh screen or cover the tissue should be drawn upward into the suction if its working properly
  get smoke bombs go outside and look
i would recommend burning a bundle of vanilla incense on the stove top and starting the vent then go outside and see if you smell vanilla the smoke bombs may stain the hood and fill the room faster than it can vent even if it does vent outside
i want to diy a showerloop  im still on the planning phase i want a filter with gravel sand and activated carbon    my questions are     how to avoid sand going back into the circuit with the water cloth    will there be moisture after some days/weeks do i have to bleed the whole thing after every use how does it dry then
  if you really want to save the planet have a navy wash rinse  shower off  lather up  shower on to rinse off will save more water than this solution looking for a problem  filter like that will clean up water a little but good fucking riddance to it putting all soap and shampoo through it
  just get a shower head you can turn off i have one in my popup trailer and i can take a shower using only 15 gallons of water
what if i want to do this because i like long showers
  any filter media you use will be rendered clogged and unusable by soap and dead skin in a matter of days
  save used shower water to run toilet saves some money
  hair you forget hair fuckos everything
  heres that shower head valve
    then dont use filters and just make it easy to switch between the loop and fresh water for when you actually soap up/rinse off the loop idea itself isnt a problem see jacuzzi tubs the filters are just have a simple screen to to catch hair so it doesnt clog the shower head
  yeah i was only talking about the bacteria/soap filter anticlog is right before pump  the switch isnt a bad idea i can look into that but it would still need filters so i can do it completely
drainlevel footswitch no filters wash as mentionned above with the stop while lathering once clean footswitch drain to loop clean water only need two drains though
i have a bunch of family videos i got digitized but the problem is many of them are all lumped together i want to break each video up into individual clips then organize them into different thumb drives for family members as a christmas gift i got vegas pro 14 as part of humble bumble and tried messing around but i cant seem to render each snippet as individual video files       any other programs that might be bettter for this or advice money is really a problem i dont mind if i have to spend few hundred on a good progrem
    have you tried windows movie maker or something    should be adequate for what youre trying to do
freemake it is my favorite used to be free but now they want you to buy the gold pack and shit like that there are torrents of it everywhere
    oh didnt see the money isnt a problem ya i would do freemake for sure fast encoding too and to pretty much any format you want
    free make pretty straight foward on multi file rendering then essentially take one long movie clip and break up each part with respective names and what not
if all you want to do is cut the videos then you really want to do lossless cutting if they were digitized from vhs then chances are theyre already low quality and last thing you want to do is make them worse by reencoding try videoredo tv suite not free but free trial i think or aviremux which is free but crappier interface and performance in my opinion
bump
adobe premier is overkill for you but if you actually want a good editor thats the standard    for free id use ffmpeg theres probably a gui for your operating system
so ill be moving to a new city very shortly and want to build some basic furniture shelves table chairs etc instead of buying it ive never had any experience with doing it myself barely even nailed things to walls    how easy it is for an absolute beginner to just start building things how did you guys start    im willing to buy some basic tools but not invest much into it
im in the same situation bumping and waiting for answers    by the way op therere lots of good woodworking / machine shop / other howto texts on google books everything before 1920something is out of copyright and free to download
it is easy as long as you do not expect to pull off a perfect louie xv chair on the first outing just expect your first pieces to be less than perfect and short lived whether by design or execution    i started by just making things and being happy with the functional failures i created    repeat and get good
    yeah i dont plan on doing anything fancy looks are not a priority yet so im ok with just nailing fruit boxes to the walls for shelves for example real basic stuff
  i made a side table as a gift for a friend i got the plans out of an old popular mechanics on google books nov 1997 issue i only used a circular saw and a drill everything else was with hand tools i traded dowels for biscuits as i didnt have a biscuit cutter i fucked up about three tables worth of materials holes drilled in the wrong places things cut just a bit too short etc before i got it right and had all sorts of problems assembling it because i didnt have enough clamps the final result turned out nice wood glue and sawdust in cracks hide many sins and once it was stained you couldnt tell dear lord was it a lot of work and i wanted to burn the fucking thing a few times be prepared to fail if you dont have someone who knows what they are doing to guide you but keep at it
so its that time of year again  what /diy/ related stuff did you ask for for christmas   what tools have you bought to give as gifts    what /diy/ gifts have you made this year
  cnc milling machine
inb4 bepcunt updates his blog with the latest tools hes bought and will never use
  are you not impressed with a man buying poor quality redundant tools
  yep or even one of those chinese combination mill and lathes
epilog laser engraver
    oh man im getting a haul this year at least the stuff i know im getting    i told my old man friend that im going to make him a solar powered hearing aid with solar panels on a baseball cap
  only two out of four are redundant and only one was paid for by me the rest is from the girl and my family      for pcbs    cubiio
  how good are those theyre just a hair more expensive than the little mills or lathes ive been wanting to get so tempting i just dont know if theyre any good or limiting in what you can work on
  i didnt think you could do pcbs on a laser at least not the ones you get for home shop use
  idk about lasers i just saw some engraving things on another thread the other day watched a video of a cheaper chinese one that just fucking mangled the boards
  probably one of the rotary tool engravers its like a cnc router except it uses a generic dremel instead of a cheap router theyre actually fine for prototypes if you set them up right but the resulting boards dont tend to last as well from what ive heard
what hinges do i need to make a cabinet open so that the doors are inset i have a shitty old 80s pink bathroom cabinet that i would rather just replace a hinge on if i can budget is 80 the price of new cabinets the doors sit flush so i dont think i can just adjust it or use a shim to move the cabinet doors across slightly
what exactly does the lab do other than eyeball your sample everyone ive asked so far has said uuuhhhits complicated but you definitely cant tell just by looking at it
i love how the black actor cant even act normal for the one pic buy has to eyeball the photographer like wut chu lookin at white boi
  thanks sauce
    
      thanks    we have one of those microscopes at work i might use it to take a quick look before ripping my house apart    i see that the pros also use colorimetric assays for iron  magnesium which are found in asbestos but not fiberglass
i want to be an asbestos tester  i tear out aspestos for my job and the dude who tests it some stoner who works like 3 hours a day he drives city to city tests your sample in like 10 minutes and goes home drives a new charger and probably makes as much as my boss
  whats wrong with that pic i hold my soldering iron like that sometimes it is uncomfortable but i feel like it gives me better control
  obtain any asbestos testing certifications  kiss bosss ass  sell testing dude a fat bag of weed laced with fentanyl    profit
  you can almost smell the burning fingers  also good luck reviving those hard drives when the plates are full of dust and dandruff
    the initial response is to laugh at how theyre holding the hot end of the soldering iron but then you notice the second layer to this image  its a hot air station
  maybe he actually knows better but the photographer insisted he hold it like that
how do i make nitromethane  plz i need for school project
do you want to make some fuel and launch a terrorist attacklol
  wow
model racecar fuel sauce
carefully
  how do i make nitromethane  pic related  plz i need for school project  what school
  go back to syria raheem
  you probably live in a fucking western country go take a chemistry course for a year or two
  school project
whats the best way to barricade yourself in the city /diy/
help wanted signs in a black neighborhood    
  go to nyc and tell all the jews there is gold burried under ground
1507228  very thick chains connecting large broken down vehicles and dumpsters works against everything but bulldozers and tanks for those you want concertina wire and 3 steel i beams welded into double tripods/caltrops concrete some into the ground leave others standing run thick chains barbed/razor/concertina wire at random between them    dig a hole 2 feet deep put a 4 foot tall barrel in it fill the barrel with concrete make a row of them separated by 3 feet build 3 layers of rows and it will stop most vehicles maybe even tanks    pits work well and are easy to camouflage but are hard to make without heavy construction equipment and fuel or explosives and sewer systems 40 organized guys with shovels and wheelbarrows  one backhoe dig ramps first and make sure they are wide enough for 2 wheelbarrows    for entances use improvised hesko barriers or lay out shipping containers to form bottlenecks and zigzags and fill them with rubble rocks soil and dense trash build sandbag and rubble protected sentry positions on top so you can see then from all angles at corners have a few low positions to see the undersides and shocks in case they have a car bomb    the bottlenecks should be have more than six turns to prevent a car bomb from breaking a hole in them thats what isis likes to do your barriers should be redundant for the same reason    put at least one layer of sandbags on top of roofs and on the floor of each level to protect hpuses against mortars and grenades same with walls if the floor can handle it put a table above sentry positions and put sandbags on top of it stay at least one foot back from holes broke into the wall when firing to hide your position break holes between rooms so you can see    tear up the stairs and use ropes to climb to different floors    put wire low tables and other tripping hazards across doorways in hallways and just inside rooms
trench sentry positions should have a 1 meter hole dug into the side at the bottom kick enemy grenades into them    make multiple redundant barriers of different types with minimum 1 meter thick sandbag protected sentry positions and an easy/protected way to retreat to the next barrier this protects from front but not back so it cant be used against you but absolutely cover your back entrances and leave multiple ways to retreat    remove all flammable material stockpile it underground protected from water for firewood    being firebombed you need at least 6 feet of earth above you a reinforced concrete or masonry ceiling and walls an airtight fireproof and blastproof door and a tunnel  preferably  2  to somewhere far away with fresh air lay down keep your heart calm and try to relax so you dont breathe so much    if your houses are cardboard boxes like us amerifags the house itself is not an obstacle you can drive through an american house with a light truck    use terrain to your advantage hills are the best places to fight from but the worst place to be in a fire    stockpile food multivitamins medical equipment common medicines like antibiotics fuel and fire making items like matches and lighters you need about 300 pounds of wheat flour 300 pounds of oats and 150 pounds of lard to keep an operation going for month or about 2 pounds of wheat/oats and 1 pound of lard a day per guy it should take 15 guys to man and defend a barrier    you will need a water supply expect muslims and the govt to poison wells keep as many cisterns as you can full before wells are poisoned and live on well water or municipal water until it is cut off    try to have at least 50000 gallons this is the minimum keep gutters repaired to collect rainwater    hunting rifles and shotguns are all you need have 10000 rounds per gun and dont waste them    expect traitors thieves and cowards deal with them fairly and publicly but do not leave them alive
to hide from heat sensing drones sew blackets together and fill them with soil make sure it is sewn so it is evenly spread put these over sleeping areas and fighting positions but you could also spread a few over yourself and shoot from there    best nonwinter camouflage is dark grey tiger stripes on grey green background    keep lookouts for recon drones and mortar drones shoot recons out of the sky with shotguns and rifles take cover from mortar drones    if you take an enemy captive do kot hesitate to torture them for info on the enemy do not leave then alive as they have info on you pigs are a useful food source that can be fed almost anything
      im not op however  id like to thank you for this  one question is there a vehicle or vehicle type that is best for this situation
tires walls are ok ways to improve the blast resistance of barriers you can use piles of them as trip hazards works best when they are bound together with chain or barbed wire only problem is they burn well    best way to build a tire wall is to stack them like bricks pounding rebar into the centers then pour a mix of cement/mortar and rubble into the tire should resist most car bombs    you could leave fields of them 2 or 3 tires deep which will slow down people and stop everything but tanks i would put it beyond any blast walls i have to prevent car bombs from getting close    source lots of isis videos and balkan war stories
if any one interested in donating a case of water to the us army check out my patreon page for our annual us army fundraiser  aidarmycom
  why does the army need aid is the government not using my tax money to fund the army anymore
  small and very quiet motorcycle or toyota pickup truck and lots of welding and mechanical gear for attaching anti aircraft guns garbage truck is surprisingly durable and easily armored if you have a refinery and oil well nearby    your best bet is to get on well with your neighbors and have a large social circle dont worry about strategy just protect your neighborhood
  excellent   would relocating near a hospital or walmart be ideal or would those locatons be targets and avoiding them would be best
  get a simple robust easy to repair pickup truck with a lot of spare parts to be found in the field upgrade the frame and suspension to handle more weight in rougher terrain figure out how to weld an rpg cage and modular ferroconcrete armor on it add gun/gear mounts learn how to hotwire military vehicles
  well if you want first dibs on looting just bring all your buddies with guns and armor best location is most hidden and defensible
  why would the biggest army in the world need money for fucking water        not exactly the situation but thanks great idea with connecting walls using chain
  godspeed frogs
  the chains are literally just connecting big things together in the street the chain itself isnt the barricade the other stuff is the chain holds it together so to push one thing you must push everything connected to it    literally push a line of dumpsters in the street chain them together and then throw tires in them put a few overturned cars on each side and chain them together so the dumpsters cant be wheeled away when the cops try to breach it throw gasoline in each dumpster and light the tires on fire    tire fires are very effective cover from drones helicopters and to a far lesser degree close air support jets    you still need something very tough to bind the chains to cars and dumpsters and shit i recommend you thread the thickest piece of rebar you can find through it twist it back on itself and then twist the two halves together douse the wire in grease mixed with charcoal dust so it catches on fire when someone tries to cut it    you can make a slingshot with a 9 inch pipe thick and long elastic rubber bands zip ties a drill and a file drill 2 holes an inch from the end opposite each other file it smooth then feed the rubber band through it attach the band to the outside of the pipe with zip ties attach a line of cord to the middle of the band    use it by holding the end that doesnt have drilled holes in your hand pull the cord and band back through the pipe then put a rock or fire cracker in it aim the other end if the pipe at the target then guide the firecracker into the pipe  have a buddy light the firecracker and let go of the cord    you can make hundreds of these things for 200 or 300 dollars they have longer range and are more accurate than normal slingshots you could pelt cops muslims or ferals with firecrackers and rocks from behind a barricade you can conceal it while firing to knock out windows while walking
  copy syria     of course the best way is escape the city because those are the worst place to be in shtf
does anyone know what these pipes in the wall are for  i just bought a house and im renovating the fireplace at the moment and im not sure if theyre safe to cut off the hole was covered by an electric one so i missed it at first glance  the copper one in the floor is probably for water but i have no idea about the rest  i might get an expert to look over it but i thought id ask here first any ideas
  heat exchanger for a waterbased heating loop maybe the pipe in the floor is either for makeup water or for gas logs youd have to trace it
  yep i removed some parts of the floor and it looks like the one in the floor is a gas pipe  and it appears that the other two go all the way up to the attic to an empty water tank so you might be right on that one as well  thanks anon that was helpful i think id also get some guy to confirm i can cut it off i dont know much about heating installations so its better to be safe than sorry
in the uk it was not uncommon to have a back boiler behind the fire to supply hot water possibly that
  perhaps theres some poor brickwork on the back wall im gonna take it down as soon as i get a day off from work and update the thread with my results theres so many pipes in this house and half of them are not even in use and yeah im in uk
hi /diy/ i am building a reading desk to prop up large books or a laptop in bed or while sitting down i have pretty good idea of how this should function but i am a bit stuck and am hoping you can help me    i want the table part of it to fold up to hold the book up obviously i am going to put hinges on the bottom of the table piece and connect them to the front of the legs     i was then going to put thin pieces of wood on the under side of the table top attached with hinges that will fold out and rest on the legs my plan is to chisel several different notches in the legs as different resting points for these so that the angle of the table is adjustable     my problem is i dont know where the best place on the back of the table is to attach these to give me the widest range further complicating it i dont know how long they should be pic related is with the table resting flat i will post a second pic in a minute    any advice is much appreciated
  check out sliding slotted stay brackets also youll need some struts between the two bases since the top will be hinged giving no structural support
  thanks yeah i am going to connect the two legs with a piece of wood attached to the top in the front and back     i googled sliding slotted stay brackets and came up with pic related is this what you are referring to can i get these at home depot
here are some important plans i created if my first post was too confusing
  i dont shop there but it seems they have some selection        youd want to replace the screw with a wingnut or buy one with a wing nut or knob already on it theyre for holding open lids but could be used as an infinitely adjustable bracket    your idea is good but id rework it as follows in your drawing the thing wouldnt go past 30 degrees because the red sticks maximum length would be shorter than either other leg of the triangle and itd have one fixed point towards the edge by moving it in it could be shorter and provide a higher angle
  thank you for your reply i was planning on the hinge point being on the bottom side of the table     the height of the table top and the length of the legs are 16 inches my desire is to achieve slightly less then a 90 degree angle with the table in its highest position but i also want to maximize the number of other smaller angles i can use     so my questions are  a where to place the hinge point  b how long should the supports be
  desu id strut up the base screw the top to it and use scraps to mock it up until i liked it if youre going anywhere close to 90 degrees id also add a light weight chain from the top to the base as a hard stop     id think the sweet spot will be around 6 inches of the hings
  pro tip lay is a transitive verb that means that it has to have a direct object in order to work  i laid the book down on the table  i will lay the foundations tomorrow  lie is an intransitive verb and doesnt need an object  i am lying down  i will lie down later  every time you make this mistake you sound retarded its your first language likely your only one learn it
  10 thousand hours in paint because i think this is a better design brush up on elementary school maths for the measurements
i know this is diy but you can save yourself a lot of trouble  
  i looked at all the commercially available bed trays and they all dont angle as high as i want and they are to small to hold the large book i built this for i am almost done with this project and will post pics later
all done
here it is at a lower angle
and here it is flat again and turned around so it could be used as a breakfast tray or whatever
    at first i thought the project was br but then i saw it was for looking at childrens drawings so now its cb
black
good job looks nice but maybe a bit heavy
photo frame hooks    a noob at hanging photo frames how do i hang this frame without it tilting seems like the only place to support the frame is from the black pieces holding the dust cover
  just a guess  the leg with the u cutout hooks over the glass pic and backing before its fixed in the frame
here ya go n00b
  this  i will type slowly so you can understand this next part    and attach it in the center of the frame  that means you must measure   find the center of the length of the top of the frame  length/2center
ive just bought a nice land with my friend and we are about to build a log cabin there   we plan to start next summer but since its hard to imagine we would finish before winter i had the idea that first we should build something like a shed using planks or lath then covering with 100mm styrofoam on the inside and one layer plasterboard and putting in a stove because this could be done in 2 weeks maximum  winters are not really cold here 10 celsius is the coldest but even thats rare
it really depends on how much you are going to use that stove and then if using it how much wood/fuel you would be willing to put into it otherwise 10 is not really a death sentence if sheltered but you should not take it so lightly
  just buy an old mobile home/trailer
  insulate it properly nice thick insulation all across the walls floor and roof
  this i wouldnt even worry about the plasterboard if you get a lot of insulation in there itll hold the heat well which will save you fuel
insulation along with thermal blankets will allow quite a bit of heat retention
  sleep together with nude bodies pressed tightly against one another to conserve body heat and you ought to do alright
  yes thats what we will do
  come on bro you know better you are 10 times better off buying a used camper from craigslist youll have a kitchen stove sink toilet shower storage space for clothes a pantry eating table actual bed couch electrical outlets that are readily powered via solar or a generator its movable etc plus no one said you have to keep the thing if your case you can easily resell it in the spring because people go camping in the spring time living in a shed is a meme a simple used camper is more practical for your situation and you know it open craigslist and start looking
  wouldnt digging a bunker be more warmth
sure you can survive but its going to be miserable to live like that for months unless you are of the rare breed that like that sort of thing    dont get me wrong i have multiple weekends a year in no electricity cabins and enjoy it but months like that sounds horrible
  can you fit a wood burner in a camper
always have the insulation on the outside of your construction when insulate on the inside the condensation point is between the insulation and outer material     properly done drywall plastic wrap insulation outer layer remember that even a pinhole in the wrap will lead to bad results over time use mechanical ventilation with heat recycling if not possible a wood stove and an air intake valve
    a basic construction going from the inside to the outside drywall 5cm of freely set mineral insulation plastic wrap 20cm of mineral wool outwall plate which is taped with elastic tape to be 100 airtight the the outer construction to proctect the outwall plate     its fool proof if you do it right cheap too none of the materials cost much
    when you get advanced you can start with playing around with massive wood solid constructions and stuff like insulated elements     best for you cuckshed would actually be an insulated leca block if you just want to stack legos and be merrily gay but its cheaper with drywall wood and mineral wool
  you can build a little shed for the wood burner and pipe the warm air in through the window
  a bunker  we get it hitler you didnt die in berlin
    so let me get this right   from the outside in  siding xps insulation paper sheathing framing more xps drywall  did i get that right    also why do the tiny home people on yootoob never have actual sheathing its alway siding framing then everything else
  whats this we shit anon you got a mouse in your pocket    1 faggot per cuckshed thems the rules
  probably but showering and shitting is gonna suck unless you have a climate controlled area to do it
  propane heater is probably cheaper and safer to run
  this too if you two arent intimate id build two separate sheds or a condo shed thing with a wall separating them youll hate each other and people in rural areas hate gays or anything that could ve construed as gay like two bachelors cohabitating in a 250 sq ft shed
start your cabin in the winter its a hell of a lot easier to cut/move logs when everything is dead for the year put them in place and finish in the summer     also yes you can live in a shed especially if you have a stove humans are surprisingly good in the cold its the wind that fucks you up seal it good but not so good as to die from your stove and bring lots of blankets you will be fine i lived in an uninsulated pole barn for two years while i built my house wasnt great but wasnt terrible either
  if your socks get wet and you dont take them off you will lose ur feet
  how good are you at building if you are good finish the cabin or at least a livable section if youre not good then building this other structure will take so much of your time that youll never be finished with what you need
  you could build a wooden fence around the shed and dump 5 feet of dry leaves around it build the fence to the door    thats how old timey trappers usedvto keep warm in the winter granted they built temporary cabins partially submerged in the ground first then piled leaves    if you do this dont toss cigarettes or anything burning in the leaves unless you want to burn down your shed
  yes you can watch this video at the 8 minute mark    
  build a cabin to keep warm  dump moisture wicks around it  cant build a fire    sounds real smart
  keep in mind plasterboard is a fire barrier will give you a few extra minutes if anything goes wrong with the fire electric etc
  a fucking meme well you can just frig right off buddy
  there is a good chance it will take longer  use plywood faster cheaper    a faster way is to buy a wall tent then sell it after the cabin is built
  ive just bought a nice land with my friend    you better be fucking this friend and getting ready to settle down and get married  if not it will end badly it always ends badly
skip the shed build the garage first live in the garage until you have other parts finished my grandfather was a custom home builder and on several occasions did this
  possible 100    the question is comfortable and will you feel like quitting the whole endeavor because its so miserable     boatloads of insulation and make sure you have adequate ventilation and a carbon monoxide sensor if youre heating with a stove     i would unironically get one of the harbor freight/princess auto solar kits and batteries for it run lights and laptop during the day run an electric blanket off of the charged batteries at night     anyway like the other anons said camper will probably be better
  shitting is gonna suck  tiny house syndrome    you just dont have enough space to get away from hot mexican farts    one of you will get stabbed in his sleep by the 6th week
    buy prebuilt shed  insulate and weatherproof it  add patio central stove 12v appliances furniture solar panels    sounds like a pricey thing
    tinyhouse  get stabbed  anonymous shed deliberately dirty outside but with strong stabberproof doors and windows  happily sleep way more than 6 weeks
  learn to read or use google translate   one housemate stabbing the other   people only like the smell of their own farts
  this because you need a shop to build a home or anything else efficiently tiny is bad tiny isnt all that cheap either its a dumbfuck meme except when used to beat zoning and building codes    a shipping container makes a great shop in that situation id do what i did and have a power pole placed with a service panel and outdoor 120/240v outlets so i had power from the start fab a man door and mount that in the end opposite the container end doors so you dont have to open those in inclement weather    while living in a container may trigger the sensitive they do make nice tough fireresistant structures you can certainly camp out in id live in mine if i had do you can instantly hang hammocks from the tiedown loops welded to the roof then build the interior at leisure i sleep in a hammock and its comfy as fuck    my bro insulated his shop container on the inside and installed a split ac unit which is super easy when working with steel no humidity issues even in the south
newfag here sorry if im not on the right board  im planning on doing my clothing brand slowly but surely and i wanted to know where could i cop some hoodie and tshirtlike fabric
joann fabrics micheals etc has you covered    but if you legit want to go pro you need to buy direct from the manufacturer in bulk assuming youre doing it right this means freight shipments by the pallet to your door
a fucking fabric store
    good idea the clothing market isnt saturated at all and people love buying random no name branded clothing all the time you seem like youve done your research so i wish you the best     i remember i was just like you a few years ago and i wanted to open a restaurant so i went on /ck/ and asked them where i can buy food they were extremely helpful like people in this thread have already been it must be because 4channel people are much nicer than 4channers
  a fucking fabric store    yes where else do you get fabric dumbass unless you plan to steal it from a factory
    i see what you did there
  but then a homeless kid named ass pizza can draw on a shirt with a hoodie and sell it for 50k so i dont see your point
  i was telling him where to buy it you arrogant piece of shit
  you need to buy direct from the manufacturer in bulk  ok thx bless u
  le brainlet deluxe
  a few years ago and i wanted to open a restaurant so i went on /ck extremely helpful   4channel  im confused and slighlty concerned
hello all i really like the klean kanteen swing cap and ive been trying to find a similar one for my wide mouth hydro flask  none seem to exist while the size of wide mouth lids seems to be standard between hydro flask klean kanteen naglene takeya etc none that ive found are as functional or as pleasant to use as the klean kanteen lid it seems that ill have to make my own  a father of a friend of mine owns a machining shop so ill have access to a lathe but i was wondering if anyone had any experience with making a uh custom lid
i was thinking itd be easy enough to shave a block of 18/8 stainless steel into a scaled up version of the cap which ive disassembled here
  radius gages  bench grinder  hss toolbit for those radii or perhaps a cnc lathe    if you arent super picky about it being exactly the way you want it then you can just use a parting/grooving tool to approximate them curves and sand it out
  how good is the triple tree brand cheapest im not from the us but i want to buy a few  www amazon com/stainlessnoninsulatedleakproofcyclistsrunners/dp/b0762l8vzx/refsr_1_20ieutf8qid1543801203sr820keywordssteelwatercanteen
  i was wondering if anyone had any experience with making a uh custom lid  no when the cap on my water bottle gives out or gets lost i just save the next one and refill it until it dies or i lose it
want to get a drill bit set want the most bang out of my buck as far as quality and amount of stuff i get    mainly getting it for the drill bits and the like 2 inch long screwdriver bits i really dont need any of the other crap but figure wouldnt hurt to have especially if i get it at the same cost    deciding between these three what do you guys suggest             3rd option is a combination of these two dewalt sets        
  go for it
    which one would you pick of the three options im liking the ryobi selection even though its just a bit more but worried about the quality of the bits im not working in construction or anything and will just be using them with house projects but still dont want them breaking at the simplest project
  mainly getting it for the drill bits and the like 2 inch long screwdriver bits    kinda weird combo but if the price is right go for it as for me i wind up buying a set of drill bits every few years so its not like a lifetime investment     if you want to go crazy harbor freight has a set pic of numbered bits with maybe a hundred or more bits of lots of sizes that i only use when i rarely have to make a special diameter hole if you get that set also get a normal set to use for your everyday drilling    also when you get around to buying taps get the set that comes with the correct drill bits and only use them for that        still dont want them breaking at the simplest project    the main way to break drill bits is being too rough with the tiny ones but you can buy a pack of several if you do that a lot just buy something if you are starting out its not like picking out a socket set that you will use for the rest of your life
    yeah the taps is my main focus right now i need to drill holes for my cabinet handles and not sure exactly which one i need so i just want a small set that is pretty much guaranteed to have the right size any tips on how to measure exactly what size im looking for do i measure the diameter or the screw im using or a bit smaller or bigger    that picture has just way too many for my needs i also matter of fact want one to drill through the wall of my house because i want to eventually tun a cable inside to power a security camera but not sure if the ones are long enough but oh well    every time i read a negative article it totally screws with my head and makes me backtrack on a decision i was close to making so the same article that lead me to the ryobi choice had a comment with someone saying it went dull after only a couple uses so now im reconsidering going with the makita or most likely dewalt sets
  yeah the taps is my main focus right now i need to drill holes for my cabinet handles and not sure exactly which one i need so i just want a small set that is pretty much guaranteed to have the right size any tips on how to measure exactly what size im looking for do i measure the diameter or the screw im using or a bit smaller or bigger    by taps i meant tapping holes in metal which does not usually happen with cabinet handles if its a thru hole that the screw passes through and then the screw threads into the handle you want a hole that the screw easily passes through and maybe even a bit larger if the handle has two screws so that the spacing does not have to be precise    allow me to repeat you will not use this drill set the rest of your life and all the name brands are decent you can dull a bit by drilling into something like sheetrock or by drilling into steel incorrectly meaning too much or not enough pressure cutting fluid helps there as does any sort of oil the main thing when cutting steel is that you want it to always be cutting and never just rubbing    you really are over thinking this but thats ok youll learn
you really are over thinking this but thats ok youll learn    yeah im sure youre right thanks for the info
op here i just ordered this     im skeptical about the reviews even though its got a like 4 star rating i feel like ill regret them because a lot of people are saying the bits break easily im going to get them anyways and see for myself but what do you guys think are the reviewers on amazon full of crap anyone on here know about makita drill bits
is it just me or are all the bits thats coated with black absoultly shit    i tried many both black and silverno coating brands and the silvers usually always out perform the blacks by miles in terms of durability and leaving a clean hole    i dont know what it is but i avoid bits that are coated black now
    damn i guess ill need to learn from my own experience but honestly like the look of the black ones better i guess if they just suck ill eventually learn to like the ugly ones that perform better
  i think its not a coating but because they are carbon steel i shoulds know that really by the amount i used in the past    like carbon steel blades they are supposed to be much sharper than normal steel but in my expirience they last one cut before becoming completey blunt they are too brittle unlike the normal silver blades    i wouldnt bother with ryobi for anything not a good rep in the uk anyway    i can vouch for maddax bits being very good though the only packs of bits i steal from work now
    i was considering going with the ryobi 90 piece set but just couldnt risk realing i spent 30 bucks on an entire set that is cheap as hell i figure makita is a step up and if they break then its dewalt left or nobody

  new anon here you need to take all drill and driver reviews with a big grain of salt as its something thats easily misused and broken    screw driver bits wear out and fail thats why they come in bigger packs its nothing to get real worried about  this says its impact rated aka for an impact driver impact drivers beat the living fuck out of driver bits and decrease their life substantially     here is a video showing exactly how they work to give you an idea why      the bits in the kit are full hex shank and they dont actually tend to last very long with an impact driver pic related higher end bits that have reduced shanks and better manufacturing take the torsional stress a lot better they also cost triple what regular bits cost but its what you need with impact drivers whether this kit says impact ready or not    doesnt mean the bits are bad and with a regular drill driver youll strip the bits out before you break them     as for the actual twist drills for drilling holes in that kit they have hex shanks to be put into an impact driver aswellnone of them really hold up well with impact drivers twist drills are frail and when you impact on them they break  with twist drills in general its not hard to snap them with a hand drill or driver one slip of the wrist while its in the hole and the bit is done    with all of that said the bit set you bought was fine but you really need to buy a regular fractional drill bit set in addition to it    of all the cheap drill bit sets ive used dewalts have actually been decent enough i was given a set just like the one you posted as your op pic they would be a perfect starter set i used them as my beater drills in my lathe and my mill  you cant live with just 5 hex shanked drill bits nothing wrong with keeping the makita set and buying the dewalt twist drills too
  its very cheap to put a very poor black oxide type coating on drills therefore most really shitty and cheap drills do it    like you said here    it has nothing to do with the coating just cheap material the bits are made not   not ever carbon steel but mostly 4241 and other low quality high speed steels they will break trying to drill mild steel    a proper black oxide coating on a proper drill bit works well  that doesnt mean that all brite finished shiny drills are good either it just means they paid more to have a better finish put on it    in the production world finishes can matter as some are better suited than others  norse says that black oxide works better for steel while brite works better for aluminum  but in the end regular users like us it doesnt really matter just make sure you get a quality hss set in the first place      the ryobi set is going to be poor in terms of the twist drills at least
  good info cheers
    i should point out that for twist drills4241 hss is your crappy wood only bits m2 is your standard hss that you should be looking for m7 hss is better hss cobalt even lasts longer  the problem is most companies dont tell you what grade steel they use until you start looking into real drill brands    i know menards sells m2 titanium coated bits under the masterforce name that go on sale routinely im guessing the dewalts are m2 because they work quite well
got the makita b43044 set    not had a single bit drill or impact fail in 15 years of various projects can recommend i think    came free with my impact driver so hard to say how much id pay for it
  oh worth noting  no concrete or ceramic bits so get those separate
    after all the advice you went for the homeowner shitbox    have fun learning anon
  6 of those bits are ones you can get in a every day screw driver kit
    after all the advice you went for the homeowner shitbox    after all what advice first response was literally just go for it    next couple responses were a bit more useful but not pertaining to the three items i was willing to select from i mean im just not into harbor freight yet even though i appreciate the suggestion apart from that no more advice or suggestions as far as brand or products were given so i ordered     dont get me wrong i appreciate any advice i got and the gentlemen that did manage to enlighten me to something i like is that i shouldnt be paying too much attention to all this drill bits will break and its not like ill have them forever so screw it no pun intended i just rolled dice and like i said earlier in this thread im willing to use this as a learning experience so if it turns out to be a crappy set of bits then oh well
  ive got that set i like it because it fits in my case for my drill and impact driver the smaller bits are no more or less brittle than any other bit ive used they all have to be brittle if theyre going to be hard enough to cut i snapped one but i was being stupid and using it wrong and they had two at that size luckily
    get a set of self centering drill bits for cabinet hinges you will thank me later
    are they really as greasy as the reviews say they are i am planning on wiping them down when i first get them
  coating doesnt matter at all for cordless drill use or homegamer    the idea is to reduce friction and chip weld to get more holes out of each bit reducing down time etc  to get the most out coating has to match the material your working on    but with a hand held tool you fuck the drills cutting edge 10 times faster than it would wear out on a machine  drilling/tapping aluminium/plastic just use a dab of booze or wd40  oil on steel    tabs i wouldnt buy anything beside hssco    is you want to be accurate you pre drill with a center drill from a lathe
  yeah let me just chuck up my cabinet in my 9 lathe
  what
    the best option is just using a hinge center punch   i dont find center drills to work all that well outside of a lathe
op here got the set and used it what really sucks is that i paid 24 and today its freakin 17
  where did you buy them at a lot of stores will give you the difference back when sonething goes on sale within a week or two of buying it depends how bad you want that 7    i got this stupid ass bit set for like 15 awhile back didnt need them and i havent used a single one theyre pretty decent bits though the gold drill bits hold up a lot longer than these bd and ryobi branded sets i was using
    amazoncom i was considering getting the one in your pic but figured it was too much for me starting off    depends how bad you want that 7    yeah im not going to fight over it i ultimately make a purchase based on what its worth so i still think i got a fair price just wasnt great like the 17 dollars it is now oh well    are ryobi really pretty bad i already know black  decker is no where near dewalt of makita so dont even consider them was considering a big cheap ryobi set but couldnt live with myself if they turned out to be pure garbage and i needed to toss it and get a new set
  the ryobi set is old i bought it mostly because it had some masonry bits in it plus a couple spades its not as bad as the cheap no name its the old blue red and yellow ryobi label so they may have changed suppliers by now    i have been happy with these milwaukee bits so far too theyre expensive at full price but you can always find a set on sale for 1015 off i dont abuse phillips bits like a contractor but you can tell the difference between these name brand ones and the cheap drive bits    dont overthink it drill bits are consumables anyway the set you got is fine im sure and after you wreck some of the bits you can try a new milwaukee set and judge if its worth the extra 1020 to you if you start drilling lots of steel then you cab get down on a cobalt hss set because none of those tool brand sets are made for that
    i will give milwaukee stuff a shot soon ive lived my whole life up until recently here on diy only hearing about makita dewalt and ryobi stuff ive probably seen milwaukee stuff around but never paid attention to them i guess theyre underrated but hear a lot of guys on here praise them
  they have the best lineup of tools definitely the way to go for mechanics who dont want to pay the snap on beyond that for a basic drill you can close your eyes and pick one from mikwaukee dewalt or makita and it will be the same shit at the same price level    and milwaukee and ryobi are the same companies but ryobi is geared towards /diy/ guys while milwaukee is supposed to be made for the workplace so that branding might be the same with the drill bits that ryobi bit set is definitely better than the bd sets
    milwaukee impact bits are complete trash dont fall for the hype read some reviews   i ignored them and ive eaten them all up quite quickly
    
i will never buy another bit set that isnt makita gold     an old boss of mine bought me this kit more than two years ago and the only bits gone are ones i lost     i am in the building trades and am using my drill/impact gun ever day i love my milwaukee stuff and my dewalt imact gun most of all but i have stripped out dewalt screw driver bits quick as shit ive used plenty of other brands i am sure impact and not and they all strip eventually    these makita golds are the fucking best try them guys i swear by them     also more into your question op dewalt bits suck imho they dull and break easy as shit in my opinion same with their sawzall blades
    get a sutton tools kit if you can     australian made super sharp  super strong carbide steel
just buy 10 dollar drill index and get the driver bits you need individually from a hardware store for 20 cents a piece
  i mostly bought it because i liked having the drill bits good assortment of driver bits and the square adapter all in one set so i can grab the 12v drillimpact bag and that one box and dont need to bring a big tool bag to fix some shelves or whatever they seem to fit/grip
     but i cant really comment on longevity yet i got them for like 10 so whatever and milwaukee review are goofy because so many of the comments are from fanbois who hate dewalt      i might try these next i grabbed the gold tm 1/4 hex to 3/8 square wobble adapter but havnt exactly abused it yet i like the gold dewalt drill bits a lot but the regular grey driver bits arent anything special its going to take me so long to burn through all of those bits
    no one cares fuck off faggot
    you are such a flaming attention whore why not take the plunge and make youtube videos you know youre dying to
  its 4chan dude everyone talks out their ass if its what you need then get it and dont feel bad about what some anon thinks of it
    he would nonironically fit in much better at reddit how the fuck he wound up here is a mystery
1505556    you
  you know he is right otherwise you would have posted an actual rebuttal instead of a deflection
    nice logic
  ive tried the makita gold bits before they look cool but ive found the tips of the bits underneath the tin coating are very soft and wear out and soon as the gold coating is gone     milwaukee shockwave bits are still the best ive used they last forever and the tips maintain their shape after loads of abuse
  go on and explain in detail
  hey bby       checked
what is a good set of drill bitsfor wood projects    im talking makingaholeinwood making drill bits not impact driver screw/socket driving bits you guys keep showing    drill bits hole saws spade bits
  wood is soft you can drill it with blank steel rod probably  buy a spade bit any spade bit for anything over say 12mm whatever the cheapest you can get that is the best
  oh god why did they do that to his neck
  regular ticoated bits seem to last forever in wood the expensive hss is for harder materials but like this anon said  the spades are pretty good for 1/21 otherwise get some hole saws for the bigger stuff as long as youre drilling the hole all the way through
  it depends on exactly what you are doing and what type of wood you are drilling    wood is softish and wont really walk when you start but can waller out the hole as it hits grain  regular twist drills and spade bits work ok but not great    buy brad point drill bits and forstner bits are far superior
i purchased a foreclosure and am in the process of renovating it but need some help basically whoever owned it before abandoned their dogs for what smells like weeks if not longer and the whole house smells almost unbearably of pet     i have done the following and while it isnt as strong the odor remains    professionally sanitize  clean ducts  sealed walls with zinsser shellac  ripped out most flooring  upstairs and down some lower hardwood remains    if i cant get rid of the odor i am screwed so hoping one of you can help
  enzyme cleaners and a week of rented ozone generators running 24/7 then flip it in the spring when its comfortable to open all the windows
  do ozone generators work ive heard mixed feedback
  i would have though ripping out the flooring would have been the end of it what do they do for houses that reek of smoke
  yeah the dog piss is in everything it seems
    stop spending money on chemicals the one thing you can do to rid the smell is just gut the fucker and redo the drywall dog piss just seeps everywhere and no chemical in the world can return that house to smelling normal again      i suppose that once you gut it you could spray down the studs that show stain signs but you wont know until you rip it all apart
be me  work as teacher at small tech school  only thing to eat on campus is a cafe that is open 5 hours week   one soda machine   used to have candy machine but it broke 3 years ago  pawn shop nearby has nice candy machine that fits my needs for 350    anyone with experience maintaining these wont have refrig will be bolted down and in a very secure location
  now bear with me for a minute this might strike you as revolutionary but i want you to hear me out its two words and holy shit despite what you might hear a majority of the free world partake in this ritual every day are you ready    packed lunch    ill let that settle for a minute and heres the best bit it is not complete rubbish junk food it can literally be anything you want you just put it in a container and take it right the fuck with you ill leave you to regather the remains of your blown mind anon thanks me later
  some hippy would put one of these at my work we would just shake the shit out of it pussy little bitch wouldnt say anything lol
  packed lunch  unironically the best thing since sliced bread
sounds like a good idea providing a lacking service and make a little profit shouldnt be too difficult to maintain
  350  hmm thats not bad    theres another option that a lot of people do with our company if you order from them they will give you free vending machines and cooler because they figure they will make up the money by you overpaying for deliveries every week    but a lot of people will open up an account get their machines and coolers and then place the bare minimum order to keep the account open so they get 10k worth of coolers loaned to them and place a 120 order every two months and that 120 gets you product that would cost 80100 at a restaurant supply store so it ends up being like youre paying about 200/yr to rent the machines and have them serviced and repaired by the company as well in the meantime you go and buy the product to refill it from costco or whoever has it the cheapest on sale and make a few quarters back on that    or you can call up a vending company and have them install refill and service the machine you will never see any money from it but you dont have to do a damn thing
   this post required a trip  we know its not hard for you change them you do it all the time how is it any harder to simply clear the name field entirely you retarded cunt
   as teacher at small tech school    own machine selling food to students    make sure youre allowed to do that
  pawn shop  theres maybe reasons its in a pawnshop in the first place quite apart form the probity of teachers installing their own vending machines as noted they can be temperamental pita still if tech school should come clear with it but id advise maybe siting it in a staffonly area at first runin test throw it in allareas accessible anyone with a grievance be sending queues after you for nonexistent refund claims and shit tbqh would not operate in own place of work under any you just begging for a meeting where difficult questions will be raised
  i used to have a couple at an office i worked at pretty easy to maintain but if its not refrigerated and you stock candy bars make sure you put it in a cool area costco sams and gfs is where i would stock up on inventory made about 500 per month on two of them also caught a sales nog trying to steal and got him fired
    the thing about packed lunch is people like the idea that they eat healthly so they will pack decent food the vending machine offers them garbage that they crave and is easily available
  i use a super secret browser app that defaults to a trip every post and i cant turn it off only change it    my moms boyfriend blocked 4channel on all the regular browsers so i have no other option
  yep this is why people want you gone you arrogant faggot heaps good you gunna delete this post as well
  op could totally bank running a machine like these grainger ones too put chalk and white board markers and pens in there we got one a couple years ago with pens and gloves and sharpies in there and its nice
  as well  i think you gots me confused with somebody else
  oh so you didnt delete this because you got called out for being a faggot even mods are starting to delete your shitposts
  kek nah didnt delete that one i think the salinity of a few uptight fags on this board caused it to erode away
  i think the salinity of a few uptight fags on this board caused it to erode away    youre cool but you are not as cool as you think you are and thats your downfall we suck for the most part that is true but youre not the awesome god you think you are    keep trying
  did they ever get the lugnut off     mine is still stuck
  wow do you actually think anyone likes you
some of his shitposts are pretty alright
  i want vending some machines in my living room  something about getting snacks and drinks from a machine is so satisfying  also would like to have one of those coffee vending machine that serves hot coffee i those little paper cups
bump
  see you can drop the trip when you want to not that bad is it
  ahhh the joy of muh anonymous taiwanese knitting forum that post was probably me but theres a chance it wasnt we will never know      my mom says she loves me
  bootlicker
   tripfag   shitposting    like clockwork
  i for one welcome our new machine overlords
  my friend trained his do to open the fridge and get him a beer you could go that route
  your biggest fears is hackers
before the invention of that flap door it was hard times for the vending machine owner
  i dont even need to call you out on this utter bullshit  not only did this not happen we all know you dont have any friends why else would you be on here constantly shitposting trying to impress internet strangers
  youre right he was more like a friend of a friend went to hs with him and then when we were around 20 his parents moved out of the house and left dude alone in this 500k700k house so we partied there a lot    the doggo thing is true though he hung a rope from the fridge handle so doggo could pull it open and grab a can of beer/soda and bring it to him sitting on the couch i dont know how long it took to teach doggo but it happened    and real talk i only ended up on 4chan after moving halfway across the country and leaving all my homies 1400mi away
    in 1962 baker established the servu corporation with his friend fred black the company was designed to provide vending machines for companies working for programs established under federal grants though a part of numerous other deals involving both politics and private financial affairs this particular business venture would cause a scandal    just stop guize before you go to jail like bobby baker
we need one of these in our shop  filled with beer joints single cigarettes and beef jerky
  itll probably get choked to death by a cop for resisting arrest
  no it will get broken by somebody with the munchies who was was so high he couldnt find his wallet    or get taken away after they had to call the fire department a dozen times in the past week because somebody got their arm stuck in it      he thinks bepis is the one who shits up the board
pack a lunch you nigger i work for a vending company and parts for those fuckers is expensive get ready to get raped on prices if anything breaks they do often
  i use to maintain 3 snack machines besides product pushers snapping off the door switch getting stuck and the plexi getting its shit pushed in when a 500 lb gorilla wants some free chips there really wasnt many maintenance issues most expensive things to break was the dollar bill module and a new one was around 150 bucks also a rail one of the trays slide on broke but that was a quick weld job
   someone farts in an elevator    its the fault of the occupants not the fucklord who farted  tripcunt logic everyone
  sometimes you just gotta fart and if two people in elevator start making a scene and screaming and crying like children i would rather deal with that shit smell than the whiney kids
  sometimes you just gotta fart    bepis saves his farts up all day until he gets on the /diy/ elevator then he locks it between floors and brraaaaaaaaappp
  i think the point that anon was trying to make is that if you are a polite person you will adhere to the conventions of the social environment you are in in this case not being a tripcunt on a board that values information above all else which just happens to exist on a website whos very fabric is woven from the ideal of anonymity trumping all else we dont give a fuck who you are and if you force an identity in the face of 24/7 resistance you are a turd in our whiskey and will be treated as such     being the egotistical cum stain you are it is absolutely no surprise whatsoever that you need this explained to you    so feel free to go buy more tools that you will never use on projects that you will never post because they will never exist post cringeworthy retorts to people calling your bullshit out and make a smart arse reply to this post for good measure the one good thing about a trip is it lets people see a pattern of behavior and the more you do it the more the pattern is established keep on digging that grave faggot
   but removing my trip is haaaard  why are tripcunts so cancerous
  if you cant hold a fart in for the duration of an elevator ride youre either a cunt you have health issues or your dildo has ruined your ass
  if you cant hold a fart in for the duration of an elevator    
  and if two people in elevator start making a scene and screaming and crying like children i would rather deal with that shit smell than the whiney kids  but theyre not are they they are going to think who the fuck is knuckle dragging faggot that dropped that bomb check out who is the only person that is not reacting then tell everyone in the office what a knuckle dragging faggot that guy is    literally    we had a guy at a previous work place who was renowned for crop dusting the tech room a relatively small space as compared to the much larger office which would allow the stench to dissipate much more readily we called him zyclon b he was a cunt just like you
  the latter      have you seen the questions i ask do you think im capable of making that
  who was renowned for crop dusting    mfw the prince just dusted the lower forty
  we all bepcuck nao
  nice give anon lol
  lol
  my bro bought one for a gym id yank the purple power aid out and fill it with beer a lot
  my lab does that took about a month casually training him    that qas 7 years ago and a terrible idea as it turns out labs fucking love bee and he learned to bust it open    i forgot to shut the door one day came home to the door open my 30 pack all over the floor shit everywhere and my dog stumbling into shit was fucking rediculous
  genious
  and you damned sure want to maintain them people will wreck your shit over that stolen dollar
  any other maint tips op here
  i am considering buying a brand new one even if it takes two years to recoup the cost i can handle what is really nice is the building is very secure and only open when people are around wish it was 24 hours but i dont mind having it be secure      i am in final negotiations with the school to put it in
  kys
  this is a legit option  took some tech classes in a local community college in the central intersection of the building there was a machine with pens pencils scantron blanks packets of notepaper and other sundries along with some hard candies and mints etc    this was a great aid as the library was always closed in the evenings when i was there and i needed a pen and paper to get through class when i didnt have my normal materials on hand iirc most of the pens and pencils were shrinkwrapped to little slips of cardboard so the machine could handle it also cheaper obv
where can i get a vending machine for snacks and drinks in my living room
  didnt plan the word spacing correctly  did nothing wrong  pick only one
  they werent really tips if you can troubleshoot and fix basic appliances you can fix these things    tips for running the machines would be keep claim forms and contact info on the machine for when it eats someones money because it will     put a camera in it if you cant put the machine somewhere already monitored    keep a row for expiring soon markdowns and aggressively rotate product there getting half from a bag of chips is still a net win over throwing out a bag of chips and itll drive people to your machine looking for deals
  where can i get a vending machine for snacks and drinks in my living room    google refrigerator and normal life
  i dont even know what a normal life is anymore
  this     getting permission is the first hurtle    theres usually a contract agreement with the manager of the facility/school an agreed split of profits or space rental fee     generally you will also need a retail business license and pay taxes    in my state the mafia runs all vending machine  locations youll know if this is true in your area if you or your vending machine get hit with baseball bats as a warning

  its a /ck/ bait thread ck have been putting stealth bait threads on other boards lately because people are too used to the bait in their own board
im stripping ancient and hideos wallpaper out of a room in my house while pulling a strip part of the wall came up with it to my surprise theres a second layer under the plaster wall it feels like concrete but i can tell its thin    how do i fix this drywall mud maybe i need to paint this room
yeah dude get some sheet rock compound give it skim coat sand it and paint it  ezpz
  sounds like an artex layer to me
  you just pulled the finish coat off the second coat     mist the exposed second coat lightly with water wait ten minutes and skim coat it sand the next day vacuum it clean and drag another coat if needed to fill any voids repeat sand and vacuum paint
isnt that just the plaster base coat that fills in the lath keys
  ill give this a try never done work like this before but thank god for youtube im hoping i can skim coat around the base board and have it look good the plaster is peeling all the way down      sounds about right
is there any way to make a diy wind tunnel for as cheap as possible
  straw blow through it
  bruh are you fucking kidding me get a variable speed fan jam it in a duct of some sort and put a net or something in front of it to get the flow laminar
  straws pull air through them with a fan
  dry ice a few fans vacuum chamber
  a net in front of it  you dont need anything to make a laminar flow wind tunnel you just need a bigass fan set to succ instead of blow
  just get some cfd software nigger
  i made one out of plaster paris a box fan and a bunch of those homers paint buckets from home depot
  i made one out of a toothpick nail file and halfeaten rubber band let me know if you need help
    this but unironically a bundle of cut straws makes a fine flow straightener
  a bigass fan set to succ instead of blow  so flip the fan around you mean  set to suck  toppest keks
  what wind speeds are you trying to get and for how long
  there are two important things for a wind tunnel  getting the chamber big enough so that your objects flow doesnt interact with the walls  measuring lift and drag independently and accurately    go look up the wright brothers wind tunnel plans for inspiration
anybody do anything dank with their slink
haha got kicked off of /g/ so now hes here
does this work or is it a meme
ive used a dremel attachment that does the same and it works pretty well just dont expect much from it in terms of flexibility cant say anything about this particular one though
i used a cheap chinese knockoff one it worked but broke quite quickly
  ended up using this
  does this work or is it a meme    probably both you might use that once every 20 years
  you might use that once every 20 years    i used this twice yesterday  it gets behind stuff and at angles a straight extension cant reach  hvac work  repairing a furnace yesterday  had to have it taking it apart and again when going back together  i damaged one through abuse impact driving  theyre pretty tough
  that looks like a good way to get brutally slapped in the face
  ive got this one from ryobi and it works great ive used it to drill 1/2 holes with a paddle bit with no problems
  used 1 yesterday to snug up a 2000s f150 coil pack
  dont cheap out    theres this generic chinesium one that is sold under like 100 different brand names on amazon half the reviews are people who havent really used it the other half are people who used it once and it broke anybody who used it and didnt break it is probably running it on a 14v bd drill with a half dead battery    also think about it if you use it on a drill the entire thing is going to twist and will be a bitch to keep straight if you want to put any torque through it the slightly better ones sometimes have a little handle but they wont fit in the same tight spots an impact may solve this slightly but will shred the gearing if its a cheap one
  works great  really gets to the gspot
  stuff like this work but theyre very limiting on the max torque so all in all its usually not worth getting it out of the box
  this is whats actually inside ops right and the one in op isnt just a air/spray lube thing withbit drivers shoved in the ends
  the worst every one ive ever used has twisted itself up when i put any serious torque on it thats just driving phillips screws with a 1/4 bit too
  this is whats actually inside ops right  i doubt it the wire rope one i have is much too stiff to bend into a u like ops  the pic is posted was just the first one of the type i have  mine is actually a calhawk csdfebh  pic related  i was pleased to see the spare ring and ball included that holds the bit in the end  ive used it a lot and havent needed the spare yet
  the pic is posted  the pic i posted earlier 
i use pic related i tried one kinda similar to ops pic and it immediately broke the first time i tried to drive a screw in the dewalt one works pretty good and ive had my impact go full torque into it hundreds of times and its still going it does reduce the torque delivered to the fastener sometimes a lot if its really bent up i usually use it once a month so its handy those times
i have a yard tractor i use for plowing in the winter i have used chains in the past on the rear and it worked well but because its a hydrostatic drive when i lift off the forward pedal too fast it more or less locks up the drive wheels and skids grinding the chains on the paving id like to avoid tearing up the paving at my place and a few others i do so id like to try to get away from chains if possible has anybody used something like pic related or would i be better off trying to get atv tires and a second set of rims    the other problem is that here in north eastern maryland we get tend to either get a dump of light fluffy snow which is no problem to push or a few inches of wet heavy slush which the plow is ideal for moving only problem is when i push too far it builds up and the front end starts to wash out not sure if anybody makes an atv style tire that size so i may be stuck with turf tires would something like a small hpattern chain on the front help stop it from washing out
you could just lift off the throttle slowly rather than using it like a switch
hydrostat drives dont do that you limp wristed tea drinker
  well if you want to be a dickhead we can get into the semantics and ill point out that the pedal doesnt control the throttle and speeding the engine up and down everytime i need to stop or start is going to get old in a hurry and isnt great for the engine more to point when pushing heavy slush you need to keep momentum up to help prevent the front end from washing       well faggot this one does why the hell respond to the thread if you think im just a fuckface who doesnt know anything other than you just want to try to show youre smarter than everyone what i meant is not that it actually literally locks up the tires but they effectively act as if youre pressing the brake heavily heavily enough to cause the tires to cause the tires to slip grinding the chains along the pavement     how stupid on me to think anyone might have a useful piece of information
  chill out fucker   see if theres a valve on the hydro system that you can adjust i dont mean a knob on the dash like some models have i mean a bolt to dial back the shut time on the hydrotrans maybe look into adjusting some of the linkages on the foot petal that makes the petal a little softer
  sorry its been a long day and i came back hot not sure if it can be easily adjusted ill have to check thanks for the suggestion
  hey look a woman that pushes snow  take your mood swings to tunatown princess
hydrostat pedal dont spring up and lock the tires you chucklehead troll that lame bullshit on the tractor forum for non tractor fags like yourself
your tires slide because there is ice on the drive you fucking retarded faggot pushing snow with a lawnmower
chains slide on pavement unlike a rubber tire  how goddamn stupid are you grandpa
  sorry its been a long day and i came back hot  waaaaaaaaaah
  they make cables instead of chains   cavles would be fine
  wtf speeding and slowing the engine is totally fine for it
    well if you want to be a dickhead we can get into the semantics and ill point out that the pedal doesnt control the throttle    but it controls the angle of the drive pump snap it shut and the pump angle returns to 0 which with forward motion means that the transmission is fighting to keep the wheels nearly static but you are still moving forward kind of like a harsh transmission lockup    try it when you are out remove your foot from the pedal slowly and watch the magic happen
  they dont snap shut buckwheat  goddamn you people are stupid
  the rubber things are junk you could buy less aggressive chains tho really youre better off buying an atv with a blade or just get a snow blower a mower is about the worst tool for the job for several reasons
as all machines have limits for best performance and operation from what symptoms you are describing your asking more from the machine than it can deliver in power and or performance adjust your operation/demands better to what the machine is capable ofif you need more then get a bigger machine
i tried being nice and you sumbitches got rude fuck this place
  a second set of rims is the best way to go for the front tires get rib type tires attached is an example of what they look like
  do you have any fluid in the tires yet you can buy a tool to remove the valve stem core and then put a anti freeze mix in with 3 or 4 gallon per tire thats up to another 70 pounds for traction
i use atv tires in all seasons plenty of mud mower info on youtube totally worth it would do again
  listen to this guy op calcium chloride can sometimes be found cheaper than antifreeze too    its worth noting that doing this will rust the shit out of your wheels but you can easily get 5 years out of them and new wheels arent all that expensive for small tractors
i thought he was plowing rows but then figured out he was plowing snow and quit giving a shit
  yeah the amish next town over make these things vid related and they blow the sheez out of chains all day i got a pair for free when they got a new machine and had some defectives and they still work awesome i would have used more curse words enthusiastically recommending them but not sure what 4channel allows  
i screwed up /diy/ how do i fix this
push the wire back in to the contact and glue on top so it doesnt fall out
  how do i fix this    tap on the screen to make your camera focus before you take the picture
  thats the best focus i could get since its so small had to hold the camera back and digital zoom it      i realized that the connecting pins are perpendicular to the wire i first thought i had to get it back in the hole thats about the size of pin getting the wire back into the slot then pressing it down and carefully reattaching to the motherboard did the trick    now that im no longer shitting bricks heres the pokeball without the safety strap and now the sound/rumble works again
  pop out the contact with a pin/pick desolder it resolder wire snap back into fitting
how can i make and program a robot to pick up the dog poop in my backyard is it even possible
feeding thousands of pictures of dog shit into an ai to train it to recognize poop  i guess you can
something like a poop roobmbaa poomba if you will
  lol ur a tensorflow fag lrn2machine vision you twat
    what about smell like a sensor for a methane or whatever compound can be detected for awhile after a warm dookie is dropped    tfw the robot is perma trying to fist your dogs asshole as it hones in on the methane
  heres a parts list      
best case scenario youre signing yourself up to maintain a robot thats been out in the backyard eating dogshit for a week
  is it possible  yes and getting/making the hardware for it is easy but programming software that will do the job will be a massive pain in the ass
10 year lead time 6 if youre an asshole
  just mod out a yard roomba
      if you really wanted to keep your yard clean you could do the following    mount camera at high angle overlooking yard  i forget what its called off hand but it uses previous images of the same area to detect changes in the image  use basic geometry to direct robot to location and pick up object    im pretty drunk right now opencv has some tutorials though
  over thinking op needs to just do his damn chores and stfu
  i mean theres code already available and hi res cameras are cheap but yeah i get it
  lol i expected this to be the first answer but people are giving legit tips im impressed
  get a robovac for the house throw a shop vac on it bigger tires turn the bitch loose
  lol    he doesnt have a front yard a back yard and a dog yard    insufferable citicucks how do you live i own half a city block and hate living in my sml town so much i bought a camper and fucked off to the woods
  that takes too much time its easier to just tape a plastic bag behind the dog then just collect and retape new bag
  robot escapes into sewer    that sounds like it would just make the robot attempt to grab at shadows or dandelions or whatever else might be different maybe it would just stand there and make grabbing motions because the color of the grass changed too much and the robot thinks the entire backyard is a giant shit
  that would be a lot more work than just picking it up yourself
  its cold outside
  if u need to ask how to do it you dont know enough to be able to do it  basicly use a rc digger rig it with a thermal camera use image processing to detect it maybe with machinelearning and then overwrite the rc controls to make the digger do what you want
anything automated will just end up being a disgusting box full of weeks worth of shit youd be better off training the dog better or using some sort of poop a scoop or inventing a better scooper or like a litter tray or something
  my god dog people are disgusting and youre lazy on top of that
  flir   you just answered your own question
  program it to watch the dog in idle hone in on the smaller signature and wait 30 seconds until the dog has moved to go get it     i know nothing about ai so i dont know how difficult this would be     but overall flir seems to be the best bet to find poo in the yard rather than a methane sensor that is succeptable to wind   you could maybe integrate one into it to confirm its actually picking up shit though or maybe a heat sensor or something
  mount flir on racing drone  butterfly net type apparatus with poop bag mounted on drone  hovers and watches for crowning dog logs  as soon as that prarie dog starts peak out of its burrow racing drone is hovering with butterfly net under doggos tail  catch that dookie before it can even hit the ground and rub its stink on your kentucky bluegrass
  slice the dogs asshole open spraying blood and shit everywhere
anything less than perfect operation of the scooping mechanism every time will result in shit getting squashed into the scoop and mechanics have fun cleaning that up
  this could be popular in india and san francisco
  train dog to poop in toilet just program autoflush on exit get 2 birds stoned at once
  replace dog with robot  problem solved    why anyone would spend their time going around picking up animal feces is beyond me  the absolute state of humans no wonder the aliens wont come down and introduce themselves
  catch your dogs nuts in the bag  yanks your dog in the air by the nuts when it pulls away from the shit catching
  
  man what ever happened to robot jones
  underestimated
  this is doable probably with the same effort as making a dog shit covered robot that could mistake your foot as shit however without the lucritave possibilities   if you made a robot that could do this people would pay 500 for it easily
  honestly just having a remotecontrolled robot with multiple toolings  mounted cameras would make even more jobs easier hell mount the thing to a lawnmower fetch your mail with it attach an extendable ladder whatever you feel like making it useful for
  why bother just build a robotic lawn mower and attach a poo scooper device to the back of it two birds one stone
  thats big brain
maybe you could instead learn some plumbing and make a type of squat toilet with sloped sides and with a timed flush or motion sensitive flush train the dog to shit and piss in there it would be easier to clean because you could just blast a hose at it if any didnt go down the hole   any sort of roomba device would end up getting very messy and be more work than regular yard cleaning
  i can do it in 5
  have it use an infrared camera and pick up hot things
  put some sort of dye in the dog food
im redoing my room taking everything out painting the walls and getting new furniture all that stuff room hasnt changed much in the last ten years all ive done is add a futon and that kinda sucks because there was hardly space for it and i cant really use it gonna be getting a new tv desk dressers lots  what i really want to know is replacing a lamp with led strips a viable alternative for lighting a room im a shitter when it comes to this stuff just looking into it ive always been interested in it figured id just line the top of the room with them but does it work for replacing a lamp or is it not worth it to do that should i just line my desk or my tv with the led strip and be done with it
doing a single bump before i head off to sleep thanks in advance for any replies
unironically doing the same thing anon just give it a shot why not
dont use led strip as a primary light source except in small confined areas like display cases everywhere else use it as a highlight it just doesnt have the power to light up a room like a normal light bulb
  whys that even if it borders the whole room
  it just doesnt have the power to light up a room like a normal light bulb    well that depends on the number of leds vs the number of light bulbs and the wattage of each leds can be spread as well which is sometimes desirable when you want to have uniform illumination
  led strip is pretty low voltage and doesnt carry a lot of current the light output per led is small and doesnt reach very far the light output doesnt add like how you believe it does      im assuming the average cheap led strip from aliexpress higher power ones exist sure but at that point a normal light fixture is probably the same price and less of a pain to deal with
  if ive got an 11x12 room roughly would bordering the ceiling cause it to be dim or something
  yes
  even if they arent aliexpress cheapshit
    whatever they are you can run two strips if you like or any number of ways to have ideal illumination from leds that other guy is an led hater and we must shun him
  alright so youd recommend two strips i figure thats what im going to need if i end up doing this id need about 46 feet give or take and they make strips up to like 35 feet or so is connecting them hard what additional stuff am i going to have to buy
  so youd recommend two strips    that depends if its cheap as hell and takes a month to ship then order a lot what i would do with my amazon prime two day shipping is order a decent amount and see how it works then order more if i need it
  ive got prime so ill probably order two or three strips one of a smaller size i guess for other stuff in my room thanks anon am i going to encounter any dimming or will it not be noticeable
  am i going to encounter any dimming or will it not be noticeable    my understanding is that leds all degrade over time and the rate is related to the current more current  faster degradation
  gotcha ill be using the stuff that comes with the lights themselves since im ordering kits but thanks for the info i just read that if a strip is too long itll dim part of it
  if a strip is too long itll dim part of it    in that case you can cut the strip and run additional power lines to it at least thats what i read somewhere long strips can have excessive voltage drop on the builtin lines so running additional lines should solve that issue and you can route them along the other led strips so they are not visible
  so all ill need is additional power adapter for each time i cut the strip right
    one power supply can drive everything if it has the current capacity
  get a dimming circuit and run it a little below max
  but how do they hook up if the strips are cut or split sorry im just new to all this
    every foot or whatever there are markings for cuts you strip off the silicone to solder to the gold contacts
  the cheap strips on amazon are 72 lumens per foot so 11 feet will be about the brightness of a 60w bulb do it on all four walls  youre good     they really degrade with temperature if they run too hot to touch youll want to mount them on a strip of aluminum
  yeah do what you suggest and then start reading war and peace at night and get back to us when you reach chapter four
  yeah do what you suggest and then start reading war and peace at night and get back to us when you reach chapter four    interesting reply what the everloving fuck were you trying to say consult a human before replying if necessary
  mood lighting is not task lighting     it may look cool as fuck but youre going to have a headache if you try to read
  mood lighting is not task lighting    are you saying that the leds in the strips are somehow always inappropriate for general lighting as compared with led light bulbs i can understand if youre thinking those rgb installations
  better ask your mom first
  would you suggest using splitting the strips into 11 foot strips or just running the whole thing and connecting where need be
op pic related is an example of white led strips at max brightness the light does not travel far along the ceiling it will not travel far when they are pointed down your room will be in perpetual half gloom
  if your supply has the wattage just run it all in one
its possible but you have to use specialorder high lumen leds they are not cheap        if you want to use the cheap ones youre going to be limited to accent or mood lighting
  could run double or triple strips of the dimmer stuff
led strips will not light your room  they do not cast enough light far enough
  if you want to illuminate the room hang one of these from each corner of the ceiling the one in the center of the ceiling
  its light it travels in a line until it hits something
  no
  yeah lighting your room with laser light
  gonna agree with this guy    this style led is are more for accent lighting think about putting it above the crown molding on an entertainment center or above cabinets to create a glow effect you can use this as an indirect source of lighting
  i hope this is bait
  no it will be bright aliexpress ones are plenty and 99 of sellers online are just resellers of aliexpress lights  make sure to get at least 5050 size leds or brighter  also the light will be harsh unless you diffuse it with something raw leds  eye balls  small room  no fun
  not true you can get extremely bright ones for example the bridgelux eb series gen 2 which comes in 1 2 or 4 foot strips that produce over 1000 lumens per foot double that if you run them at their maximum rated current at an efficiency of 180 lumens per watt and have a guaranteed lifetime of over 50k hours probably much more if you run them at less current you get good electricity savings using these things and it can add up if you do the entire house plus you only have to change the lightbulb like once a decade or possibly even never if you want to never have to change them make sure theyre cooled well enough might want to think about adding some passive heatsinks and running them at much less than maxits like 4 for a 1 foot strip you can easily cut some holes in your ceiling and run wires in the attic between the lights and to the driver which you can also hide up there then you just need some sort of shade to put over the strips to diffuse the light mean well makes the best drivers for something like this wiring your lights in series with a constant current driver is probably the best option bridgelux also makes larger cobs some that take wiring harnesses or poke in connectors even which makes connecting a breeze if you dont want strips and would rather have circles just use those i think theyre called the vero honestly if youre building a house it seems stupid not to use these incredibly cheap efficient and longlasting leds theres other manufacturers btw that make cob modules and strips so do your research if youre interested in finding the best
  an led bulb in a normal fixture will be the same price after accounting for a case for the strip i dont think op wants to diy a case and wants a prebuilt solution plus he could use a smart bulb if he wanted colors and control and whatever
  yes tho
  depends on whether its worth it to you and/or the chicks you bring home      10/10 rape dungeon decorating tip      how many levels of wew are you on lad      long strips can have excessive voltage drop on the builtin lines  this you would want to run fairly heavy gauge wire from the power source to the strips a strip longer than 4ft or so will be visibly dimmer at one end      there are also clipon connectors but see above you should have a look over one of the ali lighting stores just to see whats out there i suggest mounting the strips to some aluminum channel or angle for heat dissipation mounting ease and spill control theyre often adhesivebacked so this should be easy
whats the deal with eifs  every time i google around for a diy solution for external wall insulation based on the eifs i never found anyone who has made even an attempt  the only people that had written about diy eifs only do it to talk down you of attempt to it and get their services they make look like its some kind of nuclear enginnering feat  im in a shithole country where getting a decent eifs system is only possible via contractors that only talk with other companies the average lad isnt capable of getting their services  so  its there a way to a diy version of eifs  if not  what are the alternatives to insulate the external walls of a house and get a nice finish with brick slips
a furing strips air gap is actually a decent insulator as long as air cant move through it
  theres air streams once a while in the winter  i forgot to add i live in a mediterranean climate with long periods between rains however the climate is changing the cold season its become colder and colder every year and even we had some snow the summer gets hotter and hotter every year too
bump for more answers
i have a 1366 or whatever display in my laptop its shit and i want full hd the only problem is the cable is a 30 pin single channel connector this means the max resolution is what i already have people and myself have tried extensively to upgrade this and it does not work thru simply plugging in a higher res screen the laptop is a lenovo u410    now on to the issue i have some alternate ideas for this that could work the most important part is that it must replace the internal screen looking at this guide  makes it seem pretty easy the only issue being it requires an external power supply in my ideal setup the power would come from a usb port on the laptop itself and the hardware would sit inside the laptop theres space where the hdd goes    the lifehacker method above does not meet all these requirements my latest lead is this  a sold out usb powered lvds controller board that would fit inside my laptop and certainly work the only issue being getting the power to the board from usb    how could i turn a usb port to face inwards or the equivalent i want to remove access to a port externally and add access internally so that this board can sit inside     my other issue is the board is sold out anyone heard of these boards or where i could get one
  turn a usb port to face inwards  you desolder the usb port from the motherboard and solder a usb cable to the original solder pads  route that cable wherever you want  also  upgrading a piece of shit consumergrade laptop  waste of time in my opinion
  probably but its a comfy machine and the alternative is buying a 1k plus new one the reselling market in my city is so marked up
  not getting an ebay thinkpad  he doesnt know
graphics in the laptop wont like a better display get this

so im 85 sure im getting a cr10 as my first  ive been watching tons of info any advice for this noob necessary upgrades
anon with an underextruding ender3 here turns out the fuckers did not push the bowden tube all the way to the nozzle the coupler being shit made it look like it was pushed to the end but it was not disassembled and unclogged everything and its fixed for now but replacements are on the way
  ender 3
  yeah honestly any china printer should have its hotend disassembled and reassembled before use
  na ill pay a little extra for print bed space
  yeah but all the ender3 build vids i checked did not bother disassembling the hotend so i figured it was not strictly necessary lesson learned
riddle me this what game is this from
first for pew pew
  the only thing you get out of the expensive premade printers is better polish and tech support with a cheap chink printer like the cr10 though its so popular that there are more than enough tech support and upgrades that with a bit of effort you can get it printing just as good as a 2k printer the only real downside is that you have to build your own enclosure      if you can afford it get the cr10s it has a better board which youll want since by default the thermal runaway protection is disabled and you want to enable it for safety and peace of mind  the very first thing you should do assuming it comes with a glass build plate is buy a mirror from ikea or lowes lightly cover it with pritt stick/elmers purple glue  an enclosure should be something you work towards getting but for now you can just buy a pop up greenhouse apart from keeping the heat in the main point is to prevent draughts on the print surface  get the stepper dampers just to quiet the thing down  print squash ball feet to stop vibrations resonating through whatever its sat on  look into replacing the fans to make it quieter get a 5015 blower fan and print the petsfang part cooling duct parts cooling really helps when printing bridges and overhangs when you install the blower take the sticker off the back and drop some sewing machine oil or 3in1 in there do this once a month
  i think youll come to find that servicing your hot end and ptfe tube interface is somewhat regular maintenance at least on the ender its super easy to get under the fans and into the hot end  i probably refit a new ptfe tube every 23 months i also change nozzles often and try lots of different filaments that jam up im sure that contributes to ptfe damage and wear
i just changed nozzle size to 1mm and i have a few questions on how to adjust my machine for this    1 priming the extruder at the start of a print isnt extruding enough plastic for my huge nozzle the gcode for the prime looks like this  g1 x600 e90 f10000  priming  g1 x1000 e125 f10000  priming    im hoping changing those e values will increase the flow rate for the prime maybe 12 for the first line and 18 for the second     is there anyway to change the settings for gcode preprogrammed into the printer prusa has a permenant calibration gcode file for calibrating your zheight but its tuned for a 4mm nozzle extrusion rate anyway i can adjust this so its more usable with a 1mm or somehow add a second calibration gcode file into the firmware
  no its not a unicorn horn or a strange fungus or an exotic fruit
  it does extend to get the job done though
  mission accomplished christmas lights up in record time around the tree with no need to get on a ladder
  and how do you get them down
  the hook lets me lift them to take them down i had to take down one section and it doesnt take much time at all probably going to put up another spool tomorrow when the stores open up and i can buy another    the process was so quick that i went back and moved a few of the sections to where i thought they would look better removing it is going to be a pretty fast process not as fast as putting them up but still fast
my ender 3 pros bed wobbles to fuck and back even though i did my best to tighten the eccentric nuts on the underside what can be done if the eccentrics range of motion is not enough    i thought the entire point of paying extra for the pro was that the chinks would put a bit of extra care into not shipping you a fucked up piece of trash seeing as nothing else is particularly different between the two
  im pretty sure the whole point of the pro was so creality wouldnt have such a low profit margin 180 was a foot in the door its not sustainable     my ender3 pro has two eccentric nuts down there both on the same side if i go through one full turn with one of the eccentric nuts it gets wayy to tight the only way it wouldnt is if your extrusion isnt the right dimension your roller carriage isnt the right dimension or your fixed wheels are loose parts being the wrong dimension is pretty rare so make sure your fixed nuts are tight enough if you turn them with an allen key only they wont tighten you need a wrench on the other side to keep the nut still while you tighten    aside from the fixed nuts eccentric nuts and rollers nothing should be able to cause a wobbly bed except bad alum extrusions and that seems really unlikely if the rollers were really worn down maybe but that doesnt sound like your problem
  legit thought that was a dildo on a bicycle seat post from the thumbnail thanks /n/
  the front eccentric nut being fully tightened keeps it relatively snug but not tight the back one even at its closest still leaves a lot of play as a result the whole bed wobbles gonna see if i can tweak it using your advice    tightening the fixed nuts  holy shit anon youre a lifesaver why did not of the guides pajeet youtube videos and tutorials mention that theyre all like muh eccentric nuts muh adjustment tightened everything more than my asshole went back to adjust the eccentric ones and managed to end up with a rocksolid bed that i can actually properly fucking level for once thank you
  no worries enjoy your machine    i kind of like the cmag bed its a bummer about abs temps probably ruining it but i havent tried yet its not as functional as a spring steel bed with magnets as a stuck on part will still be hard to peel up with a flexible magnet it kind of feels like corners of parts will tear into the mag if i try to peel objects up using the fex mag i still use a scraper the bed is really handy when i want to clean it i can take the bed off to wipe it or scrape thin lines off of without torquing the machine aroundi like the bed mostly because of the matte surface finish it leaves on parts and it sticks to pla like a fucking king i havent had to use any glue at all and all my parts have stuck great   the upgraded psu is a big plus imho your mileage may vary on that its not standard on the e3pro cost extra when i bought mine
uh cheapways anon here  what do i have to launch
  no actually what do i have to do
  im using the glass bed right now because the mag one isnt flat maybe theres a way to stick the mags base onto glass and thus have a nonwarped magnetic bed but i havent bothered yet the creality glass bed has a nice surface finish that also sticks to pla pretty well i find so i dont particularly feel the need to use the cmag one  upgraded psu  i heard about this but i have no idea how to check desu didnt really look into the difference it looks chinky but then again isnt everything chinky      what the fuck is this and what are you trying to do looks like a choice between a bunch of crappy text editors and semiides
  its anaconda  i was supposed to be using it to rip pic from all the angles of a shapeways 3d preview but i have no clue what to do  i opened the prompt now and im even more confused
tfw adhesion is aaaalmost good enough but fucks up on sharp corners   dammit now i gotta go find a glue stick somewhere     anyway are any of the alternative hotend assemblies for the ender 3 worth printing out the default cooling seems to be generally agreed on to be suboptimal but nobody seems to have a good answer as to what it should be replaced with ideally id also get a 5020 fan but primarily im looking for good airflow redirection for the blower
behold yonder printe of smol yiffe
  thanks my dude
this is julius caesar printed in ziro marble pla  from what i can tell it has black speckles in it that arent pla they dont melt at pla temps they clogged my 4 nozzles many many times before i gave up i was convinced it was garbage filament for many months   but this 1mm nozzle changes everything it feels so sturdy with this thick extrusion and took only 8 hours its 8 inches tall with like 20 infill i learned that 10 infill with a 4mm and 10 infill with a 1mm look vastly different   printed on a prusa at 215/55 with 3 layer height    oddly enough im finding that this huge 1mm nozzle cant really achieve really tall layer heights for maximum speed and maximum layer look aesthetic maybe its just my cooling rig
anyone see a change in print quality after installing a tlsmoother to their cr10
just ordered a geeetech a10 what free cad software would be best to get started with  also anything i should know/do before i start using it
  isnt there a ceramic filament that comes off clear/smooth
  pirate simplify3d is on pb all day long
  for cad lots of people are using fusion 360 its free for hobbiests openscad is another popular option especially for parametric models with thingiverses customizer     i started using fusion 360 a few weeks ago and its still hella overwhelming i found that forcing myself to watch a tutorial video or two was a good start gave me enough knowledge to produce most of the objects id been using tinkercad for and it makes everything so much more precise     tinkercad is a good piece of webapp software for manipulating preexisting meshes people use meshmixer and blender for this too but i find tinkercad to be very userfriendly its like ms paint but in 3d    ironically ive never used ms paint 3d even though ive had it this whole time and it exists for this purpose    simplify3d is a good slicer but not sure its worth the money even for the price of free not sure its better than slic3r pe cura also has tons of options but imho too many options   i use simplify3d for most things and use slic3r pe when s3d fails which is somewhat often desu
i suppose coke bottles have the same threads worldwide  anyone happen to know what the specs for the threads are
anyone have a link to an enclosure build that they like
  just screw some 2x2 wood together and staple any reasonably thick blanket to it with a plastic layer on the inside to prevent dust
  yeah i found that out with my 1mm nozzle as well cant really handle over 04mm at all  but i still like it a lot and while i cant know for sure i think it makes for stronger prints
    cheers i went with fusion 360 watched a couple of tutorials and started making a custom 2004 enclosure
  so whats the take home message senpai
  uhh praise jesus christ i guess
  with that test the orientation of the infill is gonna make a huge difference did you account for that in any way
  have the code i sent you saved in a text file with an extension py  try running it from a command line like  python yourfilepy    you might need to put it next to pythonexe in the anaconda installation directory then in command line cd into that directory and try again the above command
    how the fuck does this have like 3mm of displacement at 0 load is it really that springy while still somehow being the strongest by a wide margin when compressed or is there a measurement error
  yeah i guess it all just lines up so that theres extremely little resistance in this particular orientation for the first 3mm
  for maximum speed and maximum layer look aesthetic maybe its just my cooling rig  you really need a volcano hotend or something similar if you want to push the extrusion volume to the max cooling usually isnt the main issue if your prints are large enough    t 500mm radius deltafag
  so whats the take home message senpai  grid is gud      its just a 10010030mm cube laid flat which means the infill is always perpendicular to the buildplate and thus aligned with the test punch      chalk it up to distance measurement error not all panels were exactly at absolute zero for the machine which we only set once so we could quickly pull the punch up put a new panel inhome and test again 45 mm per panel 15 panels at only 12mm/min takes too damn long
  its just a 10010030mm cube laid flat which means the infill is always perpendicular to the buildplate and thus aligned with the test punch  oh i thought that it was on its side like in one of your pictures my b
any good black friday deals out there looking for a 300x300 sized printer or should i just go for some chinkshit
  cr10s or wait for the pro if youd like an extruder upgrade and mesh leveling
    afaik all the printers at that build volume are chinkshit as in not that theyre bad or good just that theyre all chinese
theres a black friday deal on e3ds website where everythings 15 off and ive been thinking about getting a duet wifi thoughts
  that usually happens when the specimen is shorter than the platens when the measurement starts the crosshead have to travel some until it touches the specimen this is what i experienced idk about the other guys setup
whats a reliable filament brand guys
  the one with the best reviews on amazon
what the hell why didnt i know autodesk makes software for 3d printing    
  ive had good luck with hatchbox    ok guys i need some fucking help i am fucking livid i decided to try hairspray to hold my prints down and i watched videos i did two layers and let it dry and jesus fucking christ my prints arent sticking people are making claims to not try to take prints off while bed is hot cause chunks of glass will break off lol the fucking air from the cooling fan knocks them off    what the fuck am i doing wrong what needs to be done cause these youtubers arent explaining it correctly
    maybe you got some different type of hairspray from what i can tell the stuff is practically liquid gluestick have you tried gluestick btw
  yes thats what i use using before it worked pretty good i bought the hairspray everyone has been talking about online  aquanet extra hold or whatever    i sprayed a layer and good layer used heated bed to speed process of drying it sprayed a second layer and let it dry then started the print nothing its pisisng me off i do not want to leave the house again to go get a fucking gluestick fucking guy at microcenter was praising it like it was only method to do    i forgot to mention i am using a ender 3 printer
   anyone know of a tutorial to make doll style joints for 3d printed figures
try printing on the creality high tech glass bed thingy   prints are supposed to stick while its hot and pop off once its cold   it almost works but not quite   theres some adhesion but not enough and either my first or second layer are invariably fucking up    now my question is does it make sense to smear glue stick over the meme surface coating or should i instead flip it over to have a plain simple glass surface and put my glue there
  just copy any other 3d printable joint design
  have you seen the price 225 per year for standard 4100 for premium  but if you try it let us know about it
    that reminds me i have student access for a couple more years because i wanted to find the dimensions of an stl some months ago when i didnt have a printer i should try actually using it for slicing   im a procrastinating fuck so dont like expect anything right now but if you want ill write about my experience here once i do give it a try keeping in mind only other thing ive used so far is cura
       link to the glass bed youre talking about
i had a magical idea to mix thermochromic paint into pla  pic related    i have 20g of ink im thinking i can get about 02 kg of color changing filament from it worst case i still have to figure out the proper ratios the ink is expensive af also have to source pla pellets from somewhere
    and checked
  motherfucker i just got an ender 3 and the toothedgear thats on the extruder was upsidedown the chink bastards    just had to tighten a grub screw and flip it over shes rolling smooth now boys
  im using some of the wifes suave  im somewhere in between believing its 100 a placebo or doing the trick entirely    really my shit didnt start sticking to glass until i got my bed to around 70 whether thats the hairspray helping or not i have no idea
  i havent had any reason to use anything but cura yet
      hmm i am just using plain glass for my ender 3 sorry anon idk what to tell you i would look on youtube i think i saw that in a round up with other beds when i was making a decision on mine
  i read the specs on the page and it says theres a range of 5070 c for pla for adhesion have you tried bumping up the bed plate temperature to max range that is to say 70
  i see in the 3d print option for fusion it has the option to send it to a print utility print studio or meshmixer are theses slicers has anyone here   used them
i really fucking hate the plasticwheelinvslotextrusion system it basically rules out all the cheap popular printers ender3 cr10     what other cheapshit has decent qc now are i3 clones still the best i can do jgaurora are there any good corexy clones yet
  i just export to stl i think it tries to send it to an online printing service but im not sure
  if youre still on the thread the best filament ive ever used is a blend from sunlu called pla ive ordered 6 rolls so far no jams no tangles always perfectly consistent color its always around 15 bucks a roll too another brand i really like is solutech but theyre a bit pricier
  ok after calming my autism down i think i got it working    i did first layer and let it dry using the heat bed and then i applied the second layer right before i print i only did a light coat on both layers and it is holding i only had two prints come loose one was my fault cause my hand cause it to come off and the other just separated from the bed and i believe its because it got printed in a area right out side of the hairspray i put on the bed
  oh snap autodesk bought out netfabb looks like a long time ago too but anyways ive never used it for slicing and i dont know what the autodesk version is but the version i have is great for repairing/cleaning stl files and orienting prints i use it before i run them in slic3r
  curious why exporting to a different program for slicing instead of just doing it all in the same place is more hassle so whats the reason you started doing this in the first place
  wtf anon vslot with rollers is the best
  explain pls
noob here  a while back i used autodesk inventor to sketch a part for an ar15 that was intended to be made with metal is it worthwhile to use that program for 3d printing or is that overkill  downside is i have to use at work and im a macfag
  slic3r at the time it was 109 had toolpathing and parameters i liked but couldnt reorient 3d models in a 3d way it couldnt split models on the z axis and a lot of the time stl models would need repairing to fix broken vertices and it was good at importing other models and converting them to stl or converting stl to a more editable file format at the time netfabb wasnt autodesk so you could download and use their program for free with out slicing optionthere was a crack to get full version i should look into now so i just added it into my workflow to do all the things slic3r couldnt do in 2013 its a very handy tool and i havent really changed my ways since then
  there is no such thing such as overkill only the efficiency and time it youre willing to spend on something with the tools you have
  interesting makes sense
  tinkercad has some ball joint templates that work well
  thx
so for more durable structural parts should i go for larger nozzle and higher layer height
it does not appear that i screwed anything up    leveling was a pain had to go over it like 3 times
is it easy to make supplementary beer money by modelling and/or printing small miniatures and objects i kinda want to get a photon but cant really justify it unless i can make some of the money back im comfortable making my own models in blender as well as converting posing and whatnot
  15 bucks a roll    you using ebay
  autoleveler was the best  i spent on the whole shit
  im using hatchbox at 16 a roll and its just as good as the fancy chromecolored shit i got for 25
  i got tired of every fucking time i wanted to do a project from something online i either had to go to some overpriced local 3d printing shop or i had to trust that shapeways wouldnt fuck it up  so you know what screw that shit if i need something and i have to 3d print it i can now just 3d print it no more scouring the universe for that one thing that doesnt exist that would solve a problem im currently enduring and no more trusting incompetent shitheads to carelessly do it for me  thats my justification
hey guys i was curious about something i downloaded a stl file of a raspberry pi 3 b top cover and i rotated it 90 degrees to lay more flat and the original position is when its standing up     i had a problem with a print where it prints that border before the 3d model but mine kept printing the small rectangle border as if i was printing it straight up and the 3d model was partially printed on top of it    after couple tries i just paused the print turned it off and move the bed away from that border so it can print completely flat    i was using cura when i rotated the 3d model is there a setting i need to apply    printer creality ender 3  printing program octoprint/octopi
  hes trolling its garbage    credit where its due it allowed big printers to sell at the same price as medium size printers but that 100 saved is paid in lower precision and rapid wear
  if i understand you correctly then no there is no other setting probably just failed to overwrite what it was before just try again    you should always go into layer view after slicing and before printing and look at what the paths look like especially for the first layer and the supports its really easy to spot when its trying to do something dumb then you coerce it into not doing that and slice again
  proofs  from my experience the extrusions are pretty straight  and what do you mean by wear i suppose chink bearings might give out but i kinda doubt that since its not a very high load application
  they sell actual thermochromic pla filament so you dont have to fuck about extruding your own and mixing paint into it unless thats your thing in which case go for it
  its so demoralizing learning that the thing you came up with already exists  thanks anyway
  ok thanks anon i will give that a try next time
  paid in lower precision    i can get 50μm accuracy x/y what the heck do you need more than that for on fdm
  classic resolution accuracy mixup
  i mean any external dimension will be printed with less than 50μm of deviation this is on a pretty well used cr10s
does anyone have experience with tungsten carbide not straight tungsten nozzles i print a lot of carbon fibre petg and its chewing through nickle coated brass like crazy
fusion 360    did it change i hadnt made anything in awhile but i thought nonbusiness use was supported all of a sudden it wants a subscription
  still works for me it says its a start up licence as its loading
  i had to switch it to offline mode and it was fine but otherwise it wouldnt let me save    and that is a dick move when you just finished a design before it said anything at all
    how is it coming along
is a single 8mm leadscrew good enough to drive an 8x8 zaxis bed for a corexy
  thats one of the subscription licenses hobby/nonprofit theyre good for a year at a time if you try to renew you should see some questions t hen get an option for the hobbyist nonprofit startup license
  i print a lot of carbon fibre petg and its chewing through nickle coated brass like crazy  you need hardened steel for that   nickelcoated brass is only going to reduce residual buildup and tarnishing and help somewhat with the abrasiveness of glowinthedark filaments
  if you can find people to buy your prints yes you can make money even easier if you sell the 3d models directly and take commission
  literally any other nozzle type would last longer than plated bronze
    i just renewed my hobby license no problems just make sure you tick nonprofit or noncommercial cant remember what it said when you click on get subscription
how do i print support material with polycarbonate isnt polycarb too hot for pla
  how would using 2 kinds of filament work for that anyways
  i dont know thats why i came here for advice im printing some really intricate parts for a wing and they have lots of overhangs
  then use abs or hips
  wouldnt you have to switch filaments everytime it wanted to make supports if the wing is pla pla support should be just fine
  is that known to work dont they have lower temperatures too      dual extruders or is there another way im not aware of
  you have a dual extruder machine or you were going to buy one just for this project
  for the sake of this project i do however need to print in polycarb for its high strength and stiffness since this is going into an aircraft though i used a commercial fortus printer at school for this sort of stuff previously but unfortunately i dont have 200k to spend on a printer
  take them down  leave them shits up year round familam
what do you think of my bow
  nice measured how
lads what extruder would you use for a 1500mm long bowden setup  bondtech/bmg  e3d titan  thingiverse b2d  we already have an e3d volcano setup so im tempted to go with the titan doesnt have the polish of the bmg though  inb4 ditch the bowden  dont a direct drive that would add mass to the delta head
    id try to decrease the length theres no magic extruder that can fight filament bends at that scale using fat 3mm filament helps but its not that much of a solution    dont a direct drive that would add mass to the delta head    you can suspend the extruder close to the effector keeping the bowden tube relatively short like in the pic detailed article    
  thats really cool do you need any extra motors or is it just linkages  a semidirect drive belta seems really attractive tbqh
  we currently have this kind of extruder    im pretty sure all three would be an upgrade over this    the previous guy who maintained this printer already went to a flying extruder it sucked we have a 500mm radius buildplate and we are approaching 120mm/s print speeds you can imagine that a flying extruder has quite a lot of inertia at that speed controlling its movements is hard we are getting much better results with the retardedly long bowden we just need to optimise retraction a bit further still that extruder could be a lot better      delta printers suck cartesian is masterrace
  oh wait its just counterweights i see  so its pretty damn simple as well  if i ever get around to making a delta ill definitely use this setup
      yeah its practically just hanging on a string i remembered seeing this setup before so i suggested it here        i agree that deltas objectively suck but at 120mm/s youre likely to have printing problems even on a cartesian
    i mean honestly delta seems pretty good since rigidity is almost a nonissue in 3d printing and those speeds are pretty attractive
brainlet here whats a delta heae
more designing and printing bought a new gun on black friday but the grip situation sucked right where its most comfy to hold the gun is an awkward open magazine well it looks like the designer had something in mind and just said fuck it im done with this shit so i printed out a grip that fits over the lip of the mag well and put just the slightest considerations to ergonomics and voila something that is actually comfortable to hold
  sounds like your bed thermistor might not be accurate pla on aquanet holds like a lamb on the devils barbed cock for me
  midrange chinesium calipers supposedly accurate to 10 μm which i realise might be a stretch but the jaws are stainless steel and they seem fairly on point when ive put various feeler gauges in them     i calibrated my extrusion width a few times using single walled cubes and filament of known high accuracy and then adjust my steps for each roll of filament when accuracy is required by measuring in a few spots
  really silly question does the back of the nozzle body have to be flush with the heater block or is it okay for it to hang out a bit i think the threading on most of the hardened steel nozzles ive seen is a little longer than the threading on the nozzles that fit my block perfectly
  buying a pcc in the age of 300 mil spec ars
    me posting a question and then ignoring the thread for three days   tried it im using some sort of pla which became noticeably soft and soggy on a 70c bed but i tried 60 and it did stick better    the thing is the model always sticks just fine if i can get it started printing then it wont budge made a 3dbenchy boat thingy and stuck on a barbed cock is a good way to describe it except the first layer always fucks up on sharp corners that same benchy has absolutely fucked up bottom text because as the letter contours were being laid down on the first layer they kept being jerked around and not staying where theyre supposed to once the bottom around the letters was filled in though everything continued just fine and curas default skirt which has no sharp corners laid down perfectly    right now my two leading theories are that there are fingerprints or something and its making the bed work inconsistently my chink feeler gauge also came slathered in oil against rust i presume so i might have gotten the bed greasy while levelling gonna try washing it with soap  and the second theory would be that the bed is too low but it doesnt look like it at all i levelled it to about 005006mm the 008mm gauge definitely wasnt fitting under the nozzle if washing doesnt help ill raise it a smidgen more and then if that fails im flipping it around to a plain glass surface and rubbing a glue stick all over it because fuck this
  draw weight
  except the first layer always fucks up on sharp corners  sounds like you may be leveling a bit too close to the bed 010mm is a good starting point    right now my two leading theories are that there are fingerprints or something and its making the bed work inconsistently   clean with some alcohol do not use dishwashing soap that stuff is specifically design to attract rubbish    and then if that fails im flipping it around to a plain glass surface and rubbing a glue stick all over it because fuck this  you dont need glue on a 60 degree heated glass bed to print pla do it without and your prints will come off even easier
  implying you can get a 9mm chambered ar for 300
  a 9mm ar is a pcc pistol caliber carbine and that anon was implying youre stupid for buying any pcc when you can buy a cheapass ar instead
  9mm a shit
  sounds like you may be leveling a bit too close to the bed  i would have imagined the complete opposite i levelled to 006mm ill try lowering the bed on your advice  clean with some alcohol  good idea   you dont need glue   at this point its not about whats needed its about what will fucking work at all ill try your suggestions though
  another useful tip if youre getting bad adhesion on the first layer possibly due to leveling set your first layer as high as possible and slow it down to compensate if youre 005mm off on a 01mm layer height print thats a 50 error if youre 005mm off on a 03mm layer height thats reduced your error to below 20  the print may properly stick if youre a lazyass who doesnt properly level his bed every print like me this can work wonders maximum layer height is 75 of nozzle diameter so assuming you have a 04mm nozzle you can set your first layer height to 03mm
  how much is subsonic 556 how much is subsonic 9mm i would have saved 100 only to have lost it in my first ammo purchase
  buying ammo  this is /diy/ handload or gtfo
  120lbs
  well you got me there
anyone else tried to switch the firmware on a tronxy melzi 20 board i havent been able to do i need to reinstall the bootloader or what  i suppose i could just get ramps 14 but it would be so nice to get this shit working i wanna install a heated bed on my printer ive got all of the hardware but this damn board doesnt take the firmware
trying to calibrate a dlp resin i printed a calibration pattern according to     from a previous calibration it looked like 80s was the right exposure which was a lot printed some stuff with that setting and of course everything was overexposed every measurement was around 10 larger than it should have been    pic related is new exposure time range pattern can you guys help me out what timing should i pick this shit is so hard to decide on i was thinking around 3036
i got an extrusion issue printed a solid blob straight onto the heating element on the extruder when i was attempting to clean off the blob i cut the thermistor cables theres so much gunk all over it i cant even remove any screws tried unclogging with a soldering iron to get the stuff heated to remove with a brush    am i being a pussy in buying a replacement heating element and thermistor instead of fixing it
  its a 20 fix if that vs the cost of possibly burning down your printer or house    just get the thermistor and heater
  may want to use a different resin  something like monocure rapid should be curing in less than 10s per layer
  this  18s seems to be fully curing it but you clearly have some other problems getting detail out of it
i got an i3 mini on friday and got it up and running today how was something so dangerous to my free time only 150    i watched it print benchy from start to finish 3 hours i couldnt bring myself to look away now im browsing upgrade part prints
    time is not a concern  this is what i have and i dont really want to just dump it down the drain
  is there a problem with it being upside down as long as the teeth bite the filament i was thinking of putting it upside down since i cant put a rotating spinner over it it falls off
    not a tronxy but im currently using a regular melzi and ive flashed a firmware on it dozens of times by now did you put the autoreset jumper on before tryng to flash it
  oh which pins is that
    when this jumper is on the board should start resetting itself periodically afaik the microcontroller only accepts flashing during the very initial boot sequence and will time out after it loads marlin pressing the reset button and immediately hitting compile and upload on the arduino ide should have the same effect not sure if the power from usb jumper needed to be set or not i think it should work in both cases
  oh i see ill try it out with that then i already had the power from usb on
  i keep getting this when trying to upload marlin any idea what it might be
  exactly same with repetier
    looks like the same resetting issue you could try hitting the reset button on the board as it repeats its attempts to connect also did you set the usbserial port to the right one and the board type to sanguino/sanguinololu 16mhz
  yeah sanguino and atmega1284p 16mhz  kinda bummed about this the board has served me well and i wouldnt mind keeping it around for heated bed operation
    what about the serial port since most avr chips only take regular serial connections arduinocompatible boards feature a usbtoserial chip made by ftdi that handles the conversion you can check which com port its assigned to in the device manager on linux it would be one of the usbttys in /dev
  its giving me a choice between com3 and com1 i think com3 ought to be the correct one but ive tried both and neither work
    can you look into your boardstxt in the sanguino folder and check the baudrate you could set it to atmega1284uploadspeed19200 and save also have you tried running pronterface to see if you can even connect to the board and give it commands
  tried it with 19200 but it doesnt work tried it with 115200 speed as well since that same number is the baud rate and idk if thats related to this stuff at all but neither worked
  hmm the only thing that comes to mind right now is to try something stupidlow like 9600 did you try pronterface to verify its connecting at all
  does it count if i can connect to it on repetier host  i attached a motor to the board and i am able to manipulate the motor through repetier  having changed from usb power to atx power and having swapped the connector from usb to atx position the error message has changed
  nvm back to this  i think that other one is when it doesnt connect to the board at all like when it is turned off
  have you tried connecting to it with a serial console program not the one thats part of the arduino environment
    yeah as long as it works then its connected    reading up on this issue on a few forums and the marlin github reflashing the bootloader fixes the issue for some people with the melzi one user on a forum mentions that the chinks dont include the bootloader on some of their boards on purpose to prevent flashing by the user not many ways to prove this but i wouldnt be surprised if its true    if youre feeling adventurous you could try to flash a new bootloader using a 5 arduino uno or a nano there are guides for doing this and the melzi has the isp pins broken out into a little 6pin header in one corner so it shouldnt be too difficult
    also something you can try beforehand  someone else mentioned that he tried it specifically on the tronxy melzi 30 and it worked with some old version of the arduino ide 105 btw funny part  there is no actual official melzi 30 the chinks just called their board that
aaaaah my bed isnt coming off what the fuckjkjh   bed stuck   please   i beg you
  let it cool down if need be throw it in the fridge clean your buildplate better next time and level it a bit further off
  no my literal glass bed wasnt coming off the printer   the solution was actually to heat it back up then i was able to pry it away
    ahh the classic not answering the question deal
  sounds like you have a bed thats sagging like elderly tits
  more like my setup is titsonhead retarded you know how the ender 3 has a magnetic bed and the bottom part of it is glued to the metal bed plate i wanted to use glass instead but was too lazy to unglue that so i just removed the magnetic top and put the glass on top of the bottom half  presumably they ended up sticking due to being pressed together and repeatedly heated
  i did two layers and let it dry  im no engineer but i thought youre supposed to stick stuff together with the adhesive before it dries
  one user on a forum mentions that the chinks dont include the bootloader on some of their boards on purpose to prevent flashing by the user  yeah i think this is the case here though i cant imagine what theyd gain from making customers unable to flash their shit maybe it made the production somehow easier or something
  maybe it made the production somehow easier or something    thats a good theory they could be programming parallel the bootloader is only used for serial slow programming almost nobody uses parallel programming even though it is way faster because it requires 12 volts on reset and 8 data lines
  damn annoying  i dont need anything more than pic related to install the bootloader do i
    ive used those to install bootloaders and im pretty sure its in the arduino menu you need to make sure the fuses are correct because they control the amount of memory for the bootloader on some avrs maybe all the default fuses give you the maximum boot size but they might have changed them you can use that device with avrdude to read and write the fuses repeatedly because they arent actual fuses that burn out
    i havent used this one i was thinking about an arduino nano like        id still first check if flashing works with the old 105 arduino ide by the way ive had cases where certain versions just refused to work with my melzi sometimes
  i just had a superb idea  combine little cheap 096 oled screens with cheap credit card magnifiers combine them into an oled/magnifier holder/focus/screen/shroud and maybe a project box  oled    magnifiers  
  can i stop and start a print misprint with a ardicuno     i know a geetech like this you can control your printer but it doenst fucking say if you can stop mid print    i want to have a camera and watch my print so if theres an error and im not at home i can see it on my phone and stop it but i am so fucking confused can i even hook up a camera to work like that with just an ardicuno     aaahahahaahahaaaaaaaaaa
  the one one the bottom lever action right how much ammo can it hold
  you got the file link senpai
whats everyones favorite brand and color of filament looking to expand my library
  
  hatchbox makes some pretty good stuff or at least did 2 years back last time i bought it and i like the neon green and gold they offer whites good as well
    not a reccomendation as i havent tried them but i recently noticed that colorfabb now offer pla with any ral color on demand some of them look pretty neat like the mint turquoise
  im pretty sure its a torwell rebrand but the standard blue pla that technologyoutlet sells is a really nice semi translucent colour with a deep sheen to it
  just use octoprint like everyone else use the astroprint plugin and you can even cancel a print remotely
  what is this
  thanks my dude
  thanks a better modification of this is on the middle section where the arm bracket is connected by a bolt and screw instead it would simply have a enclosure it would slide inside of with a mid tight tolerance    usually when these bows all flexed up theres so much tension that it doesnt have the ability to slide out
i am looking to get my first printer for chrismas i am limited in space and cant go over 500 do anyone have experience with nice simple models  i am confused at all the offer
  cr10 if you think youll need the build volume if not ender 3 with as much upgrade as theyll give you
  this  if you are going to get a cr10 consider getting a cr10s for about 400 or so its a little more than the regular cr10 tho but it has 2 dual z axis rods a bootloader i think for software upgrades filiment run out sensor and power outage recovery    idk i got a standard cr10 the only thing id care for is the second dual z axis rod but i can upgrade that myself    most mods are 3d printable but you want to get a stepper motor dampener for the noise regardless or what you buy  ender 3 has a lot of praise also
  my boy marco seems to like the cetus 3d quite a lot and it seems really attractive in this price range proper linear rails and all  too bad it is somewhat proprietary
does anyone know a printer than can print silicone or any rubberlike material thanks
  why would you need that dragon dildos come in discrete packages
  fingerprints masks for disguises
  youre better off printing a negative of your model to act as a mold then cast silicone inside
  cantilever  fuck that and fuck printrbot for popularizing that design
  literally nothing wrong with it
  explain please
anyone ever build a lithographic 3d printer the kind that shoot a projection on a pool of resin and can print at real time speeds i make robots as a hobby/program them to do random shit and id like a way to create prototype limbs and such faster     where do i buy the resin that hardens on uv light contact  any build plans  whats a good price range
  anyone ever build a lithographic 3d printer  sure  the kind that shoot a projection on a pool of resin and can print at real time speeds  any printer prints at real time speeds i think you are misunderstanding something  where do i buy the resin that hardens on uv light contact  on the internet for about 50 per liter prices vary  any build plans  no i made it up as i went  whats a good price range  i wouldnt know im at about 1000 on my build but i can reuse my projector as a regular display device
  real time meaning not shooting jizz out of an extruder and taking 8 hours for a 10x5x5 cm object    what projector did you use as a base   are you using custom software  could you link your sourcing for the resin
  8 hours for a 10x5x5 cm object  depending on the resin and pigments it might take longer than that  what projector did you use as a base  im using an acer h6510bd it has the advantage of not needing modifications to cure resins or focus to a smal area the disadvantage is that its focus plane is quite uneven and so only the middle of its projection area is realy usable  are you using custom software  yes  could you link your sourcing for the resin  so far im using funtodo resin but im not to happy with it becaue it shrinks and cracks quite a bit if you realy want it just search for the name
  sounds like a larp or low quality projector ive seen some chinesium no name litho printers at my university that can print a few mm/minute
  can print a few mm/minute  right with a fast resin and no pigments that works the catch is that fast resins have lots of shrinkage and without pigments youll get a lot of bleedtrough
  can i ask what the point of a 3d printer is when it takes an eternity to make anything youd be better off with a cheap cnc machine
  no u
  go and make   with a cheap cnc  different machine with differerent purposes
  sounds like yours might already be upside down compared to the enders ive seen and have  there should be enough room on a stock ender 3 above the toothed gear to put a hand crank on the shaft without it falling off
  woah good to know  i was about one day from doing this to my e3pro    is the bottom magnet damaged at all from having to pry the glass off at temperature
  thats pretty much impossible when your printing with a heated bed with all the adhesives ive ever used on a heatbed you need it to still be tacky after drying out a property aquanet hairspray is supposed to excel at
  you said your build cost 1k here you go      effective working travel    375xmm535ymm65zmm    maximum speed    04000mm/min
  the average 3030 lever longgun holds 5 rounds but that one looks a slight bit shorter than a stock 5 round henry id guess 4 in the tube mag  a chart like thought should really include length of barrel for the data to be meaningful
  been really satisfied with ziro pla colorme3d also have a bunch of really great translucent pla colors with haze in the name
  that wont make what is depicted in   you madlad as i said cnc mills are usefull probably more usefull than the printer i built for most purposes its just a different machine
  make the front side  flip over  make back side    im not quite sure what youre on about
  do it and post image
  ive never been able to manufacture plastic products in my living room as fast as i can with a 3d printer even the ultrabasic models like a 30mm cube manufacturing plastics just isnt feasable     you dont have to stand there and watch it the whole time if a model takes 30 hours you just have to start it 30 hours earlier than you need the object finished     imho i like to compare print time with how long it would take to buy and ship from amazon its usually cheaper and takes less time than buying and shipping an object
  when your maximum working speed can be anywhere from 0 to 4000mm/min youre taking a huge fucking gamble    fingers crossed that you dont get one with a max speed on the lower end of that acceptable range of tolerance
the biggest reason i have a 3d printer fdm over any other cnc machinery is the price of the stock my machines can run for like 80 hours on 1015 us dollars worth of material i can print smallmedium sized awkward shaped items without wasting material if its not perfect i can adjust and reprint there are no chips to recycle or scrap there is no negative cut out blank that needs scrapped or recycled     there is a wide variety of materials to choose from and none of them are particularly heavy or expensive compared to metals or even hardwood hell even acrylic and shitty laser cutting stock  fdm has truly become the king of in home machining
  but let me ask a simple question   would it be faster that a 3d printer that costs the same at even 10mm/min
  not that i can tell well theres a small bubble in the middle i have no idea whether that has anything to do with this or it might have been there before havent tried sticking the magnetic top on again but i doubt anything would go wrong there
  most normal people have these things called a family and jobs where they spend 5 days at a time without any free time being able to setup a print and leave it for 10203040 hours is not a big deal to have something that is exactly custom made for your needs    thats why the instantpot became such a success it sucks completely as a pressure cooker and takes three times as long but you can set it up and leave it to do its thing unsupervised which is what makes all the difference
anyone got any suggestions for a 3d printer around 10000 dollars im looking to start manufacturing from home and i have only used printers around 2000 dollars this far
  if you need a lot of accuracy/special materials    otherwise why not buy a few different printers like a couple of small reliable ones and a few more specialty ones like a dual extruder maybe one resin printer    no idea how much good resin printers cost       depends entirely on what youre making though
  its supposed to be flush you might need a new heater block if you cant shorten the nozzle yourself
  anon fdm machines cap at 1000
200x200x200 outer dimensions  120x120x90 print area  frame completely printable on 200x200 print plate component cost not much over 100 all things considered  includes a heated bed so printing abs is easy and due to the small size an enclosure is extremely easily sourced
  nice meme ornament
  lmao get a cheap sls at that point
does a heated aluminum plate require a capton tape added on top for good adhesion to the print
  thanks 
  yea it needs something kapton is better than blue tape but not by a huge amount pei and/or buildtak are the current gold standard
  nice plans stls
  hobby grade fdm machines
  what does x materials mean do they actually have undecuple extruders or something
  its stratasys what do you think  it means how many different filament types are whitelisted for use with the machine
hello can i use a noctua nfa4x10 as an extruder fan  482 cfm  i print pla only and im not thinking about printing abs anytime soon
  why not  aslong as u have a decent airduckt everyfan can work  i dont knwo whats so special about that one but most other printers also use somethign about 400 mm i think
  i dont knwo whats so special about that one  quietness the stock fan from anet a6 is too loud
  you should check the airflow specs of the old fan but sins its probably a noname fan i think you can test it out and just make some testprints before and after to tune up or down the fan if needed
im looking for a printer under 200 that has a heated bed 200x200 print platform and that just works i dont mind the setup as im fairly experienced already but i want it to just work like a prusa when you press print im looking to print abs so a heated bed is a necessity while a parts cooling fan is not required  ive been considering the tevo tarantula anything else i ought to look at
  i have tevo tornado very happy with it however the glas bed has a plastic adhesive to is to make the prints stick better that works great with pla however the sticky layer will buble at abs temps i dont know what bed adhesion the tarentula has but that would be my only concern the rest of the tornado is good at default settings   it is my first and only printer so im sure if u know what u r doing it should be fine but thats the tornado not the tarantula
  under 200  just work  pick one  like a prusa  what are you even saying here
  basically id rather be a freeloader than pay for prusa development costs european wages brand and customer support
  what are you even saying here    hes saying i want to have my cake and eat it too
how come some 34mm length nema 17 steppers have a rated current of 04a while others have a rated current of 14a  these two seem to have the same torque  the 04a one has much higher phase resistance and phase inductance whatever those mean  im considering buying the ones in this link because theyre the cheapest i could find but im wondering if theyll perform as well as well as 14a ones  
  calculate the wattage and you will se they are about the same for a 3d printer you want low phase resistance since the drivers are optimised for that
  hes saying i want to have my cake and eat it too    that saying makes more sense if you use the original version you cant eat your cake and have it too which is the way ted kazinsky the unabomber put it in his manifesto which was one of the clues that led his brother to rat him out
  alright ill get the 13a ones a shame the best priced ones so far seem to be the 04a ones
  i think the high inductance ones wont go fast enough change direction quickly ect  i saw a list of steppers that had been successfully used on 3d printer builds and all but one were 5mh or less the 12 volt high inductance one that was listed came with a note that more or less said it worked but shouldnt be taken seriously due to its high inductance  cant remember the source though    i did try a 12v one on my extruder tried it because it was cheap and never got a good print until i changed it   on a side note it works good as a generator when connected to a lower volt motor itll spin it when its spun even at low speed
  these two seem to have the same torque    but they dont have the same phase inductance in a nutshell the lower the phase inductance the faster the motor can spin at a given voltage highinductance motors produce more torque for a given current but at the same time lose torque at a much lower point in the rpm range
  used objet 30  used zcorp machine  cheap sls
if i get this thing working i could probably sell these at 200 a piece while still making at least some profit do you guys think that there might be a market for this sort of ultra compact 200x200x200 printer  and as for design files theres nothing really secret here all of the components are easily available etc but ill share the stls after ive sold some or if this whole thing ends up a failure
  whoops
      
  err what
  why would you buy something thats uncomfortable to even look at
ive been looking around for a bit and the absolute cheapest motherboard  display/controller  stepper drivers drv8825 combination ive been able to find costs 2497 including shipping this is from aliexpress has anyone else managed to find anything cheaper
  why would you want trash
  literally nothing wrong with ramps 14  mega 2560 combo for a cartesian machine what benefits do you actually gain from buying a fancy smoothieboard or rambo
  what benefits do you actually gain from buying a fancy smoothieboard or rambo  youll have the nicer stuff for whatever you need to use it for in the future
  nicer stuff  please give me an example of something concrete they do better than the good ol ramps 14  i suppose those 32bit processors can calculate the calculations necessary for a delta printer better but for a cartesian machine ive actually got no idea what they do better i suppose the removable fuses are nice on the rambo but then again that doesnt actually affect stuff like print quality etc  even microstepping is something a 100 board doesnt have over a 10 one since you can just throw tmc2130s on either
    like i said its for fingerprints like the one in this article     qz com/815103/3dprintedhandfingerprintscanner/
how did you fags replace anycubic i3 megas shit extruder with an edv6 only youtube video is from a boomer and his 10 yr old who cant film for shit
  nigga just screw it all off see what kind of mounting holes youre dealing with boot up fusion draw up an adaptor save as stl load up in your slicer of choice print and assemble  or just go to thingiverse and search for anycubic i3 mega edv6
  also would it make sense to switch to ramps 14 because i have the shit trigorilla board with soldered stepper drivers
  prolly not tbqh  the only advantage you could get with a ramps 14 are those sweet tmc2100 stepper drivers and while they make a difference it aint huge  with cheap stuff like this ive come to learn not to fucking touch it if it functions and does all the basics acceptably  god knows ive spent way too much time working on my piece of shit 100 tronxy  also doesnt the anycubics board have removable stepper drivers anyway
ive got a print that keeps failing and i cant figure out why bed adhesion is good first layer is good retraction is right buildate is clear and the print looks perfect up until hour 2 both times though ive left the house after 2 hours and come home pla spaghetti at around the 4 hour mark it looks like at some point one of the objects got caught on the extractor and has dragged around and hit everything     short of redesigning the whole print does anyone have good methods on diagnosing problems in longer prints
  print it smaller/quicker first
  fucking chinks removed the feature with the latest board revision like the slant eyed cunts that they are
    the duet and smoothie have networking and can handle more steppers but the cheap avr stuff covers about 80 of the things you can have on a 3d printer my advice for  would be to buy a couple of good mosfets to put on the ramps board since the ones it already has are likely to start a fire id also be worried about the board having thinner traces than usual but thats not something you can spot from an aliexpress listing
euro buyfag here  whats currently a overall good printer with good value sub 800  the prusa i3 mk3 seems nice but a bit expensive  what other models are good value
  mk2 then  700
  how high does the print get  if the nozle catches theres a lot of leverage there to pry the print off of the bed
really pushing the edges of the ender3 bed with this one
  anycubic i3 mega mod it with tmc 2280s mofset und a edv6 extruder spend the rest of your money on a czech prostitute
considering getting a prusa mk2 kit as my general purpose workhorse is it really worth the price
  meh im not into hacking for my first printer  i think ill stick with the prusa i3 mk3    czech prostitute  ill actually be in czech next week hehe
  anon just go with the mk2  basically the same machine with just a little less luxuries
  have a look on the isbt website for the thread type or failing that look for a gpi thread that is likely the same
  i just got this cr10 and i cant level the first corner becuase this yellow spring wont fully decompress or its not strong enough all the other corners are flush with the spring knobs but the first one cant get paper under it anyone else have this problem     should i take the bed off and add a stronger spring do you think it would throw everything off wack if i did that  yes i am autohoming
  tighten them all and lower the zstop if its like the one on the ender3 you need to cut off a plastic piece to be able to lower it
  dont know the ender 3 this is first 3d printer for me and im trying to not be retarded ill see if i can find that plastic piece
    oh i fixed it my retarded ass thought that   looserlower    without realizing how the compression works    tighterlower    off to lowes to get a few mirrors
do you prefer to level with paper in 1 of 3 scenarios     paper is loose and just bairly gets scratched   paper wont move between the nozzel and bed and then scratches   somewhere in between     just a thought
  finished 11 hours and 2 filament changes later
  i never use paper  i just eyeball it  with some practise thats all you need to get perfect first layer adhesion
  you can easily eyeball it if you use a glass/mirror/reflective surface if you use a matte surface and dont have good lighting in the room youre better off using paper    i use receipt paper since its thinner at 200/60 temperature until it barely scratches the nozzle    also receipt paper is thermal so i can draw cocks on it using the hot nozzle
trying to print emmets iris box  too much stringing and globbing for the tolerances box doesnt work  turn temp down a few degrees first layer adhesion is garbage but stringing is still happening
  i actually find it a bit harder with a reflective surface  matte surface works well and as for lighting ive got a small but powerful penlight near my printer to see if the print is coming together properly as the lighting conditions arent very good in that room
  the print probably only gets 30mm high i just had another different print fail in a similar way ill try running a simpler print through and seeing if something is currently fucked with my printer
how do i clean this sort of melted buildup im this anon  could this melted crap be contributing to my problem like maybe the heat builds up and this goop drops down and attaches itself to a part then pulls it away
  im a moron
  if its pla hit up at 150c it become easy to remove with tweezers
  sweet thanks now i just need to figure out how to preheat to only 150 on my printer im very new to all this
  plug an usb cable from 3d printer to pc  cura  or similar   pre heat to 150c  if you want to do it from your printer directly i guess it depends of your firmware but it should be something like   menu  control  nozzle  150
  cheers got it the second way lets hope this  a simpler print helps fix my problem
  ramps 14  mega 2560 is okay for most people specially beginners who dont want to spend too much and dont want to spend money on stuff they never use but at the same time the hardware is kinda at its limits and becoming somewhat outdated if you are running an octopi you probaly have noticed that the print quality is worse on complex prints even for cartisian machines than when you print from an sd card directly or didnt know about it and literally wasted almost a month trying to fix your printer like i did the ram of the mega 2560 is simply to full with other stuff so the buffer is too small to handle all the data sometimes over the usb tmc2130 were bit a mess for a long time since it involved changing stuff on the ramps for 24v with out 24v the tmc2130 aint at their full potential and at the beginning you had to use pins that were already use for the lcd dont get me even started with the hattel of getting the tmc2130 software confiugred on the ramps alternatively to make the ramps 24v you could connect the tmc2130 directly with the 24v but then you had to time the power on both supply voltages since if the wrong one got power before the other it could fry part of the ramps/2560  this is kinda the thing here with the ramps  2560 there is a solution for everything but those solutions often create entire different problems to downright damage your hardware when you dont know every aspect of the mod well someone is currently working on a ramps 17 with 16/32 bit 12/24v multiple rail different voltages for heaters/fans/motor drivers and tmc2130 support all configureable through jumpers but til you can get one cheap it probaly will take at least another half a year and then you probaly still have problems with design faults and shitty chinese producers  i am currently using a duet wifi on my older cartisian machine in prepartion of building a bigger new one and it is just so much more hazzle free and convinient stuff just works
  pretty good i have to say
  leave it  better than no insulation
  what about tmc 2100 arent they kinda like the 2130 but with less features do they require any special setup  i can totally understand how the 14 could be a restrictive platform but for me only having to pay 25 and getting basically the same performance with sd cards as with any other board is just damn hard to beat
  looks like a diy dart gun/airgun you can see the pressure chamber built into the stock and the picattiny rail piece is what looks like a pump for it
  what about tmc 2100 arent they kinda like the 2130 but with less features do they require any special setup  like i said before the solution is somewhere out there you have to figure it out on your own now that is part of the problem  i can totally understand how the 14 could be a restrictive platform but for me only having to pay 25 and getting basically the same performance with sd cards as with any other board is just damn hard to beat  i dont say that you should not get it you just should be aware that the system is kinda at its end or limit every change you want to make to it will be somewhat troublesome be it through new problems they cause or first trying to figure out how you need to do it the right way and in the end you might end with paying nearly as much as the costier option  for me it was   ramps 14 mega2560 display 4xa4988 i would not need about 35 simply didnt want to go for the cheapest crap  octopi rasperry pi 3 sd card power supply with switch about 50  5x genuine tmc2130 for movement and dual extrusion about 50  thats about 135 for a set up that still requires a ton of tinkering and learing just got a duet wifi instead for around 150 lost the display but got stronger drivers and cpu all configureable through a web interface on the other hand i am kinda stuck with it now  the question is what you want and need tinkering at the beginning can be good but it also can cause a lot of trouble and in the end you are fed up with it like me since you are dealing with so many different things at once that you just lose the overlook and spent time trying to figure out this and that problem if you dont have to care about the loudness and dont mind using the sd card by all means take the cheap route
  and like the article says  to bring the price down the team is working on 3d printing a mold for the hand instead of printing the hand itself every time just as i had suggested
  this is pretty fucking cute what kind of kit was needed to fit so few keys on a board
printing f1 wheel  still not done with left grip  want it to finish so i can start up right side before i go to sleep  why is it always so slow bros
finished the cable chains the bed chain was fucked up by the guy who designed the mod who didnt actually try out his own mod and realize it collided with his extruder tail someone made a remixed cover but fucked up the dimensions so that it didnt actually mate with the chain    oh well ill print a shim tomorrow
  finished the cable chains  does the cable chain add more noises 
  no but it looks cool
  it was a custom pcb a guy produced a small amount of a slanted version of the planck old case was pic related if youre interested in 40 boards look for the planck pcb or search for 40 keyboard pcb on ali
  why do people put cable chains on at all
its happened again it was a different but similar print this time i got over 5 hours into this print checking on it almost every 10 minutes absolutely nothing looks like its going wrong first layer was good minimal stringing no obvious warping on any parts then i go away for 30 minutes and find that one of the vehicles seems to have been picked up and pushed around by the extruder     im so confused everything looked perfect every time i checked and the file was different to the last fail ive also printed these models before maybe ill need to start printing these on rafts/brims would that help i hate using unnecessary bed adhesion since i know ive printed this without a raft or supports before     i know you guys cant help i just need to vent ive been trying to print these tint tanks for 3 days now every time i try it fails after a few hours printing on a cocooncreate model maker wanchai i3 mini thats never had any problems like this before     would there have been any way to save this print by just glueing the fucked object back onto the build plate to catch filament
  if you dont want to lose an entire batch why not print one at a time instead of all at once you llose some build volume but at least your failure rate doesnt destroy the entire batch
  im going to try printing an earlier setup with some of these same models that i know worked if i cant get that going then im stuck with printing in small batches which is less than ideal i dont particularly want i do one at a time since i need 38 of these tiny vehicles
  im pretty sure you could stack at least 78 vehicles in a single oaat batch on a 200200mm build plate thats just five batches at most certainly beats your current failure rate    personally id ditch the tape bed and go for a glass heated bed instead
  99 bad adhesion/warping the same thing happened to me when printing a batch of identical pieces 1 of them warped slightly probably because i didnt apply enough gluestick also shit filament the nozzle picked it up when travelling from one piece to another and it all became the grey tumor in pic related after 3 hours thank god octoprint exists and i could stop it remotely
  do you guys think that there might be a market  yes and no id love to print my own on my larger cr10s i want to print minis without having to waste an entire print bed for larger things but i sure as shit aint buying one
  part cooling and retractions
  because it spreads any wire fatige across the length of the wire instead of putting it on a single point it also keeps the wires from getting snagged or damaged
  you arent printing abs on an unheated bed are you  also how well are the parts stuck to the plate you ought to have some difficulty removing them they shouldnt just pop off
  what if i can guarantee prusa tier quality for 300 shipped as completely assembled and tested
do i really need to blow air from a radial fan on the nozzle or can i get the air from a regular fan 
  doesnt matter
  i can print it myself and i want to build one myself i also dont want to pay 300
  retraction is enabled and ive got the bestreviewed alternate shroud for the i3 mini on it
  its pla but an unbeated bed as for adhesion normally its pretty hard to remove but this time its a bit easier       tell me about your octopront setup if i get a heated bed theres no way im going to leave it unobserved       is there any particular reason a oaat batch is better as for heated bed its an upgrade ive considered i mostly print unattended and was concerned it would increase fire danger
  is there any particular reason a oaat batch is better  youre putting hot layers on each other isntead of laying down a layer then doing 31 other models and coming back to a cold one bad layertolayer adhesion can easily cause failed prints using the one at a time setting in cura instead of all at once allows you to fill the buildplate with models that get printed in one go which means if they fail which they will not as likely you dont ruin the entire batch like youve done    as for heated bed its an upgrade ive considered i mostly print unattended and was concerned it would increase fire danger  heated beds only go to 5060 degrees celsius for pla thats not a fire hazard your 220 degree nozzle is getting pla to stick reliably to an unheated bed is a pain
  heated beds only go to 5060 degrees celsius for pla thats not a fire hazard  if the thermistor is working and you have thermal runaway activated
  ive never seen a broken bed thermistor on any of the 20 printers i work with nor have i ever seen them reach dangerous/fire hazard temperatures despite the printers being operated and modified by barely qualified students using a printer without thermal runaway for the bed is a terrible idea nevermind for the nozzle
i bought all there fans thinking the cr 10 was going to be loud as shit but it turns out the one i got from gear best is quiet i rated it at only 45 decibels running at fr 100    assuming that everyone is running at fr 100 it looks like i got a machine that was updated with larger bed knobs and some blue lights in control box idk if anyone else has that    considering that i wont have it in my room i will just return all this to amazon    but is it worth hanging on to the 40x40x10 fan for the extruder just in case
   excuse me i dont mean the extruder i mean the hotend
why does cura do this stupid shit on top and bottom layers here the lines arent even inside the model
  arent those blue lines just travels
  i meant the thin yellow lines it seems to be related to the top/bottom pattern the issue goes away if i change it to concentric instead of lines but i suspect that the concentric pattern isnt as strong as the lines one for the rest of the model i have planned
  oh those are just something cura throws in gaps where a nozzle wide layer doesnt fit  also wtf is that model anyway
  its a test for a stem for keycaps heres the model you can see that cura puts those thin lines where it shouldnt
    ok i fixed it by making the line width 0805mm instead of 08mm 0805mm happens to be the thickness of those thinner walls at the end of the limbs on the cross this is weird because making those walls 08mm and setting the line width to 08mm doesnt work the walls wont print even with print thin walls enabled go figure
  its pla but an unbeated bed  then maybe the prints have started failing because of the colder environment since its winter try heating the bed to 30c or something
  i live in straya its getting warmer every day but that shouldnt be causing it i think it might be a part cooling problem i managed to catch a failed print today and it looked like some of the bits were curling up at their top edges so not adhesion but enough for it to grab     im trying a print i know was successful after relevelling and retaping the bed if i wake up to a plastic tumor im just going to give up and not print anything until my new fan arrives
  i bought a tevo tornado 303040 cm for less then that with good printquality aswell  its not 3d printed mostly assembled and near free shipping costs from gearbest
  is the hotend pushing down on the bed  otherwise tightem them all or just put some spacers in between  all springs should be equal tho so you should check if they are and maybe ask for 1 replacement
  its a nerf        heres my newer smaller design
  i ran into the same thing on my cr10s  i just got mirror tiles from home depot to replace the glass as they were significantly thinner
  yeah man your adhesion aint good enough so it catches and rips the part off of the bed  try some zhop settings that way your nozzle will not collide with curled up edges while moving
  chinaman puts out products at competetive prices thats for sure  but do take into account that bigger doesnt always equal better a smaller machine is gonna be more rigid allowing for more speed and accuracy for example and it being so compact is pretty cool as well making an enclosure for it or transporting the printer etc would be a breeze
well at least it prints  the heated bed doesnt function yet because the firmware on the melzi 20 that came with my tronxy x1 doesnt support it and those damn chinks didnt bother to include a bootloader
  tell me about your octopront setup  basically we just bought a raspi model b you want wifi and a good cpu put octoprint on it connected an old dusty microsoft lifecam and installed the telegram plugin to send a pic every 15 minutes or so i can also connect to the web interface or use the octoremote android app to see the life webcam feed and send commands once i pushed a print off the bed by controlling the extruder and started another one
  absolute madman
printer with a radial arm rather than xy rails   how dumb would that be
  the further out the extruder and god forbid direct drive stepper are from the axis of rotation the more force you need to accelerate the arm and the more rigid your arm must be  also it loses resolution as you move out of the centre of rotation like how a delta has less resolution the further away from the middle the extruder is
  yeah the resolution problem likely means its not even worth considering rigity could be solved using a quartercircle or whatever your sweep range is  maybe even full circle rail on the outside but if my understanding is correct that would be a heck of a lot more expensive than just a normal straight piece of extruded aluminium
    the melzi saga from earlier has been my main interest in this thread are you gonna try flashing a bootloader on it i wonder if the reason they disabled flashing is because the board has shitty or perhaps missing mosfets and putting a bed on would cause them to blow up can you post a pic of the board
  ill give that a shot on my next new print its currently printing an older print that i know works and it seems to be going fine after 8 hours ive heard theres a reason not to do zhop as well but cant remember what it is any idea what i should be looking out for
  serial scara 3d printer  you wouldnt believe
  2dof arms rather than a rail   i know zilch about robotics but that sounds like a nightmare at least compared to more sane designs and without any advantage i can see
  its finally working but now i hear its going to run out of filament before it finishes ive got maybe 2m of another filament left that i can try to hot swap but im not liking my chances
  oh now i know what was originaly ment well this exists too

  ive got two prusas and an ender 3 and i gotta say the ender is actually more hit the power press start and walk away friendly    for pretty much only one reason and that is prusas mesh bed leveling procedure can sometimes leave ooze and stringing on the fresh build surface the cheaper printers without auto leveling will just start faster once the printer is up to temp         ive got two mk2s and theyre great the bed really does need upgraded to the 25 u bolts though not sure how youre getting a kit they dont make mk2s anymore i bought both mine used on clist and ebay for about 400 usd each      i hit mine with a brass brush every once and a while while its up to temp removes tons of melty gunk      if youre printing from a pc or pi you can get plugins to remove objects from a print in progress it basically just erases any gcode that happens in the vicinity of the object you select to remove very handy when you have a single loose object on a bed of otherwise fine prints      i just test the heat bed first try to drive it to max temperature many printers cant even hit 80c on the heatbed when theyre trying tooon my personal machines i have a generic webcam pointed at my printers and the powerstrip my printers are on are connected to one of those iot switches so i can hit the power remotely the webcam is awesome even without any remote control over the power i can see the print in progress while i run to the store or even if i just hear strange noises from another room     unplugging a printer in motion isnt really a good idea but ill do it if its spewing spaghetti its not going to put out a fire though i highly suggest a smoke detector in very close proximity to your printer or inside the printers enclosure if you have one
  it made it i genuinely expected to come home to an unfinished print       i should start printing from a pc/pi i currently print from an sdcard and it certainly is limited
  forgot photo almost no filament left
  not sure how youre getting a kit they dont make mk2s anymore  for real its still listed on their website
  gotta love it when that happens keep the extra half meter for color changing top layer projects    
  yeah ive already ordered an usb adaptor or whatever that ought to be able to help me install a bootloader  alao as for the mosfets idk theyve got heatsinks glued on so i dont know if there is some model numbers on them or something
  woah your totally right i stand corrected    i wonder if they still have old parts and theyre selling them out or if they actually intend to offer two products at different price pointsi can tell that one of my mk2 has parts that were made on a mk3 powder coated build plate    the mk2 is a great printer id buy a third one if i found it for sale nearby you dont need a filament sensor power interruption memory or a fancy removable build plate with the right tools prying plastic of peipcb is not hard at all
  honestly if those prices represent the actual cost of the printers i could see the mk2 staying around almost same results for 150 cheaper a lot of customers like me will prefer that  now if the 750 price is just because its a new product and theyre paying back investments etc i could totally see them dropping the price of the mk3 kit to the same as the mk2 kit in the future and completely dropping the mk2 but i kinda doubt it theyre the same machine the mk3 is just the luxury version
    wait nvm the extruder mosfet doesnt have a heatsink prolly doesnt need one as the extruder doesnt draw that much current im not 100 sure if the heatbed uses same sorts of mosfets but it probably does hope that text helps you identify it  if i manage to upload firware to it i think the solution on the issue of being unable to upload firmware on chink melzis ought to be added to the op
  ah fuck now that i look at the picture again i can see that the heatbed mosfet is way bigger
  well ya thats for sure more rigid more better he but im not sure you are gonna get a more rigid setup using 3d printed parts instead of allu extrusions  and considering how much allu is in the tornado i think you should be able make it inmovable when scaling down to 2020 but im not as confident in it if it contains a lot of 3d printed parts  but i would be happy if you could change my mind
  yeah the 3d printed frame is a tad iffy but im getting a quality printer to print it so it is absolutely straight and square also its like 60mm thick so i think rigidity wont be an issue  with those two considerations ill have solved the two most commong problems i run into when playing around with aluminum how to get everything absolutely straight who knows if chinaman managed to cut the ends of the extrusions absolutely square and getting the whole thing rigid
      ok that doesnt look bad at all  all the mosfets are there and it seems like theyve beefed up the component size and thermal pads for the voltage regulator and bed mosfet compared to the stock design which is good i cant tell what the models are since theyre hidden by heatsinks but the fairchild fdd8580s for the hotend and fan are more than sufficient for them bigger mosfets doesnt necessarily mean theyre better but at least it hints at good intentions on the designers part    by the way when you do get a proper marlin working with it be prepared to have to muck about with the configurationh a lot things like axis directions endstop config steps/mm thermistor tables etc are most likely going to differ from the original someone made a configurationh for the tronxy x1 here that might be worth comparing to    
  progress bad    sure the smarts arent an obvious improvement but there are moments when youre happy to have them as long as theyre implemented right theres literally nothing wrong with them    the mk3 also has an improved y axis and more stabillity so its more rigid than the mk2    the flex bed is also really nice to have and makes things easier and quicker     im more concerned about the i3 series using 3d printed parts for its construcion elements an im a bit worried about the 8bit platform of the mk3
does anybody here have a solidworks associate degree in additive manufacturing
  no but i do have to take a lecture called additive manufacturing  according to it desktop fdm/fff printers are called fabbers and there is a fabber scene of young individuals who use these fabbers
anyone knows where can i get functional prosthetics files  the kind that doesnt require complex electronics just simple pulley systems
i recently bought a stratocaster to replace my super crappy unbranded chinese telecaster i love my strat but now i miss the twang the tele had the problem is that my tele was 80 from china has no branding or serial number of any sort and most of all has no balls the tone is very dead and theres zero power behind it    is it worth putting money into it to upgrade the pickups would the other electronics be okay or would i have to gut the whole thing im not looking to put more than 300 total into this guitar the neck is straight the body is in good condition i think its basswood and it feels comfortable to play so i feel as though i have all the bones to make a really killer axe on a budget    pic related same color scheme as my guitar
  maybe try a guitar forum most advanced guitarists do mod their guitars in one way or another with pickups being one of the most modded components   but before you do such things you should make sure you understand and take advantage of all the basics of setting up / adjusting your guitar and do that first  things that will absolutely effect your sound and playing characteristics like adjusting the truss rod bridge nut string height and radius intonation and pickup height and tilt quality of strings and string gage    
dude apart from the pickup a guitar has pots a switch and maybe a capacitor replace the pickups and youll have a good tone
  humbuckers  duel humbuckers in all 3 positions
you can buy good pickups and then put them in a better guitar down the road
  is it a legit fender strat  or one of those cheap clones
hit up stewmac and replace all the electronics itll likely be a significant improvement for not that much dosh
  im definitely going to do a tune up a big problem is the height of the saddles does the nut really make that big a difference i thought it just kept the strings in place      once i open up the cavity should i shield the pots i could do this very cheaply with some insulating metal      true what price range do you consider good i dont want to spend over 200 on a bridge and neck pickup set im not trying to build my own master craft guitar just something unique      pic is the strat 1984 tokai goldstar sound  i wouldnt call it a cheap clone id call it a great clone      ill check them out thanks
  does the nut really make a difference  maybe a pretty minor thing compared to other stuff but it can if its poorly made or improperly fit/mounted
  hey that tokai is sweet i had a tokai gold top lp for a loaner that was great i dont know if i would put 200 into a cheap guitar but that may just me be op i have a squier strat and will get the volume pot replaced when i get it set up again but only because its worn out i also have a tele but i purchased it because of the superior tone and therefore am not interested in modifying it much of the tone is in the pickups but also in the bridge and body of a tele
when i had a lowend strat squier the worst thing was the pots they were complete shit and all the wiring connections were horribly done and the chord plug jack was pure shit
  if the necks not complete shit and has no dead spots then yes start by upgrading the pickups i did a pickup upgrade on a cheap yamaha bass went with wizard pickups from the uk eventrually    inb4 
  shield the entire cavity it will be that much quieter than before    put in a switchcraft jack so you can slam an instrument cable into it thousands of times     gfs pickups at a minimum more if youre feeling spendy
so /diy/ im looking into casting some stuff in pewter starting next year pouring not spincasting since i just dont have the space for that kinda setup    what sort of silicone or rubber would you recommend for making my own molds im looking more at rtv stuff than anything that takes extra long to get ready but ill take what i can find     im in the usa too for purposes of buying stuff
  
  pewter  watch out for lead fumes bro    i recommend you stay far away from that shitcast aluminum shit
  i recommend you stay far away from that shit    modern pewter does not contain lead at least not in first world countries
i need to open the upholstery on a chair to repair a broken wooden upright but the cloth in the back is held together with whatever this is  looks sort of like a zipper but its not any ideas
  that is a zipper
  how is it a zipper if there are no visible teeth and no mechanism on either end to open or close it
  unzip chair
  have a good look at either end itll be there maybe tucked under something    or they took out the carriage after zipping it but that would be more work than its worth    but that is a zipper
  there is nothing on either end  another key point is that there is no metal whatsoever  it must be entirely plastic and they dont make plastic zippers i held my magnetic stud finder to it and got nothing
   they dont make plastic zippers    
  your picture is of a reverse nylon coil zipper do a search on google images for reverse nylon coil zipper if you dont believe me
  ok if it is a plastic zipper its clearly zipped from the inside of the fabric not the side facing me not sure why they would do that but if that is the case im screwed   id have to undo all of the staples in the upholstery and id never be able to get it taught enough to restaple it after i repair the chair frame
  if it is a zipper and im sure it is you can unzip it from the end even if it doesnt have the zipper thingy on it there but im guessing it does youve just not found it yet even if its on the inside you can still get a hold of the back of it with some sort of hook and pull to open    if you are content to replace the zipper you can probably just stab it in the middle with a flathead screwdriver to separate both sides of the zip and then pull them apart      but replacing a zipper is never fun so i suggest you have another look and feel for a zipper carriage on either end it may be nonmagnetic material and it may be tucked under good
  sigh    unzips
post a pic when youve unzipped it
the absolute state of this board
  benis
  we all started as n00bs and he is doing it himself we should encourage that
  the invisible zipper end is about 1/2 inch behind the edge hidden in the zipper pocket so it looks nice push in at the ends and look for the grip
  yeah wow its great that were past the old cant recognize a zipper or even attempt to investigate it yourselfphase
that might be some sort metal lacing see if theres a rod or wire that run through the center of it
jesus christ youre a cunt op
  diy how to use a zipper doesnt warrant any encouragement retard
   diy how to use a zipper doesnt warrant any encouragement retard    any honest question deserves a decent reply if you disagree with that then you are most likely not as competent as you believe yourself to be
  op here  so i did end up taking this apart by removing the upholstery staples last night and heres what they did  it is a completely plastic miniature zipper with no remaining tab they had closed the zipper leaving extra slack on both ends then folded the fabric over and stapled it thoroughly leaving extra slack then they the cut the remaining slack so that there are no longer slider of plug parts to the zipper remaining i just repaired the broken wood with a metal bracket and reattached everything with t50 staples
  thanks for reporting back    i cant conceive of the mind of someone who would staple up a zipper and think they did a good job but there it is
  any honest question deserves a decent reply  surely that is why we remove easily googleable obviousspoonfeeding questions since like 9 years back
  stop shitposting oh pee  
  why the fuck would they put a zipper on it if theres no way to zip or unzip it ive never heard of such a thing before and it seems like a waste of money would be a lot cheaper to just sew it like all the other edges
  it could be a plastic zipper usually coated in metallic lead based paint especially if it from china
it is a zipper but the part that separates the teeth is hidden look on the side of the chair or what ever u are working with and follow that flap for the end of the zipper
what is that copper pad its the inside of a battery bank on a phone doesnt appear to be nfc and i dont really have any idea for what else it could be
pressure swelling cell or temperature sensing my bet would be on first
  i tried squeezing it a fair bit and it did nothing
  most that i see with a flap state that its a battery with thermo sensor
  temperature sensing    smd rt    yeah copper to sense a larger area
  could it be the wireless charging coil
  it checks for water damage to void the warranty
  its for the wireless charging
    
  obviously its a spy chip hacked into it by fancy bear to track all and every your bowel movement
  this  more exactly this is a rf antenna it is used to transmit power usage to several national agency
  dafuq are you on about son
what do you think of the trades are they that demanding on the body is there a trade where you are not on call all the time not super physical and can get home and done with at a reasonable hour
appliance repair is pretty gravy and pays well although you will be on call on rotation
  can you teach a young guy to do it for you later in life yesgood trade
  is there a trade where you are not on call all the time not super physical and can get home and done with at a reasonable hour  mowing/landscaping not hard if you have the right tools
  what do you think of the trades  im a cabinetmaker by trade and its good  are they that demanding on the body  if you are bereft of any and all common sense then yes it probably isive been a cabinetmaker going on 28 years now and my body is fine  is there a trade where you are not on call all the time not super physical and can get home and done with at a reasonable hour  cabinetmaking
  i built a rc mower    i firmly believe lawn mowing services will be a thing of the past soon
  learn wood floor amd tile laying then pay a crew instead of bust ass    trim carpenter     plumber    general contractor means u just spend all day being a cunt and making money
  what do you think of the trades  work as a tool and die maker i think machinist and millwrights are jokes other than those shits pretty good   are they that demanding on the body  depends where you work what you do and how much overtime you work shit like welding or any other physical type of work is very hard on the body surprisingly contorting yourself to weld one handed above your head on a ladder doesnt do much for you over the course of 40 years  is there a trade where you are not on call all the time not super physical and can get home and done with at a reasonable hour  really depends on the place you work ive had jobs that are 73 no on call and no overtime ive had jobs where you work 3 rotations and have all the overtime you want     shit varies so much from place to place but from experience if you dont want to be on call dont be a contractor
if youre good with tools  figuring out puzzels then try hvacr real good pay after you put your time in a couple of drawbacks 1 crawling around in tight spots  dealing with sheet metal 2 when its beautiful outside youre fixing air conditioners  when its a blizzard outside youre messing with furnaces 3 alot of your coworkers/bosses will be assholes
  well a big energy company just hired me for an apprenticeship as an electrician for operating technology how did i do  it sounds really comfy and the company told me that robots wouldnt be an issue
  how demanding it is on your body depends on how well you take care of yourself if you overwork have shit posture dont work out dont do flexibility exercises dont wear ppe and so on youre gonna be cripple    start by learning how to bend correctly      then make sure you are halfway fit and do flexibility training and youll be fine    if you have a physical job youve got to train for it just like if you played a physical sport the body mechanics are the same do it right and youll be healthy as fuck for the rest of your life
  almost all trades will ruin some part of your body sadly this is due to the fact it will almost guaranteeably involve repetitive motion of those body parts to some degree plumbers get bum knees and backs wood workers get a smaller form of jackhammer hand and shoddy wrists and elbows landscapers get blown knees and hurt backs and possibly hurt hands welders start going blind any shop or warehouse worker gets some sort of tinnitus and cooks get crippling downward spiraling depression and alcoholism issues but dentists get eye and hand issues office workers get carpal tunnel and eye issues plus possible back and foot issues    the takeaway here is that any work you do for a living will wreck up some part of your body thats just how the games played what you should be looking into and caring about isnt will this wreck my body but will that shit wreck your soul and will to live if you love working with wood and/or physical activity fuck it go work with wood if you love shop work like cncing or manufacturing fuck your eye sight go do that shit just find a job/career/trade youll enjoy and wont regret taking because nothing kills you faster than having to hate waking up every morning dreading your work day hating your day because you hate your work then going home and hating that theres only so many hours left before you have to go back to work that you hate  i know it sounds like the b yurself of career advice but its honestly one of the best bits of advice out there dont go into x trade/job/career because you heard they currently need more of those and it pays good money go into x trade/job/career because you have genuine interest in it and ignore the damn pay it will get better to some degree the deeper in you get
    what this guy said
  seconding what this guy said    im in low voltage switchboard manufacturing i love the work its about 90 workshop bound and relatively clean plus you get exposure to alot of different industries when you work on site    drawbacks heavy on the hands/wrists and neck and yes i will probably get tinnitus at some point although im very careful with hearing protection    i only know that i like it so much because ive worked on alot of shitty building sites dust everywhere heavy loads alot of up and down builders have it hard but they do get paid accordingly
  what about electricians does the electricity actually make you crazy
  only if you put your peepee in it
  nah electricians are born crazy contrary to popular belief think like a pyromaniac/pyrosexual is to fire they seek it out subconciously  what it does do is absolutely mangle your knees sometimes give that whole mild form of jackhammer hand generally mess with your entire hand especially wrists and fuck your spine up  if you have to carry 100lbs of 4 pvc 10 times by hand to the work area from wherever it may be or pull cord by hand that shit can fuck you up offhandedly if done enough outright and most of your job will have you on your knees all damn day for your career possibly at awkward angles or bent over with your wrists and fingers in awkward positions its just really harsh on your knees spine and hands due to how you end up putting pressure or strain for prolonged periods of times on your body either by holding them up in ways they dont like contorting them for long periods of time they dont like sitting your weight on them for periods of time they dont like or lugging heavy shit by hand like any blue collar work    there really is no career that wont yield wear and tear to one degree or another on parts of your body its just the nature of performing repetitive movements as a career
  lmao fuck i want a career but everything is deadly might as well be a soiboi musician at this point
  musicians get carpal tunnel bum livers and if theyre good at what they do at least one or more stds    also im not advocating not getting a career because that shit fucks your body im advocating saying fuck it and getting a career you actually want to do as a living not a career youll end up hating because you dont care about it simply because it pays well the whole does x career cause bodily damage argument while important and kept in mind shouldnt sway you towards or away from a career it should just be a known and accepted thing that happens as a result of any career you pick  like carpentry accept that youll get bum joints from the shoulder to your finger tips and go into carpentry like welding accept that youll lose some visual acuity and blow your knees and lower back out and go into welding like accounting accept that youll lose some visual acuity and get carpal tunnel and go into accounting etc   resultant bodily injury from career long repetitive motion is an important thing of note but should in no way dictate your career choice unless youre someone whos got stubs for legs and sitting on the nubs all day as an electrician causes serious tissue damage or something similar where its not just basic wear and tear but serious harm
  trades are great pay is good and a lot of them give as much ot as you do or dont want that being said a lot of apprenticeships are labor intensive to get rid of the chaff stick with it and it will pay dividends
  usually the more dangerous the better the pay worked offshore oil for a few years worked 6 months a year and cleared 200k easy
  i think youre right big guy     anyway theres all these stats on how there arent enough skilled workers but i dont know shit about the actual jobs beyond /diy/ memes dunno how young retards around my age decide what to pursue everyone under 30 is an autist with zero skills and no self awareness plus all my friends who went into the labor force went construction and promptly overdosed on fentanyl bananas    i want for nothing subsistence with the added bonus of having dad skill being able to fix fucking everything somehow is all i need
  generally speaking you make a decision based on your personality  step 1 are you the kind of guy that wants to do physical or involved work or are you the kind of guy that wants to do office work like typing writing and filing  seeing as were talking trades step 2 assumes you chose physical  step 2 look into basic classes at your technical college to see what is offered everyone ive seen does workshops or short 2 month classes aimed at working adults with a few hours at the end of the day to spare for 4x 5day classes take the plunge and pick one you think you might like or the one you think youll hate the least and see if its for you i know plenty of guys who tried welding classes like that who ended up loving the whole deal from improving their welds to know what voltages needed to be used and shit like arc cones i also know plenty who tried welding and decided it wasnt for them  step 3a enjoy trying out your new career in an actual indepth class  step 3b try out step 2 with another one of the short classes    these classes are intended to do just whats written above because of the lack of skilled workers in highskilled blue collar work being an issue not enough join so they offer these just a taste short term low commitment classes to try and have you shuffle the deck a bit and hopefully get you to decide on skilled blue collar work of any variety rather than get you overwhelmed with choices and walking off theres also career counselors and shit which can try to help pinpoint which you might want to take and give you a little more insight into each class and what that career entails in things ranging from what youll be doing to graduated hiring rates to pay  as for the labor force deal it is a stressful occupation often times requiring long hard hours under possibly cruel conditionstight cramped spaces exposed to the elements strung up hundreds of feet with no floor beneath you etc cont
  nobody is going to listen to you because you are clearly retarded
  doing what
  and is often considered the realm for people who feel theyre idiots or dont have other optionswhich is patently untrue it has more vertical and horizontal movement options than white collar work for smarter or more capable individuals it also has a lot of low skill positions but so does basic office work with less chance for upward or sideward movement which leads to the stress of the job eating them alive you also see this with shit like doctors emts accountants managers and cooks to name a few its not endemic to just labor workers but every worker in high stress jobs  this is why its important that you pick a career in this field if this is the field for you at all based not on pay but your genuine interest in it pay is only enticing for so long and quite literally lacks the psychological attachments your brain needs to keep you afloat the way genuine desire and enjoyment in the work and workplace does and/or the sense of accomplishment at the end of it all   you could be in a frozen shit hole like northern alaska working as an electrician on a pipeline going out in 20f before windchill weather to redo the wiring bundles by hand and a tired old hairdryer with a mile long extension cord held together by old electrical tape to make the cables supple enough to move before crashing back in a small bunkhouse hours later whos interior temp is a toasty 10f you share with 20 other asshats who havent showered in a week and fart more than they exhale for the next 6 months and the difference between it being a living hell you possibly tolerate and it being genuinely one hell of a life experience youll look back on fondly and maybe even brag about to your kids/grandkids isnt pay but your genuine love of the craft and/or the sense of accomplishment at persevering through that shit sure the pays a nice cherry on top but it is not what will get you and your brain through it and out the other side whole and have
  last bit i swear    this is why most run off apprenticeships like  says its for you as much as it is for them and theres no shame in saying its not for you and moving on compared to locking yourself down with something that will bite you in the ass down the road
  consider property or facility management its usually a stready 40 hour job and the schedule varies on which industry you work in theres always lateral movement into supervisory or director positions as long as you got some certs/education its a pretty comfy job kinda fell into it earlier this year its pretty much a handyman gig fixing everything what can be fixed and letting contractors handle the more specific detailed work bright side is you can easily make a 6 figure job after 10 years or just manage wealthy individuals properties and for like 600k a year
  got in 1st was fluid power specialist fancy way of saying bop mechanic/hydro specialist then was subsea
  one good trade low physicalitycomparatively speaking is good ic or ie techs work with a lot of automation type stuff sensors etc but have to be smarter then average grunt involves a lot of trouble shooting
  well said i honestly miss oil work loved the travel loved the work and loved the people i worked with oil rig has to be most unpc workplace on the planet
  i have worked in a lot of different fields before just noticed when i tried to get friends into same fields also majority of my friends wouldnt make it past 1st 30 days as op is someone looking to go into trades figured a heads up would be a decent thing to warn about
  only until you start getting cash customers on the side and then quit kek i really should have tried this long ago im about to yeet my oven off a fucking bridge
  if they specifically said that expect to be replaced soon by a robot kek
  how demanding it is on your body depends on how well you take care of yourself if you overwork have shit posture dont work out dont do flexibility exercises dont wear ppe and so on youre gonna be cripple    can confirm    im a retard and fell like 8 feet in 2010 can hardly walk anything over half a mile and my ahit pops and cracks and hurts worse for 3 days ive walked a little ways to my loader and loaded about 20 dumptrucks with rock have my bumb cankle propped up in my office still hurts like a mutherfucker and lol at ever getting a real job again no education so im stuck here at 40k until i find a way to retire early or die beoken and old from a grabber out here trying    wear your ppe use your fucking brains and work towards something that pays very well so you can live comfy and save half to invest then your working career ends before 30    publically anyway
  this i took a 30 hour and lower pay paycut to work only 50 hours and not hate my job as much worth it
  no but falling off a ladder will suck stand on concrete all day running around kneeling down to dick with outlets etc      theres a town somewhere with radio waves banned because people claim injury from it
  muh carpal tunnel and tinnitus    kek get a career and invest until you can quit maybe hop several careers to deminish wear and tear on your body and get broader experience
  damn i always wanted to do that my dad was a tool pusher kek growing up    got cripoled before i ever got the chance now my only chance at working on one is as an osha cocksucker or boat driver or something
  then go into trades and quit every 6 months to a year    you should be well versed enough to build your own home and see wich one you like     or say fuck all that and get a trim carpentry jobs and then become his competitor or manager
  ha remind me safety man is decent paying tradejust everyone will hate your guts and be secretly trying to figure out how to mirder you and make it look like an accident
  ive thought about getting into automation would you happen to know what classes to look out for
  instruments and controls a lot of tech schools out there for it also online stuff or look for opening for apprenticeship
  appreciate it i do wastewater treatment and the money just isnt in compared to the time it eats up
  tinnitus isnt even that bad and you could easily get it on a worksite
        i can tell you now that photo where he has applied the sealant in waves is wrong it should be applied in horizontal or vertical lines only never waved    regards a mechanical electrical engineer
stuck in a manufacturing warehouse all day and i hate it i need to look into trade schools but i feel like i am a little too old to go into one and i dont even know what i want to go in for maybe carpentry or tileing all craigslist jobs want experience in doing something related
  go into it with the intention of finding the right kind of job hvac tech here spent years busting my ass and being on call all the time now i work at a single site thats 3 minutes from home they pay 100k salary plus bonus and benefits and side cash and most of my day is spent in my bosses office spewing simpsons quotes
  all due respect im betting the phrase close enough has never passed your mechanical electrical engineering lips this is why people dont like you and associate the spectrum with engineers
      i think if you drop a heavy item and your tiles break because you didnt set your adhesive right is worth pointing out  you should have a minimum of 80 coverage when tiling but hey heres me happily married loads of friends and tons of money  if thats being on the spectrum sign me up
i post on /biz/ all the time ive been laying tile for 4 years now i charge about 50 an hour for my labor i usually only do actual labor about 20 hours a week then spend 15 hours getting customers putting out fliers answering emails     so i work like 35 hours a week i never fight traffic and im usually home before 5pm ill make about 75k this year     im pretty happy and i used to think this was great but now its starting to catch up my neck and spine have minor pain and clicking noises its very clear at this point im damaging my back at most i can do this another 5 years     so im looking at other jobs i can get with my experience     trades seem like good money in the beginning but that manual labor catches up on the body
    what qualifications/ experience do you need for these jobs
  welders start going blind  only if ur retarded with a shit hood  my aerospace shop has a few 70yr welders that see well enough to pass xray and penetrant inspection  but then again we use less than 60 amps for most parts
  what kind of hourly wage does an experienced cabinet maker make what location are you     im currently working at a millshop doing work for vegas casinos i do all the shops custom work and operate the cnc     im a furniture maker by profession but theres no furniture making here so im doing cabinets instead for a while    very enjoyable trade if you can call it that ive been doing it 10 years only complains are lower back pain but im working on that i am worried about long term dust exposure though its not practical to wear a respiratory all day
  buddy of mine went to ic tech school in texas think class was around 12 months cost around 610k and he is making around 43/hr with a ton of ot opportunities and he has only had the job for 23 years
  several routes you can start as a roustabout and work your way up or get into drilling/oil/gas tech training most companies will pay for the tech school if you sign contract for 24yr commitment with 2050k bonus at end of contractto stay with that company sniping is bad in oilngas if you are good at what you do is not uncommon to get at least 23 job offers a month from other companies and these guys will absolutely throw money at you had one guy tell me didnt care what i was currently making he would double it if i worked for his crew   schedule is rough for normal people if you get on a drilling crew standard rotation is 21days on 21days off used to be 28/28 but a lot went to 21/21 and this is 7 days a week 1216hours a day if you are field service side can be a lot tougher i did a rig move from s korea to singapore and that was 90 days straight 12 hour days 7 days a week made about 90k in 3 months though
  one more thing a warning or heads up oilngas is a very boom bust environment when it is booming it is awesome but in bust phase expect to get laidoff until it booms again it is just the nature of the industry great for single guy but not so good if you have a family just a fair warning
  not much you can do to avoid it outright unless youre all wearing wrap around entirely contained helmets complete with shade 14 passive lens 24/7 any exposure is exposure not bashing it nor am i saying youll actually go blind blind but the uv/if it gives off are essentially welders burn on your retinas and damage to that area doesnt heal like it does on your skin thats just the nature of that profession   sidenote this is why passive lens are arguably better than adf as adf has lag between the spark and it darkening which while insanely short yields exposure that passive lens would have protected against  just like ear pro theres only so much equipment can do to prevent long term wear on your body
  thats fuddlore  your old fudd is blind because he didnt wear a helmet all the time    the uv/ir protection is always on  
  well shit i heard that from teachers and professionals alike for years now  a quick googling gave me this though  which makes some sense its possible the visible spectrum flash you receive before the best filters can kick in is still a possible danger if ill studied as of yet though who knows now im trying to find that en379 bit they mentioned either way youre still getting flashed to some degree unless the other guys working in essentially another room until your helmets on
  cooks get crippling downward spiraling depression and alcoholism issues    i worked in kitchensshortorder to fine dining through high school and college every single person i worked with smoked like chimney and drank like a fish the cooks chefs souschefs dishwashers and waitstaff all addicts
  yeah that one was from experience  everybody gets stressed when its a properly running kitchen so things like weed alcohol and nicotine become vices that people can take solace in especially when things go from stressful to you finally getting time for a nic fix which instantly makes you feel better possibly coincidentally ive yet to work in a kitchen where there was never less than 70 of the staff having experienced the wonder of being jailed for any period of time at some point in their lives and plenty of others simply admitted they were just good at not getting caught
  tool and die maker  what do you think of the trade
  have you also tried making sure that you are working with proper form bending at the hips and not arching yout back maybe its something that you could fix and
  
  this is sorta true but doesnt really address the amounts generally construction workers and similar have a lifespan of about 10 years less than desk job people every job will lean on parts of you more but some will fuck you up way more than others and many trades tend to it totally depends on the specifics like the company but in general manual labor jobs are underpaid overworked and will wear you out
worked as a painter between the ages of 1825 enjoyed the work and made some really good cash doing it taxes lol one winter when work was slow i was browsing jobs on my counties website and saw a listing for a locksmith at a mental health facility filled out the application got a phone call 2 days later and was offered the job on the spot at the interview  less money but the benefits for a state employee are insane you get tons of paid time off sick days and in my state a pension that matches you dollar for dollar eligible to retire at age 50 after 20 years vested stay pretty busy too because its basically an asylum where every employee has keys and every door is locked  long story short check your county/state websites for government employee jobs
  even better id assume there a few to no women i work in a warehouse with women and hate every day i wake up for work at 3am when oilfields open back up this spring i think im going to go try it
  majority of trades have very very few women the ones who do show up either get fired/quite because they are fucking idiots trying to larp as a man but the ones who stick around and make it are some of the best trades people i know
what are some lowrisk trades both in terms of legal liability and physical danger im not about to be a roofer and risk being crippled just for a few bucks over something much safer
  instruments and controls/electronics very low voltage growing field automation a lot of thinking/problem solving involved relative to other trades not super physically demanding fairly safe depending on work environment
  any tips for how to get started in the field
  tech/trade schools are best bet apprenticeships are awesome but often only posted for legal reasons if good tech/trade school chances are you will have multiple job offers before you even complete the course i am in texas so wages may vary by state but here entry level can expect 3035/hr and if you are good at what you do 3845 after 23 years to try and keep you there after you become ic guy with experience can pretty much apply anywhere that your trade supports and get a job easy better bargaining power if already working though as in you can straight tell prospective employer not enough money

so ive just started a channel on youtube about making stuff from recycles material like popsicle stick soda can bottle or used straws not sure this thread suitable posted here but i thought this fit best im a little struggle to find a community that interested in those kind of crafting and was wonder if anyone can help me with some suggestion  thank you very much
  what are you trying to sell us just fucking get on with it
but i struggled to find audience in a couple of months back and so i think it would be nice if i can ask for anyone knowing about a community that interested in my kind of work
  crafting  such a gay thing to say
  subscribe to pewdiepie with screenshot as proof first then and well talk
wow didnt know pewdiepie like these stuff too and just known asking for suggestion is gay d

i decided to turn my shed into a gym and so decided to plywood the floor and walls the problem ive got now is that where the floor boards meet there is a gap an it doesnt sit on the floor underneath and whenever you walk over it it makes a horrible squeaking noise already tried screwing it down three times before i realised my screws were too short  i know i wasnt thinking straight had a few whiskey cokes by then do i just need to get longer screws screw it down then filler the gap
  idk op i guess your screwed  next time instead of whiskycoke drink a screwdriver or a whiskydriver
also to add the reason why this section wasnt screwed down in the first place is because underneath it is only the shed floor whereas all the other places i screwed it down there was the wooden planks as the shed base underneath the floor so would it be ok to just screw into the shed floor and nothing else underneath it
  or a whiskeyscrew screwwhiskey driverdriver
hello fellow /diy/ers i have this thing and i have no idea what it is never seen anything like it either the handle to the right is adjustable and if i twist it it unscrews and it swivels there are two markings stamped into the steel one says german steel and the other one ohn  i cannot make out the first letter but i think it is either an i or a j can anyone id this thing my first thought was some sort of drawknife but i cant find anything like it and the blade profile seems really skinny i can take more pictures if necessary thanks 2 foot ruler for scale
  what kind of boots are those
  the handle to the right is adjustable and if i twist it it unscrews and it swivels    weird    for taking bark off  leatherworking  going around a giant potato to make those spiral potato things
this is easy  thats called a  cheese willy or willy for short  its for cutting large cheese wheels it originated in wisconsin by a man named charles lethium 1864 one man rolled the large wheel of cheese while holding the horizonal handle as the man in the back pushed and controlled the feed or cut man this take me back thanks for sharing anon and enjoy your willy
  large debarking draw knife for large dense wood verticle handle is power horizontal is guiding    sorry for poor english
  this smaller versions are also used for working logs into rough shape before moving on to the plane

  rape machine
  nothing makes you cut the cheese like someone pulling out their big willy
  its not what you guys think this is not a draw knife or a cheese knife its the cutting lever from a paper or more likely a shingle cutter the one perpendicular handle is not original to this item rather that is where the knife/cutter blade is attached to the base there is more wear on one side of the blade the side that is closest to the connection point of the base and the point of most frequent contact with items being cut
  not for shingles or splitting wood most likely the pivot would need to be much further from the blade for that so it could travel the full length of the wood being split and the thick portion and the back of the blade would interfere cutting anything deeper then the blade from edge to the thick portion if it was for splitting wood it would be shaped much like a splitting axe in profile     you are right on the basic operation though it is a shear of some sort i know i have come across these before but i can not quite place it
my dad used one of those he also had a smaller 18 one same configuration he carved walking sticks called it the german draw knife
  could be some sort of stock knife for clog carving or cheese cutter
  ariat groundbreakers
    heres a picture with the handle removed for scale now that i look at it the pivot handle doesnt seem to show its age like the rest of the piece and it is a different style and finish from the other handle so it is possible that it isnt original

  a guillotine paper cutter repurposed
  correct my exmother in law used those to groom her gunt scabs i went through many rolls of hardfacing wire keeping an edge on them
reminds me of a clog knife
  this
  blade from some sort of fodder chopper
  except its a paper cutter
looks like a debarker to me
    there are differrent ways for it foddercutter most likely paper cutter usually has differen grip looking up and not down
  after seeing this it seems   is correct that it was some sort of fixed cutter for paper or other materials and was later repurposed as a draw knife like  said
  down modern
im getting into wood working and carpentry as a hobby and the first thing i wanted to build is a new desk i used dowel joints because from my understanding they make a good solid structural joint i have 5 in each connecting board but should i have put glue between each board as well or just on the dowels and their respective connecting holes
  in this case you should have put glue between each board  what diameter/length dowels did you use    dowels arent great as far as joinery goes very useful for making sure your boards are aligned well though
  definitely should have jointed and glued each edge will surely get gaps as they adjust to moisture
  these    eh live and learn i can always go buy some more wood and try again     thanks for the tip though
  any way i can save it or is it fucked
  not that anon but it should be easy enough to redo just rip it down the seams clean up and joint the edges as mentioned and reglue forget the dowels and just align the boards with calls during glue up the wood looks rough so youll need to plane or scrape it either way then just finnish with 220 grit and throw some poly on it
also since its been i while lets go ahead and call this a woodworking general whats everyone working on building a bed myself anyone have a good recommendation for filling the edges of plywood before clear poly i get that you would use bondo before paint but not sure what to use under a clear finish
  a mixture of sawdust and wood glue if you want it to match better i forget the ratio but it is a common technique so it should be easy to google
  id leave it as is modern glue is extremely strong  if youre really worried about it recess or not a cross member
  best way to rip them without damaging the wood or at least damaging it too bad
  leave it in your shop for about 2 weeks without touching it to let it adjust to the local humidity if it doesnt split at the joints you can save it     then plane it flat and finish the table seal it with like 5 coats of polyurethane to prevent humidity changes from getting into the wood too fast and warping it
  just run a saw down the glue lines or as the other anon said just wait and see if it lives
  kinda feel like i should just go ahead and rip them since i only put glue on the dowels and in the holes feels like it will be a waste of time and a potential safety issue i do intend for this to be a work desk in my room i do intend on putting some braces on it as well but id feel better if i just went ahead and did it     fuuuuuck i knew i should have
  anon    before ripping the boards maybe try clamping them to a strong surface with one board overhanging by its full width then bear down on the overhanging board trying to wiggle it up and down pretty sure youll be able to wiggle it enough and break the glue at the dowel joint then just pull the fucker off rinse and repeat if you have a table saw or another easy means of ripping the boards go ahead      how big is that bed full    i dont know if youve yet to do it but id round over the edges of the plywood too it would tie in better with the posts imo    i recently made this pretty ugly waterfall bar table some some rough 10/4 wood from costa rica we get the slabs pre sanded and filled with shit tier epoxy theyre never flat or true so cutting miters accurately is a bitch especially when you want to keep the grain flowing over the side
  queen yeah everything in the build is getting a complete edge to edge roundover this was while i was fitting the half laps so still long before those finishing touches i cant afford a jointer/planer yet so the sections in the legs were all milled on the table saw that meant i had to wait till the laps were done before i trim the beam ends flush wit the legs which is pretty chill as you just use the two side surfaces like a slab leveling jig and run the router a cross the ends i feel your pain on the shit wood im in florida so its just construction lumber and sheathing ply for miles you pay out the ass for every foot of hardwood here
  a pic of the lap joints
      in case youre having trouble looking it up its cauls
  looked at it last night desk is solid i put 5 dowels in each board and a lot of glue im 245 pounds and sat down on an edge of the desk and it doesnt even wobble     my question is what grades of sandpaper should i use and what can i use to fill in the little gaps in between each board
  use p100 then p150 go up in grits to about 220 for normal home gamer poly or oil finish realistically just go to p150 and use a water based poly save the sawdust and combine with yellow glue aim for peanut butter consistency apply it in multiple layers and allow it to dry completely if youre filling a big gap
  sorry im a phone poster didnt bother to check the correction
  save the sawdust and combine with yellow glue aim for peanut butter consistency    this but make sure to wipe away the excess it kinda gums up and is a pain to sand  also get a palm sander 50 and soooo worth it along with sandpaper from chinaebay its 1/10 the cost that the stores charge itll take a month to get to you though    finally look into the maloof finish equal parts tung blo and varnish foolproof and you apply with a rag
  sok bb i wish there was someone telling me what the fuck cauls even were a year ago before i made my first table
  second page of his book but i dont mess with the wax i just mix all 3 into a jar and slap it on and wipe it dry 20 minutes later once a day for 3 days / beautiful sheen and oddly it gives a holographic effect   the concept is the oils dilute the varnish and rejuvenate the wood as the multiple coats of varnish set up
  any progress
  first time making one of these its mostly made from scrap pieces i found the hinges gave me the most trouble every time i tried to do install in on some test pieces it wouldnt close flush  i need a mallet and i started on that today but it turned out shit since the piece wasnt perfectly square i dont have any sort of machine planer so ive got to make it in sections instead
if you had to buy either a router or a pin/brad gun which would you choose im leaning towards a router but ive worked with a pin gun and its so quick and easy but i can achieve the same thing with some elbow grease routers is more useful but i only have minimal experience with it
  if you had to buy either a router or a pin/brad gun which would you choose    that depends 100 on what you do so if you cant decide literally flip a coin buy one and then later on buy the other
  i say router for sure a brad nailer is nice but i see it as a quality of life item speeds up the process but isnt entirely necessary a router is a big deal for increasing your production capabilities
  if youre joining and making fun things at home router    if youre installing trim brad nailer
  i think between just 2 be sure
      thanks ill get a router then is this worthlasts at least 5 years au360     this ones au230 but it doesnt come with the accessories but isnt battery powered either  
  skip the cordless for now not worth it until your already set up with a full size and want to augment it trim routers are really only good for round overs and small dados i say go with a full size like a dewalt 618 and build a simple table for it once youve gotten used to making it part of your work flow then go and get a trim router so you wont have to remove the full size anytime you have to do a last minute round over or something just my opinion of course
  by full size you just mean a plunge router or something else these are my options for routers which would you recommend if im going to build a table  
  plunge router is way overkill unless your rolling in it i was referring go the tier below that the approximately 2hp range they usually still have a canister body like the trim sizes but are more than powerful enough to table mount especially since the body allows clamp mounting looks like you have shit selection though amazon not an option
  on amazon aus theres only one    theres total tool as well it has a few additions in the lowmid range cheers for the help  
  of course you should have you dick head
  go away      im genuinely sorry for your options i would say go trim over plunge as the later is a sizable investment your prices dont seem all that great all around i will say corded is a must youll be grateful when you move to a cordless in the future and realize its general limitations the right tool for the right job but better a tool for most jobs than one thats adequate for only a couple after all that its just time to read reviews and pull the trigger    i wanted to post progress on my bed but the holiday weekend is eating way more of time then i expected carry on wood bros
  im genuinely sorry for your options  oh  what about these two plunge routers      160 and 130 respectively i dont think they offer variable speed though
  sorry dont mean to sound like a downer i just dont get why you have zero offerings in the mid range its all low power trim routers and full power plungers i like the dewalt plunger but its way out of budget id say go for the 160 makita so you can use sturdier half inch bits makita is commonly regarded positively in the hobby community i generally recommend my dewalt 618 as a first router but that class of tools seems to be non existant for your region
  how about a veneer or are you wanting to expose the layers of the plywood
  that looks amazing surprised you havent had anyone else comment on it great job anon
what type of protective coating should i use 6/4 red oak used as a top for an entertainment set
  thats alright the info was useful ill keep looking around for something in between plunge and trim that has a 1/2 shank 2hp corded in the 200300 price range       thanks i followed these dimensions and made some changes in sketchup to match the material and tools i have
  i think you may be thinking of the prices differently i found something similar to what you originally suggested and it costs au450    another one but i think this one functions like the one you suggested but au530    to give you some perspective a day of labour work is usually around 150180 does that information change anything when it comes to midtier price range is 200300 too low
  both of those look ok the dewalt only has a 1/4 collet though as for costs i was going off of googles conversion from usd to aud so i guess i just dont have a good sense of costs i would say hit up local tool forums and read the reviews like crazy word of mouth is always the best way to gauge the market
  are you actually going to use those barrel hinges ive always wanted to try them just havent got around to it
  im off by 1/4 wwyd
    learn from it and do better in the future measure twice cut once    if it was something standard you could hide it with some moldings but live edge stuff is different
  in future when fitting into a defined space always make a template it can be as simple as strips of thick cardboard taped or hot glued in place use it to transfer live measurements directly from the space to your workpiece    heres an example where i was making a template for a fitted work surface the smaller tabs of plywood are used to follow the exact contours of the wall when i take it back to the shop i just lay it on my work piece and connect the dots    in your situation if you still have the offcuts from the right side of the top id consider cutting a 1 slice and glueing it back onto the top at best youll be left with a hairline join that shouldnt be too noticeable use the new elongated piece and try fitting it again
  will do thanks      its already done that was the original plan but i didnt have the right bit to make the holes so i went with regular hinges in the end theyre a bit difficult for me to install and make things flush since the hole has to be precise and there are no adjustments like on kitchen/bathroom cabinet hinges
im a complete and total noob to wood working and crafting but it appeals to me could any one tell me what resources i can use to learn the basics
  cut two end piece rips trace them onto the top and round them over to mostly match the live edge

never worked with wood before want to make a desk table top and detachable legs for mobility    can i do it with a skillsaw instead of a table saw  would saw horses be enough or would i need a workbench or flat surface
  get a guide for the saw 20 and you can do everything a cheap table saw can    sawhorses should be ok put plywood on top if you find you need a work surface how are going to make the legs
  im thinking just 4x4 posts shaped like an upside down u id like to use brackets and screws for easy detachment i am concerned with it being sturdy and strong structurally
  im thinking just 4x4 posts    pic related wont cost much more and will be 10x easier plus you put a 2x4 in the top and it is clamped by the legs and you set your skillsaw to cut through the plywood or whatever you are sawing and cut down into the 2x4 a bit the 2x4s last a long time and then you flip them over or replace them being able to cut through the board you are sawing without having to hang it off the end of your support can be very helpful at times    and when you are not using these they fold up pretty compact and are easily moved about your 4x4 structure will always take a bunch of space
  upside down u  an h shape would be stronger but unless you tie the sets of legs together itll be prone to folding over  if you plan to remove the legs often use bolts and nuts/large threaded inserts screws will strip the holes eventually
  could glue some wood as edging to the edges of the plywood    im doing similar with a desk build at the moment
so i have some wood about 1/4 thick that is warping pulling away from the main box can i steam this back or is steam only for laminates
