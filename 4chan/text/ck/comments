dude im not gonna lie i mostly eat sandwiches are cereals actually good
  cereal in the sense of processed breakfast cereal no cereal in the sense of grain sure it has its purpose but you eat that all the time because its used to make the bread for your sandwiches

now that the dust has settled whats the best way to cook pasta boiling or leaving in the fridge overnight in a pot of water
  obviously boiling because you can go al dente leaving something in water isnt even really cooking but i guess it could be a perk if youre just going to reheat the pasta anyway or use it for bagged lunches
i like to give myself a pasta enema let the body heat cook it naturally over the course of a few hours
  how do you get it out later
  just pop a squat over the pot and serve fresh
  with a slotted pasta spoon obviously
  based and pooperpilled
does al dente apply to all pastas or just thin noodles like spaghetti i couldnt imagine say al dente pappardelle because of how extreme the volume to surface area ratio is much more of the pasta would be firm
gotta get that char going
  fresh pasta is never al dente
  only idiots put their pasta in the pot like that it will stick together and cook unevenly that way and it will take a long time to get soft enough to slide all the way into the pot     you hold the bunch of pasta vertically with two hands encircling it with just thumb and indexfinger then you twist the bunch of pasta in opposite directions like you are trying to wring some birds neck this will cause the bunchedup pasta to twist and fan out at both ends then you just cleanly release the pasta and let it drop into the pot it will spread out evenly in a 360 circle like a spiral with many strands each formed by an individual spagghetto
  it will stick together   why do you think you put oil in the water doofus
  wanting all of your sauce to slide off of your pasta
  hi jordan
when did you realize that water is the best drink
  when it made my pee stop smelling like asparagus after a few glasses
when i hacked my sodastream
  did a cost/quantity as a child      hacked my sodastream  what and how 
water is inefficient lager gives me hydration plus calries
when i realized its the first ingredient in coke
  sodastream used proprietary fittings to connect co2 you can change then run a line to a big tank from airgas and not overpay for their co2    honestly just buy a regulator and the adapter to a 2 liter bottle and skip the soda stream altogether
  when i tried to lose weight and realized how shitty fruit juice and soda are  sippin on a sprite cranberry rn though came for the memes stayed for the flavor
  not until i started drinking badoit  did you know it comes out of the ground sparkling bloody mental
  it was after i watched the documentary   water the great mystery  i wish i had someone to shoot the shit about my favorite subject water  feels sad
  i only like it with ice
  its not beer is
can boiled meat compete with steak hard modeno searing or sous vide
  simmered until tender in a flavorful liquid thats thickened to serve over the top can i prefer something like short rib done properly over steak
  obviously no
  depends on what you mean by boiling are you talking just purely a bubbling pot of salt water and dumping meat in there  or are we counting slow simmering and cooking in coconut milk or other substances  because meat cooked just in water at extremely high temp is pretty much garbage unless youre using it as part of a larger recipe
    depends on the cut of the meat    some cuts really dont get tender unless you boil/simmer them for a long dang time  those are better boiled than fried even if youre not allowed to sear them
  in northern italy there are great dishes of boiled meat gran bollito piemontese lesso e pear√†ecc
    this looks terrible
  no but properly braised beef pork and venison are pretty good
  yes but they are actually really good
      gotta behonest that all looks nasty as shit but im interested to try those little sausage slice things
  this is cotechino a type of salami boiled for several hours generally served with lentils in the new years eve lunch
  what is kassler with sauerkraut mashed potatoes and either hot mustard or horseradish  eating steak instead   what a pleb you are
there is a similar building to pic related in my town     i was thinking of making it into a surprise meal restaurant where i have a rotating menu and only make one dish per day so that i can focu on quality     would anyone eat at a place where you knew that there would be only one choice     what would you serve
smegmad tofu
  chicken tendies
  it works for hotdog carts
  would anyone eat at a place where you knew that there would be only one choice  sure if it was good
  what if one day you walk in and the menu is chicken noodle soup and peach cobbler ala mode
  tacos
dumb gimmick
was it a taco bell
  go for it op people are starved for a decently prepared meal i wish you great success
  not him but is it good  just make sure to post that shit on social media or something cancerous as it may generally be nothing worse than going in for the regular special and they replaced it with some shit you hate
  i would skip it that day
  it was a taco bell then tb moved and it became a taco casa they grew too big for the place and built a new place then it went on to become a payday lender
this looks a lot like an old taco bell
  if im not a lazy nigger for you ck ill drive to an abandoned hardys that was made into a physica therapy center and post it tomorrow im drunk now though
  personally crab legs
  or you could turn into some kind of pervs porn palace a sort of live pornographic theater you could serve popcorn i guess maybe nachos
sounds like the location worked well for at least one of those previous restaurants if it were me id apply for a liquor license and set up another mexican restaurant in there sounds like it worked before and the kitchen setup should already more or less ideal really play up margaritas sangria etc margins seem particularly thin on mexican food so youll really want to shoot for alcohol sales maybe aim for a more middleclass clientele with slightly more refined offerings than you typical small town mexican joint
  no thanks mom im not hungry
  go back to the kinoplex
  if a you see a failed restaurant building you should consider why this happened and whether location/internals are part of it    only one dish surprise style    youd be out of business by the end of the month people would walk right the fuck out    theres already a thing for surprise one quality dish per day its called a fucking special
  is this where dinotendies lives
  imagine dinotendies running a restaurant
my fave eatery in town has a rotating sandwich menu does 2 different sandwiches every week    if you want to do a rotating menu you need to be able to get hella creative on a regular basis it needs to be novel enough items that people want to come back frequently to see whats new sounds doable until you are a year or two in and starting to run out of ideas
  just repeat old favorites
  first why do you want this location specifically as others pointed out abandoned restaurants are probably abandoned for a reason and often times reviving it can mean a lot of cleaning and renovations second why do you want to do this surprise meal is it just because you think people would like it do you actually have a ton of unique menu ideas floating around your head or do you just wish there was what does cooking mean to you and whats your background your strengths your limitations if you havent got an answer for all of these your restaurant is going to fail
  i guess you could do that periodically but i think if you didnt still break it up with new shit your popularity would slip
  fish and chip
  soup
  terrible idea would be cheaper experiment to do as a food truck
  i was thinking of making it into a surprise meal restaurant where i have a rotating menu and only make one dish per day so that i can focu on quality  im assuming this is bait but if its not then this is an awful idea mostly because if people dont like the one dish they wont eat and if they do eat and dont enjoy it then theyre never ever coming back some customers may come by for the novelty but it wont last a month or even a week
  we have several old taco bells and pizza huts that went out of business and became new places without changing the outside design  the old taco bell is now an indian restaurant
  what do i need a falcon for
  man i miss when taco bell built those distinctive little mexican style buildings instead of generic modernist boxes like pic related
  or you could turn it into a rape dungeon haha
  there are a few places like that but theres a few caveats theyre all in touristy places theyre all absolutely tiny like 10 customers or less at a time and they mostly sell on the idea that the chef is some kind of eccentric/local character  its not really a popular business model  however if you expanded it a bit theres money to be made if its in the right location for a small restaurant with a pre fixe multi course menu that changes daily theres a place in seattle called the corson building where the chef writes the menu the night before goes out and buys the ingredients that morning and nobody knows whats being served until the doors open for dinner its not a huge operation but its outlived a lot of other restaurants in what is a pretty tough market
  the classic cycle of fast food realty from franchise to independent to payday lender
  or occasionally used car dealership
  is the location in the middle of a city atleast as large as nyc are you also a famous michellin starred chef    if you cant answer positively to those questions then it wont work
  i have seen this work well with lunch restaurants    it also had a very small menu besides the daily meal with a cuban sandwich and a few salads and maybe a soup    it worked for a minute but they were cunts it was also located in a industrial park so lots of people close by looking for lunch every day    cunts because while they usually did okay at normal lunch service going in at a time besides that they just didnt care they were open until 5 but going after 1 was pointless
  whats near this building
  i wouldnt do one option thats a bit too limiting and only works like   says for a famous chef in a busy location  i do like the idea of a lunch place that has a small rotating menu of quickly prepared dishes  assuming the place still gets a decent amount of midday traffic id start with 3 part menu with four options in each part  a sandwich a soup and side/salad you pay x99 you get to pick one of each and its ready in 10minutes   rotate the options depending whats in season and whats selling well but always leave room for a new option in each category  i feel like thats just enough choice to keep people interested but not so much that it slows things down
    cafeterias are very popular in some places
  yeah but i like the idea of a small rotating menu it would force me to stay creative and reduce potential food cost waste because youd move through smaller amounts of fresher product
  where im at abandoned fast food buildings are the exclusive territory of pawn shops and payday loan ripoffs   that because the local communities are too poor to buy fast food and the stores go tits up  you will go bankrupt trying to sell trendy food to poor white trash and niggers  you will make more  selling dope in such communities  good luck anon
      glad this meme is dead on /tv/ it was never funny
  rusticfake rusticrustic  pottery
  you guys are right i am going to expand the menu to 2 items and just ask people if theyd rather have the fried chicken or the fried steak    ill serve with veggies fresh mashed taters fresh roll and fresh made hourly gravy
  are you retarded
  imagine dinotendies existing in real life
  you mean he is but a myth     he had a bar of soap in his fridge    he took us shopping at the food bank once
  holy shit its my taco bell

  no
  hell yes i just wanna eat i dont want to make decisions thats a great idea
  in the future all restaurants are rectangular
  open a meatand3 easy and cheap to prepare cafeteria style southern food pass the savings on to the customers

  kkawaii
your
it the holidays do you follow this graph when eating out/getting coffee
  fuck this barbaric shit why cant businesses just pay the fucking worker
  someone worked way too hard on such obvious bait
  even big corporate multi nationals run on razor thin margins thanks to obama era taxes and the chinese and you want wage hikes no fuck off with that shit you idiot
    funerals    took it too far
  enjoy eternity in hell
  whoa youre right about fuck obama but youre ring about tipping fuck that shit all of it
infographic  tipping anyone other than waiters/waitresses  why would people do this i dont tip anyone in hotels
  who has this much fucking money
  enjoy broken elevators
  this tipping culture has got to go fuck this shit
  you think the guy in the elevator does the maintenance on them
    i never interact with the guy that fixes the elevators
  yeah it doesnt even fit it somebody tried to tip me at my job id be fired it is bribery and corruption extortion exploitation of the workers
  tote my own bags for free  most of the hotels around here dont offer room service anymore  towels are complementary because thats a health hazard  no doorman free diy  no concierge free diy  housework only straightening up the bed and dumping trash and you can request not to have it done    waiters  1520 any more is generousity  takeout  not necessary the cashier just hands you the food to go anything at all is generousity  tip jar  never tip the tip jar unless you like everyone working there the tip jar is split evenly among all employees if you like someones service that much and they only have a tip jar insist that only they take it and tell no one  pizza delivery  already included in the bill but an extra 5 or 10 is thoughtful depending on the size of your order i give 20 for big party orders of 100 in pizza any more is generousity    travel  just rent a car or take a plane fuck riding in small vehicles with strangers  tipping airline workers  lol    any salon work  15 any more is generousity    weddings funerals  too scarce and too varied for specific tipping rules to apply most services include gratuities and how much you give to a mourning family is up to you
tipping at funerals  the absolute state of canada
  ez b8
  tipping  lmfao hell no fuck you wagecucks    because when they did the workers bitched that made less than with tips because they couldnt hide their unearned income under the table
3050 of the bill for wait staff    ok this is obvious bait i dont even think waiters think that should be the standard
  pizza delivery  already included in the bill    dominos driver here that is not actually the case the delivery fee goes to the owner to cover liability insurance maybe 1 goes to the driver for mileage depends on the franchisee
so how about it service professionals i wanna start at ten percent and go up or down from there depending on how we get along is that reasonable
  even big corporate multi nationals run on razor thin margins  interesting statement can you show us a source to prove it
  no because most of the places i go to have hospitality included the prices
    there is a specific tip for massage therapist and funerals  m u r i c a
americans
how much should i tip at 711
  i have never seen that graph before so probably not
  literally nothing would change prices on services where you are expected to tip would go up but it evens out now that youre not doing it and the pizza guy knows how much money hell have each month
in germany the rule of thumb is to round up to the next full amount depending on quality of service bad service no tip decent service next full one to two euros above average service next five to ten euros outstanding service next ten to twenty euros  you can use the first tipping tier to signal the other partys bad service in the sense of round up i dont want to waste more time with you than necessary
   op  i have never seen that graph before so probably not  it has euro money in the graphics and the amounts/percents are intentionally wrong/too high/ridiculous its some kind of bait 50 for housekeeping per day 35 to hail a cab no not at any hotel in the world would that work    id say no i wouldnt follow that chart except to understand who to tip people who perform services i think its a given to leave money on a dresser for the maid sometimes i do it daily sometimes i do it endofstay if i think itll be the same crew daily but not everyone understands that is expected at all you dont tip waiters at a wedding but the host doesif they are overall happy with the service itll be more and maybe a special person who took extra care of grandma gets more
ive stopped tipping in the us once they made it a thing to rip people off with their resort fee bullshit plus the entitled behavior in general of expecting money for the most basic tasks    you tip when the service is good and you dont when its bad its that easy
bump

why are millennials killing the tuna industry
  already a thread about this stupid    
  fuck wrong paste but just open the catalog and youll see a thread about the tuna alreayd
  pfffffhahahhaaha  everyone point and laugh at this fagaroni
  
  starkist tuna is literally shittier tuna  i hated tuna for all of my life because it smelled like ass and looked like vomit  then i tried pic related  sorry starkist and bumblebee get a better quality product or die trying to scrape by on pennies and inhumane environmentally destructive fishing practices that ultimately make your product taste bad
  starkist is wack not tuna
  this headline is getting old companies need to adapt to changing markets and quit blaming others i guess im responsible for the impending death or downturn of several industries because im frugal as fuck oh well
i thought they were complaining about tuna being over fished before
  we are killing everything because really we just want to kill ourselves
  whoa so deep
  havent significantly rebranded or advertised in over a decade  freaking millennials   the absolute state of boomers
kill em
  doesnt understand marine ecology
  i feel awful for animals in captivity they are given everything they need food shelter medicine sometimes companionship everything except for purpose  oh
  yeah i dont
  and thats a good thing
  sustainable fishing practices are a thing  that concern is still in play but its not fashionable to worry about that particular species of tuna anymore yes tuna is more than one fish  but i mean yolo so do what you want
   millennials are killing the auto industry   millennials are killing the real estate industry   millennials are killing vacation   millennials are killing cruises   millennials are killing the golf industry   millennials arent having sex to start a family   millennials are killing home ownership   millennials are killing hotel loyalty programs   millennials are killing the airline industry    so why arent millennials spending money on things like new cars home ownership vacations/cruises a family playing golf airline tickets dinner dates at upscale restaurants etc    because were all in our 20s we dont have our shit together yet when have these dumbass article writers ever met a 20something with a stable income a house in their name a nonused car kids they had on purpose a country club membership enough money to go on a cruise or fly somewhere
  people from your grandparents generation had real jobs when they were 15    someone in their mid 20s would have been earning real money for a decade at least they also would have wasted far less money on frivolous things along the way mainly because they didnt have the opportunity to buy them    these days people are well practiced at wasting money and they tend to stay in school a lot longer often times that means they ended up investing an assload of money into a worthless degree
  true i see lots of people my age wearing supreme tshirts and jordans/yeezeys and buying giant flashy rims for their car definitely not saving for their future but my grandparents generation were young adults in the 1950s the economy was way better back then the job market hasnt been that good since the 50s you could get hired on the spot in a lot of cases now every imployer has a giant stack of applications because millions of young adults are jobless and we all go to every place in town and add our own application to the pile nobodys hiring lately college is pretty much useless too because even if you get a degree youre still gonna be stuck flipping burgers or stocking shelves
  mom says i cant make tuna patties anymore because it stinks the house up _
  hey retard people spend their money frivolously now because they make so little that no amount of saving will allow them to make the worthwhile purchases they need to like a mortgage peoples financial goals are so unnattainable that saving is fruitless
  bruh this guys just making a point hes being reasonable and not bitchy about it no need to call people retards for no reason at all
  crazy right its almost like the massive economic boom america experienced after wwii was just a fluke and now things are just normalizing
  
america enters ww2 and it ends up being advantageous for the economy in the end  boomers take their newfound wealth and piss it away on opulent bullshit  fast forward 50 years  economy is total shit now   why are millenials not buying things
  im 26 i have a wife a baby a full time middle management job and i payed cash for my house i wouldnt say i am typical of our generation though since ive been working since i was 14 and i have been on my own since 17 i do have a large student debt burden i am slowly paying off so i guess i have some things in common with my cohort my car is used also payed cash but i dont consider that a negative since i cant imagine a worse investment than paying 1020k plus interest for something that gives me no more utility than my 2k sedan that i own outright as far as country club memberships go i am not a geriatric yankee so i dont care
  fucking retard your grandparents generation was the first generation where the kids had disposable income and companies were selling frivolous shit to these kids your parents had the thing as well and still got high paying jobs right out of college     maybe it has go do with the fact that wages have stagnated every boomer who got good shit out of college now wants to only hire unpaid interns and balk at the audacity of them possibly receiving a minimum wage
  people from your grandparents generation had real jobs when they were 15  completely untrue but even if it were how fucking far in life someone would get if they dropped out of school at 15 and got a real job dumb fucking bootlicker
boomers experience the single most lackadaisy lifestyle in the history of the world because of wwii  afraid of acknowledging theyre spoiled shits who did massive damage to everything they interpret things returning to normal as millennials not working hard enough even though millennials work infinitely harder than them     im getting pretty sick of the generation that killed the polar bears getting mad at me for killing target
  these days people are well practiced at wasting money and they tend to stay in school a lot longer often times that means they ended up investing an assload of money into a worthless degree    yea boomers the people who pushed there kids into college and to follow there dreams the same people who inherited a roaring post war economy were if you werent a drooling retard you could get a good job cheap college and cheap housing     you talk about wasting money but when college and houses have began to cost multiple times what they were during the boomers era and wages have remained relatively stagnant its not hard to figure out that things arent as easy as boomers like to pretend     that being said college gets a bad wrap here it can and statistically leads to a better income however the main issue is that parents are sending their kids straight into college saying follow your dreams but with no real life experiences in working or knowing what is actually in demand in the workforce youre telling a kid to plan your life here and now when most adults dont even know what is really going on
salmon and mahimahi are the only fish that is edible  also cod but it had to be deep fried    t millennial
  the main problem with college is tgat certification inflation has caused it to become simultaneously worthless and mandatory because its the standard in so many fields that coupled with the standard means of paying for college being through loans one of the only loans that are indefinite and you cant declare bankruptcy/default on means that college tuition can increase indefinitely and arbitrarily     college does lead to better quality of life thats actually one of the problems
  social engineering  unbased
come on you fucking millennials you think youre too good for mercury poisoning
millennials have finally figured out that tuna is shit and deenz is where its at
  we dont like it because it reminds us of roasties
tuna industry executive here stop with your faggy sardines and buy more tuna again you autistic snowflakes
  deenz taste better have better texture go better on bread and crackers and have less mercury and microplastics the oceans are permafucked so people that still eat ocean fish are going to choose deenz over tuna every time
    stay mad you little fucking pussy bitch
  why are millennials killing themselves
  youll buy what we tell you and youll like it
what about anchovies
  admitting your plan  based
    a bad mistake for you is a funny mistake for us
  go military  not be a retard and actually choose good branch and take the o route  get paid to attend college  debt free at 22 because of this  get 4 years of work experience as a lead/manager   walk out with hiring preference increased federal time in service job experience contacts that will employ me the moment i call and an active ts clearance  dab on wagecucks paying thousands in interest till theyre 40    lol
  they are advertising all the time for a few years now with the full house chick problem is millennials dont watch tv
  i do fine without mercury poisoning thanks
  this this this i will never afford a house unless its in the middle of nowhere a car is too expensive with insurance to drive nowhere important to spend money and buy gas after i have over 40k in the bank but that does not buy anything but maybe expensive clothes and video games boomers try to talk me into roths where i cut my spending money in half to have money when im 60 what the flying fuck do i do at 60
  dont worry massive waves of over immigration will fix everything its a fact
how entitled do you have to be to honestly believe that the people you refuse to cater to are obligated to give you their money  look up starkist ceo and marketing team  literally all boomers and an asian  that explains it
  well you see dude if you save 10k today you will have the equivalent of 40k when you retire
  are there not enough avocado and toasty points in the tuna fish to appeal to millennial tastes
  give (((them))) 10k today for 40k years from now which will be worth 2k in todays money
  why dont you do your job and do some market research to find out
  doesnt understand how compound interest works  will never retire  oooo im laffin at you
  boomers run business into ground because they just sit in an office all day doing fuck all and waiting for phone calls
  considering money loses value yearly saving a dollar today is the same as losing 75c in a year utterly pointless
  /deenz/ btfo
  banks insist you invest with them to fight inflation so this doesnt happen to your savings  interest rates are lower than inflation rates
  the company is hoping to lure in consumers with spicy tuna flavors like hot buffalo and sriracha    youre a commodity provider you fat fucks you dont get to pretend to be value added find a way to be profitable serving plain tuna in plain cans or fuck off    christ i can just hear the board of directors crying to their marketing people right now    but we dont want to be commodity providers we want to make fat dosh off our brand name    not gonna happen get realistic or get out of the market i can add fucking sriracha myself if i feel my tuna needs it hint it does not
  i can add fucking sriracha myself    i agree with you but the fact is those kinds of products sell very well fuck half the shit in a supermarket is something that you can just as easily do yourself but that doesnt stop people from buying it quite the contrary really    pumpkin spice whatever anyone
be a generation that polluted the oceans with microplastics and mercury   still has the audacity to be surprised why the newer gen doesnt buy anymore tuna contaminated by the aforementioned pollutants   wowie
do europoors really not know what a quarter pounder is
  they measure things like cavemen with stone
  where ironically americans weight things in bullets
the fuck are you talking about mutt
  they do the guy who answered that question was just being a retard they use an alternative name for the quarter pounder in some metric system countries because thats what those countries use not because nobody would understand otherwise its the same as knowing what temperature in celsius or distance in kilometers mean as an american just because you dont use the other system doesnt mean you have no knowledge of the common units
  obviously since british people use pounds as money they understand pounds
  what stone is imperial the measuring system america uses
  try using google or wikipedia before posting next time    in most markets that do not use imperial measurements the quarter pounder is known as the hamburger royale royal mcroyal or variants thereof in france belgium portugal and cyprus the quarter pounder includes cheese as standard and is named royal cheese in italy formerly known as mcroyal deluxe it goes by deluxe cheese and bacon variants  in englishspeaking countries such as australia canada ireland and new zealand that have adopted metrication or have partially adopted metric units such as the uk the product retains the quarter pounder name although in frenchspeaking canada it is known as quart de livre the term quarter√£o com queijo is used in metric brazil cuarto de libra con queso in spain and in latin america and quarter pounder cheese is used in sweden and finland in the united states and south africa there are two variations the quarter pounder with cheese and the quarter pounder deluxe in some middleeastern countries such as saudi arabia and united arab emirates mcdonalds provides both a quarter pounder and a mcroyale burger on its menu the mcroyale having slightly different ingredients in hong kong the quarter pounder is known as a full three taels chinese Ë∂≥‰∏â‰∏° in chinese because three taels is approximately equal in weight to a quarter pound while the english name quarter pounder is retained in taiwan it is known as fourounces beef hamburger chinese ÂõõÁõéÂè∏ÁâõËÇâÂ†° the quarter pounder is unavailable in mainland china in russia and ukraine it was known as royal cheeseburger and since 2016 in russia it is called grand cheeseburger in japan the name was a katakana representation of quarter pounder japanese „ÇØ„Ç©„Éº„Çø„Éº„Éë„Ç¶„É≥„ÉÄ„Éº kw≈çtƒÅ paundƒÅ
  european name  its called a quarter pounder in denmark trust americans and canadians to not know europe isnt one country
  oh right i didnt realise europoors was a term that excludes multiple european countries
  nobody should because theyre trash
    when did op say this applied to all europeans
  stone is how the british weigh people and animals
  when did op say it didnt
americans have loved mcdonalds quarter pounder ever since a franchisee introduced the iconic burger to the country in 1972 in the 1980s aw attempted to capitalize on the success of the quarter pounderand drum up a little competition for ronald and friendsby introducing a thirdpound burger the bigger burger gave consumers more bang for their collective buck it was priced the same as the quarter pounder but delivered more meat it even outperformed mcdonalds in blind taste tests with consumers preferring the flavor of aws burger    but when it came down to actually purchasing the thirdpound burgers most americans simply would not do it baffled aw ordered more tests and focus groups after chatting with people who snubbed the aw burger for the smaller quarter pounder the reason became clear americans suck at fractions alfred taubman who owned aw at the time wrote about the confusion    more than half of the participants in the yankelovich focus groups questioned the price of our burger why they asked should we pay the same amount for a third of a pound of meat as we do for a quarterpound of meat at mcdonalds youre overcharging us honestly people thought a third of a pound was less than a quarter of a pound after all three is less than four    not understanding that a fourth is actually smaller than a third many consumers eschewed the bettertasting burger in favor of the one they thought was the better deal according to taubman aw recalibrated their marketing saying the customer regardless of his or her proficiency with fractions is always right    apparently undaunted by the average americans lessthanaverage math skills mcdonalds tried their own version of the bigger burger the angus thirdpounder in 2007 it didnt last but they gave it another shot with the sirloin third pounder just last year that one is gone now too but the mighty quarter pounder remains a mainstay
  wait do we use a metric based on bullets i only know about proof
  europoors  europeans   europeans  people who live in europe
  what stone is imperial the measuring system america uses  try using google or wikipedia before posting next time    the united kingdoms imperial system adopted the wool stone of 14 pounds in 1835    the united states customary system uscs or usc developed from english units which were in use in the british empire before the us became an independent country however the united kingdoms system of measures was overhauled in 1824 to create the imperial system changing the definitions of some units
  do americans a quarter pounder doesnt weigh a quarter of a pound yet the entire continent seems to find this acceptable
    autism
    why would you assume all in the absence of a qualifier for all if someone says pizzas here you interpret that as meaning every pizza on the planet has been shipped to your home
  it says so in the fucking image genius
why is it called the double quarter pounder instead of half pound burger
  just stop asking retarded questions that could be answered with two seconds of googleing and i wont have to keep posting these
  it doesnt say all europeans anywhere learn to read
  if someone says pizzas here you interpret that as meaning every pizza on the planet has been shipped to your home  no im not retarded if someone says europeans i assume they are talking about the people who live on the continent of europe
  theyre talking about people living on the continent of europe youre adding an extra assumption of all people living there for no reason
  saying the european name for it is royale is saying thats what its called in europe all of it  the answer was clearly written by some millennial faggot who didnt even get the reference he could easily have said french instead
  op never said he wasnt talking about all europeans either though
  its not just france  saying the european name for it is royale is saying thats what its called in europe all of it  black people love menthols means every black person on the planet smokes menthol cigarettes in your mind the name buffalo wings means every wing in buffalo ny is a buffalo wing
wubalubbadub dub  i need that royale with cheese like the gangsters in pulp fiction marty im quentin riiiiiiiiiccccck
    so itd be a 035 stone with cheese
  i doubt this is true the millennial faggot would have googled the term before responding he should use a search engine that doesnt scrape your data but the internet has been there his whole life and he has never paused to consider privacy implications pulp fiction will have been every result on the first few pages
  no but its a reference to a line in a movie where it is about france and saying france would at least be true while saying europe is not
  could you go ahead and write down everything op didnt say he wasnt talking about bullet point list works fine
  saying europe is true saying all of europe wouldnt be true if you see a news article titled why americans cant get enough ranch dressing would you assume every resident in the entire us is a ranch dressing fan
obsessed
euros might now know what a quarter pounder is but at least they wont shoot up a school
  no theyd stab people instead
  i would assume they werent only talking about three states out of the fifty  im done arguing this with you youre a fucking idiot

did you guys ever notice how similar mcdonalds is to krusty burger  they call krusty burgers quarter pounders and krusty partially gelatinated nondairy gumbased beverages shakes

  bullets are weighed in grains which really isnt used for anything else
  i like the super specific units of measurements like hands use that for a horse nothing else love it leagues are super interesting too because theyre based on paces iirc
  thats not weighing things in bullets thats a weighing system for bullets and gunpowder  a grain is an average weight of a single seed of wheat it was normally used for farming bullets and gunpowder are measured in grains because people would use a scale to see how many grains the bullet or load of gunpowder equaled
  calling them french fries when americans invented them  stupid dumb wrong yuropoors
  bullets and gunpowder are measured in grains because people would use a scale to see how many grains the bullet or load of gunpowder equaled  its worth noting an anecdote of benjamin franklin which may or may not be true just before the revolutionary war new england petitioned pennsylvania for a grant to buy gunpowder of course pennsylvania being quaker they could not openly assent to this request since gunpowder is an instrument of war and theyre pacifists also of course quakers being hypocrites they gave  an aid of 3000 pounds and appropriated it for the purchasing of bread flour wheat and other grain some of the council desirous of giving the house still further embarrassment advised the governor not to accept the provision as not being the thing he had demanded but he replyd i shall take the money for i understand very well their meaning  other grain is gunpowder which he accordingly bought and pennsylvania never objected to it  gotta love them quakers as well as their modern intellectual descendants
  eurpoeans dont know much of anything
crickets are unironically a good source of protein but im not so sure about it
ew no
  lol boiled crickets id rather just starve
gross
cricket or mealworm fluor for those cookies with extra protein for sick gains and while eating tasty treats
  is this actually how you think do you really need to add cricket flour to cookies to get a few extra grams of protein
  yeah what of it
  dat protein  dem ecdysteroids  once cricket flour becomes affordable it will revolutionise the protein supplement market
and cookalong    ive been trying to master flavoring macaron shells with freeze dried fruit powder its uniquely low but still substantial moisture level made it a challenge to incorporate to a delicate and volatile macaron batter but i think i found the best technique i will upload pics while they are baking and we will see how they turn out
  start with mites in piazza  im using  100g almond flour and 100g powdered sugar pulsed together in a food processor and sifted twice  80g aged egg whites  1/4 tsp cream of tartar  50g granulated sugar  15g freeze dried blueberry powder  not pictured gel food coloring
  beat the egg whites on lowest speed until foamy throughout and no liquid remains then add your cream of tartar my hand mixer has 6 speed settings but i only use the first three in these macarons higher speed means larger air bubbles incorporated and you dont want that its not a race to make the fastest meringue slow and steady wins the race here
  when a loose meringue starts to come together start adding your granulated sugar 1/3 at a time add incorporate add etc
  stop here you want barely firm but glossy peaks after i incorporated my sugar i kicked the speed up to the second lowest setting
  this mediumfirm peaks stage is when you add anything to the meringue you are using here im adding the freeze dried fruit powder but you could add espresso cocoa powder or no flavoring at all for traditional use gel or powder food coloring at this stage as well i mixed the food coloring in on low1 then increased mixer speed to medium3 as i gradually sprinkled in the blueberry powder stop as soon as everything is thoroughly incorporated as you do not want stiff and dry meringue
  should look like this when youre done firm peaks but still glossy not dry at first i struggled a lot with getting meringue to the right spot it is better for the batter to go a little under on beating the meringue rather than going over
  now we start macaronage process add half of your dry ingredients almond flour/powdered sugar and incorporate be careful not to deflate the meringue at this stage sweep a rubber scraper around the outside of the bowl then drag it down through the middle until everything is combined
  good thread i dont bake and probably wont make this myself but i learned something and it is good work youre doing have a bump and a u on me
  then add the second half of the dry ingredients and keep folding in the same scrapeandsmoosh motion you want to deflate the meringue to the right degree the more you deflate the meringue the smoother and runnier the batter will get as you release more of the liquid do not overmix at this stage or your batter will be ruined and cannot be saved people use the phrase flowing lava but i dont think thats very helpful the batter should flow off your spatula in thick but consistent ribbons like very thick honey it should sink back into the batter in the bowl in under 20 seconds
  same keep it up op i feel a little strange there being an actual cooking thread on this board but its a nice change
  thanks      fit a piping bag with a large round tip im using 12 but you could use 2a if you had one pipe them directly perpendicular to the baking sheet im using silicone mats but you can use parchment paper exactly the same pipe directly down without swirling or moving the tip and then lift directly up the tails should sink back into the macarons when youre finished piping one sheet tap the baking sheet hard on the counter on all sides to release air bubbles
  do not do what i did here which was forget to give them enough space they spread out as they rest its not a terrible deal that they touch each other but naturally it makes them less beautiful at the end
  the first batch does not look pretty but i think i did indeed forget to rest them for long enough before i baked theyre loads better than the other fruit powder batches i have baked but they did crack and ripple which might have been because of the oven might have been because of not being rested or might have been because of the way i made the batter the second tray is looking more promising
  close up on an ugly but very tasty cookie
  the second tray turned out better with taller feet and fewer cracks and rumples but still not smooth the first time i baked them 18 minutes at 275 degrees freedom the second time i kicked it up to 18 minutes at 300f but put a second cookie sheet on the bottom oven rack to shield the cookies from rising too fast which causes the cracks    i think tomorrow i will make another batch and try an even higher oven temp for less time tomorrow i will also try resting them for much longer than i did today which online troubleshooting seems to suggest would be the answer for the rumpled tops    thanks for watching the cookalong post pics if you have them of any time baking went right or wrong for you
  bonus cursed image of an ugly blueberry macaron filled with homemade lemon curd
  youve probably already tried but isnt it easier to flavor the cookie of a macaron by mixing in jam
  aged egg whites  wut
  not op but sometimes professional bakeries age the whites to improve the macarons in some way i think they are just left in the fridge for a few days up to a week
lotta work for such a shitty pastry
    aging them will make a more stable meringue but i dont know the scientific reason why      jam will make the batter too wet and the macarons wont set at all its hard to flavor the shells which i guess is why people dont do it most of the flavor is just from the filling but i had to give it a good shot because i wanted to im planning on folding the lemon curd into a buttercream side by side with blueberry jam in the filling of these shells when i do them for real but this practice batch was a fail
op this is a great thread macarons always struck me as one of those things that were really hard to get right at home and so i never tried them looking good so far and im eagerly awaiting more
  i work in a place famous for their macarons     our pastry chefs dont flavor the shells and almost all of the great macaron houses in france do the same     focus on getting perfect neutral flavored shells as flavoring them isnt worth the wasted time make an intensely flavored ganache or gel as the filling that will be the true star
  id eat your macarons
letsa get rready to loose some pfeengorrrs
  this is almost too easy to post but i never post my food on /ck/  preheat oven to 375  sweat chopped veg in 4 tbsp butter until just starting to brown  add garlic and fry till fragrant  add dried spices parsley and thyme
  add stock let veggies absorb a little bit  turn off heat  add stuffing mix literally flavorless croutons and mix in some more stock till m o i s t
  my meme pan
  sizzle  my last stuffing was too moist so i wanted some crisp this time
  fullsize money shot  thats all  its good but needs gravy  i have some potatoes and green beans i trimmed/blanched but theyre for tomorrows dinner
    i thought it was the opposite the fresher eggs coagulate better and the structure hasnt broken down
  i can make neutral flavored shells easily theyre not very difficult but ive just been experimenting with trying to get them just right with fruit powder i dont get why you can add cocoa powder or espresso powder something already dry and it doesnt change the batter but a completely dry and nonsticky fruit powder fucks it up amazingly my first batch is still my most beautiful  they were pear shells maple ermine frosting and fig jam pic related      thank you      its just what ive read something about them drying out so theyre stickier and make a more sturdy meringue that is harder to deflate      this looks tasty
  interesting stuff
  maybe dried fruit powder has enough fructose in it that it fucks up the sugar proportion and is what is cracking the glaze and drying them out try cutting some sugar when you add the dried fruit powder idk im just spit balling here i know fuck all what im talking about
  i did cut powdered sugar to add the fruit powder but it seems like its just overall too wet  i think i will stop trying to directly flavor the shells with fruit powder ive given it four good batches and i think it just makes the batter too wet instead ill sift the fruit powder over the top of macarons fresh out of the oven for flavorful decoration      if you skip the step where i added the fruit powder this recipe still stands to make perfect french macarons
what were people eating 100 years ago and was it better than today
  was it better than today  yes there was a huge culinary renaissance taking place in the closing months of the first world war only to be topped a decade later with the great depression
  no the food 100 years ago is not better the people who say so probably wouldnt even eat the brown spot on the banana billions of dollars go into the science behind making food look better and taste better theres more effort going into this now than any other point in human history
  not exactly the better tasting cultivars are typically not mass marketed since they have unattractive qualities such as being more perishable not looking good on a shelf being easily damaged etc taking away from profitability    most people were not eating as well as they are today because they were poor and cooking well has never been a common skill even when all women had to cook
i heard that we wouldnt be able to handle the food from back then because of bacteria or something actually the further you go back in time the less we able to digest i even heard that viking feasts would kill us now
  100 years ago nobody had even heard of nutrients
  the better tasting cultivars are typically not mass marketed since they have unattractive qualities such as being more perishable not looking good on a shelf being easily damaged etc taking away from profitability  or almost going extinct from excessively trying to get the best profit by using a single variety
  what the average person today values in food is appearance and dopamine output the food back then wasnt filled with excessive amounts of sugar hfcs preservatives fats etc most people would choose their current diet over having to eat white bread alone soup potatoes rice celery carrots peas with meat eggs milk being a luxury
  they only ate black and white food
canned food was pretty revolutionary
  my cousins side of the family operated a grocery in a midwest city of 10000 people 100 years ago    ive seen pictures of papers of what was regularly stocked if the place still existed today it would be swarmed with foodies and hipsters    scoop bins of 14 different kinds of flour  produce bananas to kale to papaya to zucchini  fruit flavored bottled seltzer and spring water  every imaginable cut of cow or pig  imported tinned foods from around the world chinese tea to german sauerkraut     i think people 100 years ago were eating quite well
i was talking to my grandma on thanksgiving about food back then of course shes only like 86 so really just great depression and ww2 stuff     she said that meat was mainly the same pork was fattier the cuts were way different and people used to eat a shit ton more venison in america
  food isnt full of that stuff now if you live in a first world country thats mostly an amerimutt thing
  was it better than today  in some ways yes in some ways no    most people had a far worse selection of food back then compared to what we have now supermarkets werent a thing people were very much restricted by geography and the local growing season    that said what food you did have was probably a lot better there were no cultivars of plants or breeds of animals which traded away taste for higher yield there were no artificially processed junk products etc    modern food is much more accessible but a lot of it is much worse factory farming fucked the flavor out of our meats industrial ag has done the same to produce and grains and of course the prevalence of junk food
  what were people eating 100 years ago  be german  its 1918 all of the sudden  well potato peel soup with breadcrumbs doesnt sound too bad rright guys
  so its a matter of quantity over quality if thats the case id have to agree an overabundance of cheap processed food in modernized countries has led to people consuming whatever they like indiscriminately its a widespread sort of gluttony if you will to the extent that shaming people for eating too much can be considered hurtful
  i think you have to refine your search to get a difinitive answer  poor first world countries eat better today bc of all the gibbs me dat todays poor eat much much unhealthier though hence the plague of fatties   is it better to be hungry and thin feeling truly blessed for every meal or morbidly obese angry at the gobment for the soda tax i think the answer is clear  middle class being able to eat out regularly these days compared to being able to buy the more choice cuts of meat for the wife to cook the family unit was much tighter 100 years ago and eating dinner around the table was a key part of the day eating well every night while enjoying the company of loved ones in the comfort of your own home is the clear winner here  rich this comes down to the quality of the chef you employ 100 years ago they were passionate about their role in the house werent alcoholics by far the most part werent drug addicts for by far the most part   100 years ago wins in all 3 categories
  so its a matter of quantity over quality  pretty much  for the most part quality has gone way down  otoh convenience and selection has greatly increased    cost is a mixed bag buying supermarket produce is a fuck of a lot more expensive than growing your own which is what a lot of people did back then otoh a lot of foods which people buy have gotten a lot cheaper
have you ever made dinner for yourself that turned out so awfull you had to throw it out  done it a few times  and couple of times i just ate the damn thing though it tasted notsogreat
first post
i put homemade fries in the oven on my stainless steel baking sheets without greasing them first  i was so disappointed in myself i didnt eat the rest of my food  good thing i have half a container left for a redemption arc
only once i remember i was living in france moving from hostel to hostel because i had some issues with finding a place and ate cr√™pes and sandwiches every evening in the street and was generally starving since i was low on money and so i just bought enough when i finally moved into a tiny apartment i went to a grocery store and bought some canned mushrooms eggs and i think it was spinach to make some kind of omelette i was excited i was gonna eat real food again i dont what i did certainly i didnt cook the mushrooms long enough but the thing was hideous i couldnt even finish half of it despite having been eating badly for like a month into the trash it went
spent several hours picking blackberries and cooking to make blackberry jam  make it  taste it  its fucking disgusting  put it directly in the bin
i tried making orange chicken one time that was really bad for some reason couldnt even finish it into the trash it went had to go to mcdonalds in shame because that was the last of the food i had
  first time i cooked taco beef  recipe used t and t instead of tbsp and tsp respectively  assumed all were tablespoon for some reason  so i ended up with a recipe close to  1lb beef  5 tbsp cumin  3 tbsp chili powder  1 tbsp salt  1 tbsp pepper  2 tbsp oregano  2 tbsp paprika  2 tbsp onion powder  1 tbsp garlic powder  2 tbsp cilantro  absolutely disgusting
  do you not have any logical thinking
  that was a decade ago i was a teenager that grew up exclusively on boxed meals and wanted to eat something better than applebees or chilis
  this hangover pizza didnt turn out too well i almost heaved just looking at it
  he doesnt understand that more spice equals more flavor  t tastelet
  what
  my first time making spaghetti carbonara i destroyed the sauce in final stage bc my pan with spaghetti and bacon in it was too hot and it turned into some kind of disgusting scrambled egg noodles dish i could not bring myself to eat that cringe every time i think about it
  live and learn same with that pizza thing i did
    more than a full cup of spices holy shit it must have been gritty as hell
my first time making dough the entire thing stuck to the surface i was working on despite putting a ton of flour down
  ruined a whole pot of split pea soup by not looking at the beer i grabbed out of the fridge accidentally used my roommates meme ipa and the whole fukken pot tasted like hops was pretty mad with myself
the fianc√© whats to make something by herself to celebrate our moving in together  goes for a run of the mill pot roast  im hanging out in the couch playing vidya begin to notice a horrible smell  some awful mix of swamp gas and feces  ask her what she put in there   she goes on to list what youd expect to be in a pot roast  against by better judgement i give it a try  literally tastes like someone dumped a four loko in a crockpot with meat and shut the lid  we throw it out and order pizza
  swiss chard steamed with vinegar so bitter i almost puked  gnocchi that were raw inside  trout baked on rice with no real seasoning
went to buy skirt steak for fajitas last week  oh heres skirt steak already sliced and tenderized similar to cube steak  after it cooks it has the texture of unbreaded boiled steak fingers     cussed myself out for buying stupid boomer meat and threw it right out didnt even let the wife try it
  like once a month is that bad
  meh done it maybe 4 times in 3 years
   confused a garlic clove with a garlic bulb   got through 1 bulb making hummus before i realized it was too spicy
  did your pizza go out that night too
  you
  i was trying out different mac n cheese recipes and i saw a bleu cheese and bacon baked mac and cheese i love bleu cheese and bacon so   i tried it    it was fucking disgusting smelled awful as it was cooking tasted even worse and made my breath smell terrible i only was able to eat like half
  thats not a pizza    thats a fucking abortion
  i was 20  got paid  be really into marco pierre white  want to make his pepper steak recipe  tell family im cooking tonight  go to store and spend nearly all my money on ingredients  ruined the steaks they stuck to the pan and i didnt know about letting the crust form before moving  ruined the sauce it tasted like pure beef stock pot and shit  ruined the presentation  everyone said it tasted awful  i couldnt disagree  my dad broke his molar on a whole pepper kernel  all the food goes into trash  the pan was caked in disgusting sauce  mother later throws it out because the stench wouldnt go away  mfw
  i made beef brisket once using barbecue dry rub from a packet i slow cooked it in the oven cause i dont have a smoker and i dont know what went wrong but i legitimately couldnt put it in my mouth it looked fine but the taste was so repugnant i legitimately couldnt bring myself to chew after the first bite had to throw it all out because it was simply inedible   thats the only thing i can think of
when i made crepesor russian bliny rather ideally id use a bit of melted butter in the batter but sometimes i just go with sunflower oil when im too lazy instead of either of the above i decided to use olive oil once and that shit was nasty the olive oil smell and flavor was way too strong to a point where i couldnt eat more than two
op here  just bought some frozen pizza for a buckfiddy peeled of the pineapple spiked it up with extra cheese didnt help disaster
  only once that i can think of tried to make american pancakes but added too much bicarb of soda tasted fucking horrendous i was gutted
  no such thing as too much garlic you pussy
  how did you mess an omelette up you can eat mushrooms raw btw and they taste alright definitely not binworthy
  swag on em lil mick
  rancid meat
  dudegnar
  all the fucking time except i never threw it out the best way to learn is to suffer through your mistakes unless it was unsalvageable and actively harmful it was eaten great way to learn not to burn shit on a grill or to make something shitty from experimenting
  is it really that bad thats really disappointing i was thinking about making some next summer
not a full meal but ive fucked up a few times making rice and had to go out to a chinese or mexican restaurant and buy some to go with the rest of my meal
  marrying a woman who cant cook  i feel sorry for your future children
  microwaved frozen garlic bread
  once put a quarter cup of crushed red pepper on a bowl of plain spaghetti
few days ago i let some cubed chicken marinate in siracha garlic chili powder and some pineapple looked like it was going to turn out great but as soon as i started browning it it formed a thick paste like biscuit dough texture was fucking awful i guess i over tenderized the fuck out of the outside the chicken    live and learn
  marinating in pineapple  fault
  thought it would tenderise it but danm
  you dont really need to tenderize chicken and the enzymes in pinapple can fuck up proteins real hard
i was making brownies for the first time i lived in a college dorm and we had an old minioven where you couldt change the temperature we made a couple of batches of pot cookies in it before and they turned up okay but i baked the brownie for too long and after it cooled down it was hard as rock i was pissed so i threw the brownie out of the window it landed on a road in front of the dorm it stuck to the road and stayed there for weeks
  yep wanted to make a whole pan pancake put too much milk in the batter and it came out liquid it wouldnt flip
  nah mushrooms cooked a little are worse than raw or properly cooked they get a gross slimy coating
  you didnt knead it long enough
  there is no reason whatsoever to go through that unless youre somehow incapable of learning without abusing yourself
  i think i kneaded it too long desu and it got too warm i didnt throw it in the fridge/freezer
i once made fried rice that looked and tasted like puke    i didnt even want to make fried rice i actually wanted to make pilaff rice but i mixed up the recipes
  have you ever made dinner for yourself that turned out so awfull you had to throw it out    yeah that happens  its when im cooking only for myself that i do all my experimentation and hoo boy some flavors do not go well together /
  is it really that bad thats really disappointing i was thinking about making some next summer    blackberry jam is delicious when you do it right but that doesnt mean its impossible to fuck it up
  huh
  this even if i have to slam a gallon of water in the middle of the night
trying to use cinnamon on things  trying to use garlic on things    if its not pretty damn good i just throw it out
when i was poor as fuck i ended up going through all of the canned goods in my house making terrible meals i forced myself to eat what i already had to put off buying more groceries for a little while    the worst was a chili made from a can of bushs baked beans a can of chili dog sauce and whatever spices i thought might be good in it cumin taco seasoning some bbq sauce some tobasco i couldnt finish more than one bowl    i felt like i wasted those beans i never thought id have gotten to the point where i would be so upset about wasting a single can of beans
  tobasco  i see this a lot on here  is it a regional spelling

ive been to this small little middle eastern sit down restaurant twice and both times after placing our order the owner has walked out turned on his smart tv and played this dudes youtube videos ostensibly for our enjoyment    what the fuck am i being memed on

  phoot

  ill buy nice ham before christmas fun fact my jewish friends envy me eating pork
  what about it
whens the last time you had bourbon chicken at the mall    do they even make bourbon chicken outside of malls
  never heard of bourbon chicken
is this the slop o shit thread
i havent been to a mall in at least 10 years i dont remember bourbon chicken either but it looks applebees tier
    i havent been in about that long but i might go just to see if they still have it
  dont do it man that shit is fake only bourbon is in kentucky
  is this literally chicken and ketchup over spaghetti
  not enjoying flyover cuisine  yikes
  what the fuck kind of cuts of chicken do they use for most chinese food anyways theyre barely recognizable and irregularly shaped i wish chinese places would use cubed breast pieces or at least something distinguishable like tenders instead of this slop their sauces are usually good but they use it to hide subpar cuts
  thighs
  makes sense theyre definitely cheaper
  dark meat master race
  the shitty places use breast meat which they will be proud to advertise all over the menu so they dont trigger their soccermom clientele    the good places will use whole chicken     wish chinese places would use cubed breast pieces   most of the places near me do use breast i fucking hate that dry flavorless crap     but they use it to hide subpar cuts  the breast is the worst part of the whole chicken it is the most dry and the least flavorful
  honestly theres barely even any chicken inside most chinese food ive dissected sesame chicken orders many times mainly just fried breading
  mainly just fried breading  i hate those shitholes    thankfully ive found many places where the breading is a very thin layer
  its only dry and flavorless if you dont know how to cook chicken  and if you dont know how to cook chicken breast even boneless skinless but the rest of your chicken is good youre not asian and know nothing of bourbon
  its the shit that the pushy chinese lady tries to make you sample when you walk by tastes like chilis version of teriyaki but with more salt and usually extra goop
  its good as fuck
  its only dry and flavorless if you dont know how to cook chicken  agreed though it seems that most of my local chinese places fall into that category when they use breast its nearly always overcooked and dry
  and tastier
  chicken and hot sauce over lo mein looks like standard mall food court chinese
  i like the flavor no doubt but its sketchy to me because its not discernible from nontraditional meats if you know what i mean
i could live off of orange chicken and bourbon chicken    its impossible to get either her in the uk
  malls only exist for the sole purpose of being a place for old people to walk because theyre too cheap to buy a gym membership
  i wasnt aware that malls even still existed
  the breast is the worst part  you are a tastelet who probably cant cook for shit kill yourself
ill occasionally make a big batch with chicken thighs shit tastes way better than chinese bullshit eat it with hush puppies and red beans and rice
  i tried orange chicken once in the uk and it just taste like orangeade sauce poured over chicken it was horrible
easy to make dinner for 3 i always end up making tacos or spaghetti meatballs what are some easy to make recepies that taste good actually
  that is one beautiful baby

  i fucking hate manhattan but your garbage dump city is the closest and most convenient place for me to take the train in to get trashed and crash at my brothers place in chelsea i prefer philly any day of the week but fuck that commute
  just try and stop us faggot  we have the presidency what have you got
  as someone that lived in philly 5 years and loves visiting nyc is better in pretty much every single way
  maybe it is all relative to your experience i grew up between brooklyn and jersey and manhattan was just the city i didnt know any other as i traveled and visited smaller less dirty less congested cities i began to wonder what the fucking appeal was just driving home in 34 hours of mind breaking traffic after flying in to jfk is enough to make me question why anyone would ever want to live and work in this cess pit
  except people who arent fucking manlets
  the appeal is that unless youre going to live on another continent nyc is the only reasonable option if you hate car culture even in nyc car culture is absolutely out of control but its not as bad as northern california which is the only other part of the us thats even remotely civilized

nope it goes on /b/
  /thread
what other drugs do you guys do you knowto get high
  smoked 2 bowls of weed and played runescape all day
           only drug threads on /ck/ relate to the cooking and manufacturing of drugs
i look doing drugs especially ones that have fuck all to do with gay shit like cooking i mainly just like getting high on drugs
have you ever eaten exactly one fried potato thin
  yes ama
  why havent you kys yet
  did you enjoy it
  fried potato thin  unironically huh
  theres no reason      i enjoy every food so yep i enjoyed it
i feel bad eatting ginger bread men
dont feel bad thats what theyre here for if you dont eat them youre denying them their purpose
why do people in europe love baked beans so damn much
do you not like baked beans
  baked beans is delicious its the marmite that baffles me i mean what the fuck
  marmite on toast with baked beans is god tier
    what does marmite even taste like im an american so i get the love for baked beanswe have an affection for them too as a picnic food especially the sweet kind with molasses but marmite seems to be a uniquely european thing
  it tastes like concentrated salt sauce almost like eating salty anchovies
  american as well i like it but i can see why people hate it basically just tastes like salt and yeast its good on buttered bread or grilled cheese sandwiches
  i mean we have baked beans and they do come canned but generally we eat baked beans at our outdoor cookouts and they are served with fire roasted pork or beef and have been cooked for hours and hours w/ cuts of meat and other ingredients     restaurants often cook baked beans aka pit beans for 24 hours minimum
  you can make sweet baked beans the same way it comes in the can you just need molasses
  like the bottom of a primary beer fermenter without any beer flavour
  implying any restaurants would do 24hrs of prep for a side dish  not cost effective  waste of time
  just cook it in a big vat so you can spoon some out when someone orders
  t sysco sales rep
  oy bruv lost me biddes at tesco fackin slags
  ever baked bread before  imagine the frothy smelly stuff you end up with after you feed the yeast but made into a viscous spreadable paste with added vitamins  tastes great when added to soup imo
  i dont like baked beans mostly because its always the same shitty white beans pinto red and black beans are the only beans worth eating
i am german and its not a thing here i always thought it is an anglo thing
  britfag here because we bbq beans arent a thing in uk ill admit theyre much better
  it is americans are so dumb they think europe is a country
  only brits do that and those guys are barely european
  more like a british thing
        marmite is shit vegemite is 100x better
  reminds them of the balls theyre lacking
  surely its just bongs who consume this filth
  are you a retard
  not him but yes i am
  unironically umami     gravy without a tsp of vegemite/marmite added is trash
  why do people in europe love baked beans so damn much    its a hold over from post wwii poverty and near starvation when the usa shipped massive quantities of bulk relief foods over which included tons and tons of canned beans    oldfag euros will remember when damn near everything in the market was stamped usa thanks to the marshall plan
we do
  sysco    syscos home page gives the hardest burn to their own customers
  we dont its an americaneducationtm thing
where do they get all the beans
  i use oyster sauce or a combo of worcestershire and soy anchovy paste also works
  the eu  not trying to destroy national borders sovereignty and culture since 1958  dont blame us for thinking youre one country when you fucks are trying your hardest to make it a reality
  im pretty sure theyre only a thing in perfidious albion maybe the other british isles too but thats it we never eat any here and were their closest neighbour

  youre welcome lil jimmy im glad i was able to make your 10th birthday so special  jimmy runs off to the facepainting clown outside  alright now its time for the adults to eat no ones wasting crusts over here right guys  all the people around me chuckle and remember how they used to toss the crusts when they were in middle school too
  youre scaring me apu  what are you trying to convey here
roll the lip over the top its like a glove a pinch of cornmeal is a natural consequence of using the flipper but can make it feel more enticing to finish off when you get down to it that and when combined with the enveloping its a damp squid
i would thank someone for their spare crusts with or without a dip available  i am a crust hound
  pizza bones gift them to me
  what is it with this picture that is so unsettling to me i feel like there is something wrong with it
  i think those lovely ladies were in fact born male
  oh fuck
  the crust looks like shit i wouldnt eat it either  make a better pizza rather than insult your guests on a cambodian cattle ranchers forum eh
  this wouldnt happen in my house because i wouldnt let them take a new slices before finishing the first one ill get them some ketchup from the kitchen if they cant eat bread that isnt covered in it but they are eating it      a penny saved is a penny earned      its because youre a hateful bigot
  earning money you already own  burger education
  not eating the pizza bones  next youll tell me you dabbed off the pizza sweat as well degenerate
  if youre at pizza buffet dont eat the bonesotherwise dip em in ranch and chow down
  pizza sweat  why do americans eat such sloppy fucking pizza that it literally oozes oil

whats the best vegan cheese
  hmm if i had to guess id say
  op you could just buy the shredded melt it down set it in a loaf pan throw it in the fridge and slice it into sticks you get more volume of cheese when its shredded about 2x the amount and i would go out on a limb that the shredded and sticks are of same value
  ive never been about to find vegan cheese in bulk
    cheeze
there is no such thing as vegan cheese for it to be vegan it has to contain no dairy for it to be cheese it must contain dairy this is a logical contradiction you can call it whatever you want just not cheese
  im talking about this one    also is it just me or does anyone else tend to get mold on their follow your heart shredded cheese their slices are much better than daiyas but when it comes to shredded i think daiya and so delicious are better
  none of them if it does not contain milk its not cheese vegan shill anon
  wrong
  vegan cheese
  fumunda look that up itll change your life
  daiya cheese has such a weird consistency whenever i go to vegan restaurants they always have proper consistency cheese ive never had the follow your heart cheese before  ive heard miyokos is good but ive never found it
  do you often sit around in starbucks discussing your latest vegan conquest
  i know that daiya has two different types of mozzarella cheese one is regular and the other is made specifically for pizza the pizza version melts way better than the regular    miyokos is good but really expensive never tried kite hill before but ive heard good things the things with the miyokos one you posted is that its more of a cheese spread than a meltable cheese that one would use in grilled cheese or pizza but the miyokos mozz is really good
  its frumunda and vegans are already wellversed in the benefits of it its been their only cheese forever
  friends and i always use fumunda it sounds better hey are you really going off because i didnt say fromunda   youre really more of a faggot then i first suspected
  ive only eaten daiya cheddar style shredded cheese but it was reasonably good on chili cheese dogs i was impressed how well it melted    i dont think id ever go full vegan but im trying to minimize use of animal products where i can because i think its hard to raise livestock in a way that doesnt create unreasonable amounts of suffering
  when was the last time you sucked a cock do realize that youre a full fag
  starbucks is for gays and women veganism is for men who defend the innocent and voiceless and arent npc cucks
  lmao wtf is that shit
  riiiight
  thankyou wise vegan
  than
  not an argument
  not a counter argument
  the joke        you
  i know i didnt proofread i knew someone would nail me on that right after i clicked post
   crickets 
  what kind of hot dogs are those ive only tried the tofurky sausage and fieldroast but i cant recall ever trying a veggie dog before
  that keylime one is great
  we all know where youve been putting those dawgs
  those daiya cheesecakes are delicious i had one for thanksgiving
  usually in pasta dishes or i slice them and cook them in an assortment of veggies also as a pizza topping
  field roast is definitely the best vegan sausage the frankfurters are fucking amazing
s got no dairy no soy no gluten what the fuck is it and why do they have to be soy free now is soy problematic for veganfags
  they are some kind of pork sausage not good for hot dogs but they are all the store had it seems like there should be vegan hot dogs since i assume the flavor and texture would be easier to emulate than other sausages my closest store doesnt even have field roast but ill check out trader joes next time i go grocery shopping
  allergies also some vegans dont like eating heavily processed soy products
  some people are allergic to soy some people see it as their boogeyman because they are unread on the subject and big animal agriculture like to demonize it
  soy literally gives you tits
anyone try it yet
  no it doesnt i lost mine going vegan and exercising tofu is my protein of choice
          prove it  you cant
  how much soy do you eat im not terrified of soy but i try to get most of my protein from nonsoy sauces
  king oscar sardines make for a great pizza topping i like getting a plain cheese pizza from a local joint then adding stuff like that no pizza joints have sardines its always anchovies and i find those way too salty  to each their own
  
  this is the best vegan cheese im not even vegan and i cant tell the difference

  as opposed to what mr frogposter
  those trips
  practically with every meal though lately since ive been working out more seriously ive been finding my way to protein powder which was surprisingly really good in my after workout smoothie      honestly if i wasnt vegan id be all over sardines i love artichoke hearts and olives i like salty foods      yea this ones a good cheese brand too
  of course i can only speak for myself though i think the whole soy creates moobs is no different than the whole thing back in the days that mountain dew shrunk your penis size
  cool im not vegan buy trying to be as close as possible right now i have rice and pea protein powder and im trying to incorporate them into recipes but i might resort to smoothies
  dont go vegan for some stupid treacherous bitch thats likely fucking a plumber
  what is lynx
  yeah right go on drinking your california soy
  do you wear vans like a standard california wannabe faggot
    are all antisoy posters hickabama cousindiddlers or am i missing something here
  theyre just sore losers and still crying in fetal positions in closets because their annointed one shillary was beaten by trump
  technically its a jam
  i didnt my decision to go vegan was first due to my lactose intolerance followed by my stomach not being able to properly digest meat      yea smoothies are the best bet i mean you can make protein brownies and cookies pancakes all that but if youre doing it to stay fit and healthy best be mixing that protein powder with greens and fruits
  dick cheese obviously
  care about animals  pollute their environment with individual cheese stick wraps

    dairyfree cheese  is it basically like plastic american cheese
why are most pans now aluminium  why not stainless steel     surely its harder its less likely to warp and it wont scratch up as much  also isnt aluminium somewhat poisonous especially if youre scraping bits of it off of a pan into your food    i would also raise the question of why cast iron is not so popular  but that shits expensive and heavy and they never put a plastic handle on it
the jews are trying to poison the white population by spreading aluminum products pans cans its even in deodorant dont fall for it it will make you more feminine
cast iron  expensive  what the fuck
aluminum is completely biologically inert
  unless it passes into your blood by swallowing particles of it then it gets stuck in your brains and gives you parkinsons
  keep believing that goy
  cite 3 studies that show a causal link between aluminum and alzheimers
  aluminium  very cheap and heats quickly   isnt aluminium somewhat poisonous  i think thats just when cooking in acid
  poor people use a thing because its cheap but good  hipsters who are poor people that cant accept being poor and want to pretend theyre eccentric middleupper class folk hear about it  hipsters start buying the most expensive versions of the cheap product and talking about how enlightened they are  businesses try to cash in on the hipsters and start jacking up prices because hipsters will fight over who can spend the most money on the worst stuff  consumer factions form up over weird brand/manufacturing divisions  all the poor people who were just trying to stretch their dollars are forced out of the market
  theres actually quite a lot of studies that show raised levels of aluminium in dementia patients
  correlation / causation buddy  also you say a lot but in fact there are very few
  i guess thats why deodorant companies have started producing sticks with no aluminium in them
  that was because of tariffs you can be certain it wasnt from concern for citizens health especially nowadays
things only assholes eat mug cake

  ironically starting a clickbait thread is still starting a clickbait thread
does /ck/ still have /alck/ threads    how was your week    are you ready for the week ahead    what are yall drinking tonight lads
it was all right until a bunch of jobs came in ive worked 40 of the last 48 hours and im still here i just want to slam cheap beer in my bed
  doing well but the first few weeks after the cunt closed down the al/ck/ threads here were rough i hope he goes to win his 69 virgins soon     sounds crazy tough guessing you used something a tad stronger to get you through  im in bed with some pasta strong ciders and netflix only 432pm here but ill be asleep by 8am i reckon
  im fucking high not a drunken loser like you pleb cringe bluepilled yikes
  like handjobs or what kind of jobs
  cant do anything harder i do refinery work its forced me to cut back on drinking so at least when things like this happen i dont get withdrawals anymore  took a little phenibut to calm my nerves tho
  i drink as much or more volume but ive gone from 13 down to 7 per volume  my shits have been better for the most part and im actually sleeping better now
  sounds like a victory to me good on you buddy     i just stay away from hard liquor now and dont drink more than a six pack a night unless ive specifically taken the day off also raised my quality of life a good bit since i actually eat food now
50ml lemon juice  20ml hamilton gold rum  both of the above poured over lemon zest  60ml st george terroir gin  40ml templeton rye  20ml st george bruto americano  20ml sweet vermouth  15ml fennel syrup  6 drops fee brothers mint bitters  3 drops fernet branca    shaken  strained with a cherry    just finished was pretty good but honestly couldve used a more alcoholic tasting rum like wray and nephew and maybe less lemon juice wasnt that strong tasting even though it was probably around 50 abv    now im just sipping smith and cross with a laugunitas ipa lol
  whats a /alck/ thread some sort of thread about being drunk lol this board is for food and cooking if you want to talk about being drunk try  or something i dont know but obviously its not relevant here
  grats anon
  how long have you been on ck
  do your homework before bed little timmy
  stop biting the bait idiot
  id love to say it feels like one  i need to cut down more still i know   but strong thanks on the kind words    ty anon   i dont have the runs 68x per day now so thats awesome baby steps to getting better  its weird bc i eat far less now losing weight is kinda weird bc doing zero exercise but down 10kg in 2 months i just sit at a desk all day i guess red wine has more calories than i thought  glad that stage of my life is behind me
fucking tired equipment tech in operating room been working 13 hour days all week nov/dec is crazy busy as everyone has hit there deductibles closing a shitty week with some black cherry seltzer and vodka following with a half of watermelon
  im drunk give me a break
moooooods theyre talking about alcohol again
havent read any posts yet too drunk and lazy to do it before posting    i had a rip of my dab pen the plug and play for those who know weed shit and i shotgunned two 25oz cans of rolling rock
  so basically youre sober
being a problem for your family and friends because youre addicted to alcohol has nothing to do with food and cooking did what i had to do
inb4 delete    grandfather died in july good friend of mine killed himself in 4 days before my birthday in novmeber binges are getting longer
  how do i boiul water
  i dont think anyone can determine what that tastes like just from reading that list of ingredients and am positive nobody is going to be recreating it but you could at least post it in a thread that isnt going to get deleted in the next 15 minutes beer wine and cocktail threads are fine but al/ck/ threads were for legit drunks and we basically fall into two broad categories the shitty macro lager virgin and the bottom to midrange handle of vodka chad /ck/ was always an al/ck/ board but the general just attracted too much /r9k/ woe is me bullshit
  damn sorry to hear anon  also sorry that cunt mohammad will ban you for posting in this thread  id love to meet mohammad as im sure if we met id convert him and hed love pork   ive shown 12 muslims the beauty of pork so far and they all enjoyed as much as alcohol and pot  mohammads are weak truly ask anyone
havent been in one of these in awhile one of my local regular stops is run by indians and he fucks with me for buying a big bottle of vodka every weekend today he gave me the look like eyeroll i feel sorry for you go kys y u do this every weekend he lost a customer
  i purposely go to different shops every week and before the weekend so it looks like im buying shit for a party or football
  sorry pal
  it was suppose to be on  but who honestly goes there but they rejected liver failure  was home at one point but not enough kino related
al/ck/ has been a staple on this board for years i dont know wtf has been going on lately but this is where it traditionally was contained
    finished off a 3l box of wine now working on vodka and juice/soda weekend binges are fun but ill be shitting liquid for the next two days
  what makes no sense to me is that as far as generals go this is the best there is nothing cancerous ever spills out on to the board and everything is contained perfectly youre literally seeing a silhouette of a man drinking every now and again but apart from that i cannot see how this general causes enough trouble to justify the reaction its been getting
  agreed i dont understand how drunks are the most shunned of all the fucking degenerates on 4chan shoot heroin and fuck children no problem get a fur suit and get fucked by trannies no problem your drink too much spammed and reported
halfway through a handle of vodka and have a fifth of kracken on deck
  you are an alcoholic loser and youre too drunk most of the time too really understand what sober people are talking about or doing so maybe kill yourself
  were all trying go cook some fucking low quality steak
is mall drinker still alive
  the fact that the daily bon appetit waifu threads are allowed despite having absolutely nothing to do with food theyre literally just /tv/ cancer but al/ck/ is deleted is pretty much the nail in the coffin for /ck/
  half of al/ck/ is either dead because of drinking killed themselves or is dying no joke
woah an al/ck/ thread thats unusual i cant believe they banned these anyways i was up to about a liter of vodka a day now im down to a bit less than a fifth trying to taper because this shit is really getting to me just scared of withdrawal even with tapering but my kidneys and stomach are starting to hurt and im getting delrious and my face is peeling i usually try to taper off around this time
  tapering is the safest option unless you go hospital detox where they can pump you with mag and thiamine so your brain doesnt get blasted
  roll
i truly miss these threads kept me grounded
bump for drunks sake
smashing down the leftover goon bags of fruity gordo and getting mad as fuck playing rocket league and listening to dead kelly got a drug and alcohol piss test for a new job tomorrow
  one cunt wolf pack
  i just go to the same one or maybe two bottleshops 34 times a week ones near home ones next to work    i only ever buy bottle/s of vodka and im sure they know im alcoholic but i dont really give a shit who cares what some random idiot at a store thinks about you
for me its fitz super clear the best european style lager

  hey if youre in winnipeg that can be arranged
after opening it and getting one whiff that is the most foul smelling shit i think ive ever come across if you possibly can even get close enough to that shit to smell it and then actually go through with drinking it you are mentally ill     i bought it because i wanted to be a rock hard bonered high circulation chad never again
why would you get powdered beetroot instead of just eating beetroot
  ive literally never eaten a vegetable in my life not trolling
  beets are a very advanced vegetable an overgrown toddler cant just walk into a health food store and move straight to beets youre like the retard on /fit/ who thought a body weight squat was adding your body weight to the bar
  if only people would just read the sticky
  i know thats why i bought the powder     but anyway what are good starter vegetables im thinking spinach which has nitrates like beetroot powder and baby carrots     also im wondering if there was like poison or something in that powder because i can still almost taste that shit on my tongue even though i didnt even put it anywhere near my mouth the powder flew up into the air when i opened the package and my apartment still reeks of it i dont know what beetroot powder is supposed to smell like it surely it cant be that
  whats a beetroot
  arent nitrates the things in hot dogs youre supposed to avoid
  nitrites
  carrots squash especially zucchini cherry/roma tomatoes and bok choy
otr carrots v onions  a pride of carrots      maybe im just a dork for liking this stuff
  youre like the retard on /fit/ who thought a body weight squat was adding your body weight to the bar  what do you mean i cant just squat 250 pounds with zero training or prior experience /fit/ fuck you now my spine is broken
what do you drink
high quality h2o
  nice
jack and coke or jack honey and ginger ale what about you op    also makers mark is highly overrated
rum and soda bourbon on the rocks and im trying to get some decent vodka for infusing
    ive been actually trying to get decent at making mixed drinks but for me its the vodka cranberry
water from tap
drinking a four loko atm because i hate myself but im a rum guy
water and seagrams vodka
  what mama dont know wont hurt her
  water and cheap beer just to avoid the spiciness of the local food
neat whiskey whiskey soda old fashioned gin and tonic margaritas not frozen wine beer dark and stormy negroni mint juleps vodka cranberry moscow mule
  since its getting colder fancuillis with a dash of chocolate bitters
  mules are gross bruh
  i fucking love ginger beer i had a mule once made with a really smoky mescal and that was one of the best drinks ive had i really should buy some mescal and try it again
  at the moment some crown rye
  white russians
store had zaya on sale  its very nice for an oldage rum bacardi 8yr could have a harsh taste zaya is much more mellow on harsh flavors but still very holiday warm spices
  ale  polish lager  whiskey and coke  occasionally shots of sambuca
tap water and flavorless white rum ive been trying to ferment it in the basement from molasses but it never turns out right
  kahlua is repulsive
  bland white rum is usually made in gigantic column stills and filtered multiple times i dont know if it can be replicated at home what kind of molasses are you using

  omg so le epic op xd
look at this absolute madman he actually did it
an inferior version of wendys 1 chicken sandwich
  look guys its a meme    im bored
4channel sucks
  okay wow    after eating it i can confirm wendeys did it better
  a cold mcchicken theyre better eaten straight away
  please review this with more high res photos and be articulate  as a potential first ever mcchicken virgin looking to get cherry popped tomorrow i need an honest opinion
im lovinit  why is the im lowercase  why couldnt they just spell loving  what exactly is it that theyre lovin
  im a mcchicken slut but im giving you my honest opinion dont go for a full on mcchicken straight away get a cheeseburger and some mcnuggets use no dipping sauce alternate between bites of cheeseburger and plain mcnuggets do this at least once a week for about two months only then will you be ready for a mcchicken
please dont eat on the mcdonalds tables
dont forget to smear feces around the joint
heart disease and diabeetus you worthless faggot
  its a 1 chicken sandwich
  true but i didnt t think wendys us actually a dollar now
  the crispy chicken sandwich is still 099 at least it was a week ago in maryland
  ouch    too late i already ate it the experience was sub par    i cant eat this fast food shit once a week i would actually die    this is accurate    the mcchicken was 1 im pretty sure the crispy chicken from wendeys was also 1 the last time i got one
  disappointment just like your father when you were born
why are they pushing the edible insects
  those are not insects
  this op you absolute retard
why dont vegans assuming for moral reasons eat bugs would they if bugs were more easily available is there a name for someone who only eats vegan  bugs
  these are leds or light emitting diodes  if you pass a poz current down the pole it will light up
      good job op you dumb fuck
  they have to push something to keep up their budget and they just like bitching it keeps the california soccer moms occupied
  almost definitely there are so many words for vegan subtypes that its ridiculous thats why they tend to just use vegan as a catchall term everybody has a general idea of what theyre aiming for
  his smile and optimism gone
  peanuts  wut
  now these are insects
jews want us to behave like subhumans  they started with processed garbage like mcdonalds
  weird in the 90s men got vasectomies because they wanted to fuck a lot without having kids now it is somehow a virtue worth signalling
  he has frozen peas on his missing testicles
  i bet you think whales arent fish either fucking npcs
  based  you sound like a doctor
  look mom im pretending to not know what a vasectomy is
  it was virtue signaling then too facebook just didnt exist to spread it very far google vhemt
  no thats absolutely wrong if you eat animals or animal products of any kind you cant call yourself vegan period what youre describing are semivegetarians who limit their diets less stringently to include certain animals eg pescovegetarians or animalproducts eg lacto and/or ovovegetarians personally i think modified vegetarianism is the best diet for optimal health because youre still taking advantage of efficient sources of nutrition
  i didnt mean it in a literal sense you spastic retard he willingly removed his ability to have children so he essentially isnt a man and therefore has no nuts idiot
  vasectomy  orchiectomy
  i know about vhemt i wasnt aware it was old as 1991 but did know population panic goes back to at least the 70s    i didnt realise the image was related to human population though if thats what it is im disappointed i presumed it was a feminism thing and had enjoyed my opportunity to vice signal
  uh huh so youre the shitty type of vegan basically i dont care how you live your life just dont talk to me because youre fucking dull
  
  i hope she ends up pregnant one day and the baby turns out to be black
  yikes
  i havent seen those in probably 20 years
  sustainability is popular
desu bugs are pretty substanible plus a cricket taco is pretty good
from what ive heard insects are one of the most efficient sources of protein in the world with way less of a carbon footprint when compared to farm animals
  scorpions are arachnids not insects retard and those scorpion lollipops have existed long before the insect eating trend
  you are confusing following a plant based diet with a vegan    vegans follow a plant based diet for moral reasons and generally care about the environment    a plant based eater is one that avoid meat and animal byproducts
i really dont mind insects but they are way too expensive
  those would be a cool looking design for leds
does your partner cook for you does their food taste good
  braaap

my last girlfriend was extremely good in making salads everything else was burnt overcooked bland or simply wasnt done right shes 33
shes vegan so o dont trust her with my food but she compensate with sex hence im not complaining
  yes    yes

its probably unrealistic to have that many types of bread at a small place
  seems very gormound amd maybe shit is different overseas    my only recs  more classic deli meat sandwhich options/combinations   good sauces like aolis/mayos garlic chipotle basil etc     overall seems very high end
  for the schnitzel remove the cheese add some pickles and use some darker bread ideally rye
do an original sandwich
  looks pretty fucking good op    reading this makes me realize how pivotal italians are to sandwiches and their ingredients
romaine  keep your death leaves you bastard
simple wonderful combinations id eat them all the only thing that would stop me from going is if you tried playing up the ingredients on the menu  avoid that pitfall and keep it just like you wrote it     also make 11 a secret tendie sandwich
  garbage all of it
  so long as you use a separate knife when making a the vegan id definitely eat at this sandwich shop quite often of course if the price was reasonable as well
  this i dont want my delicious sandwich being touched by hummus
  pair with some soups and it sounds like a great menu
  shredded lettuce on a blt  what the fuck
sounds great but give them out to coworkers friends and family before you get your store open     no one will tell you if they dislike it but if they ask for more youll know they did
im not eating there until you make a mcchicken
  i was going to say something about the grilled cheese but then i realized that your cheese selection is shit in every sandwich shredded iceberg lettuce is also awful if i wanted these shitty sandwiches id just hit up my costco loving grandma
  you have to be taking the piss  perfect grilled cheese has meat and is that basic    oh i guess hes just doing a real simple menu    the classic nothing classic about it except maybe classically retarded      just stop it you troll
sounds pretentious faggot
  looks good anon sounds like a place id go to all the time for lunch nice slice details you should change deluxe blt to blt deluxe though more patrician that way
r8 my sandwich /ck/
  shredded lettuce is so much better lad
  ah yes the time old pretentiousness of simple sandwiches
sounds good
whats the highest quality pizza that i can get

redpill me on these pieces of shit  are they any good are the capsules full of shit coffee and chemicals
a bullet
  they are absolutely full of chemicals    i take it you know nothing about chemistry did you finish high school or just go to a very bad one/ not pay attention
  unironically huh are you shilling for chemicals and processed foods
  by chemicals i mean more sugar than coffee etc  now why dont you further elaborate on your masters degree in chemistry that appears to have taken such a huge impact on you
  i dont have a masters in chemistry i just have enough sense to know what a chemical is
  by chemicals i mean more sugar than coffee etc  dumbass
  you seem to be asking a question you already know the answer to but here are some convenient points  special packaging for each pod increases cost/cup as well as waste  no control over brew parameters  coffee is preground and sometimes chemically preserved stale/contaminated  companies can more easily introduce lowquality beans and upsell no transparency  variety is limited to licensed producers reduced freedom of choice  machine itself is expensive compared to other options and offers less functionality  literally the only advantage these offer is marginal convenience saving you maybe five or six minutes in prep time
  podshit  good    pick one
that black thing looks like a cat
is there a worse apple than a red delicious apple   its so bad  mealy not juicy at all skin tastes like fucking shit
  every fruit ive ever eaten tastes bitter except for bananasgrapes and watermeloneveryone else says fruits are sweet but maybe were both tastelets
  agreed try nearly rotten fruit its always the best
  most other apples are great though honeycrisps are very sweet
northern spy master race
  yeah theyre awful the reason is red delicious apples were bred to win apple growing competitions which only grade on appearance
whats everyones favorite apple mine are sour jerries
  in my neck of the woods we call these sour apples on account of their sour taste and applelike appearance
  did you know it was actually named after jerry apple the guy who discovered the apple and named his favorite kind after him he then went on to open up the big apple but then somebody i think it was the creator of the red delicious apple assassinated him and then tried to get everyone to forget his name thats why you guys call them sour apples and not sour jerries
  no i didnt know that and wish i hadnt ever learned
  shut it bonerboy
yep by far the worst variety fuji/jazz/royal gala/golden delicious/jonathan and modi are the only ones i buy
  most fruit has a bit of bitterness or tartness to it especially the skin and seeds or if its not fully ripe
anyone have tips or recipes for making leg of lamb    i was thinking of seasoning it with roasted garlic fennel and orange but ultimately a good texture and perfectly melted fat are the most important things
i usually stab some holes in it and crap garlic and rosemary in them then just roast it in the oven like that collect the drippings for gravy obviously  im not much of a mint guy myself but it is kind of traditional and i dont mind including a little    why did you chose a /pol/ image for the op if you wanted to discuss cooking
  could have gone a bit more pink than this but it was still quite nice
  gritty is actually the polar opposite of a /pol/ image but mostly its because i didnt have a picture of lamb on hand and was too lazy to download one    might try your stuffing idea but it seems like it would be easier to stuff the inside if its boneout
  holy shit you cooked the piss out of it
lately ive been covering lamb leg in gyro spices and smoking it then making gyros i use the spice rub from saveurs pork belly gyro recipe which is also really tasty too
out of curiosity do you think i could cook the leg of lamb like a brisket i think that texture is what i want but i dont know if leg of lamb will get the wrong texture from it since its mostly tender meat and hard fat
there can be only one
brownies are shit
its gonna be chocolate cookies for me easily
  cake brownies are shit fudge brownies are fantastic
  this man is a man worth listening to
  theyre both so fucking good but i think ill have to pick cookies gooey perfect chocolate chip cookies are the best possible food fudge brownies are heavenly but not perfection    based and fcking redpilled
  this desu baka senpai
a challenger appears
  challenger is instantly defeated
cookies more versatile
brownies can be better than cookies but those particular brownies look like shit
a challenger appears
  /thread
now heres something we hope youll really like
  why dont you go drink a bag of milk leaf
  cookies and donuts are one of the few things that i honestly dont give a shit about even after trying many different recipes/sources so easily brownies here
  fudge brownies no contest people who pick cookies havent had a good brownie in their lives and i feel for them
  brownies are only good with icecream
  why not both
for me its chocolate chip cookies the finest in tasty treats
fudgy brownies easily win but theyre ruined if they have any icing
  brownies not even a question desu
  brownies every time even my favorite cookie isnt as satisfying as a notburned brownie
  brownies unless oatmeal raisin
  ice cream is only good with brownies
  cake and fudge brownies are both equally inferior to chewy brownies
  neither why give your body something it doesnt need there are so many foods just as delicious which actually serve a nutritional purpose
a new challenger
  thats only in onterrible hoser
  brownies are shit
chocolate chip cookies brownies are good too but eating a chocolate chip cookie is a much more dynamic and interesting experience
  based
  these are so fucking nasty
ill take mississippi mud thank you
    which one was made with coffee  thats the one i will choose
i would choose the brownie if it had nuts otherwise the chocolate chip cookie wins every time
  brownies
ice cream with both of them in it
  everything is shit in the end
  no
step aside kiddos the adults are here
  cookies since they offer more variety brownies are nice but cant match up to the versatility the cookie provides
  my nigga
  damn that looks good do you lay the cookie dough on top of the brownie batter at the start of cooking or like halfway through cooking
    niggers
  brownies always
cookies by a mile brownies effectively have one flavor and dont have much variation between recipes  sure you can top them differently or add fudge or whatever but the end result is always superdense chocolate flavor meanwhile a lemon drop cookie is vastly different than an oatmeal/peanut butter or chocolate chip cookie in both taste and texture so you arent stuck to just chocolate the whole time like you are with brownies
a stranger approaches
  its a boxed thing the instructions are on the back or side
  you wouldnt race mix would you
  wouldnt i
  fpbp
  eww fuck off i bet you like vanilla icecream and cheese pizza too
so ive watched the great british bake and why doesnt anyone make chocolate chip cookies its always shortbreads and curry flavored shit when they do biscuits
brownies fucking suck dick obviously the answer is cookies
  because its too common better to make something unique that represents who you are as a chef then to make some basic bitch cookies even if they are tasty as fuck
why is frosting so disgusting anons i hate cake for this reason
  americanstyle frosting is garbage but there are many cake that either dont use it at all or just use classic royal icing or powdered sugar
  gingerbread is better than brownies
  they arent mixed they are very clearly separate yet equal also the cookie always goes on the top brownies need to stay on the bottom where they belong
  boring
  chocolate chip cookies brownies are good but chocolate chip cookies are timeless you can eat chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream but you dont eat brownie batter ice cream
  challenger is not registered for the match
  just as delicious   name 3
  these are too hard to make and dont even taste that good they look pretty though
  peppermint bark is garbage tier even the stuff you buy at a higher end store is almost definitely almond bark partially hydrogenated oil and sugar with a little flavoring with real cheap or fake more partially hydrogenated oil chocolate unless you buy it from a place like whole foods where they disallow those ingredients and youre probably paying up the ass for it no matter how shittier it is
  depends what those are lemon sugar plain sugar butter chocolate chip cookies without the chips snickerdoodle i cant tell
  flavorwise  royal icing is garbage   fondant is garbage   most places dont do a good buttercream but a good buttercream is phenomenal     if you are buying your icing premade at the grocery store you are short changing yourself and you should go outside more
  heathen
  ill have a pizzookie
  isnt a cake brownie just a brown cake
  kaka
  eleventh post best post  well it took you a while but we got there eventually
  actually my local bakery sells a half brownie half cookie they call it a brookie
  plain sugar
  those arent mixed though theyre clearly one thing made up of two segregated things
  dont eat brownie batter ice cream  speak for yourself
  but you dont eat brownie batter ice cream  no but they do have fudge brownie ice cream
  fudge brownies  you mean oil saturated cake
  no
  ah yes macarons the biggest dissapointment to exist in this world  you keep wondering what these things taste like you want to try these yourself since they look so cute but never find the time  you finally get the chance to eat one and it tastes like fucking awful shi fancy ass garbage shit that a monkey would throw around in a zoo  and on top of that they gave birth to an awful precure chocolate had atleast the little sister thing going on but macaron was just boring the only reason she existed was because they needed a fifth precure and couldnt reveal ciel so early into the show  they might have wanted to get the sailor moon thing by making her and chocolat similar to the lesbians/cousins from sailor moon but she didnt have enough of a personality to stand on her own the only somewhat good parts were when she was with chocolat and even then those moments cant fix such an awful character in a not that really great show to begin with  so yeah  i think macarons suck
  were you being serious about expressing your hatred of them while you typed this
  yes
  a brownie is classified as a barcookie
  no theyre not what shitty country do you come from
  you seem agitated   though in fairness for how expensive they are macarons are rather disappointing yes the crunchy/chewy combo is nice but theyre overly sweet and somewhat bland   give me a decent stroopwafel over a macaron any day
hoping to make some gumbo soon /ck/ got any good recipes
i have only ever tried this recipe      i have made it about 3 times now and ithink it turns out pretty good i am curious of other recipes though i really have no clue where to look for recipes the internet has way too much bullshit
  i always add flaming hot cheetos to my gumbo to give it an extra kick    dont do it if u dont wanna fight the spice though
i combine land and sea in my gumbo
  if you take your time and make the roux right you should be golden   chicken and saussage crew here
    can second this recipe cooking in russia is one of the best channels on youtube make it op
    thanks for the pro tip
keep rice and gumbo in separate containers
jamably  a craw fish pie  a filet gumbo
    this should help
    be nice if i would ctrlv right
  additionally  
the secret ingredient is gator tail    fire up yer fanboat and go womp one on the head with your dale earnheart promotional louisville slugger there is no replacement for gator meat
  an actual recipe recommendation on /ck/  kiss me i must be dreaming
  bs  thats tourist food unless you actually live in the swamp no one around the city in new orleans was raising gators they were fishing raising hogs cows chickens and shooting deer n ducks n shit
  i bet you dont even eat nutria
  i was going to mention them but i didnt think youd know what it was
  get your spiciness from a variety of peppers rather than a spoonful of cayenne
get ready to stir your roux for a good while unless you like your gumbo white
  get a lot of thinking done stirring a roux
  its not chili its gumbo
  creole/cajun food isnt spicy
  its not chili its gumbo  what does that have to do with anything    gumbo is usually spicy and you will get a better flavor using a variety of peppers you will compared to a onenote dry seasoning especially cayenne
  i agree with you to an extent that its usually better but in this case notrealllly cayenne has its own distinct flavor unless youre buying the cheap powders and it lends better to gumbo than serranos or habaneros for instance and is much better than mexican fried peppers / chipotle cayenne jalapeno and scotch bonnets will be the flavors gumbo will best mesh with avoid the sweeter peppers
  dried not fried
  who the hell uses a recipe for gumbo just sear off every goddamn piece of animal you got and combine with rice and stock
   thats jambalaya     most southerners and french chefs will tell you its all in the roux when you make gumbo its practically religious to them use the trinity mirepoix green bell peppers celery onion garlic use andouille sausage chicken catfish crawdads shrimp and pork knuckle bay leaf cayenne chili powder paprika white pepper parsley garlic and onion powders okra and green beans optional
  okra is necessary green beans can go jump in another pot ive never put fish in seafood gumbo does it work well
i reuse oil i had used before to fry chicken for my roux
  heres one i used to make using simple ingredients to save time    boil a bunch of dark meat chicken can be frozen kind if youre lazy chop a fuckton of yellow onion and celery and toss them in you can use frozen sausage or legit and also toss it in get a gravy packet from your local grocer and mix in well with some browning sauce add chopped basil generous seasoned salt pepper and finish with a decent heaping of gumbo file i add hot sauce individually after the fact not the fanciest gumbo but comes out very good despite the quality of ingredients
  oh and a metric fuckton of garlic
  if you use a gravy packet for gumbo you should be beaten with a bat make your own roux
  okra is necessary    truth
take a dump on my chest
  jamably  hebba heba hebba heba
  where
i only ever do chicken and sausage gumbo is shellfish that good i hate the texture of shrimp in most dishes i prefer to eat them alone or on a bed of rice where i can still eat them individually
  holy fuck i have the same mug as that guy
  may god have mercy
hey boy
  creole is spicy real cajun is hearty country fare
im about to order some sodium citrate  what do you have in your pantry so i can pad my order to get free shipping from amazon
get some malic acid and succinic acid powders too and you can makeyourself synthetic lime juice
  sodium citrate which as you probably already know about  iota carrageenan  you can use it along with sodium citrate to make gourmet american singles / velveeta with whatever cheese you want just sodium citrate alone allows you to make great cheese sauces but this gives you that butterlike incremental melting of velveeta and american cheese  citric acid  sour as you already know used for its chemistry as well  xanthum gum  thickener kinda like corn starch and gelatin useful to stop crystallization in ice cream    i think thats all the unusual powders i have in my pantry
  xanthum gum  thickener kinda like corn starch and gelatin useful to stop crystallization in ice cream  most people i see putting 50/50 of xantham and guar is there really a difference between the two  i thought it was all just fiber gel
  prague powder
doesnt industry use sodium hexametaphosphate instead of citrate ive made american cheese with that before and it was the most godly thing ever to come out of my kitchen and continue to make it if only for grilled cheese sandwiches    might also want to pick up some transglutaminase just for shits and giggles lasts forever and you can do some cool experiments with it
sodium alginate
just gonna get straight to the point lets say i needed to do a milk and vinegar challenge all i know is it needs to consist for of drinking a gallon of milk how would i do this and how dangerous would it be to do it
you dont need to do this
the point of that challenge is to trick retards like you into vomiting up body temperature milk curds
 thats kinda my thing though

visit parents  dad pulls a frozen steak out of the freezer its glad wrapped and covered in ice crystals  puts it in the microwave for 5 minutes  you know it will melt if you cook it in the pan right  no the middle will stay frozen it has to be microwaved first  meat looks a little grey  he puts it in a cold pan then puts the pan on the oven and starts cooking  no salt no oil definitely no basting  pan starts to heat up and makes the smallest sizzling sound  he turns the pan down  after 5 minutes finally grabs the salt shaker and puts a 1/4tsp of salt on one side then flips it  5 minutes more of fussing over it and its done  meanwhile mom makes a single boiled egg for dinner
that physically hurted to read

  hi ops dad your steak blows
  tomatoes are a vegetable they have water
heat teflon coated pan up without oil  gets 550 degrees  add avacodo oil heats up to 500   sear steak
  he doesnt cook with freeze dried tomatoes
  criticizes dad for thawing steak  suggests cooking steak directly from freezer is ok  painful
  its better to cook the steak frozen rather than thawing it just baste the shit out of it    thawing is about the worst thing you can do to the meat it will be grey and tough and lose so much moisture use google to find a comparison i think americas test kitchen did some tests if you never tried it before
roommate makes dinner  eats his fill but leaves the rest on the stove  a day later throws away a dried out mess  we own tupperware but he throws out like 40 of what he cooks
  this sounds gourmet compared to what i grew up with ill try to muster the strength for a greentext later
  no prepattied burgers are the exception
  either you cook it right and have a coolerthanroomtemperature middle or you overcook it to thaw it nobody here really eats less than 114 inch steaks right

  carefully season meal to taste  serve grandparents  grandpa shakes saltshaker over entire plate for 20 seconds then complains that no salt is coming out  tfw his plate looks like its been snowed on  every fucking time
  opposite for me bro  not allowed to season food because fatass grandpas sodium is too high  not allowed to any herbs or spices because he doesnt like them
  my grandmother used to cook the same halfassed sort of way as ops father and how you seem to have to literally just put a piece of pork chop in the oven without seasonings and bake until you need to saw it apart i guess its no wonder my grandpa always salts the fuck out of everything by reflex but still infuriating to see your careful efforts at flavoring undone by overzealous salting  id still try to sneak seasoning in where i could if i were you my grandpa dislikes garlic but ive incorporated it into slowcooking roasts and a few other places where the flavor isnt instantly identifiable and heard only complements on it
    drowned in his shower    wut
   my grandpa dislikes garlic  you mean he doent pretend to like it like everyone seems to do
  ill breath it right in your face next time i spot you out see if i dont m8
my mother has been cooking for 40 years and has never once given a fuck about presentation drives me up the fucking wall

  youre just as bad if you defrost steak in the frying pan
  dont discriminate against humans you vampire
  if it tastes good otherwise presentation can take a hike
  good cooking is about making food not painting pictures you retarded woman
  why insist on being wrong just because you messed up cooking a steak doesnt mean its hard    frozen steaks are easier to cook because they wont burn so easy you only need 60c internal temperature for medium rare its so easy to hit that while caramelizing the outside    again just baste it
  what a shocker that rejection of traditional values lead to a generation of men who are expected to cook but were never taught and women who prided themselves in not being able to cook
  he didnt learn to cook at camp with his dad  sad
my roommate a few years ago  meal prepped by baking chicken with no seasoning   when he wanted to eat the chicken he would pull it from the freezer then cover it in ketchup and microwave it  then  he bought a panini press   he used it to make steaks that all looked like old leather
  my pops understands letting the meat rest at room temperature and seasoning beforehand he also prefers to make them on a grill instead of a pan which is delicious    for some reason i cannot understand he burns his meat beyond welldone growing up i had to eat the lump the coal he made nowadays when i visit we compromised on letting each other cook the meat to our own taste

ex gf    microwave scrambled eggs  2 eggs in a dish scratch a little with a fork  nuke for 2 mins on high  comes out a slop  eggs are ready    supermarket chicken rotisserie  in freezer  cuts bits off and heats up in microwave including skin    coffee   beans first  cold milk  drips of hot water  nice lumps of solid moccona clumps
  ive never used a turkey baster ever on a steak who you trolling
  stop being so american thanksgiving is over mate    baste  /bejst/  verb  pour fat or juices over meat during cooking in order to keep it moist    add a few tbsp of oil or butter to your steak while cooking tilt the pan and use a spoon to scoop up the oil pour it on the steak im sure you can google for more info about basting
  pan not hot enough  you need high heat get comfortable with this fact and experience hot enough to fucking vaporize that water basically not let it slide around and collect in the pan  you just cook it for less time
  get the pan hotter and rest the meat for a at least a few minutes after you take it off the pan  melt a little pad of butter in the pan while the meat rests and use that for dipping no waste
gf  puts pasta in cold water  doesnt salt the water  doesnt clean leeks  never season ever
  i loved ozersky rip
  so close to      first   milk   of hot water   lumps of solid moccona clumps  what was she using instant coffee or pouring cold milk over ground coffee in a filter
  melt a little pad of butter in the pan while the meat rests and use that for dipping no waste  oh so i should use butter instead of oil
  i imagine that went down something like that story they tell about turkeys drowning in rain because they look up with their beaks open
  butter and oil but thats not your problem    you can also cook stuff in the juices or pour in some wine or stock to make sauce
  i see it makes sense that the pan is not getting hot enough i usually throw the meat on it after the oil starts sparkling which is very early on
  frozen steaks are easier to cook because they wont burn so easy  its so easy  caramelizing the outside  100 stupid idiots guide to cooking
  other anon indeed seems like a stupid idiot but i seem to remember an americas test kitchen segment involving frozen steaks and it worked out pretty well from what i remember cooking isnt the problem the problem is the what happens to meat left in a freezer for xx months
  leftovers are gross
  implying overcooking steak isnt the way most people fuck up  implying cooking steak is hard    though you are right that maillard reaction isnt the same as caramelizing
dad buys hella expensive filet mingions at costco  fires up shitty 1989 propane grill that has never been cleaned  pulls the meat straight out of the fridge and throws it on a cold grill with zero seasoning  leaves the grill totally unattended to go back inside and drink his 6th scotch and soda of the evening  comes back in 10 minutes flips meat  grill is so shitty that it probably only hits 250 degrees f  cooks another 10 minutes  he stumbles out to turn the grill off and take the steaks inside  one side is totally burnt and the steak is still cold in the middle  i look on in horror as he precuts the entire steak into bite sized pieces and then drenches the entire plate in a1 steak sauce  he inhales his meat making animalesque cartoon chomping and groaning noises stopping only for more scotch    i hate boomers
  more dad cooking    2 pieces burnt toast  1 package stouffers creamed chipped beef  1 can of jolly green giant peas  heat the peas up in a pan microwave the fuck out of the creamed chipped beef  half assedly drain the peas and dump on toast  cover pea/toast sludge with creamed chipped beef sludge  grind about a teaspoon of black pepper on top  inhale like a starving somali child

  other anon nonenglish i was actually wondering if you meant pouring the butter over the meat or beating it with tenderizer

  my way of doing chicken    get the chicken thighs make sure theyrent frozen  season with basic chicken seasoning  apply butter and maybe a bit of water if chicken is too dry  put into preheated oven at 220c for a hour  baste it every several minutes  after the hour turn off the oven and let the chicken rest inside for several minutes  i gotta admit i like my chicken more than when my mother does it she always insists on using plebtier vegetable oils putting it in unheated oven adding water during cooking to pretend it from burning ruining the already kind of shitty fat and she ends ups often burning the skin a bit    how bad am i at cooking
  its a fucking miracle he hasnt had a heart attack yet  animal fats arent bad anon embrace the keto

visiting parents  meal is any kind of pasta or doughbased food like pizza  dad proceeds to dump mayo ketchup cheap mustard and shitty pregrated parmesan cheese on his plate without even tasting it  every  fucking  time  doesnt understand why mom or i say he has no taste buds or just plain taste for that matter    alternatively  at a friends house  his mom is visiting  friends mom dumps half a salt shaker on the food before even tasting it  complains the food is salty  i see my friends soul die a little
  holy shit that beginning he and marie have the same way of speaking
  chicken is good but dubs are better
  puts pasta in cold water  you mean like soaking dried pasta before actually cooking it it works though as long as you dont leave it in for too long and it cooks faster probably not going to get it al dente but al dente is for hipsters super tender pasta is fine
    instant coffee man she has no concept of any other coffee unless it comes from a cafe and is a cappucino
  mush that was once dry pasta is fine  sure it is

  ive got a steak horror story too  went to bjs brewhouse/breweryidc im never going there again  it was lunch and a bunch of people from class were going so i thought id tag along and feel like a normie  wanted the best cut of steak because i was feeling good for almost being done with school  im sorry we only do that on x days  i work in a kitchen so i comply with their house rules and dont act like an asshole about it  get the ribeye  person next to me got a strip or something im not sure  his food came first and it was on a very basic plate of fries some bland broccoli and a piece of meat the size of my fist  im not kidding  fifteen bucks down the drain  i get my food  no other seasoning on the asparagus aside from a heap of salt  my ribeye looked like it was cooked on a flat top with grill marks seared onto one side only  take a bite  all i taste is salt  scrape off the seasonings with my knife and it all comes off as a congealed mass the size of my knifeblade  grill marks are gone kek  finish my beer return the foodsince i didnt eat it pay my tab for the drink and leave
  hurted  you must be 18 to use this site kiddo
dumbass puts way too fucking much olive oil in the water when boiling the pasta  hes planning to put a cream based sauce on it  on fucking pappardelle  it all just slides off and has no ability to adhere to either the pasta or the grilled chicken and mushrooms and theres just oily naked pasta and a plate of rapidly separating alfredo underneath it
i dont like white wine and i dont have any ill just use white wine vinegar instead
semirelated  stepmom doesnt know how to cook has boring palate  occasionally offers to cook spaghetti although she supposedly makes sauce which i can never see or smell cooking  companys coming over and i feel like cooking straightup spaghetti and meatballs for some fucking reason offer to  make meatballs and meat sauce from scratch fill kitchen with tasty aroma everyone compliments cooking because no one else cooks  next week while im out of town my sister mentions to me that she cooked spaghetti and meatballs with a bunch of ingredients  tfw accidentally dabbed on my stepmoms cooking  afaik the only other things she cooks are eggs and unseasoned chicken and whitefish
  when you say from scratch how from scratch are you talking in regards to the tomatoes a canned of crushed or did you go all the way from whole tomatoes to finished sauce
  incase    incase is a porn artist who draws a lot of futa content you are looking for in case
mfw someone completely fucks up a meal and says i like it this way because they are incapable of admitting mistakes  these are the same fuckers that will break something of yours and hide it instead of telling you about it i swear they are mentally 9 years old
  not wanting your eggs a nice crispy brown around the outside with a bubbly foaming texture because they were cracked straight into still splattering bacon grease
  im so sorry
  i use a little tomato paste a can of crushed and a whole tomato cut up so it isnt from scratch from scratch i dont mean it in the granular sense
  ah okay i was just wondering because my mom did the same thing at home just about no paste though but she would have never described it as scratch i think from scratch has a bit of a warped definition where everyone has a different concept of what qualifies     not disrespecting the sauce of course sounds great
  i tried making alfredo once and since i made a bunch for lunches i though i was clever doing so the next day at work i heated it up and it turned all into oil i tried eating some and patting it down with paper towels but it was awful how soupy it was with oil
  ozersky drowned in the hotel shower after suffering a seizure disorder and his death was ruled an accident  jesus christ what a way to go

be kid  dad is a lazy piece of shit  mom abandoned us   seldom made breakfast was lucky to get frozen waffles on weekends  for lunch was a peanut butter mayonnaise bologna sandwich or something equally as disgusting  dinner was frozen pizza tendies or tiny almost burned burgers that looked like hockey pucks       its no wonder i grew up to be a fat piece of shit   shit was good when i visited my grandparents couple times a month though    breakfast was omelette made from fresh eggs they lived on a farm and had cattle chickens garden ect with green peppers onions and a side of toast made with homemade wheat bread  lunch was usually just a sandwich nothing special but it sure as hell beat whatever my dad made me  lot of variety with dinner usually had a nice juicy roasted chicken with potatoes and salad or fresh steak from a cow we slaughtered       i wish i could go back
  yes it was all we had at work

  cooking with these shits is peak boomer    my mom used to make something she called tuna mush    combine cream of mushroom condensed soup with a can of tuna drained  heat  serve with rice or pasta    she finally stopped after my dad and i complained constantly she still combines it with rice and pan cooked chicken in a dish then bakes it i refuse to eat it
  i hate it when my mom reaches for cream of whatever soup it literally looks like cum in a can this thanksgiving i took a quick lesson from babish and made my own quick easy and delicious cream of mushroom soup to go in my green bean casserole big hit im still beaming from the pride
  like this
  no caramelized onions

  checked those quad dubs
  learn how to spoiler nigga
  tinned tomatoes and tomato paste are fairly standard for tomato sauce    dont glorify from scratch too much you are very rarely going to make anything 100 from scratch the same goes for even very good restaurants
  cool my family eventually taught me the recipe and its usually a can of crushed tomatoes and then roasted peppers basil bay leaf and diced onions very light on the tinned peppers usually reserve the paste for doing a sauce we intend to bake like a lasanga or pizza
  a litre of olive oil  half dozen cloves of garlic  dip meat  leave 95 of oil and seasons in pan  
  every time i watch one of these cooking videos i know what im going to see every time i know ill get mad every time i get mad  fucking hell why would you do this
  grilled cheese on the rocks
  s mom dumps half a salt shaker on the food before even tasting it   the food is salty  
  t h i c c
  i dont know where i said anything that wouldve implied anything about me expecting shit from a steakhouse other than food i could eat the beer was alright they made it themselves
  whatd you use for the meatballs ive been using pork shoulder eggs fennel salt red pepper and a little cold water for mixing i also make a pureed slop of seared red onions and garlicin white wine that i throw into the mix
  microwave scrambled eggs    my mom loves doing this but she adds milk and nukes it until its rubber ive never seen her make scrambled eggs any other way its so gross
  i make microwaved scrambled eggs with margarine nutmeg and milk  just gotta watch it like a hawk watches prey so that it doesnt overcook  hell stop heating it before its ready because itll keep cooking from its absorbed heat even when its out of the wave
  i dont care much about presentation when the single items look good and tasty in themselves if they look bad no presentation can save them    presentation is the least important part of cooking i mean when you cook for yourself at home and not for pretentious fucks in some finedining establishment
  he made a pretty good video on cooking a steak
  next time pat those bad boys dry then cook them 45 minutes each side in an ovenproof pan then finish in the oven 2025 minutes at 375
  its good to see where your retardation came from
    tomatoes are a fucking fruit you absolute imbecile
  fruits are vegetables but regardless being a fruit or a vegetable has nothing to do with whether a vegetable has water
  those better be turkey thighs or youre overcooking the fuck out of them
  i still dont get why it has to be inside out once youve made the cut cant you just shove your meme pork into the cut
  no it isnt just take the steaks out in the morning let them thaw throughout the day on a plate and when they are thawed salt and pepper them bitches and use a hot skillet to cook them to perfection
  eating dinner with inlaws  theyre great people but mother in law is scatterbrained and a control freak  everyone even she knows im the better cook but she wants to try to show off by wanting to have a roasted duck for dinner  doesnt score the fat  cooks it on a baking pan instead of a roasting pan on a rack  doesnt periodically baste it  duck comes out greasy skin/fat are soggy and meat is grey and well done  father in law constantly mmmm wow lindaso good throughout the meal  my wife and i later agree that mother in law had no idea what she was doing  mother in law actually laments that the skin isnt crispy like she wanted  kept my mouth shut the entire time because she is sensitive but seriously wtf how do you not know about scoring the skin/fat basting etcits not a chicken

buys sausages  dump on grill with nothing else  poke holes in it so the fat runs out  dry rubbery sausage ready  dump on a plate with nothing else  wa la    buys imitation crab meat and a lot of other frozen fish  thaws it  god awful smell of fish permeates the kitchen and then some  throws it in a tray with cream white wine random spices saw cumin garlic powder and some unidentified grill spices  into the oven for an hour or more  comes out as disgusting fish semisubmerged in a whiteclear liquid   literally no consistency to the sauce and its full of chunks  dumps it on a plate with some plain boiled potatoes  wa la    boomers are a fucking menace
  your post implies that you should ever put olive oil in the water you use to boil pasta please correct this thank you
  poke holes in it so the fat runs out  youre not supposed to do that
  you can do that if you want your sausages to be dry and lose a lot of flavour
  it actually does nothing it wont lube up your pasta oil floats to the top your pasta is already set so the oil will just slide off
  how would you cook and serve your grilled sausage
  youre not supposed to do that  nope    if your sausages are bursting then put them on lower heat
  get given as a gift ya know
  how would you cook and serve your grilled sausage  dont poke holes in it first grill it or panfry it until it reaches the correct internal temp 155f for porkbased sausages or 165f if they contain poultry    if you are having problems with your sausages bursting then your heat is too high fix that instead of poking holes in them
  roommate tries to cook chicken fried rice for the both of us  looks alright try a bite   salty as fuck overpowers every other possible flavor or seasoning be might have also had in the dish  can only taste salt and soy sauce extremely disgusting   tell roommate that the food tastes pretty salty  he says well i generally prefer salty food  i then ask did you use any oil when cooking since i use a bit of peanut oil and sesame oil along with soy sauce  uh no  do people really not understand how food is generally fried
oh i can contribute to this my mother has absolutely no cooking skills whatsoever i started cooking at about 13 so i didnt have to eat her food anymore didnt stop her though one time she made chicken by taking a skinless boneless chicken breast putting it in a pyrex bowl pouring water up about halfway and then cooking it for about 40 minutes no salt or seasoning or flavouring of any kind

   buy better quality meat most meat you find in supermarkets is too fresh  not aged at all  and it will pour juices like a motherfucker after you cook it no matter what   cook it on a very hot pan   let the steak rest at least 510 minutes before cutting it
  cool proxy paige has a new scene coming out  why wasting half a bottle of olive oil for that
  from the photo alone it looks almost edible
  i buy supermarket steak but make a point to set it out on paper towels not to come to room temperature new old wives tale but because from the package its going to lose moisture i change the paper towels every 15 minutes for 45 minutes pressing lightly every towel change  preheat skillet once youve got the steak in one hand and ready to put in use other hand to pour some oil in the skillet set oil down swirl skillet to coat surface put steak in once done i like mine very rare/nearly raw use tongs to move it to a resting place i use a ceramic plate that ill eat it on itll let out some stuff but i tilt the plate to the side and put my potatoes or asparagus on the juice that runs over
  veggies have water in them fruits have juice

dad making scrambled eggs  cracks eggs into a bowl  adds too much skim milk  puts olive oil in pan  low heat  adds eggs  slow stirring for 5 minutes  heat up to high  walks away  eggs start smoking  that quick thats how quick itll get away from you anon remember that  chops up omelette  still some liquid in pan water from skim milk  covers eggs with paper plate in pan  heat back up to high until all liquid has evaporated
    wew lad all that story needs is a metal spatula on a teflon pan
man im glad i grew up in a household where people knew how to cook even my dad can cook and hes a living boomer meme without the monster
  this might have been posted already but i didnt read the whole thread    boil pasta  drain all of the water  jarred sauce right off the shelf  maybe heat the sauce in the microwave  pasta in bowl sauce over it top with canned parmesan    i resonate with the cosmic sperging of the italian peninsula
  it does need to be defrosted it would have remained frozen only problem i see is not preheating the pan
2 uncles no homo barbecuing boneless ribs  fill weber with match lite till maybe 2 inches from grill grate  throws ribs on as soon as flames die down  cut into ribs with side of spatula every 20 minutes to check for doneness    they also then get mad when nobody is impressed by burned dry meat he has not even tried to get better since
  the transient and hostile nature of an imageboard makes it a poor resource for beginners /lit/ doesnt want posters that havent read hundreds of books for example the problem with /ck/ is that the site is mostly used by americans and americans dont really cook so you get an outlier where /ck/ doesnt want posters that havent eaten at hundreds of fast food restaurants instead of made hundreds of dishes at home or in industry this makes it doubly frustrating when a decent thread with seemingly decent cu/ck/s gets shitted up with your retarded /r/ post    tldr lurk moar or gtfo

  well said gas the kikes am i right
  guest is crying and walking around in the room  hey have you been bitten by the craft beer bug
look at you you king fuck off
in general he always comes off as robotic with no personality but also i feel like after so many episodes of doing this he knows how to just stick to the script and turn is brain off    every episode is like  explain that gram where your dressed in a lobster suit with the rock whats happening here with your idol ice cube that you bumped into in australia i did a deep dive and found out your into model trains what is it about model trains that you got into it no im alright man ill take a dap so you dont one up me yup i do this all the time  alright you did it you survied the last dab da bomb you went through the torment of firey chicken wings you got through the insert particular issue contestant had with challenge  youve got this camera this camera and this camera tell everyone what you got going on in your life  that being said painfully clear how bad h3h3 is at this kind of shit when compared to this guy
  he seemed dead as fuck inside he probably has ulcers or something
  more than 3/4 of the shows are him eating that shit with niggers and the rest are with sjw (((whites))) youd hate your life too  hes also a pothead so hes really just a medicated betaboy who tries to make retards seem interesting  i know its all /pol/tier but its really the only way to describe that guy and the show
  pretty much yeah
  niggers and the rest are with sjw (((whites)))  which one of those is bill burr
  sorry i havent watched the show since the johnny knoxville episode
  search for bill burrs wife
  both
  i dont watch it at all but calling burr an sjw is fucking retarded      i did expecting to find something about her cheating on him or something  but its really just because shes not white isnt it you think that makes him a soyboy  bet youd love to put your own dick in an asian though but you never will
  listen kid im from /pol/ im into neonazi ideology bill burr having a black wife is for me proof that white genocide is happening and thats its orchestrated by the jews for me bill burr is committing bestiality with an inferior life this is redpill this is truth
  for me  outed yourself right there soyboy
  being this much on the wrong side of history once again   enjoy stewing in your obsessive cauldron of ignorance and hate while it lasts kid
      s√≥y juiced women detected    you are both disgraces
  no not even hitler wanted to do anything so awful he only wanted to reeducate them the gas was just a measure against lice the medically accepted treatment at that time
  ignorance  yeah h8er everyone knows white manlet  black buffarilla miscegenation produces the best offspring for future generations

  no one cares what you and your homo circle jerking friends think you gotta go back to your containment board
everyone complaining about left baldy when right baldy was the one giving boring as fuck answers and disappointing everyone with his comedy
  watching celebs eat hot things  expecting anything other than pure shit
  i never expect billy hotnuts to be funny during interviews he knows he doesnt have to be and doesnt give a shit i just like hearing him shit on interviewers
  get retarded questions  give retarded answers
    hes not autistic hes an interviewer    this is what interviewers are supposed to do ask the fucking questions and keep the interview moving instead of letting idiots scream and thrash about complaining about spicy food
its probably due to the fact that he has a show to run and a schedule to follow watch the video of him working at a gas station stoned out of his mind if you want to see a more relaxed and natural sean evans
  hes adamantly defended black lives matter both in this video and on his podcast anyone who isnt licking colin kaepernicks asshole is clearly a white supremacist according to him
  hahahahahahaha
  please post this video

spider milk may sound like a fictional ingredient you would find in professor snapes potions class √† la harry potter but scientists in china have found at least one species of realworld spider that does indeed produce a milklike fluid to nourish its young    the jumping spider toxeus magnus lives in china and taiwan its appearance mimics that of an ant but its parental behavior is surprisingly mammalian the mother spider cares for the newborn spiderlings for up to 20 daysa long time for a critter whose entire lifespan is just six months to a year during these first 20 days she secretes a white fluid thats rich in sugars and proteins from its abdomen the milk is crucial for the survival of the young spiders and surprisingly it contains four times as much protein as cows milk  according to a new study published this week in science    i thought it was remarkable you dont really expect spiders to be providing that type of maternal care says jason bond an entomologist at university of california davis who was not involved in the study    researchers at xishuangbanna tropical botanical garden hubei university and kunmig institute of zoology noticed something strange about one particular group of spiders while most mother spiders would leave the nest soon after birth jumping spiderlings seemed to hang around the nest for far longer than most other jumping spider species when the researchers brought the spiders back to the lab to get a closer look they found that over a span of three weeks the baby spiders grew consistently in size even though the mother spider never bring food back for them to eat eventually researcher zhanqi chen noticed something never seen before the young spiderlings crowding around the mothers abdomen drinking a white fluid secreted from a reproductive organ used to lay eggs    
to test whether drinking this milk truly affected the survival of the little spiders chen and his collaborators ran a series of experiments they painted whiteout yes thats correct across the area of the mother spiders abdomens where the milk flowed from blocking its secretion all the baby spiders stopped developing and died days later suggesting total dependence on the milk supply in their early days the researchers write in the paper in follow up studies the scientists found that the milk was essential for the first 20 days of life only afterwards the young spiders started to fend for themselves but they still drank the milk every so often and the continued maternal care greatly boosted their ability to survive and thrive    in the past research on spider secretions has been limited to studying the critters precious silk which is essential for creating necessary webs as far as bond is aware this is the first time scientists have found spiders behaving this way    this is definitely a first says peter smithers an arachnologist at plymouth university in the united kingdom who was not involved in the study but spiders are full of surprises    while definitely surprising lactateadjacent behaviors arent totally unheard of in other animals world even cockroaches provide a crystallized milk for their embryos and pigeons produce a nice fluid in a body pouch for their young to nosh on but its important to realize these creatures arent lactating in the same way as mammals says smithers mammals have special glands for milk production which spiders and roaches for that matter dont have so the milk could be the partially digested remnants of unfertilized eggs smithers suggests that would be in keeping with other known spider behaviors as some spiders will actually lay unfertilized eggs for their young to eat to give them plenty of sugars fats and proteins early on in life
there are nearly 50000 known species of spider in the world and we know a lot about a few and very little about the rest says bond uncovering a new behavior like this could tell us something about convergent evolution between distantly related speciesmammals and arachnidsand inspire scientists to look more closely at our mysterious eightlegged friends    and maybe in the far distant future well all drink spider milk from giant dairy arachnids think of all the protein in just one gloopy glass what am i kidding the giant spiders would definitely kill us all before it got to that point
kill yourself
stupid subhuman chinks killing spiders to test an obvious theory
for me its car milk
  based
  milk me
  huh
  ok but why should we drink this again
  more protein then cows milk
   it contains four times as much protein as cows milk
    eat more protein from a less freaky source damn this site is weird  and would it be expensive as all hell i would think itd take a lot of spiders and labor to produce just a mouthful of it  by allah you people are dogs
  who cares adding more protein to cows milk by either removing the water like muscle milk or by adding it directly eg protein powder is more cost effective    this sounds like some kind of dumb immature spider meme bullshit
  all the baby spiders stopped developing and died days later suggesting total dependence on the milk supply in their early days the researchers write in the paper    more proof that it should be perfectly legal to kill a scientist without punishment
  take 1000 spiders to produce 1 gallon of milk  building breaks because it made in china and millions of spiders are set loose  china fights off mass starvation thanks to eating spiders  disease infects thousands and severely dwindles the population  spiders now infest all of asia  nuke gooks  world saved guys lets do this
where can i get a gallon
pigeons have a milk gland in their necks     why did i never know this before
  now that you do go milk one and make a new thread
    ill post about surprising milk anywhere i want    flamingoes do it too fuck
  ok
  he said while spraying down his kitchen with roachkiller designed by biochemists
  we only drink cow milk in this house young man  go to your ching pong ding dong land if you want this exotic stuff    what ever happened to good old fashioned teat sucking from the mouth of calfs eh
spider cheese when
i hear camel milk is better than cows milk its more accessible and appealing than spider milk

i just made bread for the first time ever using four water yeast and salt i have a scale and some bowls but nothing else really the bread is okay i think it sat too long in the fridge i was out but im curious how i start augmenting it with different flavors so where in the process should i introduce spices or other things     i want to continue using the scale rather than measuring volume but im having a hard time finding recipes that do so id also like to introduce a dark beer but it seems like no matter what the result will be pretty crumbly and soft like cake wondering if its possible to get a nice hard bread using dark beer    also will baking it in a pan really make much difference the guide im following suggests a dutch oven but i havent got one so im just throwing it in the oven on whatever looks fine
also obviously forgot to score it
  what was your recipe and how long did you let it ride/proof
  1000g flour 700 water 20 salt 5 yeast  i mixed it and let it set 15 minutes yeast separate since it was dry active mixed together and let it sit 15 then kneaded it some and let it sit 30 this part im still iffy on folded and let sit 30 then folded again and let it sit in fridge for about 23 hours shouldve been 15
looks delicious for real
looks pretty decent if theres not much flavor i suggest adding 50 more salt or even doubling it can we get a crumb shot    flavor ideas add 1 tbsp of caraway seeds when first mixing the ingredients afaik this is when all mixins go into the dough but someone correct me if im wrong    the dutch oven is suggested because the closed environment keeps the steam from the dough escaping and that enhances the maillard reaction in the crust making it crispier and flakier its quite worth it imo
  also an interesting idea next time you drink a nice beer like a belgian or trappist save the dregs in the bottom of the bottle  sub 1/2 of the yeast with this gives it a nice beery flavor and different breweries often use their own particular strains of yeast starter so you will get a different flavor with each beer
  i use milk instead of water and the fucker is way softer
  whats a nondairy alternative to milk
  i homebrew and bake bread but i never thought of using that layer of yeast in the bottom of my bottles for baking bread im going to try this thx for the idea
looks good but no reason to leave it in the fridge itll just dry out faster that way
  looks ok i would have substituted five instead of four though
  water
  ive done something like this before you can also add in some of the grains from brewing into the dough as well for an added crunch and flavor factor
  i just freestyling sometimes add chopped black olives or sundried tomatoes or sunflowerseeds grated carrots or onions  you know there arent really any rules just make make sure it got time to rise
  want to be cool and hip and make my own bread  dont have an oven just a shit electric skillet  is there someting i can bake in a skillet
  flat bread
  yeast  stopped reading there
  thanks
  i have never made my own bread but i should all store bread has milk in it and i cant eat that sht
  this meat is murder
  not bad op tons of recipes use weighted measurements instead of volume because its way more accurate     absolutely look into getting a dutch oven because it will drastically improve your breads to compensate if you dont want to buy one preheat a cast iron skillet on a rack underneath where your baking sheet will go then pour some boiling water into it when you put the bread in
  update it is very good      op try adding in a few tsp of herbs or spices that you like  caraway seeds sunflower seeds soaked flax seeds also try using different flours  its incredible how much flavor fresh whole wheat flours can add to breads
    why did i laugh to that
did they really stop making the patrician chex mix flavor
first post
11556842  11556842  the second post my dudes
  that would be the chex mix bold party blend msir
  no you forgot about the bold flavor
hate him all you want hes out there having the time of his life while youre stuck in a 9 to 5
but how many people had to lose their lives for his enjoyment was it really worth it
we all watch his show which is why we love to hate him
  i dont hate him or most food reviewersaside from when abroad in japan does a food review that guy has literally some of the shittiest videos what i hate is the fanbase that surrounds food reviewers for all real things    hey anon you travel right how was x i saw a video on it and it looked so yummy  wait you went to x and didnt get y man whats the point of even going you missed out  oh man i hear x is amazing what do you mean ya didnt like it    every time i come back state side said i had something and it wasnt as good as youtube reviewer whatever said about it then they fail to believe it
literally who and no im not
  hes enjoying his life now but in the afterlife the souls of those kids will torment him for all eternity
good morning /ck/ i hope youre having an amazing day this is mark wiens and right now im inside your moms skin i killed her with a hammer blow to the back of the head skinned her tanned her hide to make a raincoat and cooked her meat in a delicious eastern thai curry    hwoooowww look at how tender the meat is its literally falling off the bone
im watching his latest pakistan video and i cant help but wonder how many of the younger boys in the video have been gangraped in a mini bus
  isnt there a thing in their culture where a young boy is designated as the village sexual emergency reliever
  stateside  kys
these threads need to be banned
i just hate that he never leaves asia southeast asia is fucking boring why do all these travel fags all live in sea
  jokes on you im unemployed
  does thinking about that arouse you
  sexual emergency reliever
its ok
just started working here as a grill cook ama
  how much of the food is microwaved whats the rundown on the steaks does the soup come premade
  foods that arent microwaved or deep fried are grilled chicken steaks kind of hasbrowns sausage links burgers flounder bacon salmon sausage patties and anything egg related everything else is thrown in the microwave    the steaks are frozen sirloin    the soups are premade i believe kp deals with stuff like that so im not completely sure
  how many of those foods are frozen
  almost all of the food is frozen when we get it of course its cooked dethawed unless its something that absolutely needs to be cooked from frozen like chicken tenders burgers etc
  burgers  absolutely need to be cooked from frozen
  i mean in the way that the job makes us cook it from frozen
  unless its something that absolutely needs to be cooked from frozen like chicken tenders burgers etc  absolutely needs to be cooked from frozen like chicken tenders burgers etc   burgers
  so if i wanted something that was never frozen microwaved or deep fried what would i order
also as someone who works behind there things i would avoid ordering  pot roast  mac and cheese  meat loaf  anything with turkey    they arent exactly bad but they are a rip off for not only the amount you really get but its just thrown into a microwave
  sausage patties  bacon  sausage links   sandwiches  pretty much any side that isnt french fries home fries or mush      not my fault the burgers are cooked from frozen if youve had bubba burgers thats essentially what we have back there
  and of course eggs pancakes/waffles hash browns
u at work now are we taking flat top griddle or gas grill
    so im better off just going to a local diner where those breakfast foods are going to be much cheaper
even though i work there i havent tried the mush yet anybody know if its worth using my bob evans good boy points on some
  definitely i have gone to diners since i started working there and have noticed they have much better fresh food i would recommend any local place over bob evans
  i am not its stainless steel griddles shit is hot though feels unsafe to cook at times as we are just given thin gloves that arent heatresistant so if your finger even as so much grazes it you better be running to get some ice
  theyre probably selling/serving the exact same shit from the exact same distributor
  not the places i have observed at least fried chicken and burgers seem to be much better at the smaller nonchain diners ive been going to    there is a surprising amount of stuff that just looks grocerystore bought back in our fridge too
are you a basketball american
  holy shit grow some skin the more hot stuff you touch the easier it is how many stations do you have can you run the kitchen by yourself tell me exactly how bob makes you dress a burger
  why would you subject yourself to busting your ass slinging sysco pig slop into troughs for shit wages and benefits when decent companies paying more with better benefits for less work effort are hiring anyone that stumbles in off the street nowadays seems masochistic
  its the only place in my area that would take me and was the highest pay for an entrylevel job i didnt want to work in fast food and all the retail stores were looking for people with more experience which sucks because i would love to work in retail    needed a job asap though so bob evans it was     its an awful and depressing job hours are shitty pay is alright but by the time youve made the 50th hashbrown that day and have a cogrill cook who doesnt know how to communicate and only worries about what hes doing you really start to wonder if its worth it
   i would love to work in retail  oh sweet summer child
  bbut muh new maga factories ok
  why the fuck nobody in your restaurant knows what a serviette is
  dude the servers there bitch at me everyday because they cant tell the difference between beef gravy and chicken gravy
  whats bob like
  pretty evan keeled
  dethawed  where are you from
this thread highlights the reason why i cook all my own breakfasts buttermilk pancakes from scratch are just plain better anyway
  how is life down on the farm
  i was just thinking this
  i visited cleveland last month and heard this was the goto spot for breakfast 30 minute wait time but it was fucking worth it
david chang was with american express on instagram we should start tweeting at him pictures of him as marco and the american express lady as a stock pot
it just makes more sense than stock to use knorr stockpot it takes less effort has a longer shelf life and just tastes better
imagine actually liking this dogshit it tastes like vomit
its disgusting like all american chocolate
ameriblubbers are addicted to the vomitous taste of butyric acid
i like it no one is making you eat it im sure your country eats actual shit as a delicacy
  thats probably a step up from eating imitation shit
  why are you so angry about hersheys eat your dutch chocolate
  im not dutch and im not mad its just gross simply stating facts
  ok i think your attitude and obsession with american products you dont have to buy is a sign of mental health or personal issues i say dutch chocolate because its considered the best
  obsession  i think youre confusing my boredom and disdain for one product as something else  you sound like a paranoid faggot
  of course i would because i dont know your intentions idiot you seem like a narcissist faggot
  if you dont know my intentions maybe you shouldnt make wild accusations  you seem like a narcissist faggot  im not a faggot madboi
  i used to be ashamed my country bombed third world shitholes you live in but now i understand why they do it
  lol u so mad  also my country is first world and has a long standing alliance with your country
  what country israel
  cookies and cream flavour is good
  no i said alliance
  i can imagine having a stronger reaction if this was really overpriced or something    but its cheap    good chocolate probably not    american icon absolutley    dude its just chocolate    chill
  britain theyre not much better than israel
  wrong again
  just tell me the country fucktard so i can criticize it
  this is why we consider europe a country because you guys like to pretend its one and hide behind the label as a shield of criticism
  its not european either
  you must be really ashamed of your country whichever it is
  nah like i said im bored and fucking with you allows me to just stretch out my boredom this isnt even my thread
  only boring people get bored
  and no doubt youre being butthurt in this thread because your life is so enthralling
well it doesnt taste like vomit but it doesnt taste like chocolate either its just a sugar bar basically     very dull very unsatisfying
  dutch chocolate i was under the impression swiss and german chocolate was considered the best dutch chocolate is fine though
  and then the two massive faggots finally got a room and fucked the end
  thats a terrible ending needs a twist
  a poo in the loo showed up and tried to be funny but failed   the end
  terrible
    can we talk about chocolate thats actually good instead eg made without shittier ingredients like soi lecithin
  can you
so do you people also complain that butter and parmesan cheese taste like vomit
the only good hersheys bars that actually exist are cookies n creme and gold thats mostly it
  its not my favorite chocolate or anything but its not terrible ive never tasted the vomit or anything the only time i usually eat them is when im making smores though
  not really the butyric acid works ok in those foods as the taste is expected there its not expected in chocolate
  it tastes like vomit  i feel so bad for people with inferior taste buds
  me too but sadly there are still a lot of fucks buying herseys so the brand still exists    thankfully there exist plenty of alternatives which taste good
  i feel so bad for you too anon i cant even imagine having such lackluster genes you hate cilantro too right
  based
  t american in full damage control mode  enjoy your vomit chocolate pleb
  its swiss and belgian
hur dur ameriblubber  go cry about pol
yuropoors are too used to eating dirt based foods their tastebuds get shocked by actual flavor
      and you wonder why yuros hate us so much
why would they need ten thousand hours to cook
  btw im gay not sure if that matters
  you not me
i tried a few of them its funny i thought i surely had tried chestnuts at some point in my life but the taste is not nearly what i expected which i guess explains why i always seem to find myself feeling confused when i try something thats supposed to have chestnut in it    any way what do you like to do with chestnuts
  i didnt like them too much just roasted by the way they seemed dry or something but the unique qualities of their flavour is interesting to me
  worst thread ive made today
  boil em
  mont blanc and chestnut gnocchi or dumplings are good but those use the flour not the nut
  but the taste is not nearly what i expected  yeah because theyre anti nuts theyre full of starch have almost no fat and by some wacky twist of nature have vitamin c in them theyre fucking weird but very tasty
  i seem to remember reading dickens when he describes bong victorian feasts that they made a chestnut dressing for roast goose
at a family reunion  grandma gives me a non stick pan because i like to cook so much  chuckle to myself and tell her that nonsticks are not good they cant sear and give you cancer suggest her to replace her pans with cast iron thank her anyway and take the pan home  my husband is waiting for me and laughs at the pan  try to sear a steak in it for shits and giggles  to my surprise the steak actually sears pretty nicely almost comparable to my cast iron repertoire  no fumes or anything weird coming out of it even at high heat   feel like a dick for being mean to grandma  welp i guess this is what you call getting memed
  tldr shitpost thread
  absolutely seething nonstick fag btfo in every other thread had to make another in a vain attempt to salvage a small piece of his pride sad
  zoomers cant read
husband  show tits or dick
  husband
  i can tell fluoroethane by smell    it fumed my guy im sorry but you shouldnt have been mean to your grandma anyway
  use fewer buzzwords next time you post maybe the adults will take you seriously next time just a tip
why would you ever correct your grandma thats so mean
also my parakeet died today guess it was just his time keep a good thought in your head for him
i may just be a fat fuck but this was really good
first post
  hes fast
  fat fucks like you usually love sugar so i dont doubt you inhaled that thing hope you choke to death on your next one
  ok this is epic
  not anymore
where were u when the buntube did zoomed
  my grandma is my dad
  fuck you
  seriously though  huh
  fuck you
whats the tastiest and simpler way to prepare bone broth
  bake on a baking sheet with aromatics on a low heat for about an hour or 90 minutes  then transfer everything to a dutch oven or heavy stock pot cover with water and simmer for as long as you care to if theres still some marrow left in your bones after youre done freeze them for use another time
    8 lbs bones and meaty scraps  1 lb mirepoix  optional step roast if you want brown stock  simmer gently until done    times 45 min to an hour for fish 3 hours for poultry or pork 12 hours for beef  those times can be cut to 1/3 if you use a pressure cooker instead of a normal pot
  fucking insane i see bones being sold for 45 like that its garbage scraps fucking meme diets why the fuck are brusselsprouts 3/lb
boil a large pot of water  toss the bones in  once it foams up and you get a lot of scum on the top fish the bones out  throw away the water  let bones dry  roast them in an oven  dump them with any drippings in the clean stock pot  add cold water  maybe some onion garlic or peppercorns  dont go too crazy with veggies or spices  simmer for a long ass time  skim foam off top as you simmer  no the simplest but this is how its done
  throw away the water  yikes
  you do throw away the water that you blanch the bones in thats the whole point even if youre not roasting the bones blanch discard shitty water start with new and simmer
  based clarification poster
bone broth  please put a trigger warning before using that term
  do i have to skim the fat
  why the fuck are brusselsprouts 3/lb  have you seen how sprouts grow also 3/lb isnt a bad price theres plenty of 99/lb veg selection for povertyfags      whats the point of blanching ive never done it
  they didnt used to be 3/lb you fat loser
  you dont have to but i fail to see why youd want to skip that step
  inflation exists  sorry to burst your bubble but the price of everything will inevitably go up throughout your lifetime dumb shit  i pay 250 for a pound bag of sprouts anyway sucks to be you
  whats the point of blanching  gets rid of a lot of nasty scummy crap and fats that would otherwise emulsify into your broth
  kill yourself
  fat is great does bone broth fat taste bad or something
  doesnt taste bad but generally you dont want a thick layer of fat floating on your broth
  bone broth  hahahah
  fat is great  not for most of the things that people use stock for
    just remove that afterwards
  live in the netherlands   have always eaten sprouts  suddenly burgers want them  can buy them for close to 1 euro a kg in the winter now  thanks burgers
  its garbage scraps fucking meme diets  i remember when the hipsters were all raving over lingua tacos and all the mexicans raged that they couldnt afford a fucking tongue anymore
  same with oxtail i used to make curry for like 3 now its 10 for 4 of them and barely any meat fucking buzzfeed or whoever starts this shit
  theres so many foods that no one cared about until recently that has made poverty tier meals the same price as a ribeye steak what will the next meme food be pork trotters
  i make my chicken stock from claws and its so far been pretty safe butcher told me im the only one who goes there for garbage like that

do people really eat raw onion or is it just a very bad meme    voluntarily eating raw onion that tastes bitter and harsh rather than eating amazing sauted or carmel iced onions    also it gives you a stinking fucking shit breath gross as fuck

  of the 3 main supermarket types the only one not to be eaten raw are yellow onions

not putting raw onion on your toastie
  wala
  enjoy those caramel iced onions mate  bone apple teeth
  never as is but as a topping for something like a sausage or a hamburger sure smoked herring with spicy mustard and raw onion is quite good
  this is what europoos consider food
  my dad is from eastern europe grew up behind the iron curtain he has always eaten onions like they were apples takes the paper off and bites right in i used to until a friend called me a weirdo
    i eat all of them raw i like raw onion best with peanut butter on toast
  that looks really good
  carmel iced  phone fag typo kind of works though try soaking the raw onions in ice water for half an hour i do this before i put them on my italians to mellow the harsher flavors so i can pile them on for more crunch
  why would you put the greens on the outside as opposed to the cheese
  i like raw onions and sandwiches they provide much better flavor and crunch than useless lettuce     why do i keep seeing people post about raw onions
  this is the only answer to adress the problems with using raw onions
  the thinner you slice or the smaller you mince an onion the milder itll be it helps to have a sharp knife thick slices of raw onion will seem a lot harsher because of the chemical produced when the cell walls get damaged but if you damage more of the cell walls by slicing it more thinly itll seem milder even if youre eating the same amount ive gotten people who said they dont like raw onion to enjoy it by just preparing them properly
what do onions taste like
  one 1 tiny sample study by a rinky dink university in iran published in a journal so little known it doesnt even have an impact factor rating  result hasnt been replicated since  gymcels with zero knowledge about how scientific publication or experiment verifiability works eat it up  gymcels literally drinking raw onion juice    its like the biggest prank iran has played on the whole western world

there are many different kinds of onions  sweet and red are nice  i use ringlets of either as gamerfood sometimes i prepare some savory garlic oil and use it as a dip
  carmel iced  what language is this
  do people really eat raw onion   anyone who has had a hamburger from mcdonalds  so yes
  tard speak
  or just buy decent onions like a civilized person
  bitter and harsh  what are sweet onions like vidalia
  you might want to think twice before stepping to someone you dont know like this it could bite you seriously in the ass one day
smart way
  gay choices
  wrong fucking quote meant for   
  every onion ive tasted is sweet and you are a pleb the whole fucking point of caramelizing onions is to get the sweetness out onto the other ingredients
  i use based vidalias and still do this
  pungent spicy sweet vegetal a bit sulphurous its hard to describe  like garlic mellowed out a bit with different high notes
  pleb
  to be fair the level of isoflavonoids in soy dwarfs almost everything else by orders of magnitude
  and literally nothing edible contains more isoflavonoids than soy to add
   the more you cut onion/garlic the more allicin you get hence it will taste stronger   if you want to mild the flavor you wash it or even better spray lemon juice on it
  i just dont care for the soft texture of cooked onions i like the crispness of raw
  you can eat raw onions all the time with indian food
  raw onion is delicious if used on hot dishes that enhance its flavour    why do you think that mexicans use diced onion with their tacos
complains like a woman  doesnt eat raw onions  figures
  there are many types of onion some are meant for cooking some are delicious raw raw onions are a great foil for many foods providing crunch and flavor mexican food wouldnt be the same without them for example
  i just ate a bunch on my sausage sandwich then i went into this nasty fatass wenches cubicle with a printout and leaned down pointing at something and exhaled a big puff of onion breath she recoiled as if a snake had struck at her
  real men eat onions no matter if they are cooked or raw unlike fags
  raw white onions with sharp cheddar and saltines is the patrician snack for drinking beer
    i love onions so fucking much     in denmark we have burger with three types of onions     roasted   caramelized    raw     it looks like shit but is fucking awesome literally translates to beef sandwich
raw onion goes great with some dark bread  salo
  id eat more onions and garlic if i werent so lazy to peel and dice them i literally avoid them because peeling takes forever probably 2 minutes
  great with fries should top that shit off with tzaziki
  remove australian
  onion that tastes bitter and harsh  onion  bitter    buy higher quality produce onions shouldnt be bitter spicy and hot sure but not bitter
  that looks pretty awesome
  how does one eat a burger this big surely cutting it in smaller pieces with a knife and eating it bit by bit defeats the essence of a burger fucking hell
garlic and onions are the only vegetables that i can eat raw
  cut them let them soak in lime juice eat shits are good
  the only raw onion that i dont too harsh to eat raw in great quantities is red onion maybe if its finely chopped but large slices have a very strong flavor
  sounds gross desu
my grandfather used to love eating slices of raw white onion on a hot piece of bread i miss him bros _
  says the closet homo kek

caramelized onion is like limp dick dipped in sugar which is also incidentally ops favorite snack
    the ploughmans lunch delish
you put it on top of things like smoked salmon or beef tartar
  what kind of onions eating some sweet varieties of onion like that wouldnt be weird at all white onions might be a little unnerving but it is no different than eating a whole carrot
  sounds pretty good desu its basically how i dress my salads except i use red wine vinegar and olive oil

how to cook liver    my grandma used to make it for me and i want some now but im not sure how to cook it
    hot pan  butter  sliced up onions  start the onions in hot pan with butter some salt  have liver sliced thin lightly saltpepper  onions getting soft push to side of pan  put liver on hot pan in the butteryonion goodness  liver cooks fast like about 5 minutes or less turn it over mid way  plate the liver top it with the onions    not a lot to fuckup liver is a simple meat to cook
  this is correct  you can fuck it up though by overcooking it dont do that
  wrapped in caul fat and grilled over charcoal add a squeeze of lemon and eat it hot
  dont forget to soak it in milk or buttermilk overnight
  bump
  no need same can be achieved in salted water takes away some of that gamey taste and smell if you cant handle that
so the insides always have this specific strong taste is there a way to make them paletable for people who dislike it
  remove the strong meaty taste  remove the main reason people eat liver in the first place  tell them to grow the fuck up and get over their childish palette
  palette  kek you fucking retard
  pate plenty of recipes say to use chicken liver but beef liver works just the same      i slice them very thin while the liver is still frozen and just steam them with my hearty vegetables such as broccoli i guess im fortunate that i enjoy the taste of healthy foods like liver onions garlic broccoli spinach and sardines while some cant stand them it gave me a huge head start in my journey to get fit still no gf though
  drown in alcohol for 15 years remove from body cook eat die
  kek nice anon
  what do you do with the milk afterwards  seems like a waste of milk
  make chocolate milk
  fellow /fit/ bro here also im op    liver is very cheap in my country like 200 for 500g i think  want to have a cheap bulking meat because im a student but im fussy
cook it liver is european sushi serve thinly sliced with rye bead and vodka
would a cirrhosis liver taste better than a healthy one
  fuck off bogdan the white men are talking
    thats right kid where do you think this stuff comes from
  slowly fry in some olive oil thinly chopped onions when transparent make some room for the liver brown it a bit on one side drop a bit of white wine or in desperate cases some white wine vinegar if you want a stronger taste flip it and make the liquid evaporate  enjoy it with some toasted baguette or some toscano
my bar fridge crapped out last night how long will food last unrefrigerated before it goes bad there were some various veggies in there but im mostly worried about the pasta sauce i made last night and put a lot of effort into it was probably in that fridge for about 7 hours before i woke up and transferred it to my main refrigerator god damn that thing i knew it wasnt working but i was drunk last night and didnt think much of it
  7 hours  thats too long senpai you better toss it for your own good
  i might toss the vegetables because i need to go grocery shopping anyway but i will take my chances with the sauce
vegetables are usually good for up to a week but that really depends on what youre soring leafy greens will lose a lot of moisture and will taste shitty after two days if you store potatoes or onions in a dark place they can last you up to two weeks before they sprout then you have about one week left  unless you cant repair the fridge within a week the only stuff you should worry about are fresh meat fish and milk if that goes warm it has to be consumed within 24 hrs or youll have a really bad time
  hope its not an lg its been 12 days since my primary fridge still under warranty crapped out and im still waiting on fucking service i may have to turn them into the state attorney general for consumer fraud for not upholding their warranty contract
  ill counter sue you for slanderv
  if its above 41 its already ruined
go to chinese buffet  im the only white person in the restaurant and its packed wall to wall with mexicans and blacks  where do white people eat these days
your local gentrified artisan avocado shop
  white people eat in their cars on the way to and from work
white people dont exist
  poor white people eat where you eat rich white people eat dorcias
go to chinese buffet   its american or fujianese garbage   no chinese customers or servers
  you do know all chinks are sleeper agents for the zerg working to destroy america from within right
  in the cuck shed
  chinks arent working for israel you silly boy
    praise kek brothers lets spread the redpill on /ck/
  go to chinese buffet  theres chicken feet in a steam tray and old gonggongs at all the tables
  this i saw a guy eating a bowl of cereal in his car a fucking bowl of cereal we were going like 60 mph
  its impossible to get a reservation there though
  dorcias  yeah okay try getting a reservation there
    apparently not at all you can eat chinese buffets
  they eat at local nonfranchise places where the cheapest entree on the menu costs like 15 usually located downtown or in the nicer parts of town
the cracker barrel
  white people never ate at chinese buffets other than in deep flyover land where its nothing but white people
  packed wall to wall with mexicans and blacks  proof youre on the wrong side of town  go to white neighborhoods if you want to be with white folks  also dont go to all you can eat buffets they attract the white trash wagecucks and theyre worse than the nignogs and beaners
  probably says more about your neighborhood than the restaurant i have never been in a restaurant where black people made the majority and only so with mexicans at mexican restaurants in mexican neighborhoods
  i havent eaten food that wasnt prepared at home since the blm shit kicked off all whites get loogies or worse in their food and drinks
go to chinese restaurant  everything is delicious and the aunties know me by name   feelsgoodman
does anyone else order in pizza and when it arrives put it in the preheated oven for another 5 minutes
sneed
well yes obviously
no   have you ever gone to a sitdown pizza restaurant and had the pizza served fresh you have to wait a couple minutes anyways the cheese needs to cool a little so it doesnt burn your fucking mouth off and also so it can congeal and be cut without getting yanked off the pizza  the 1015 minutes you have to wait for your pizza to get delivered helps it more than you think
pizza is piping hot when it arrives though
  well you are very wrong
  no its always hot enough when i get it
  my dominos/pizza hut pizza is never cooked fully so i usually do this
  i use the broiler to toast the cheese when i cook at home but ive net tried this with a delivery pizza if youre going to cook it yourself then why didnt you just start with a takeandbake  i love toasted cheese its always annoyed me that this is not a standard option to choose from at pretty much every pizza place it should be like a topping even if it costs another dollar
i have nothing to contribute to this thread except a dumb ass opinion cowabunga dudes
yes they always arrive at room temperature so i have to give it a bishbashbosh in the oven for 5 minutes or so
  kino
  ps im gay too if that matters
yes it sneeds to be chucked in the oven because then it is piping hot formerly lukewarm
  yeah because i live 5min walking distance from dominoes but it always arrives after 4580min and cold and i sometimes get a free pizza if i complain
  if thats what youre seeing ok rorschach
  put it in the preheated oven for another 5 minutes    nah just stack the slices on a plate and microwave it for a minute or two
  untrue
go to little ceasars  order pepperoni  they dont have any made  dont worry well make you a fresh one  leave  for whatever reason their pizza tastes better the older it is
  stack the slices  microwave  they stick to each other  bad form noob
  no because im not autistic
yes or it will be cold
  caesars
usually but sometimes it arrives warm enough and i just tolerate it
no because i order carryout so i dont have to tip some nerd or spend over 10
  actually you were revealed as the noob by falling for this bait  and even worse you wont understand your mistakes
  i actually order pizzas and tell them to not cook it and just take the ready to cook dominoes or papa johns pizza and cook it at home
  this was an option  doubt it due too food safety laws they generally dont sell raw food
  ive never seen that before are you sure you arent lying
  i just make my own now its really not that hard its even easier if you make batches of pizza dough at a time so you can freeze it to thaw later use a cast iron skillet and set your oven to about 450 with the pan in there then when youre done putting toppings on it you just drop it into the pan and shove it back into the oven takes around 5 minutes to cook making your own also saves a lot of money and you can have your pizza how you really want it i live in a small town and nobody here makes italian style pizzas with olive oil or a lot of fresh basil or anything like that
  some pizza places do this especially if they bake pizzas at gas stations ebt people often do this because if it isnt cooked the cashier can ring it up as cold serve and they can use their government bucks to buy pizza they do this with milkshakes too they ring the cup of shake up as cold serve meaning you take it home to prepare it but they have a machine right there to whip it up its pretty bad
  omfg poor people should eat only rice and beans god forbid theyre able to occasionally treat themselves to a slice of shitty gas station pizza and ice cream  eh lockheed martin heres a few hundred billion in tax money were not forgetting you hfcs and soybean growers either heres your 100 billion dont forget me next election cycle wink wink
  gesundheit
  its not bait to be retarded
  get a job poorfag or are you expecting somebody to pay for your diabeetus and muh pain pills because you buy bullshit food with other peoples money anybody who sees you swipe an ebt card thinks you are a garbage waste of a human being and probably wishes you would just die already
  being this much of a corporate overlord cumpuppet  the absolute state of you
  i do
  so this is how you live with yourself you invent all these stories about how the person you are stealing from is actually in the wrong this is why nobody likes you or how you vote
  billy bob sally sue and her niglet child and shaneeka getting a few hundred/month is stealing megacorporations receiving hundreds of billions in subsidies and overinflated contracts and funnelling kickbacks to the politicians who allocated it to them is perfectly proper and good  lets not forget israel receiving their annual stipend of 100 billion either  ill bet youre the kind of guy who cheers when some kid gets shot in the back for stealing a candy bar and wall street tycoons walk scot free after fleecing the public out of billions
  oh youre a commie that explains everything
  found the person thats never sat down at a pizza place
  ill bet youre the kind of guy who cheers when some kid gets shot in the back for stealing a candy bar  lemme know when that actually happens
  no but i live in a fairly populated are so all the pizza places are right by my house it always arrives hot hell the place i order from 9 times out of 10 is literally down the street i only get delivery because im lazy
yes with a toaster oven    not only is it piping hot on my plate but it allows be to just start to brown the cheese which brings it to max flavour also i can add hot sauce to my pizza without cooling it down
  secret nigger trick    if you order dominos delivery immediately call the place after it was delivered and tell them they forgot something on it they will send you another pizza for free
not bait im just a fucking weirdo when i get pizza delivered i immediately throw it in the freezer for 20 min to get it super cold cant stand hot pizza
whats your favourite spam recipe /ck/ mines unironically spam with rice and scrambled eggs for breakfast obviously
  musubi eating spam makes me feel really sick now that im older but i used to like musubi a lot
  spam with rice and scrambled eggs for breakfast obviously  this cant go wrong with a classic i like mine with tabasco sauce even though spam is already pretty salty
spam fried rice usually with carrots and onions and maybe peas and eggs of course
wtf is a chicken bake
the finest item on costcos menu
some totally gay shit
    fpbp
  its delicious thats what it is  combo peetzer is great too  cant beat the dawg and drank for a buck fiddy  brisket sammich is aight not 499 aight but aight  turkey provolone sammich is good  aint never had the chicken caesar salad  recently had their burger its aight not a fan of double meat though  aint going anywhere near that fake tofu carnita shit they have
  just buy it trust me
  pricing is about onpar with higher quality foods of the same types  placement makes people think its cheap stuff for really cheap  reminder that 90 of frozen prepared foods involve false advertising to some degree
  removed the polish dog  costco is fucking dead to me
  flyover wa la    never been to a costco its just a walmart with their own foodcourt though right
  its just a walmart with their own foodcourt though right  theyre a warehouse place where you buy in volume the walmart version is called sams club
this is personal experience and quite dated as costco has removed the chicken bake from the menu in my local area the chicken bake is a large baked garlic and cheese dough filled with white chicken meat garlic sauce and mozzarella cheese i cant remember if there are any vegetables within or if the chicken bake is actually deep fried but one thing i remember is the indigestion you would get due to the metric assload of oil contained within very delicious though
  flyover wa la  picture taken in california
  the best combo is hot dogdrink and a slice of pizza fills me up for the entire day
was waaaaay better when it had green onions in it really brightened up the flavor    now its just a mushy chicken alfredo in some bread get a slice of pizza instead
  its literally just a fucking hot pocket kid
chicken bake is amazing
  jesus christ im retching at the thought of eating food at a costco
slices a pepperoni and hot dog master order
  the most delicious item on that menu
  more for everyone else
    its at least a tier above hotpockets
  better with hot sauce in the chicken bake hot sauce also good on pizza sandwiches and salad
  christ look at the body morphs of those folk paying particular attention to the blue jean lady ass in the lower right
  like a cheese/veggie stuffed chicken breast except its not chicken breast but whitemeat chicken mishmash   i hope this was enlightening
  the cheese is the kind of cheese that is absolutely not gourmet cheese it has the kind of flavor that tastes like there is something missing but you think about how it contributes to obesity and then you realize no theres enough in there already but the hot sauce i use sriracha or secret aardvark if i ever eat any costco food
theres regional variation i knew the canadian ones had poutine but i thought the sausages were universal
my om would always take me at close to 4 so id get a churro and a berry slushie thing so i wouldnt ruin my appetite
the bakes you buy from the frozen section are superior to the food court versions at least they were the last time i purchased them
  no you have to buy a subscription before you can go through the doors walmart lets anybody in
  its a big hot pocket best item on the costco menu
  i actually really like the bbq brisket sandwich
  you can access the food court if it isnt part of the main warehouse the one near me has its own separate building while in another county has it in the warehouse near the cashiers
    he has never had al pastor pizza    fucking scrubs    pastorshrimpbakcanolichickenbake
anyone try it yet i fucking loved this thing back in the day guy but looks like they tweaked it a bit since last time it was available  now looks like it has some sort of mini onion rings like that the smokehouse burger different bun too    
  oh look more absolute garbage on /ck/ imagine that    kys you piece of trash shilling faggot    nobody should eat that utter shit
there was a period back in like 201617 where if you had the mcdonalds app you could get a free artisan sandwich with any purchase so if you felt up to some kikery you could buy a cookie and then get a sandwich for around a dollar theyve stopped offering that coupon though to my knowledge i think this mushroom swiss one was on the artisan menu but i never got it
  you sound a lil cranky go get a milkshake and some mcdonalds apple pies
  hey guys here in my car again for another food review make sure to like comment and subscribe well anyway ttoday we have a longtime favorite of mine the mcdonalds mushroom swiss sso first impressions are it looks really cool guys they updated it aand added mini onion rings too the bun is different though time for a taste test mmm it tastes ppretty good guys im gonna give it 5 stars out of 5 head into your local mmcdonalds and buy a mmushroom swiss burger its good be sure to check out my blog
  ill wait for reviewbrahs report of the week food review before i take the deep dive
  get back to me when they resurrect wendys bacon mushroom melt
  theres a chicken variant as well fyi  
everytime you call fake emmentaler cheese swiss a mountain nazi cringes
  good call
  fast food  mushrooms  no thank you
  mcdonalds mushroom and swiss was garbage i cant imagine it being much better this time around   nothing can beat the mushroom and swiss from hardees
  bout time they added a new burger to their lineup   i like how theyre still trying to push that terrible bacon smokehouse burger who the fuck even likes that thing
  hardees/carls jr has gone down hill in recent years their new buns on all their burgers suck shit the original guac/texas guac burger was decent new one has chipotle and a sweet bun just fucks up the flavor
  im waiting on joeys review see how many woowoowoos it gets
  utter
  you couldve had a v8
  this
  i work with them and everytime someone opens the tray of them the kitchen floods with their smell  it makes me naseous as fuck mcrib sauce smelled like it would kill brain cells  so i guess i prefer the mushroom
  nothing can beat the mushroom and swiss from hardees  you mean culvers
  tell us more about what its like inside a mcdonalds kitchen    also is it possible to order a milkshake but not have them put the vanilla/chocolate/strawberry syrup in so its just pure soft serve ice cream in a shake sized container
  culvers  no i mean hardees we dont have that flyover garbage here
  how often do you flyover north carolina
thoughts on restaurants dedicated solely to cereal
  isnt it illegal to sell cereal like this similar to how its illegal to play a movie you purchased in a public setting
  thought about doing this as a kid didnt think such places actually existed where is this place op
  paying 50 markup for something thats not even fresh    the only thing that would make it worthwhile is if you got to milk a titcow waitress with giant milkers
theyre for soyboys
  fun for kids i guess       i dont think eating a bowl of cereal is any different than getting an ice cream or whatever
  eating a bowl of cereal in a restaurant catered to numales who have been babied all their lives is different than eating it at home
  paying for people to pour stuff into a bowl for you  why not just buy the cereal yourself online
  nobody eats the cereal in a restaurant right i thought it was like you grab a quick bowl to walk around the street with like youd get an ice cream cone
  walk around eating a bowl of cereal  do americans really
  why wouldnt you just buy the cereal from a grocery store or have it delivered through amazon
  you should be just as embarrassed to eat it at home
  has to be owned by a flaming fag
  fucking hipsters and bugmen theres one of these in my town as well as a fucking actual wizarding shop and a shop that sells nothing but rubber ducks  come come nuclear bomb
  which portland do you live in maine or oregon
  nice to see someone servicing the autistic community
  yes
  when your parents have 500000 to waste
  yes because eating baked chicken tendies in the darkness of your parents basement is the peak of manhood and independence
  eating a shitty frozen meal by yourself is peak masculinity just add your liquor of choice
  based and redpilled
  would this be actually legal
white nonsense
  when i was in college you could get small boxes of cereal for free in the union
  if i were to guess   boston or nyc
  wow what an amazing idea there couldnt possibly be a cost effective way to have this many different kinds of cereal at home
  those arent really cost effective
how does /ck/ feel about culinary school
  we think its a jewish institution that brainwashes young kids into breeding out whiteness
expensive and when you are ready to finally get a job in a kitchen it is actually works against you because a great many chefs consider culinary students useless knowitalls
  for 90 of cooking jobs it isnt really necessary youll learn way more actually going out and working in kitchens the other 10 is only for really prestigious hotels/restaurants that wont hire anyone without a diploma and they do that mostly to weed out pretenders  what matters more than a piece of paper is your work ethic willingness to learn and a good reputation with former bosses
  what matters more than a piece of paper is your work ethic willingness to learn and a good reputation with former bosses    that sums up pretty much any trade
  holy fuck anon
  someone posts legitimate advice  uhhhh actually works that way woth everything bud still gotta do it  name five chefs that an american would know with a culinary degree
  i knew someone who did an 18 month program at cordon bleu and had 40000  60000 student loan debt because of it the degree allowed her to make 10/hour as a baker at places like panera bread
  chefs that an american would know  chef boyardee  ronald mcdonald  colonel sanders  wendy  the burger king    check  mate
  wtf are you on about the comment didnt say you did not have to have a degree it said that what matters most is your ability to learn work ethic attitude ect    it goes for wannabechefs to transmission lineman to car mechanics to crane operators schooling is nice but tis who you are that counts not the paper
  i wouldnt really trust a doctor that was like ive never been to medical school but ive got lots of on the job experience as an orderly
    dyslexia  the post
  56 detected
  i wouldnt really trust a doctor   you could have just stopped right there no need to qualify it
  doctor  a trade
  if you provide a service or product in exchange for compensation its a trade theres skilled trades and unskilled trades but theyre all trades
  my holistic crystal healer told me not to trust doctors
  i had a black gf when i was in school like fucking clockwork
take that as you will but every single culinary school grad ive ever met was an entitled cunt who thought he was in charge and didnt have half the work ethic he shouldve had in the kitchen
  if you want to be a cook just start as a dishwasher/prep and if you show youre not an idiot and try even slightly more than average youll move into pantry and then eventually line chef dont waste ur money going to culinary
is culinary school necessary to land more higher paying positions
  i accept whatever medicines my medfag dr sirini prinhavatisu prescribes because of course he doesnt get kickbacks from big pharma  good thing you dont live in the us
  but you dont live in the us anon
  necessary no helpful yes higherend hotels and establishments use it to weed out first round underqualified candidates but it wont guarantee you a job   a culinary school might even get you placement as an extern somewhere but its up to you to actually keep that position i used to work at hyatt and every spring we got a fresh crop of externs and most of them washed out before fall one guy got shit canned after a month because he threw a tantrum when chef told him to help the stewards plate salads for a banquet
you get paid shit in the food industry right its like a relatively easy to obtain job that pays slightly higher than minimum wage but thats all
  waiters in high end restaurants can make a ton of cash but thats pretty much it
  poverty wages for a diploma half as much as med school
  yeah pretty much if you go to work for a big corporate hotel or an upscale dining chain like palomino or daily grill youll get paid slightly better and you also get benefits that you would necessarily get an independent restaurant or a malltier chain but its not a career path you follow to make big bucks most people do it because they legitimately love cooking or theyre just kind of weirdo that cant keep 95 hours or play nice in an office  of the few friends i have still in the business most work at corporate hotels and only one has actually become a head chef the rest of us burned out on the line and went to do other things fuck my old sous chef is now an agricultural biologist
does the prestige of a culinary school really mean much what exactly do more selective positions look for
  its mostly about showing employers that youve at least been trained in the fundamentals of restaurant cooking you can either do that with a diploma or a really side resume with real world experience top tier fine dining restaurants will probably expect applicants to have gone to a famous culinary school because theyll expect you to know a lot of different techniques that they know are taught in said schools but real world experience and recommendations from established chefs will open a lot of doors too plenty of culinary grads wash out as soon they hit the real world because they cant handle the stress and the shitty hours
  do you have time to work at least parttime at a kitchen while attending culinary school
  depends on the culinary school and how intensive their program is
virtually all education is the same  80 or so of schools and programs are total garbage and a waste of money you can get more knowledge and work your way up faster on the job but there is that 20 that actually constitutes a good education when you find that 20 its totally elevating shit
  the only acceptable culinary schooling is in the military    based
  culinary school isnt even a year long
i took a catering class in high school and also home ec they were fun
im a cook   my head chefs been to culinary school my room mates are in culinary school   i have not    im a better cook by far   they just call things fancy french/ german names    coulis bitch its just pureed mango stfu    pic unrelated
  needed for food related proffesions  wont probably teach you something unique and/or unfindeable elsewere  good to have cooks learn to wash their damned hands 
  lel
i currently go to culinary school and it has gotten me jobs with aramark and disney which then lead to having a beefy fucking resume so its definitely not worthless    really depends on what you want out of the field
  im so diamonds that african warlords are vying for control of my pelvis
  get a fucking apprenticeship
  doctors  cooks  if a cook fucks up i get a hair in my pizza if a doctor fucks up i get undiagnosed cancer its a bit different
  the stakes are every bit as high anon a cook who fucks up can get a lot of people sick or even dead    but your conclusion is right for a different reason the body of knowledge required to be a safe cook is far far smaller and far far simpler than that required to be a doctor its not the consequences of a fuckup that are any different its the amount of learning required
  spoiler she looks like a dude irl
  its a dude
  id still smash
its fine if you come out actually knowing how to cook food but if you just come out cooking gaudy gastronomical bullshit then you should kys
  this is a guy with marfan syndrome isnt it
  culinary school isnt even a year long  what are you talking about mine was two years plus a summer
would you get much more out of a 4 year program over a 2 year one
  couldve invested in an established bakery for that money and learned on the job state
test post please ignore
  the type of people who attend them are so fucking lazy and stupid half the time like maybe 1/3rd are literal 20 year old highschool dropouts whose parents would kick them out if they didnt go to school but were too retarded to get into college the other 2/3rds genuinely want to be there but as others have said would be better off starting as a line/prep cook somewhere easy to get the workflow basics down before trying for a job in an actual kitchen

  holy fuck who the hell ever thought that chinese ever sounded good as a language japanese is objectively so much more easy to listen to jesus no wonder theyre the real master race of asia
worst thread ive seen in months
  master race of asia  got nuked twice
  this is a 10/10 loli in china  no wonder you fags are so obsessed with anime
  028  wow this like some romantic lady and the tramp shit
  do they have a restricted fov genuinely curious what about eyelashes
  meanwhile the rest of asia wasnt even worth nuking  thats how you know the japanese had something good because the americans had to come in and destroy it
is there a way to make air in a room have a taste i was thinking like wouldnt it be cool if you could make a room have a different flavor like when you walked in you tasted oranges or lemon or whatever wonder how that would work
its called smell
  taste is an extension of smell
  so exactly what he said then
have something spreading vapours with the oils from citrus fruits in it
aroma is easy taste is harder i cant imagine it would be very easy to make you taste the air on your tongue without you also feeling it on your skin and eyes and having some discomfort as a result and damaging the decor as well
  you may not like it but this is what peak /ck/ intelligence looks like
  is there a way to make air in a room have a taste  yeah i could brap in it
lets fucking end this debate now
  what debate theyre the same thing except one has rice
  cook your food stop being a dumb neanderthal
  retard alert
sashimi allows for a pure and refined 1 dimensional flavor profile while sushi can be more complex in flavor but usually not as intense and refined in any of its multiple dimensions as sashimi is in its singular dimension simply a matter of prefenrence
  hookworms butt worms tape worms and brain worms
  wrong
  theyre both disgusting end of debate
  untrue
  south bronx paradise baby
  tflyover boomer who once read an article on salmonella in 89 and has lived in fear ever since
sashimi without the shadow of a doubt  fat tuna/salmon are noble cuts and to ruin them with 4 times their volume of rice is utterly retarded      i order sashimi et keep a bowl of rice on the side which i dip into if and when i need more texture in the palate
  are you alerting us to yourself for not knowing that let me guess  durr actually sushi doesnt necessarily contain raw fish  wow great insight fuck off now
  being this angry about being wrong
  did the guy who got the big tapeworm early this year live in seattle disgusting
  all americans should eat more sushi then
  crude uncoocked fish is discusting
  its not wrong sashimi is sushi without rice nobody cares that you read on wikipedia how sushi doesnt have to include raw fish
  how long do you cook both of them
  incorrect
  big if true but likely isnt
  kek
  do your parents only let you use the internet on sundays
the best of both worlds
  hurr durr what is a freezer
  this  i like both nigiri and sashiminot a huge fan of maki for the most part but my preference is a nice chirashi bowl where i can exactly chose how much rice i want to either go with the fish or to cleanse my palette between different kinds of fish
sashimi
  huh
    nigiri
  50000 yen gaijin pig pay up
  false
  sashimi Âà∫Ë∫´  raw sliced fish  sushi ÂØøÂè∏  anything made with vinegared rice  jishoorg    it is wrong get rekt stupid incorrect faggot
  nigiri unless its thin sliced smoked salmon
  giant snake birthday cake large fries chocolate shake
both nigiri  sashimi are good fag rolls with creamcheese can die in a fire
  based early zoomer or late doomer
cathy prefers sashimi thats enough for me     
    yes homie yes
  sushi ÂØøÂè∏  anything made with vinegared rice  here you go    let me guess  durr actually sushi doesnt necessarily contain raw fish  wow great insight fuck off now
  kek
  sushi if i had to choose
  cheap  poke or sushi rolls  midquality  nigiri  high end sashimi    pretty easy dumbshits
  at least at the ultra high end in japan i believe nigiri is more highly regarded than sashimi as far as i understand
  sushi can be sashimi with rice but its the rice that makes it sushi not the sashimi
something not right with people who eat sashimi in america
  thats true but the quality of the fish is going to be same imo if im paying 100 for a meal for one i dont want any fillers like rice to interfere with the true flavor of the fish
  sashimi in seattle or california is going to be better than anything outside of asia
  pretty sure seattle and california are outside of asia anon
  looks like the waste bin at a fish processing site
  how many times are you going to make me repost this    let me guess  durr actually sushi doesnt necessarily contain raw fish  wow great insight fuck off now
  neanderthals were highly intelligent food cookers whose progeny became the white race we know and love today
  well actually in japan the rice is the main dish everything you eat is to flavor the bowl of rice hence the place settings in a japanese meal of many small dishes to accompany the rice why do you think gohan is the word for any kind of meal and also the word used for rice itself the original form of sushi was fish and rice left to ferment together as rice and salt were the main methods of preservation in ancient japan fish and rice go hand in hand historically its not always about consuming as much expensive meat portions as youre able sometimes people like balance why would the highest end sushi restaurants still insist on using rice if your argument was even close to being valid we would call them sashimi restaurants and only low end ones would serve rice but they dont because the rice is a neccecary and desired element of the meal sushi rice itself is a difficult component to master and if you have tasted it made well you wouldnt be complaining about it frankly if theres too much rice with your sushi it means get out of the mall food court and go to a real sushi restaurant sushi is my preference but i will eat both because there should be a good variety during the meal like order some of the appetizer dishes as well theyre meant to provide a varied experience i always start my meal of with beer and tempura or gyoza and am staying for a while like order one thing at a time to ensure freshness in conclusion dont you dare talk shit about rice
  lost
  why do you think gohan is the word for any kind of mea  wrong  gohan is the word for any kind of meal   wrong  the original form of sushi was fish and rice fermented together  wrong  these are the ramblings of a weeaboo whos only experience of japan is extremely bad anime
  oh sweetie
  wow great insight fuck off now
  based chirashi
  i ate raw jelly fish and stingray when i went to a sashimi resteraunt
  neaderthals became the jews they have crooked noses  cromagnon are the whites
  implying im not a fat ass that orders tons of both
  the original form of sushi was fish and rice fermented together  this is true though
  and how was it
  holy based
whats the most american thing youve ever eaten
two obese people in motor scooters at a walmart coming opposite directions down an aisle until they blocked each others path
  did you eat them      luther burger pretty good
    did you have fries with that xir
  cannibalism is illegal anon
  i was once at a baseball game and ordered a hamburger with something called shaq sauce on it
  luther burger  huey is ashamed of you
sugar that came with a sales tax and congressman
a mac and cheese burger at guy fieris bar in cancun airport
  huey is dead and never coming back
  a mexican girls pussy
  that pic  cringe
  ihop when i went to visit like 10 years ago ridiculous big portions
the first thing i ordered when i visited the us was a chili burger which i thought was just some regular spicy burger instead i got something like pic related but with more cheese     the server was hispanic and i didnt know how much i shouldve tipped    8/10 american experience imo
small town breakfast joint  order something called the mennonite special  2 16 inch blueberry pancakes 4 eggs 3 slices of bacon toast a sausage link glass of milk and a tiny cup of coffee  thought it was or not and  whole thing came on 3 plates  775
chicken fried steak with sausage gravy side of home fries with ketchup and tobasco a side of chicken tendy mini waffle sliders  a diet coke and virginia slims
  based chili cheese poster
  chocolate dipped bacon it was alright
  that much food  775  dont you english have wives even gregory zimmerman wouldnt pay such outrageous price
two frozen mini pizzas for buns 1/3lb burger bbq sauce    actually delicious but i felt faint after eating half i was maybe 17 at the time

  had to be pa only we have that gorgeous amish shit for cheap pic related 8 dollars for an all you can eat breakfast
    im dutch they dont sell wonderbread here i had to make do with local ingredients
  whatever feels food  that freudian slip  lmao
  mennonite communities also extend into central ny where the place was
  im from central tx so country cooking is super common and we used to go to this one place that made exceptional chicken fried steak when i was in hs i forget how big it was but you could get up to 36oz one on sundays that if you finished it all the sides price went down from like 17 to 5 bucks finished a number of those in hs but doubt i could anymore probably close to 5lbs of food over all    inb4 thats not a lot of food  from the fatties
  at the state fair its a competition every year to come up with the next hot culinary abomination it started with deep frird oreos then friend twinkwies fried candy bars then we got fried coke/kool aid fried butter sticks a burger with donuts for buns etc the most american one i had was the twinkie but it isnt as good as the friee milky way or fried oreo
  thats not a freudian slip
    sooo good
  that would be the dominos buffalo chicken pizza i had tuesday it was a moment of deep sadness
  yes it is  boogies fat so his subconscious would obviously associate food with sex
  deep fried oreos
are eggs vegetarian
broccoli eggs are
yes assuming theres no babby in them
  no but they are unfertilized so they would never be animals
yes but not vegan

  they do but its not as sour
  its an ancient idea/tradition to put coins on the eyes or under the tongue of the dead so they can pay the being that takes you to the other side or bribe someone trying to bother them on the way

i want to get lazy sunday drunk hit me up with your favorite bloody recipe    bonus points for using bacon
  the picture you posted looks like it meets the requirements see ya
  lazy sunday  spend 45 minutes cooking bacon and chopping garnishes to pretend youre a louche man about town  you cant just walk a couple blocks and go to the neighborhood brunch spot
  turn off lights  look in mirror  say bloody mary three times  get murdered by candyman  open the door  get on the floor  everbody do the dinosaur  garnish with what time does the narwhal bacon
  vodka bloody mix celery salt/pepper hot sauce beef stick pearl onion and some pickle juice there all the necessities
  i normally do but im mixing it up today
im drinkin a redeye right now ice beer clamato lime juice worchestershire tabasco ground pepper garnished with peperochinis
  that sounds good    ive got olives instead of pearl onions 
  ok this is epic
    i had a sensible chuckle
  for a caesar/bloody i do basically the same but add horseradish for garnish i like anything pickled pickles asparagus and blue cheese stuffed olives are great
bloody mary mix vodka pepper what the fuck is wrong with you if you like to be fancy add a celery stick or olive or something
    not too shabby
into a shaker add    1/2 oz fresh lemon juice strained  1/2 oz worcestershire sauce lea  perrins  2 oz 100 proof vodka smirnoff  2 oz tomato puree cento san marzano  2 dashes of tabasco sauce  pinch of salt  pinch of black pepper    fill 2/3 with ice cap shaker and roll from end to end to chilldilute without aeration    strain into tall 12 oz tumbler filled with 4 ice cubes top with freshly ground black pepper    fill a side bowl or plate with different varieties of pickled olives onions okra pickles peppers and a couple strips of bacon
fill a pint glass half full of ice add 2 1/2 shot of vodka use a spoon to add a few olives and two teaspoons of juice add a kosher dill and a teaspoon of juice a few dashes of hot sauce a dash of worcestershire add a bit of horseradish if you likei dont crack some pepper into the glass and a pinch of celery salt fill rest of glass with clamato shake dont stir
  if i had to make one it would be  can of v8  two shakes of worcestershire sauce  two shakes of tobasco sauce  salt  pepper  2oz vodka    dont know if thats right but im sure its a decent approximation

  get out  t yinzer
how should i deal with hairs in my deer meat that i am going to have ground up i have left it in there before hoping for the best but they are definitely noticeable in the finished product   i would like to rinse it off prior to grinding but not sure if the added moisture would screw up the quality of the meat especially after freezing/thawing  i also am not sure how to prevent them in the future as whenever i field dress a deer the hairs get all over the meat
just wash it off
  this cold tap and dab it dry with paper towels  its meat it doesnt dissolve in water
  have a nonretard handle the meat next time
  whenever i field dress a deer the hairs get all over the meat  how its not hard to skin it without chopping off fur wtf
  just be yourself
  id rinse it well and pat dry you could let it sit in the refrigerator for a day or so and it would dry even more one way to minimize it when field dressing and skinning is try to keep the sharp part of the blade pointed away from the meat even then there will still be some hair i always hose it down after skinning prior to quartering it out
  you can minimize it but no matter what some will be there
  t retard
  when you realize that deer that any old idiot skins gets mixed together at the processor not you anon but there are deer with literal shit and stomach contents when dumbasses get done cleaning them and if you take your meat to a processor they often throw many deer together when grinding
    dont want to do it if it wont have a chance to dry i was hoping that it wouldnt matter if its wet when ground sounds like i might be ok just to rinse it off   much of it is tiny fucking chunks what a pain to dab each one with a paper towel       it might have to do with me dragging them across the creek thinking thats enough to rinse it after dressing i should have rinsed it off netter before bringing it home    wouldnt have mattered the issue was in the field plus it costs about 70 usd to have it butchered also  they dont hang it for aging   you dont even get your ground back  defeats the purpose of harvesting your own meat
  never field dressed and skinned a deer in his life  ive done  20 and stand by my assertion now brush the cheetoh dust off your fingers scream up the basement stairs to get mom to heat up your tendies wipe the slobber off your lips and chin and fire off another devastating zinger
  dont feed the trolls man hes making it clear he has no fucking clue what hes talking about and hes just trying to get a rise out of you
  how should i deal with hairs in my deer meat that i am going to have ground up    isnt this an issue with whoever was responsible for skinning the deer not skinning it properly likely also not washing their hands after getting the skin down and then touching the meat letting hairs get on it from their hands    i can understand some hairs up near the start of the incisions to start pulling the skin off but after that there shouldnt be hairs unless they are being slobs about it and touching everything
  dont want to do it if it wont have a chance to dry i was hoping that it wouldnt matter if its wet when ground sounds like i might be ok just to rinse it off  much of it is tiny fucking chunks what a pain to dab each one with a paper towel  its meat not a sponge it doesnt absorb lots of water just because you give it a quick toss in cold water  if its small pieces i guess you might could sling it in some cheesecloth like you do with lettuce you know
  the issue was in the field  stop skinning and harvesting the meat on the ground take it home and hang it in a clean environment to skin and harvest the meat you should only be gutting it out in the field
  only 20 amateur in action
  quick going over with a butane torch will sort it
  ctrlf burn  ctrlf torch  this is how my dad did it took a propane torch to the carcass after skinning
  works well for those little feathery things that are left over after plucking a bird too  fire solves everything
  use one of those lint rollers the one that has the sticky peel off paper kind
europoor here id love to have your problem going hunting at least once sounds like itd be fun

    hey you bring the beer and the troops will bring the freedom
  i think something like 500k deer tags were sold in wisconsin so 500k whities armed to the tits drunk off their asses in the woods and no one gets killed you cant say that about an the ghetto now can you
  you cant say it for paris either especially not right now      i kind of know what you mean i sit at home and dont really want to waste a day but once im out there i enjoy it i bring my kindle
i hate those fuckers pretty much the only thing you can do about it is meticulously removing them with a knife although that torch idea sounded brilliant may have to try    does anyone have any good deer recipes got a fuckload of haunches and backstrap
using this knife will drastically reduce the amount of hair that gets cut when you make the initial cut when you start skinning
  what store sold you that crap id get my money back there was a feather in my chicken wing at buffalo wild wings and i was livid they brought me out a new chicken wing and were really kind but wtf
  are you dense
  some people dont want non food items in their food bro
  nobodys talking about store bought food dumbass

  makes shit thread  cant even link to other boards  gets butthurt when no one replies  lol at ur life
  meat   salt   pepper   maybe a little onion or garlic powder   thats all you really need ive never heard of someone marinating ground beef for burgers
  you dont marinade ground hamburger unless youre making some weird meatloaf
  you mongoloic subhuman you brainless shit you dont marinate ground beef you retard cant even link to other boards just fuck off redditor
parm on puttanesca yay or nay
  its overkill
  if you like it then yay if not then nay   who am i to judge if making it for others then leave it as an option for them personally i go for yay
  puttenseca is my favorit tomato gravy
if you want it have it
    making for someone else and just realized dont have any on hand debating whether to run to store
  if youre going to put cheese on pasta at least use pecorino  but no the flavor of hard cheese goes well with salty briny things when youre eating an antipasto platter but in pasta its just too much  its ok if you like it but dont insult your guests palates by serving it to them
  yay  jesus christ
  jesus christ  yay
  kek i like you
  salty briny things    puttanesca contains anchovies capers and olives
does chickfila make good food
i like their fries but the chicken is salty as fuck very overrated imo
  their service is the best but the food  its fast food
  its fast food but its probably the best fast food chicken chain
  its good not great but what really sets it apart from all other fast food is its consistency every single time the food will be good you wont get dry chicken or chicken with too much breading or soggy fries or burnt fries none of that i dont know how theyve mastered it but it really sets them apart
  yes its hard to say that anyone else has better fast food than them    also im convinced chikfila sauce is just yum sauce
  good fries  chicken is salty as fuck  canes tendies in chickfila sauce is the best
  this
  this along with milfs wearing yoga pants
  really good food i only go there perhaps once every month or two because there is always 1520 cars in their drivethru it moves fairly quickly but you have to be prepared to wait at least 510 minutes to get through same situation with innout burger
  name a place where you have gotten a better chicken sandwich or nuggies
  canes has better tendies their sauce sucks though
  the average cfa employees iq is at least 25 points higher than any other fast food chain employee they also treat their employees really well ive known a few people that worked there and enjoyed their job combine all that with simple ingredients and a simple menu and you have decent and consistent fast food
  went to chick fil a to support a sincerely religious place if i had children itd be a good place to start working  i bought a lot from them but cant remember
  unirickally supporting religion
    wendys chicken sandwiches are way better imo and their spicy chicken is actually spicy chikfilas spicy sandwich is for baby boomers who think black pepper is too spicy
  wendys spicy chicken sandwich isnt even spicy either sounds like youre a boomer whos a small step above other boomers
  does chickfila make good food  never eat fried food
  wub a dub lub haha hella epic my dude how do we up vote each other here though this 4channel still needs some work
  wendys chicken sandwich is okay but it doesnt hold a candle to cfa
  i was saying its spicier than cfas you fucking moron no one is impressed by how h4rdc0r3 you think you are because you can handle genpop levels of spicy food
  the absolute hottest take i have ever seen on this website the sauce and bread is the only fucking reason you go to canes you codswallop
spicy chicken sandwich with chickfilsauce  waffle fries with a mix of polynesian and mayo  cocacola  the best meal you can buy
  its very good as fast food goes but the real reason i go there is because theyre the only mainstream gayhating fast food company
  the food might not be gross there but your opinions sure are
  who are you quoting
  their menu
  fuck you i read it in his voice
  fuck off faggot
  dog whistles
  their spicy chicken sandwich is actually spicy    read your own post next time stupid fucking boomer
  200117  still a closeted homophobic  enjoy your self imposed neutering
  n i g g e r s
  its a crime that i cant post r e d d i t at an increased font size
  so is your lifestyle assfucker
   whistles
  yes not the best but certainly good especially by fast food standardsm
    you seriously dont think i can comprehend my own comments holy fuck youre dumber than a nigger with down syndrome
    way too salty and their cheese is almost flavorless the fact that i have to ask for mayonnaise on a chicken sandwich instead of having it put on by default is testimony to what normies those wacky mormons are at making a proper chicken sandwich
  reddit
  epic  pickle rick  pickle riiiiiiiiiiiiiickfuckingszechuansaucereeeeeeeeeeeee
  its actually spicy  uhh i wasnt saying it was actually that spicy just spicier xddd  nice damage control retard boomer lay off the alcohol and try and remember what you posted
    their serving sizes for price are abysmal    id rather go to popeyes or churchs for chicken
  you dont put texas pete on their spicy chicken sandwich
  my pleasure
  same
    because it is spicy you dense fuck ive had to explain this to you three times now you fucking retard did i say fivealarm flaming hot spicy no i fucking didnt maybe reread my comment about how no one gives a dusty shit about how hardcore you think you sound right now keyboard warrior kill yourself
  right on
  go to china and suck communist dick faggot
  ok we get it you have such a great palate fucking no shit its fast food compare it to other fast food you retard
  wendies is always filled with jaded 40 year olds who leave food in the tray too long or niggers
  people can detest homosexuality without secretly being closet fags themselves all the lefty phobic buzzwords are so idiotic and ironically intolerant and closeminded
                      serious question how spicy is it im a pussy when it comes to spicy food i can only handle a little before its too much for me tabasco is too hot time if thats any indication i did try jollibees spicy fried chicken and it was delicious but the spicy level was probably the max id want to go
  not at all should just be called seasoned or something
  but what is your tolerance level is it at least moderate or can you eat insanely hot foods
  go fuck yourself newfag  you havent lurked on 4chan long enough to understand anything
  t 2016 election shitter
  i can handle pretty decent spice levels but my sinuses are very sensitive to it so id be blowing my nose if it was really spicy but its really not im not sure about jollibees chicken so my best sense of scale is less spicy than wendys spicy nuggets rip
  its called greentexting       who are you quoting     this is a quote do you get it now i think we are almost there really good progress today
easily the best fast food chain
  better chicken sandwich  howlin rays in la
  chik fila is the dr pepper of fast food

so everyday i would eat a spoonful of dry chia seed and wash it down with a glass of water     i know almost every source on the internet say you should soak it for a couple of minutes before consuming it because the risk of it gets stuck in your throat     but if i drink sufficient amount of water with it then whats the risk    i do it this way because its quick and requires no prep     anyone else eat chia seeds dry
i dont eat meme food
  no one does this including you you are dumb and ugly
ah hello everyone today we are making one of my personal favorites a dessert fit for the washingtons a dessert that has an apt usage in the modern day especially that reflects our current climate we are making the orange fool
first post
  watching some revisionist loser
drumpftards get triggered at cooking channels now lmao so much for not being sjw snowflakes
  cringe
soy sucking faggot
  exhibit a      exhibit b
  this site went to shit after the 2016 election influx of newfags
  it went to shit long before that newfag
  orange man bad
isnt marriage supposed to be between one fag and another  this whole cuckold thing is a bit crazy
  i swear i really am doing an orange fool oc next presidents day just to give /pol/dditors an aneurysm
whats meant to be wrong with him
  ha i remember this ive watched some of his videos i think hes definitely an aspy i dont think it occurred to him people would rage about politics i mean how politically involved can he be he seems to spend the majority of his autistically puttering around in the woods while using antiquated cooking methods and tools
  what history does he revise
  it turns out that being a sensitive little faggot is ubiquitous among people with empty enough lives to have time to care about politics
    why are we talking about boring youtube drama from over a year ago
  eh put yourself in a trumptards shoes when you root for someone that claims no victories and provides literally no cause for celebration the next best thing is to fling mud even if its years old its pretty pathetic
  implying american history is important enough to revise
  kek that is pretty funny in high school we have a 1 year course on american history all 300 years or so and world history is a 1 semester elective that youre not required to take for graduation
  my school had 3 separate world history electives each on semester long
  one
maybe if murrica land actually spend more time learning about the world history they would feel less inclined to force their fuckked up way of life on 3rd world countries  and would realise they aint shit and arent the fucking centre of the universe  and maybe they to will notice nazi and patriotism is essentially the same
  im in a red state though where world history is viewed as an atheist commie plot to take muh guns
  forgetting that we had to come and save the entire world 2 times  keep talking shit       we had to take 3 historiescivics world american and the senior year was ap euro
  orange man good
    psa this is a paid shill i dont know how they have funding after the election or what their organization is trying to accomplish on /ck/ but for the sake of keeping /ck/ less shitty everyone should ignore it      according to a follow video up the mt vernon people actually chose all the dishes and he just kind of showed up given how clueless he looked during those videos especially fried catfish i believe it sour beer was his first good rp video
what are some other youtube channels that trigger 4channelers
  story
  because american history exists entirely within the era of mass media its most prominent feature is rapid continual revisionment
  jack  mark weins  bon appetit    those are all posted by reddit or otherwise just shilled not really triggering but definitely a minor annoyance and not representative of 4channelorg/ck/
  thats not what i meant i dont like politics
drink ice cold water  stomach feels like its been frozen into an ice ball    ow why does it hurt so bad
cancer probably
  youre 10 ply bud
  best case scenario you are just a pussy if that isnt the case then there is something wrong with you and you should see a doctor
  water is spicy
  the cold feels similar to cramping thats why i started mixing half cold water and half room temp water otherwise you just have to sip it slowly in small amounts which gets annoying if youre really thirsty
drinking ice cold water on an empty stomach is the best
this is normal if you are asian from what my gf tells me i guess their guts just dont do cold drinks
cold tap water is too spicy for white people lmao
cold water irritates the intestines and makes them contract and it gets especially bad if you have ibs  take care op
/ck/pill me on the mukbang phenomenon
im dieting and watch mukbangs to get vicarious virtual eating pleasure
  i get really drunk and jerk off alone with them on the tv
feeder fetish
i dont understand how people can eat so much food the most i can eat is probably 3/4 of a large pizza and ill feel like vomiting after that
  god i wish that were me
  i did this too but it ended up being a last test for me of sorts if i could go through the whole night watching mukbangs or cooking videos while my stomach rumbled all the while i felt more confident in my self control and willpower good luck on your diet anon and make sure to work out at the same time
  the mukbang phenomenon  is this a star trek episode title
mukbang asmr
  basically koreans did it first except it was skinny womenthen la creaturas saw that you could make money doing it and now we have amerifats making the entire community about drama talking about thats the tea siswig theyre just podcasts while eating basically
  holy fuck shes disgusting
  friend simulator basically
  based and trekpilled
i want to make money binge eating but all these episodes lasts more than 15 minutes so i dont think i have a place in the market 
  some of those videos literally sound like dogs eating
    seriously disgusting mukbang is fairly unpleasant to watch to begin with but augmenting the sound is revolting
  sounds depressing
  i would wreck this chick i mean over and over and over and over all night and again after pancakes i dont get it but it works for me
  sauce on this chunklet
  started as tiny cute asian women who eat huge meals and surprise their viewers   it has since been coopted by obese americans like pic related to justify their obesity by broadcasting it online
  
originally i was hating on it but i realized that theres a lot of lonely people out there and they should be able to feel like theyre not through whatever medium they find so i cant hate on that no one should have to feel alone     that said i havent watched a single video
  from looking at your picrelated im guessing there are probably some degenerates that watch videos of unremarkable thots eating whatever and beating off to it or something   competitive eating vids are more wholesome entertainment   matt stoney kinoshita yuka and randy santel are the only ones i watch randy is lesser known but i like his stuff because he does pretty much only real challenges at restaurants instead of stuff made up on the spot like the other two
i like to watch people eat seafood when im high or drunk for some reason its just satisfying to hear the crack of a crab leg or see them slurp the crawfish perhaps its because ive never had anything like it but it looks super appetizing only crab legs ive had have been from red lobster not trying to meme  i have had a full lobster in san francisco on vacation though that was pretty cool saulsalito to be exact
  weird flex but ok
  kinoshita yuka  competitive     nigger what    shes fun to watch but not competitive matt stoney is goat though
  not everyone is like you idiot
  hi everyone its joeys super cool world tour random epileptic noises
  vomits
  shut up zoomer
  judging by that photo youd want to be careful dickpunching her in the shitbag chilli dick is not fun
the only mukbang worth watching is this one with a genuine oneofakind man    
  thats the strongest man in the world
  unless youre sexually attracted to women theres no pleasure watching videos like this unless they star somebody youre sexually attracted to
  weak im 5 9 150 pounds and can kill a large pizza thanks mommy for my metabolism
mukbang  capitalist degenerates  consume consume blargh so much freedumbz
  its cancer
  go to bed kim
  go to bed schlomo (((capitalism))) is cancer
  get on hormones alice
  people have been saying that since before you were born braxton
  i honestly dont understand /pol/ at all it started as a troll board with hitler did nothing wrong type bullshit but immediately attracted stormfront retards who didnt realize it was a joke since trump its become the biggest board which i can only assume means they attracted a bunch of t_d fags who actually believed in getting trump elected and believed they were somehow making a difference by reposting memes on 4chan yet it still seems like the people who make the memes understand that theyre just for trolling despite /pol/ being a containment board that nobody pays attention to but then you come across a post like this and the only thing you can think is that the the left cant meme meme is meant entirely ironically and this is just bait    then again maybe youre just one of the retards and completely missed the joke
  but capitalism is cancer tho
  i agree but youre conflating memes /pol/ loves capitalism and hates jews so you cant equate jews with capitalism especially when marx and the most influential postmarxist theorists were jewish the idea that the jews secretly run the world is just an excuse right wingtards have to tell themselves to create a boogeyman to explain voting for capitalists who dont give a shit about the working people despite everything they vote for is blatantly against their interests
  capitalism and (((capitalism))) are nothing alike
  heres a redpill for you the koch brothers arent jewish
  but i know capitalism is shit whats your problem dipshit
  sauce
  pol is not one thing or ideology everyone is welcome there
shit the nights when i ate a whole pizza and drank a 12 pack of miller high life i shouldve been streaming it i didnt know this was a thing i thought i was just being a disgusting pig
    dubs confirm we need sauce need more drunk girls hypnotically staring in camera
  thanks mommy for making me a manlet  oof
  /pol/ is a board of peace
  btfo you fucking commie /pol/ is the only reason anyone knows about 4chan or 4channel /ck/ isnt close to as active as /pol/ i wish it was
this is my favorite mukbang video cause the girl is clearly on drugs eating a salad and all the comments are about her being on coke     
  i didnt think coke made people want to binge eat never tried it though
  that bitch is pretty coked out i like how she gets a bloody nose towards the end
  imagine uploading this in a druginduced stupor and being so much of an attentionwhore that you leave it up for two years instead of deleting it the next day      stimulants generally suppress appetite yes but you can eat a salad if you get it in your head that itd make a good video
  my ex was like that and did zero drugs
  /pol/ is the only reason anyone knows about 4chan or 4channel  ask me how i know you came here after the election
  human males want a fat wife for childbearing and skinny whores for fucking/childbearing  human females want a high fitness man to devote his attention to/have kids exclusively with her until his fitness lowers  conflict ensues
  i like watching mukbangs cause then i can imagine how their poop is going to come out and what it might smell like    take the brownpill
i heard a lot of people watch it because theyre lonely the thing started in south korea and now everyone and their dog is doing it most of them are doing it wrong because they dont realize that the korean women are puking all of it out after turning off the camera
      exactly thats why its worth watching we get to see just what it takes to push human biology to the very limit
  how dare you insult muh bbc/tranny/trump circlejerk  we was kangs n shite ok
  they should film that too then i would actually watch
  marx was born into a lutheran family retard  fuck you for the off topic post and fuck you for the shit history lesson
    wtf they didnt even finish anything
i dont mind watching a guy like matt stonie eat a shit load of food in mere minutes or some travel food guy going to a country ive never been to before but i dont care to watch average people eat chipotle
  actually wanting newfags to come
  you mean chanology right
  marx wasnt a jew  holy shit i havent laughed this hard since i first saw /pol/ claiming nietzsche as one of their own
    it might be palo alto 2013 film  decent movie
  no stereotypical jews are absolute capitalists you need to divide left/right social policy from left/right economic policy trump was voted in on a right social policy mixed with a slightly left economic policy this is why his own party hates him it gets more subtle than that but this is a good start to realizing polarities are inherently bullshit
  does coke constrict or dilate pupils
  ill look into it thanks
  they do also you can orser personal vids from them in which they say what you want and even make noises into a mis asmr style with their mouths while eating
  why does she bend her head forward towards her food when eating the watermelon what an absolute barbarian   what a disgusting human being i have never seen anything more repulsive than this druggie chick bending over to mash her face in that watermelon instead of just picking it up to eat it normally
yet another variety of friend simulator popular as society begins to disintegrate
  why the fuck does she have hairy pits fucking gross bitch
  started as korean neets staving off loneliness by watching videos of cute girls eating regular meals  turns into grotesque horror show of cetaceanamericans eating themselves to death to amuse the peanut gallery
  rent free
  stonie is the goat cant believe he failed that kfc challenge
  woo woo woo woo
what exactly is a mukbang  where is the line between that and an asmr or that and a food review is it just quantity
  americans ruin everything       its in their culture to not eat alone but if they have no family to eat with they watch a mukbang
  it dilates them on its own but as someone who has worked as a bouncer for a decade its not always easy to tell what people are on from their eyes alone i mean you can see if someone is stoned but when you get into cocaine sometimes people mix it with heroin ketamine or pot and that kinda evens them out where their eyes arent so black also some medications make pupils dilate like epilepsy drugs i only know that from having to call paramedics because of epileptics rather than drugs a few times we always assumed it was drugs and then the paramedics get there and it was from the strobe lights and the people arent on anything
  59  150 lbs  thanks mommy for my metabolism  i dont see any reason to thank your mom for that fatty
  not him but thats like 10lbs over ideal weight and depending on his body frame could be ideal
ive eaten dominos four times this week whats your favorite order
green peppers onions green olives
brooklyn style with marinara instead of the normal sauce topped onions and mushrooms anything nonbrooklyn style sucks imo  parmesan bread bites are the best side item to get bonein wings are good but the sauces are meh i get them plain and add my own usually   its all a bit over priced but i get it because its the only thing out here that delivers
  always ask for double cheese  they skimp out normally and it turns a regular pizza into a great one regardless of other toppings
  pan is a close runner up definitely overpriced thats why i only indulge when theres 50 off i wish they served french fries like most family italian joints
  carbonara breadbowl pasta
alfredo extra cheese italian/pepperoni cant go wrong with any meat really
  i dont have one i dont patronize dominos you fucking shill ass frogposter
  dont you care about leukemic minor minorities
shalom goyim
  nothing goes better with potato pancakes than bacon and sour cream
  bacon  shoo goy shoo    sour cream yes but apple sauce is the best how about both
  nah i love eating pork and combining meat with dairy
  probably used pleb russet potatoes
  not using starchy potatoes for latkes  retard alert
  russets unpeeled    yup
i went to a seder once and now im a shabbos goy
  its strictly beef and dairy they cant combine if youre gonna meme on jews get it right they can eat chicken and cream sauce all day and cheese too as long as the calf wasnt killed to make the rennet and its been certified kosher and rabbi schlomo got his beak wet of course
happy hanukkah bitches
all these jews on my 4chan  its like moot never left
  what the fuck is the point of this are hashbrowns some kind of kike food
    he fell for the (((cast iron))) meme
  theyre latkes goyim go to a jewish deli for a pastrami sandwich latkes and some pickles some time you wont regret it
  le jews are bloodthirsty monsters meme
  huh
  no thanks also you belong in a fucking oven
what food do they serve at jewish weddings the parties look amazing but whats the grub like
  i mean not a jew i just like thier delis for a bit of nosh
  you have to bring your own food to a jewish wedding
  milk bones seem seem like an odd choice but enjoy
  why are the pink in the middle
  salmonella
  shadilay my brother
  op dd a shit job and let his potatoes oxidize/brown
  whatever you say talmudfag
  center is raw  just like mommy used to make
  nope thats wrong any meat with dairy will not be kosher
  nope youre wrong bro the restriction is specifically in reference to a verse not to eat the milk of the mother and the meat of her calf technically a particularly pedantic jew and lets be honest they all are can get away with a goat cheese and beef burger
  the verse specifies goats not cows and if you want to be pedantic about it it only prohibits the act of boiling a kid goat in its mothers milk    that said most jews interpret that much more broadly to avoid mixing meat and dairy period its a case of oneupmanship really     obey the scripture and i dont boil goats in goat milk  oh yeah well im holier than you because i dont do that with any kind of meat not just goats   sinners the both of you i dont eat milk and meat at the same time at all  thats pleb tier i dont combine meat with dairy of any kind
  you have no idea how jews work apparently the entire reason we dont mix meat and milk is because we dont want to even come close to violating the specifics of that verse it says dont boil a calf in its mothers milk well we shouldnt eat meat and milk together ever  its called building a fence around the torah look it up
  heat is too high you dumb kike
  thats just what happens with russets as the skin gets shredded with the flesh it changes color when cooked as you can see      nah the cooked potato in the center is white like normal potato      because too much browning they came out nice and crispy but creamy in the middle i guess its preference
  is that cheese
  die you fucking kike
  cool it with the antisemetic remarks
    this is why other peoples hate you
  this i love crispy potatoes too but you are extremely close to ruining it that horrible flavor of burned food and also promotes cancer you went so far i cant believe you dont at least have some portion of it past the point of no return and then the whole batch is ruined
          fuck off jews
    ow the edge
resize your fucking picture you asshole not everybody has unlimited internet
  what are you doing on an imageboard if you have limited internet lmao    sounds like a great way to blow through your allotment
  not being afraid of gd jewing you so you dont mix any meat with dairy  youre not actually chosen i see
    i know what you mean but i cant be assed to resize pics on my phone its literally the lowest setting for 169
  im not that guy but my internet speed is slow i dont have a quota or allotment its just frustrating to wait for images to load its justified if the image benefits from being at high resolution but its sort of pointless to waste bandwidth when its just shitposting even if your internet isnt limited its still a dumb waste of bandwidth that slows things down for everybody yourself included
  who the fuck cares youre never going to get a jewish customer anyway unless you have free coffee
  usually i browse in the text only mode    i takes 2 seconds you lazy bum
  where are the canddles you idiot
hey you want some breakfast here ill whip up some eggs in the cast iron  ssorry im gonna have to season this  wwait sorry we have to wait 10 minutes for it to warm up  hokay here we go eggs in  ouch fuck burnt myself on this handle goddamn thats authentic  woops little too hot hope you dont mind crispy eggs  no no we dont use modern nonstick pans they really arent authentic pal  alright here ya go hold on one sec while i wash this  uhum its sticking a bit let me just boil some water in here for few minutes to loosen things up look super easy  just gotta scrub this for a few minutes  no dont soap ruins it  hey look good as new  let me just wipe up this water you see if i leave water on it it will rust super authentic and rustic  woops my kitchen towel is black now ill just throw out the towel  sorry i cant eat yet i need to season this right away  k okay ill be there one sec dont eat yet  okay i just need to warm this up for a few minutes you see i need the seasoning to polymerize to the pan really authentic  alright im ready  damn these eggs are pretty cold maybe ill go higher heat next time
  whoaniggabmp
  youre wrong and thats all youre gonna get outta me you prankster
  not an argument
today i made a bunch of scrambled eggs in my cast iron heated it to medium threw some butter in there then the eggs was easy i served the eggs put my cast iron under the faucet for maybe 15 seconds while filling my drink and then took my metal spatula and scraped the residual eggs off the pan took about 15 more seconds if that then out the pan on a hot burner and ate my meal while my pan dried if youre bad at things why even do them
  kek nice  stainless steel  cast iron  debate me
  that cope tho
  not an arguement
  fuck gottem
theyre also too heavy to pick up
  theyre also too heavy to pick up    how embarrassing
cooking something as finicky as eggs in cast iron  wtf  implying the pan has to be reseasoned every fucking time its used  lmao  thinks he actually has to scrub the shit out of his pan to clean it  med heat kosher salt and a brush or rag  believing the le no soap meme  retard lol
  nah
  cooking only eggs in the cast iron when bacon and hash should be in there too  seasoning the pan now an hour long process that should have been done the day you bought it decades ago  warming up something that should already be hot due to you just now seasoning it  burning yourself on something that you know is hot assume everything in the kitchen is hot  rule anyone whos worked in one will tell you as if cast iron pans are the only things that dont have insulated handles  presumably didnt use butter or oil and just threw an egg onto an nonlubricated pan something you dont even do with nonstick  proceeding to wash out the seasoning  wasting a precious kitchen towel on a job that could have been done with a single paper towel then complaining about it  seasoning hour long process again right now    on the bright side your cast iron will survive your inevitable house burning down with you in it
  proceeding to wash out the seasoning  how else are you supposed to get the sticky shit out without scrubbing idiot
  more like too perfect for bashing a disappointing hisbands head in am i right feminists
  no dont soap ruins it  this is unironically true though
  yeah you right people do be treating their cast iron like that but they retarded that shit for the birds  the best part of using cast iron is that you can abuse it and not worry about completely ruin it gouge the burt eggs out with a metal spatula then scrub it with some soap and warm water you dont even need to put it back on the stove to dry it out  just use a papertower to get the bulk of the water off optionally you can put a small coating of your oil of choice for storage
why do people cook eggs in anything but a nonstick its literally made for eggs
  you dont wash cast iron
  and do you think he was joking about everything else  retarded anime posters
  now this post is authentic and rustic
not cooking in a glorious dutch oven master race    lets see you make bread or braised beef stew in a cast iron oh and enjoy those acidic tomato dishes
whats the benefit of using a cast iron pan over a normal one it looks like too much effort for the same result
  none its just autism
    cast iron is explicitly for frying purposes you dont cook scrambled eggs on high heat you pleb 0/10
  tfw i make eggs in my stoneline pan nd theres no sticking at all so normally i just wipe it out if its extra greasy i put it in the dishwasher because i have normal cookware that isnt for autists had the pan about 2 years its a good quality one and its still as good as the day i got it
  feminist  married  abusing men  pick the top and bottom only
  stoneline pan  these memes end here
mfw basedboy millenial faggots cant cook in the scrub filter tool    color me shocked dont forget your shes the boss apron queers
  i love how insecure trolls who cant figure out a tool thats been in use hundreds of years are
imagine being so bad at using a utensil you have to construct this ridiculous hyperbole to make yourself feel like you arent a useless stain in the kitchen
  dutch ovens are cast iron you retarded brainlet
  not to mention that if he really feels the need to move the handle around all the time these exist 
what do you mean i have cancer how could this happen  nonstickfags
  get it smoking hot as you run the sink at the hottest temp run it under the water maybe scrub a little with a brush like lodge sells just for the task dry on the stove and rub a few drops of oil in and let it smoke    you can literally do this in less than a minute of actual work it takes longer to clean stainless steel
  not heating the oil in  good way to get a sticky rancid surface going
why is it so hard to own more than one pan  i have exactly 6 pans and they cover everything  2 nonstick small and large  2 stainless small and large  2 castiron small and large
  he buys the meme that tomato dishes are bad in cast iron  this meme stems from idiots storing stuff in the fridge with aluminum foil over top which turns it into a primitive battery
  enamaled dutch ovens are still cast iron
  why is it so hard to own more than one pan  because this is the internet and there is no middle ground its binary
  plus those super expensive enameled cast iron skillets have serious problems with developing chasing surface basically shatters on the cooking surface if you try to use them the same way you can use uncoated cast iron
imagine your life when youre arguing over pans
  yeah i would never use an enamaled skillet my enamaled dutch oven is my favorite piece of kitchen equipment though
  do people still believe this momscience shit
  last thing i made in mine was a japanese curry was great especially over rice with some kewpie mayo on top
  based and steelpilled      it takes longer to clean stainless steel  it doesnt and the stainless steel is actually clean when its done    people who use nonstick pans should just gas themselves tho
  stonelines look pretty neat how well do they sear foods i dont love cooking eggs in my cast iron unless im doing over easy or something but god damn i love cooking meats vegetables and one pot meals in it     i have no idea why people think its one or the other i love my cast iron but use a nonstick pan for anything acidic its like people who swear by using only youtube or only listening to vinyl
  use a nonstick pan for anything acidic  hopefully you mean enamaled cast iron or stainless steel
  desu im not sure it was gifted to me and i know its not a teflon pan it looks like its enameled but i cant say for sure i really want a stainless steal one but keep forgetting maybe ill get myself one for christmas
  post a pic
  hopefully you mean enamaled cast iron or stainless steel  what makes you say hopefully    acid will attack enamel or stainless more than it will attack teflon
  pans at home and im at work it looks kind of like this type though    which says its enameled
    found the rosti another great cast iron dish btw
  it doesnt and the stainless steel is actually clean when its done  do your ci right and its not just clean its actually thermally sanitized
  good shit     the acid wont attack shit in the few hours at max it will be in contact with the pan i make tomato sauce in both types of pan all the time with no issues
  if i refuse to use teflon and acidity attacks cast iron enameled and stainless which pan would be best for acidity
  enamaled or stainless or even cast iron its an old wives tail and doesnt matter
  well there is a small truth in it    that if you throw aluminum foil over it and just stick it in the fridge itll basically act like a battery and corrode the foil but only an idiot shoves their ci cookware in the fridge instead of using proper storage containers
  false flag
  i never heat the oil in after cleaning and ive never experienced any rancid oil residue even after months between uses use a tiny amount of oil rub it into the cooking surface with a paper towel then wipe out as much as you possibly can with a fresh paper towel
no you cant use modern cleaning agents on this pan  we clean it the old fashion way by inconveniently heating the residue left after cooking until its the surface of the sun
to the admin of half chan of fb fuck you
  that fucking pan costs something like 200 ive seen it before
  it sucks desu
am i missing something here got a preseasoned pan as a gift two months ago and all i do to maintain it is gently wash it in warm water with mild soap then dry it my boomer dad is always genuinely excited to eat my food
you can use soap you worthless autists just make sure its not a detergent
what can i cook   i have a few packages of hot dogs a few cans of tuna mashed potato flakes an onion sweet taro bread eggs flower crackers noodles spaghetti routini some sardines and some milk one package of sliced deli chicken a box of pizza crust and pizza sauce a box of stove top chicken
  dinner

  lmao scientists need to shut the fuck up and go discover more genders
  the max population the earth could sustain 100 years ago was much lower until a scientist figured out a better way to create more fertilizer its stupid to tell people to stop having kids when advancing technologies can fix most of the problems theyre talking about anyway
  sad
  good news everyone you dont need to worry about our societys current behavior leading to catastrophic problems in the future because advancing technology will fix most of them    and well tell everyone that the problems we cant fix are just a chinese hoax
  people to stop having kids  you think anyone but huwhaites listened to this shit
  telling people to stop having kids is just barely better than the retards who say just kill a bunch of people lol when talking about anything related to population labgrown meat is going to let people eat meat without all of the issues associated with factory farming thats just one instance of technology solving a problem instead of telling everyone to stop having kids stop eating meat etc we shouldnt be trying to go backwards like some people suggest
  i hope you got a tub of crisco and some condoms for your ass
  white people arent reproducing why do these scientists keep telling white people to stop reproducing when they arent  meanwhile niggers and poojeets are throwing as much trash as they can into their water supply and shitting out tons of kids while driving cars that get less than 5 miles per gallon
turn vegan
  op did u shoop the ballsack too or is that legit
  no    kys
  be beta  be walking to burger joint with gf  see dude in ops picrelated  this dude slaps ur gfs ass  wat do
  no kys
  thats my cat
  become a vegan
you dont scare me
  no u
  the chickfila mascot got buff eat more chikin
id turn that into a stack of steaks
  whole photo is legit its a belgian blue bull myostatin a protein that stops muscle growth has been bred out of them so they get jacked
  for what purpose surely that meat is not tender
  no idea  there was a time a decade or two ago where lowfat diets were the meme im sure they are pointless outside of pageants and fairs and shit   i grew up next to several small farms and i know if they had these fucking things i would have found it to be the coolest thing ever thats probably the extent of it
  woah  thats a big cow
  for moo
    most of these animals are sold to private zoophiles a lot of girls are into this sort of shit muscular cows look at those fucking balls
decide to go vegan for a week  shit multiple times a day  clean every time  there just might be something to this whole vegan thing
  its called eating fibre you mong
i unironically went vegan this summer still eat meat when i go out and eat or go over to a friends place and am offered it but all my meals at home are plantbased its amazing weight is melting off of me more energy skin is clearing just feels amazing
  no i like my beef with horseradish sauce
  if i pulled on that nose ring would you die
  how do i start this i need to lose weight i heard it makes you skin clear too
  an apple a day keeps the doctor away  and carrots make you see better
    
  actually the meat is really tender and lean
im finna boutta eat my greens
    its just for productivity the cow has twice the amount of meat in exchange for being lean as fuck and flavorless massive filet mignons is the only thing worthwhile from that cow
is there such a thing as a good chain restaurant
  youre a fucking idiot
  mad
  exhausted
my local mom and pop diner in town makes good food 10/10 chain would recommend
i like red robin alot
  yes there is but it isnt on your picture
i think chilis is pretty good
  wendys
  outback is the best place in the pic every outback in the us is packed on weekends but every chain has at least a few good things on the menu even if everything else is garbage
1 outback  2 chilis  3 starbucks  4 mcdonalds   5 ihob  6 pizza hut  7 subway  8 dunkin  9 dq  10 red lobster   11 sonic  20 burger king  100 applebees     never had brappigans
  i think chilis is pretty good but i only go there a few times a year
  i used to like black eyed pea but they went out of business like 15 years ago
  waffle house unironically has the best drunk food
  applebees and bww used to be legit good but theyve each made some serious compromises on quality to drive down prices in recent years ive only been there once but ruby tuesday seemed pretty comfy
  while i mostly agree i always preferred dennys especially back when you could smoke inside
  redpilled
  everything at wafflehouse is sticky dennys not as much
  wafflehouse unironically had great burgers from what i remember the actual waffles not so much havent lived near one in a couple years now
  this is pretty accurate but id say dunks and sonic should be higher imo
  why is mcdonalds so based
  half of those arent fast food but out of the big chains that arent super regional taco bell is the only one that ill eat at
zaxbys and arbys are where its at but at that price point youre better off just going to a proper deli/diner
  if it makes lots of money its good by definition
  chilis is alright so is five guys and other sort of burger places like that like smashburger
i like chilis and cracker barrel
collects dust    ttthanks santa
  your fault for not taking advantage of it
  i like mine but honestly a croc potforhalfthe price would have done it for us dontyouse the yoghurt function and has anyone ever used the cake function    but anyways tried and tested for oats stews curries rice and brothmaking works well for that
  you can get a crock pot for 10
  use it for turkey heh
  i use mine like twice a week      makes dank chili in like 45 minutes as well
  maybe that would be even better the ones i have seen usually hover around 2530 ish got my instantpot for 5990
  right along side a foot massage machine
  havent tried making chili in it yet but i make my meatsauce in it if the stove is otherwise occupied when its meatsauce monday kids wanted to have a recurring dish every day of the week we compromised down to two
  cook a whole turkey with it heh
how to make curry with it  or crockpot curry
i use this thing whenever possible i used to spend all day doing meal prep on sunday now its only 23 hours actually cuts cooking time of most things i make by 6x
  download the instant pot app
tfw when the pizza arrives
wa la
omg epic for the win xdddd
its called decadent human waste cooks larping at the head chef of louis xvi at versaille     youre not an artist you dont change lives you cook food for a living youre a cook your customers pay for the opportunity to larp as medieval french nobles while your waiters dance around them like whores so you can laugh all the way to the bank     this skid mark is a chicken mango tarragon and turmeric reduction splashed to resemble my 1yearolds diaper fillings crashlanding onto oversized porcelain   it is a privilege for you to dip a single organic english green pea into this ambrosia of the gods
  i dont quite understand what youre saying perhaps you should learn more english in your esl class and come back to us when you score higher than 92 on toefl
brevity is the soul of wit and youd also give the impression of being a lot less assravaged if you tried being more pithy
why do you care so much  youre obviously not worth the effort
  did your pervy uncle touch you in the naynay
  just search central lima peru and then say shit like that   also traditional fine dining is dead and if theres a restaurant that still does the basic shit like rack of lamb and lobster bisque or random smeared shit like the picture its because old people with money still go there because thats what they consider fine dining
  thanks for the input you have a good point    i dont think you should sell lies to people i believe that the best food of all is easy affordable and cooked at home with love fine dining bastardizes food culture by creating the illusion that wholesome food is inaccessible to the masses     this is exactly what im talking about  its modern  its edgy  in our mission we are exploring the ecosystem and biodiversity of our ancestral homeland through a gastric journey that traverses time climate and the intersection of ethnomycology biogeography and culture  a baked crustacean   tastes like moss   traditional french plating   victorian dining arrangments  peru  just look at their squarespace website
  getting bent out of shape by something that is financially socially and geographically beyond your reach  top tip if you live in a country that uses dollars for currency you probably will never experience fine dining unless you get a passport
  fine dining bastardizes food culture by creating the illusion that wholesome food is inaccessible to the masses   no it doesnt  i dont think u can just lump all fine dining together there definitely are some pretty rarted fine dining restaurants though  that being said i think you have the wrong attitude toward this
  please tell me your annual earnings    if this sort of food is financially unavailable to you i can happily disregard your comment
  i disagree whilst fine dining must be filling and delicious as a minimum it has value beyond that partially this is in the availability and quality of ingredients  truffles and foie gras taste good    but i also think good fine dining has an intellectual thread on food combinations and pairings theatre and visual concepts and a means of displaying abrast inspiration on a plate  exemplified by landscapes that inspire dishes for example    i think in fine dining you also have more room to play and to try to iterate on interesting ideas to see if they produce something of value    that said fine dining is not an excuse for ponce and theres definitely a lot of vacuous and mediocre fine dining    but on balance fun has to be part of eating i cant eat the same thing more thanonce a week and equally i cant hace classical cuisine every day  even i get bored of tournedos rossini eventually food is more than just sustenance
  the owner of central is a boarderline biologist in his vision to bring the foods from rare places to the public to bring awareness of the biodiversity of his country     also how is it traditional french plating have you even seen most of the dishes     i get what youre trying to say that it does seem to be a little pretentious but these chefs are masterminds in the culinary world theres a reason why they can have a tasting menu and still make tons of money also most of the fine dining chefs have other restaurants that do serve typical restaurant food   at the end of the day everyone has their own vision when dining out thats why a hole in the wall rib shack can technically get a michelin star and it has happened many times around the world
  implying nonamericans even have access to food  i dont believe it
  nobody is forcing you to eat it or pay for it let the rich waste their money
you arent wrong and i might add that people who eat in restaurants should all be pushed into a landfill to cleanse the earth of garbage people
  if you have the money to spend and enjoy the experience then its great
  nice blog
is there a better way  no preshredded i prefer buying by the block because its cheaper and it can be frozen
get a tupperware where the bottom is the bowl and the lid is the grater ikea sells em
food processor
  still requires manual grating no different from using a regular grater however the same google search came up with this rotary grater by tupperware      ill consider this
  is there a better way    whats wrong with that way    if its risk to your fingers when grating fast you can get julienne/mandolin graters with a safer handle      if its too strenuous i dunno do you have schlerosis you can get a grater for your food processor      too annoying to clean in that case get one in stainless steel so you can soak it in soapy water without developing rust

shut the fuck up
peta says on its website while these phrases may seem harmless they carry meaning and can send mixed signals to students about the relationship between humans and animals and can normalise abuse    teaching students to use animal friendly language can cultivate positive relationships between all beings    ms hamzah added historically the resources required to obtain meat meant it was mainly the preserve of the upper classes while the peasantry subsisted on a mostly vegetarian diet    as a result the consumption of meat was associated with dominant power structures in society its absence from the plate indicating disadvantaged groups such as women and the poor    to control the supply of meat was to control the people

    its true at its core but theyre playing it up a bit and putting it through the lense of 2018
why cant vegans just eat seitan and shut the fuck up no i wont fuck you you apple cider vinegar smelling bitch
  implying salted pork fat wasnt commoner food  the absolute state of this muslim    preach brother
  people in dark ages europe ate fish every damn day because it was still plentiful and not horribly polluted they all lived on or near the rivers because population density was lower than today and it was cheap transport the primary export of george washingtons mount vernon estate was river fish washington made his fortune by making his slaves catch fish estates like these made fish and salted fish super cheap peasants throughout the ages kept hogs on the farm to feed their scraps to and slaughtered them around christmas time there used to be way more birds flying around than there are today the prices of ham pheasant goose and salmon have all gone up since those days while the quality has declined people always had good amounts of meat i dont know where this occasionally eating meat figure these illiterates spout comes from
is this seriously what nonstem researchers do all day

whats your goto recipe for these tasty fucks other than steak and burgers with muzzleloading season closing up hope you got your backstraps and haunches
  for the meat itself i like to make a civet its just a red winebased stew if you actually hunt you should thicken it with the blood of the animal i think but i never tried because im a coward who buys his deer at aldi  but the best thing about venison is it has to be served with a fuckton of sides  good sides include but not limited to    sp√§tzlis    brussel sprouts    poached pears    apple sauce    some kind of red berry jam    red cabbage    chestnuts
deer is trash and dumb to eat
  i just moved to germany we get this kind of meal quite often in the work canteen fucking excellent
  thin slices sauteed with onions
  a female deer
  man i wish i had hunting friends and shit too much too learn any way and since i live in fuck you portland oregon i dont even bother trying to own a car    but i really wish i could try game meat knowing where i live and how i tend to spend the meagre amount of money i have i dont think i could fit it into my budget without a full investment in hunting    shame
the deer where i live are fucking trash animals mule deer with a heavy diet of sage brush if you can get the ones living in the cow fields they are all right but sage brush just makes them taste like shit
hey so im trying to fix my life and just be better kind of like a new years resolution but not new years and hopefully to prevent medical things currently a skinnyfat vegetarian picky eater any suggestions
  take it a step further and go vegan but eat whole foods and not processed junk food i mean its okay once in a while but try cooking meals with actual food not bagged/premade/frozen stuff    eat healthy fats avocados nuts    do your best to avoid junk food     exercise a lot more
  i cannot currently go vegan because i live in a college dorm and the dining hall serves nearly no vegan options
  are there any kitchens you can use do you have a stove available
thai cuisine has great sauces that are full of flavor and also indian food both taste good especially if you re trying make big lasting meals and can afford bulk spices also run with weights
      im trying my best but we arent even allowed to have a little stovetop single in our dorms only a microwave not even a toaster ive basically been having lettuce cheese sandwiches with spinach when i have it
  get some canned beans and microwavable rice get a wider variety of veggies that can be eaten raw    celerycarrotsbroccolicucumber    have salads just dice up a bunch of fresh raw veggies and have a salad use an olive oilsalt and lemon juice mixture as a dressing     dont forget fresh fruits
  eat deenz and peas every day and hit the gym youll be strong and sexy as a motherfucker in no time
  tldr the more natural colors you get in your meal the better the mix of nutrients you get you can use your microwave to steam vegetables in a sauce after slicing and dicing squash and rice in a creamy sauce is good source for protein since youre vegetarian
  if youre suffering from depression the book feeling good by md david burns can help its about cognitivebehavioral therapy a successful treatment for depression  link to pdf       you can also try some st johns wort its a plant tea for immediate relief i mix mine with melissa for the calming effect see if it works for you im currently trying it out myself no opinion yet
  so go live off campus and when you have kids remember to not put them in a fucking dorm    burger college life is silly

  yes but with beans though
  this except im a bohemian peasant
  beans because of switchblade sam
no because my life isnt so pathetic and tragic that i need to engage in fantasy just to make it through a meal
  this needed a king of the hill image    most cowboys were actual herdsmen who just ran cattle drives for months at a time all dudes no women no people no towns until kansas city no nothing no people to murder no women to rape pay was shitty and most of em had no family that cared about them or they cared about and it was a relatively short lived era as train networks expanded and fencing got affordably mass produced the days of the cattle drive were effectively over by the dawn of the 20th century and it had only really began in full post civil war so about 40 years total
  nigga im eating beans
  no but i will make really spicy chili in a cauldron over a fire set up a fog machine and some green mood lighting and cackle like a witch sometimes

  anyone else make really hearty stew  yes  and eat in a wooden bowl  yes  with wooden spoon  ah no metal spoon i guess i could have used a wooden spoon  outside their yard at night  yes  pretending to be a cowboy  viking
  the cattle drives coming up from tx began because those returning from the civil war came home to nothing so the more enterprising started rounding up the longhorn cattle that had gone feral since the ranches had fallen apart with no men to manage them in order to build up a money stake they were desparate and hardbitten men although being on the trail w/o women for a good part of the year led them into avenues of shall we say sexual exploration pic related thats where the phrase the only things that come from tx are steers and queers
anyone else sip canned soup heated by a fire and pretend to be a survivor of a post apocalyptic wasteland sometimes i even play a record from 50s for maximum aesthetic

  being able to afford premade peanutbutter    must be nice i have to steal peanuts from the bar down the road and then make my own
  he had items with which to make peanut butter    i had to steal the peanuts pilfer the tools and containers to make peanut butter and find a place to squat in so i could store the product and eat in peace
  he owns a pair of hands
  why are buying peanut butter when youre pissed off
im that poor all i eat is air
  must be nice i dive into my local peanut butter shops septic tank and eat peoples slightly nutty feces sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do
does /ck/ make their own wine i want to try making strawberry and mango wine
i dont make anything
  boones farm
i met a retired rich guy who made his own wine and beer literally all he did in his spare time was smoke weed and make wine and beer it was pretty tasty stuff but balanced against the fact that he spent a fortune on equipment and literally all his waking hours and the fact ive had homebrew alcohol from people with real jobs and that stuff was decidedly mediocre that ended any notions i had of ever making my own alcoholic beverages just not worth it
  i have a background in biotech so making my own wine was literally mandatory we had to makedo with storebrand grape/apple juices so the result tasted like stale hobo piss    we made beer/ale too and that actually was done on 100 professional/industrygrade level if on smallscale and the results were really good
  but balanced against the fact that he spent a fortune on equipment and literally all his waking hours  well he might have but its not necessary i make a 12 gallon batch of blueberry wine by juicing berries i picked myself adding water pectic enzyme yeast nutrient acid blend and potassium sulfate in a 15 gallon stainless pot and adding some yeast in 24 hours cover let ferment for 2 weeks transfer liquid to carboys and let ferment out for 12 months transfer to another carboy and let clear for 1 month bottle the equipment except for plastic hoses were one time purchases and not even particularly expensive the pot was 80 and the glass carboys were 5 gal mountain valley water containers that i kept for a 15 deposit the amount of time spent on it is trivial considering a bottle of the wine ends up costing me  3
yes strawberry has been my favorite so far ive made blueberry apple red and white currently making pomegranate and mead had a mulberry but it became vinegar
  classic diy fuzzy math i know youre leaving out the wasted money on the learning and experimentation and the batches that didnt come out great    the retired guy i know also drinks like a fish probably if he drank retail alcohol hed be running 500 a month through his liver    i drink a bottle or two a week which means even if you ignore the actual money id be drinking experiments for years before i got my recipes dialed down gross    coupled with the fact that im a 1 bedroom apartment in manhattan that i dont want to clutter up with tubes and buckets like a mentally ill hoarder the answer is going to have to be nah no thanks
  classic diy fuzzy math i know youre leaving out the wasted money on the learning and experimentation and the batches that didnt come out great  ive been making  2030 gallons of berry wine/year the last 6 years and theyve always come out tasting like a decent 15 bottle of merlot sometimes even better however id been brewing beer and mead for 5 years prior to that and while i never had a bad batch of mead or wine ive had a few bad batches of beer but being lower alcohol and brewed with yeast strains sensitive to warmer temps thats not surprising     coupled with the fact that im a 1 bedroom apartment in manhattan that i dont want to clutter up with tubes and buckets like a mentally ill hoarder the answer is going to have to be nah no thanks  thats fair i wouldnt want to try and brew in cramped conditions but really your other points arent valid

  not op using this thread    what should i look for in an oven stone will a cordierite one work fine for homemade pizza ive been using foil and sometimes a tray but i cant avoid getting a soggy bottom

    it will work okay but what you really want is a quarter inch to half inch thick piece of stainless steel that will get your crust crisp and maybe burn it if you arent careful
is cheese on toast the ultimate britbong heroinchic food
i used to eat that shit as a kid put it in a toaster over its the bomb the cheese would make one big bubble that would slightly burn and then you could peel it off and eat it revealing the gooey cheese layer underneath tasty af
  i literally just finished eating this exact same thing not even a minute ago and confirm shits fucking delicious i even used a shit tier cheese cracker barrel extra sharp white cheddar and it was still delicious i also sprinkled some worcestershire sauce on it
  shits cash bruv
      whoa hold upyoure telling me that melted cheese plus carbs tastes good
mine never looked that nice i had thin brown hovis bread with greasy cheese that still held is rectangular form after being half melted still enjoyed it though
  shits great when you use pumpernickel bread
  stop overanalyzing everything you cynical incel neckbeard
  if you dont eat cheese on toast with lea and perrins then you deserve to be sent to the gulag
  imagine eating a boil on a burn victim like that
  if you dont eat cheese on toast with hp sauce then you deserve to be sent to the gulag
  this except swap the worcestershire out for vegimite/promite
i love adding slivers of raw onionbarely enough time to cook but just lose that raw harshness that and worcestershire sauce will make a great cheese on toast
  what are silvers of onion
  slivers  sorry was being a retard
  grate it cheddar is not a great melting cheese it needs some help
do you fully toast the slice before grilling or toast one side and grill the other
  why not slap it together and call jon favreau so you can make it a movie
  didnt the /fit/ goddess die at 22 of heart disease whats your point
    shorty was a toasted cheese
    great question and very important i definitely toast one side fully that means very dark brown i then toast the other side to a light brown because i know the edges will get darker later on the light brown side is where i place the cheese    just to clear things up when brits talk about cheese on toast it means putting the bread under the grill i think thats called the broiler in america maybe some weirdos put the bread in a toaster but frankly i dont want to think about them
  sliver    silver    sliver

people say vodka is the easiest hard alcohol to drink straight but to me it tastes awful id much rather drink whiskey straight i think it has to do with the fact that vodkas taste isnt rounded at all anyone else relate to this
  vodka can be drunk like water though assuming its not a bad bottom shelf brand
  perhaps ive only had bad vodka the chief problem for me i think is the burn it gives me fucks up my throat and my stomach the bitter taste of the alcohol just makes it worse then again ive only had cheap vodka like smirnoff
i get what youre saying yeah whiskey has a strong flavor that may or may not be good the main flavor of vodka is objectively bad a good vodka is as even experts will tell you one that doesnt taste like much of anything adding it to anything just turns that thing into a shittier version of that thing it cannot improve the flavor of anything nothing compliments it only masks it its just trash
  this is a sensible post thanks anon
    vodka is basically just stuff as close to alcohol and water as you can get its not supposed to taste good because its not supposed to taste like anything   girls use it to get drunk off of juice without having to taste the alcohol in it
  1 get better vodka smirnoff for example is shittier  2 chill it hard  3 get some zakuski vodka snacks  pickles pickled herring cold cuts on crackers etc    good properly chilled vodka should be very mild with a nice oily mouthfeel  if you do get some burn or nasty aftertaste just eat a snack after each shot
as someone who almost exclusively drank bottomshelf shit like gorlovka and wisla for a long time you just slam it down to get drunk but if im honest i find absolut very unpleasant to drink same with smirnoff russian standard eristoff and bols arent all that bad though
  this
  i guess that you just cannot drink pussy sorry you have to unload the shame on shitty liquor
fuck you theres nothing wrong with smirnoff its cheap and yummy
  breath in  drink shot  take a couple gulps of orange soda  exhale tasting no vodka
just admit it you like his shows dont you
  no fuck off
i love you mark wiens
  he used to look like a chill stoner what happened

  i am almost 100 percent certain at this point that the guy is a serial killer
  nupositivity and overexaggeration while absorbing the accents of the places hes visiting nope
  huh
  i like the premise of it
i want to break every bone in his hands and lock him in a dungeon until he dies of sepsis
  he promotes the lie of cultural relativism the crying homosexual has more dignity
  based
ive been to this small little middle eastern sit down restaurant twice and both times after placing our order the owner has walked out turned on his smart tv and played this dudes youtube videos ostensibly for our enjoyment    what the fuck am i being memed on
his videos are good but i dont agree with how he kills children
  chuckled
leans to the right   ooooooh its so spicy mmmmmmmmmmm
mark is having an affair
  i travel for spoon food
  kek
  mark was a completely different person back then strange how much he changed
how can someone be this perfect
  aka being a cultured world traveller    you fucking neet loser
i really dont get it at first this guy pissed me off so much with his face and his reactions but now im watching hours of his content per day
    watch his old video he was a chad hapa stoner     then he had some kind of accident and turned into a child molesting creep    
  its the demons
  not cultured enough to have a real backbone man has no true personality
  i unironically love his shows bros his adventure to the third worlds is comfy now if only he would stop the whole children raping shenanigans
  mark weiner
you guys are pretty intolerant hes hiv positive and trying to deal with it
  he is not
  yes i am
  hes the fucking fantano of food fuck this bread loaf
to anyone wondering no you cannot win in a fight against mark wiens things just always seem to be in his favor
    he hit his prime plus drugs will ruin you as a person  also worth noting he has psycho eyes like the whites are always showing too much over his eyes
whats the secret to making good sandwiches  i get good meat good bread good cheese but my sandwiches always end up bland and uninteresting
  put stuff you like on a sandwich  eat it  wew lad
  bland and uninteresting  funny how that happens
put dill weed on ham and cheese with must and mayo plus do the oil vinegar thing if you wanna be fancy
its in the sauce you cant make a good sandwich without the sauce since cold meat doesnt taste as good as warm meat
  this its all sauce baby
have someone else make it
  oil and vinegar yo
  kek this i swear any sandwich i eat by somebody else is delicious compared to mine
  this applies to all food
  flavor try subtle amounts of onion or making an aioli with spices that you are fond of try different types of cheese and meat blends ie smoked turkey and aged swiss     texture make sure you have something crisp like lettuce something moist like tomatoes something creamy like mayo toasted bread can add a nice crunch    presentation part of the reason why having someone else make it makes it taste better is that they usually make it look good try putting a pickle on the side slicing it diagonally adding a few chips treat yourself
butter the outsides and then fry it pressing it extremely flat as you do so
sauce the bread so it isnt dry but not dripping pick a sauce that compliments the sandwich guts
  throe it in the floor and eat it like animal you fucking dog
good sauce and a variety of textures
shredded lettuce used to give the mayonnaise texture
dont know why but at least one item needs to be warm/heated for me to make myself a good sandwich
tips for coffee brewing or whatever coffee especially for a drip machine
nope
  1 tbsp per cup dont use distilled water turn on the machine is all i have to know
  you got it bud
  ty
  you dont even have to brew it you can just eat it if you want
pour coffee into pot with hot water let sit for 5 minutes strain out grounds and enjoy you dont need fancy machines
  this is a valid option too
mark doesnt have shit on mpw marco looks like hes killed people
  well she was pretty rude i dont think i would have served her
  maybe but i wouldnt post videos or brag about it kinda makes you look like a tool
  if i was a world class chef then yeah probably
  t mcdonalds regular
  i was mainly referring to the 2nd guy
  some clients are assholes and need to be told theyre assholes  calling someone a snob with the prices mpw has is pretty fucking rich though if youll pardon the expression
we reserve the right to refuse service to anybody  e    r  e  s  e  r  v  e    t  h  e    r  i  g  h  t    t  o    r  e  f  u  s  e    s  e  r  v  i  c  e    t  o    a  n  y  b  o  d  y
  excuse me chef needs more stock pot
  bake the cake bigot
gordon ramsay is more fun to watch throwing people out
  fuck off faggot
  lol no they dont
if it were an actual paying customer i doubt marco would have been as ruthless and something probably would have been worked out but since the meal is free he can tell any guest to fuck off if they dont like it
  would you kick out customers  absolutely there are people that have no self control and are intentionally rude obnoxious and antagonistic and rather than ignore their shitty behavior so theyll be more likely to repeat it i confront it directly and either nip it in the bud remove the idiot or choke them into unconsciousness    assholes arent born theyre made by cowardly pieces of shit that ignore and therefore encourage their shitty behavior
  video clips so good they had to run them twice
how could anyone love a british person
  that guy actually won the supreme court ruling and a tranny lawyer tried baiting him again and i think the lawyer got btfo
  theyre great to have around in aircraft or on boats in case you need to ditch some ballast
  if theyre returning food cause someone fucked up no
  dude we know  how new are you its a fucking joke about leftie hypocrisy not an actual call for the state to force people to bake gay cakes  /ck/ is a libertarian board anyway
  a board about fucking food has to have a political bend  /pol/ is that way
  commie bastard
  really depends on what the issue is and the customers behavior    if theyre being polite about it probably not at all
i want to go out to eat at a nice restaurant tonight what kind of food should i get
  get a hot girl to brap in your mouth instead loser
  i want this where can i find a girl i have no friends
  treat yourself with the incredible classic meal deal from mcdonalds for only 6 you can choose between the iconic big mac loaded with shredded lettuce and the famous sauce we all love the quarter pounder with cheese made with 100 fresh ground beef the filetofish good enough for any sea lover or 10 chicken mcnuggets fried to a perfect golden brown and served with a delectable dipping sauce of your choice  along with your choice you receive a small order of french fries  always hot and crispy plus you get a warm delicious apple pie just like grandma used to make for dessert and wash it all down your favorite cocacola product or iced tea ba da da da im lovin it
  just offer one some money works everytime

what is good road trip food for lots of driving    all i can think of is pic related and water bottles maybe beef jerky    what does /ck/ like to buy before long drives
  dried squid/cuttlefish session beer salty licorice
  nuts trail mix and other shit anything high in sugar is a bad idea since it can tend to make you more tired
grab a crave case
  fruit and nuts
reminder that air heads is the brand name for a reason
iced tea coffee cigarettes refill tea beer in that order
  none eat before you go and wait until you arrive
  never tried dried seafood before session beer not sure about that im curious about that salty licorice though    i agree with you with the sugar making me tired i know exactly what foods to eat and at what times in order to maximize my levels of awakedess      i wish theres no white castles along my route though      im going to have to go make myself a custom trail mix in the bulk section of the grocery store thanks for the obvious idea i somehow didnt even think about      opme is a mega airhead      how about we make it yerba mate pot vape pen and coconut water in that order      already planning on doing that im rolling up a burrito made with pinto beans rice corn tortilla strips and guacamole massive amounts of food and concentration energy there it is the perfect food for the brain    the only reason i mention sugary snacks is because im going to be driving 12 hours with many leisurely recreational breaks in between
what to do with them leftovers soup feed the rats bin it
  use them to feed a dog when the dog is fat enough you can cook the dog youre welcome
donate them to science
  soup and sandwiches
  checked  suddenly i want to eat dog flesh
  feeding rats with chicken or any type of meat really  i shiggy diggy
  will buy a dog like this feed the monster then eat him
  
  entire chicken drum is leftover
  reheat via frying with some pasta and sauteed veggies
  i am working on a business plan that involves feeding rats on cats actually  and vice versa
  you dont want to feed meat to rats because that makes them carnivore as result they eat each other and you lose your rats  if you want them to eat cats then i guess you should eat meat but i dont see how a cat can be devoured by a rat unless the rat has friends helping yet a rat cant have friends if its carnivore such is life
  why is this post so low in the thread  that whole plate is edible dont you eat crispy skin  some people eat the cartilage too
  thats way too much meat for rats unless you have a shitton of rats i mean at least 50 meat is good for rats sparingly only
  he doesnt chicken his coffee
/grill/
omg i hate grownups now
  ooh yea baby i learned i could light wood chips in a propane grill and rotisserie anything in a basket smokes to the bone
i dont know who weber is but he is a god amongst men
/smoke/
how do you clean your grill i just scrub most of it off and wash it with a lemon once its heated up but some of my friends have taken exception to this and want me to wash it every time ive been eating off a grill like that for twenty nine years and ive never gotten sick from it
  heat and a steel brush is all ive ever needed never got sick why would i
  replace lemon with half an onion with oil
    looks good how long
  the lemon is too traditional to drop but ill try the onion in addition
grilling has been tough ever since i lost my grilling partner a few months ago there he is in the background
  the little brisket was around 5 and half or 6 hours the ribs are 3 hours then wrapped in foil for 2 hours and then one more hour with the sauce in the last 30 minutes id like to get a new grill soon the pellet smoker i have is great for what it is but i want one of those big dick smokers that you see them use on tv
  im sorry man 
  i remember you that was a good thread the dog died thats a bummer man  f
  this is the most facebook of posts  but he looks like a gudboi and needs a tummy rub
  sorry bro i know how tough that is 
  hes pretending not to notice large amounts of meat being cooked in heaven now
any of you guys ever use those weber or grill mates seasoning mixes some of them are surprisingly really good especially the chicken ones
            thanks anons he lived a great long life      yes i like pic related a lot
    i used it on chicken hearts of all things
  is that his stomach or his boner
  sorry about the pup anon 
  i remember you too i took your advice and grilled some hearts i also tried gizzards the gizzards sucked but the hearts were delicious thanks for the tip man
  file deleted  why there wasnt anything wrong with it

  he just wants white supremacy dude not too much to ask  brown eggs taste like shit anyway
its illegal in america so it doesnt matter
  what do you mean i thought the clan still exists
  he just want you to get the best  white and yellow

  grape nuts my dude
shot this tastey fucker does /ck/ like wild game
  seek help
hung for 3 days to get all the blood out
  not particularly but i like deer jerky      go away
skinned and ready to be broken down
look at this hock yum
  make jerky
  i have a piece of paper issued by the state government that says harvesting wildlife is not only legal its necessary your move vegfag
  tracking your exif data now triangulating with your ip ok done i have your location and am now on my way to tear up your phony murder permit
do you keep the organs i dont know why but i get the feeling most hunters dump them
ive liked deer and reindeer whenever ive had them but they are expensive beasts to buy
  you probably shot it with your assault rifle 15 with extended clips drumpftard we all know 556 is designed to wound not to kill you monster poor thing must have died in agony
    what would blood sausage from venison taste like im guessing intensely gamey
  hope not thatll fuck up the meat a good hunter takes a clean shot to paralyze or brain the motherfucker instantly
  i know this is bait but it has always been funny to me that vegfags are so opposed to hunting its literally the least cruel  environmentally impactful way to procure meat for the table
  i thought there would be no useable meat left on the carcass if shot with an assault rifle 15
  i kept the heart sometimes i keep the liver depending on its condition it really depends on if its a gun kill or a bow kill a bow kill usually leaves the liver in great shape a gun kill not so much  when the bullet hits it sends shock waves all through the body and ruptures lots of the offal i much prefer bow killed deer but this one was gun the liver was iffy so i left it for the foxes and coyotes   ive tried the lungs before they were stringy and tasteless   deer kidney is quite strong tasting not my thing   the stomach is so much work to clean out to get tripe ive done it a handful of times but usually killing a deer is a race against the clock  wanna get the thing field dressed and hanging before the meat starts to spoil so im generally not going to take the time to rinse out the stomach   heart is delicious as fuck tho
  thats only when you load the assault rifle 15 with minorityseeking armourpiercing bullets which instantly obliterate dark meat
vegans are retarded when the deer population gets too large the government literally hires people to go out on helicopters to shoot them down at least with hunting people get to eat the meat and use something from the animal       i heard stuffed deer heart is delicious never had it though
  eeesh deer fat has a really musky smell to it the taste is unpleasant no thanks
  do you hunt with bow rifle and bow
  when the deer population gets too large  hmmm i wonder whose fault that is
  go back to /pol/    45 cal muzzle loader not as much meat damage as a 50
  its so tender and think about it its an organ continuously bathed in hyper oxygenated blood its so good     yes i prefer the bow but once gun season starts the animals are nearly impossible to get close enough to for a clean bow kill and no centerfire rifles allowed here only muzzleloaders or shotguns
  /pol/  not back to /k/ where i came from  did i take the /pol/ boogeymanbait just now by replying
  whatever its not about food you dick mods
  your post complaining about his post isnt about food either i hope the mods ban you    pretzels
  looks tasty
  not only did you misspell tasty tasty is a fucking cringe word like yummy only girls use it
  he has unironic trigger words  yikes sweety
  if op has a pair of boobs and took down that doe she is the queen of /ck/
hunter bros i know nothing about it but ive done some reading lately i had assumed that the ideal place to shoot for a quick painless kill would be the head but the texas hunting license reading material recommends shooting just above and in front of the front legs so as to get the heart is this correct is it because its an easier shot or is there another reason
  its usually pretty hard to hit the head which is why they recommend aiming for center mass i aim for the lungs which takes them down pretty quickly and preserves the heart but aiming for the heart is also a valid strategy
  cry more pussy
  based
  blowing the deers jaw off wont kill it it will just slowly starve to death anything in the boiler room upper chest cavity will kill it pretty much right away it might run for a couple hundred yards but it will be dead in less than a half hour any gut shot in the lower chest cavity is bad news will take a day to die and youre probably not going to find it
look at this glorious shank
a deer died for this thread
  if you have a manual bone saw looks like a large hack saw or i suppose you could use a hack saw cut up the bones for venison stock really rich tasting well worth the effort dont use the spinal column though as that will contain the bacteria causing chronic wasting disease if it was infected
  yeah better let these things crash their own ecosystem
  check out this shank  teleports behind you
  nice  i wish my dad taught me how to hunt
leg steaks they grill like shit but come out great sousvide i preseason and freeze with herbs and some added fat usually butter or pork fat
  i live in the uk i wish i could hunt my own meat like this and live off the land only thing we can really do is fish cant even hunt rabbits without needing landowners permission theres no wilderness to just go hunting everyone is such a little pussy when it comes to hunting here too they act like its the worst thing you can do shooting the poor animals meanwhile they go and buy their factory farmed meat the hypocrisy and ignorance is astounding
  cant even hunt rabbits without needing landowners permission    is it really that hard to get landowners permission
  not gonna even mince words the public trust doctrine that makes wilderness available to all and protects hunting from becoming only available to elites is the best part of america
  underrated metakek
  well theyre liable if anything happens when youre on their land so you or anyone else could sue them or they themselves could be prosecuted unless you know them personally they are very reluctant maybe many years ago it might have been different but in modern times when you have to be very careful due to the law coming down on you like a stack of bricks
  well theyre liable if anything happens when youre on their land so you or anyone else could sue them or they themselves could be prosecuted    its the same thing here in the states we are infamous for being lawsuithappy after all but its no big deal to find private land to hunt on if you dont know any landowners personally which seems statistically unlikely unless you are a shutin then people will advertise in papers an online that you can hunt on their land depending on the species you want to hunt you might have to pay for it or you might get paid for it ive had farmers pay me to shoot rabbits feral hogs etc    i once paid for the use of a deer lease and the landowner explained to me that there was a mountain lion on his property and he had it on camera killing his goats and some of the young deer he told me that it was a condition of the lease that if i saw it i was to shoot it if i wanted the trophy to mount it would have cost me 2k otherwise i would be paid 500 if i let him have it this was actually in our lease agreement
  doesnt scotland or wales have some areas for public hunting
    in several states private property is open to public hunting unless the property owner posts no trespassing/no hunting signs
  thats pretty badass anon  did you bag the cat
i can get wild boar and alligator meat on the regular down here in florida im no hunter though i just buy it fresh and break it down at home cant really get deer a lot on the gulf where im at but i have eaten some fucked up birds illegally
  are you the anon who beats his wife in the pasta 
  nope i didnt even see it i did hear it though
  dude that is the scariest sound i had one yelling at me while i was in a tree stand it sounded like a woman getting gang raped no lie     i also heard a coyote vs turkey last week the turkey lost but the sounds were nothing short of alien
whats your favorite venison recipe op
  yeah its scary alright    a raccoon fight sounds like hell on earth
  ill give you my two favorites  venison loin backstrap  dry rub of ground coffee black pepper coarse salt garlic and something piney like juniper or rosemary  cut the rubbed loin into 15 medallions  shiitake mushrooms or even portabella cook just long enough to release water but not a second more   hot pan thin coating of clarified butter throw in whatever aromatics you have on hand an cook just long enough to release some oils and then discard  star anise fennel seeds etc quick sear on the medallions  make a 2 minute pan sauce with the remaining clarified butter scraped up fonds usually by adding some kind of berry blackberry blueberry pomegranate seeds lingonberry it all works great   usually i serve with some kind of root veg puree like celery or sweet potato and a hard green like brussles it doesnt really have a coffee taste the rub gives it some earthy tones its really nice and goes great with the mushrooms     recipe 2 venison cassoulet with chestnuts   this one is a pain in the ass but its worth it check out emerels venison cassoulet recipe generally i follow that no reason to retype it here except i add roasted chestnuts and instead of andouille i use my own spicy sausage made from venison cut with pork fat white potato and red pepper flakes cassoulet takes a while but its so good     
and no centerfire rifles allowed here  joisey
  even worse
  exif data  on 4channel
  its humanitys fault that the deer population can get so out of control in populated areas or those stripped of large predators thats why we have a responsibility to mitigate the damage
  this anon is correct get some help     its a lot easier to butcher game with a friend or two and it means the meat will hit the freezer sooner which is better
  most hunters i know try to salvage the heart and liver then donate the rest to the critters
  i only eat wild game no farmed meat for me
  get the heart is this correct  heart / lungs yes
  does cumin go with venison
  im always cumin when i shoot a deer
  just buy wild game if its for food  if you just wanna go hunting then i know your struggle
  why do you post this edgy shit
  get some help  you really dont need it for deer if you are not a twink faggot or you shoot a trophy you can clean a fucking deer by yourself the only real difficult shit is when its 5f out with a 15mph winds that shit fucking blows      hung for 3 days to get all the blood out  what the fuck why just clean it fresh and get that backstrap on the grill
  most hunters get rid of all the organs i keep the heart though because im from louisiana and thats just how we do shit        if you get someone who knows what they are doing the heart can be one of the best parts of the deer
  i respect the fact that you are willing to kill and butcher an animal to eat most eat meat and refuse to even look at an animal dying
  yeah lol most people wouldnt be able to stomach squirrel hunting if you kinda get a shitty shot and hit their hinds then you have to beat them on a tree to kill them i hated it when i was a kid probably because it took me 5 or 6 swings to kill it    but once you kill enough animals it doesnt even matter its just food not a cogent being
  preparing and eating eating meat is edgy    you vegans are annoying no one likes you preaching go away
  gamey shit the only good cut are the backstraps
  t woman
  this might be an insanely stupid question but how do you prevent the meat from spoiling while you drain the blood is it just really cold there or does it take a while to spoil
  just dont do it its very unnecessary if you clean it immediately ive literally never drained a deer in my life and they have all tasted normal    also for colder climates its usually below 32 most nights because deer season is in the winter
  hey i know that chink she has a youtube food channel right
  i think that anon is conflating two different things    the blood drains out of an animal very fast it only takes a few minutes however it is common to hang game for a period of time this has nothing to do with draining the blood out rather the idea is to let the meat start to partially decomose which improves its flavor i dont mean decompose in the sense of rotting but rather the enzymes in the meat start to break it down and change the taste its the exact same principle thats applied to beef or pork when you buy it at the supermarketits been aged aka hung at the slaughterhouse before it even got to market hanging game is the same idea as wetaging meat    if you do it too long then yeah the meat will spoil and it does need to be cold otherwise it will spoil too
  but once you kill enough animals it doesnt even matter its just food not a cogent being  thats were i would argue you are wrong i personally think killing comes from a dark place inside a human being even moreso when it is done for fun i mean i do respect the fact that you kill to eat even though it isnt needed as opposed to those who eat meat and refuse to acknowledge the reality of how their food is processed
  ar 15s are basically just fancy hunting rifles anon
  im so sorry anon
  as a cajun i have killed literally thousands of animals i 100 disagree i think it has more to do with honor than evil one thing thats always passed on is that you never kill for fun unless its necessaryboars n shit and to never mock the animals ive even had friends who prayed over the body after killing bigger game like deer and turkey    personally i dont give a fuck i love the way it tastes and theres no other factors in it idc about honor i dont get a sick happiness from it i just want some good ass food    as for having fun while hunting it depends bigger game where you have to sit and track or wait long periods of time i think the fun is the chase the primal instinct that we all forget when we have food readily available and fast hunting like duck and squirrel is more about the precision and fun    combine that with the fact that hunting is commonly done with all the males and their friends its a bonding thing saying it is evil means youve never been apart of a hunting culture
  not a cogent being  disagree ive been hunting since i was 12 yo starting with squirrels and rabbits progressing to pheasant/quail and deer and i still feel sadness at the kill it was a beautiful being in the full bloom of life endowed with the same spirit of life coursing through me worst part of the hunt imho but im willing to subject myself to it for the meat youd better believe i waste none of it though
been eating moose meat omelettes all week until today i decided to make it into chili
    its the same thing here in the states we are infamous for being lawsuithappy after all  eh its the opposite i thought at least for ny  i agree to conduct myself safely responsibly and lawfully respecting the landowner property and others using it i accept the responsibilities which are part of the activities which i pursue i agree to comply with the instructions of the landowner while on this property  i understand that the laws of new york state absolve the landowner from liability for nonpaying recreationists engaged in hunting fishing trapping boating hiking and certain other activities except in the case of willful or malicious failure to guard or warn of hazards
  hmm thats weird i understand what you mean as i felt similarly as a kid because some of the shit was brutish like beating the squirrels to death cutting the throat on a deer etc but i havent felt sad since i was a kid maybe its because of my culture and the fact that it was applauded and the feeling you would get when your dad would bring you and the kill back to the camp and everyone was so happy for you and cheering you on idk how anyone can see it as evil or sad
  vermont is like this
  nope theyre human killing machines and not at all good for hunting a bolt action 3006 is far more accurate and effective for hunting if you see some fag hunting with an ar15 you can be sure they have no clue what theyre doing and get the hell out of the area because theyre the type of imbecile who will spray rounds into brush where they heard noise w/o identifying the target
  when i was a boy my father taught me to take a bite to the heart when the deer was killed
  you can use them for deer you just have to aim well
  i didnt mean to imply it was evil of course as i still hunt to this day idk just has always affected me that way at the kill but emotion like that isnt really rational so i generally keep it to myself other than talking to my wife about it irl just thought id mention it as a divergent viewpoint to yours as a hunter
  3006 is fine if a little too large a round for whitetail 3030 or 308 is ideal also all this talk of hunting deer with an ar where can you hunt deer with a semi auto ive never heard of this in the states
  ah thats fair
i enjoy game for sure particularly rabbit squirrel dove pheasant grouse and venison
  semiauto is legal in my state and surrounding states but its the south
  where can you hunt deer with a semi auto  you can hunt deer with a semi auto in ny barring areas like long island that dont even allow rifle hunting at all i doubt youll find that restriction anywhere on a state level    for a competent person using a semiauto rifle to hunt deer should be akin to using a shotgun with slugs to hunt deer its about the swissarmyknife i can use my gun for everything approach not i can shoot bullets faster weeeee
  small deer dont benefit from hanging but big old mature deer really do its a night and day difference with taste and tenderness
  ive shot and eaten probably 50 deer in my life and every time its an emotional roller coaster heart beats out of my chest
if its raised on a farm sure    i dont like lead shards or prions in my food
  bring this incorrect    as long as it doesnt get above 42 a deer can hang for a couple weeks and yes it rarely gets above 40 where i live between thanksgiving and march 1
  why did you kill a beautiful being are humans next for you
  i respectfully disagree but i do admit that that the difference is subtle
  its not exactly fun in the way a roller coaster is fun maybe its fun in the way that a horror movie is fun its a radically emotional experience to kill megafauna fishing on the other hand is fun as fuck
  100 this
  veganiggers seething
  how is fishing fun as fuck standing in the same spot for hours on end without catching anything then when you do catch something you have to rip a hook out of a poor fish just to toss it back into the water like what the fuck is the point of that shit so fucking stupid
  223/556 is illegal in every state for deer 23 is the min caliber
  hours on end without catching anything  youre doing it wrong    or sometimes thats the whole point its an excuse to get out and enjoy nature just chill for a while without the annoyances of modern life
  imagine not eating your catch
  youre doing it wrong   pic related
sothis being my only hunting rifle how bad an idea would it be to use it for deer
  hello fellow massbro north shore here
  semi autos are even legal in california although there are mag limits and other limitations they impose they were selling ars for 500 at a gun show last february and california doesnt have gun show exemptions so i know theyre straight legal

  yep squirrel pies made with acorn flour
  ive made corned deer heart for breakfast hash and its pretty damn tasty
  this is the most ethical way to obtain meat that deer had the opportunity to frolic munch on grass and fuck he had to eventually succumb to the circle of life but im guessing the death op gave this animal was much better than any sort of death you would meet in the wild
  arkansas mississippi or alabama
  you natives are something else
    maybe so i hunt deer up near natchez mississippi and ive never done it most ive let them hang was on bitter cold nights where i just wait until morning to clean it
  georgia drunken squirrel with pumpkin dumplings
  i personally use 556 because the wounded deer has to be dragged to a deer medic by two of his deer buddies  i get three deer that way  but why not shoot the medic deer too  im not a fucking monster
  get a load of this faggot
  what part of georgia my dude up in dahlonega here
both of those rounds are in the same weight class except for 3030 which is about on the same level as blackpowder
  thats pretty culturally insensitive you faggot
    squirrel nowadays has an image of being whitetrash food but its very good all dark meat and nicely flavored since they eat mostly nuts and seeds they arent tame like suburban squirrels either so they can be challenging to hunt as theyll see and hear you so you have to walk into their area sit motionless for awhile before theyll start coming out from hiding good training for deer hunting
fall for the cast iron meme  season it properly  try to cook  it still sticks  ok now this is based
  im also gay i left that part out not sure if that matters
  do we really need another thread about this faggot
cast iron supporters are cucks who pride themselves on doing things in a more difficult manner as an arbitrary display of ability even at the cost of the dish
  im ready to filter cast
  what is with all of the cast iron threads are you fags upset that youve never seen cast iron before do you think this is suddenly a new thing i have castiron cookware that i inherited from my grandmother the shit lasts forever and it is not rocket science to cook with at all
  dollars to donuts its one dude making them at least when i made all those seinfeld threads here it was fun
  this its just stupid
  every 4chan board has a joke that some anon beat completely to death cast iron jackposting and sushi is raw fish seem to be some of ours
  theres always been cast iron threads on /ck/
  a cuck has a natural inclination to do things in such a way that are traditional and require a bit more time and effort    woah does your wife assure you that youre not a cuck and that the most manly thing you can do is let another man fuck her because its quicker and easier and when jamal and tyrone have her doublestuffed like an oreo it just werks and she cums so much easier than if you had bothered fucking her
  there really havent been too many of them in the past couple years now theres like 4 up at once and theyre all mocking the use of cast iron
  not like this not even close
  so its only ok when you circlejerk about it and shit on nonstick but not this right redditor
  0/10
  simply based lets circlejerk bro we are superior
  he doesnt jerk off with his bros  fag detected
my mom stripped all the seasoning off of mine with brillo and then got an attitude with me about it  youre supposed to reseason it every time  no fuck off    so i wiped it with oil and all that turned the oven up to 550  filled the whole house up with smoke    but let me tell you the seasoning is high level now
  sushi is raw fish  its fucking ruuuuaw you donkey
  more difficult  huh
its a meme
  a lot of people honestly believe that cast iron takes special care or treatment
  it objectively does tho
  thats only what virtue signaling try hard redditor faggots would have you believe the truth is the less you do to your cast iron the better only exception is if youre reconditioned an abused pan but this is an extreme case
  im a borderline retraced alcoholic and i cook with cast iron all the time no problem
  not the point
  help me figure this out ive tried nothing and im all out of options
need some assistance lads mistook how hot my pan was misplaced it and melted a cheap microfiber cloth onto the bottom its caramelized onto the bottom im going to try to get it off with steel wool baking soda and vinegar but im concerned about the porousness of the metal will i need to be worried about fumes or anything when im finished cleaning should i even bother salvaging it or should i scrap the pan entirely
  fuck that ive gone to the white ceramic pans and never looked back
fucking retard kys making eggs in cast iron
oh look another faggot that cant preheat and oil a skillet
    eggs on cast iron    when did your mother start to hate you
  use a proper oven cloth next time to salvage it  scrub off the gunk with steel wool  heat it up hot to open the pores theyll still be there by leaving it in a 450f oven for 30 minutes  apply a thin coat of canola oil or whatever you prefer for your seasoning all over the entire pan  do another 30 minutes in the oven to hold the seasoning past its smoking point so it doesnt go rancid  turn off the oven and just leave the pan in there to cool
  its not that bad or difficult cast iron is a very easy way to do fried eggs if you actually know how to use it    that said i never use cast iron to cook eggs i make omelette in the morning using a tamagoyaki pan or a stainless steel skillet
  he cant cook eggs easily with any skillet  truly youre a lost cause being able to cook perfect eggs easily under any circumstances is the first step to being a competent cook    remember folks these are the illiterates trying to discourse with you about food and cooking
  enjoy your whole life cleaning egg off your 800 year old pan fag lord
  there is a saying in my country   a shitty dancer will complain about his balls too   so either you didnt season it properly or didnt heat it up enough before putting your shit in it learn your shit about the tools and how to work with them before blaming that shit
  yikes bud looks like youre just retarded
  that toast is a war crime
  try cooking on nothing but cast iron for 1 maybe 2 weeks print pic related and put it on your fridge follow it every time you cook and youll have mastered cast iron it may be more time consuming than other cooking materials to work with but after those two weeks youll understand what having a good cast iron around can do for you it will always be there for you when you need it and it will never let you down again i almost always cook with stainless steel but i know that if i really need what that cast iron can do ill be able to call it up to rush to my aid
  the right one did cook a bit too much but it started off whole wheat so it was already dark i buttered it and pan fried it tasted pretty gud
  first 5 are useless 10 and 11 are only necessary for restoring a pan 6 is a useful tip 79 are common sense for any iron or steel item in your kitchen yes stainless can rust this stupid shit is what turns people off and gives memelords ammunition
  all that work just to use a fucking pan jesus christ
  exhibit a
  lets see you cook french omlette in a ci fuckface
  ive done it i dont have pics its my favorite pan for spanish tortilla too
  thanks for the walkthrough this will definitely be a one time mistake will do this tomorrow
  youre probably doing something wrong growing up cast iron was the only pan we had worked like a charm
  tradition is pointless if it doesnt have benefits cast iron is just a waste of time it doesnt provide a better finished product that modern or more specialized tools its harder to work with and maintain all for the pretentious sake of being old school
when it comes to eggs all u need to know is heat control and be semiliberal with your oil
  tradition is pointless if it doesnt have benefits  agreed     it doesnt provide a better finished product that modern or more specialized tools  from a modern perspective it is a specialized tool it is superior for applications involving absorbing heat such as baking in the oven because of its high emissivity its also good for highheat use like searing due to its thermal mass     to work with or maintain  nope unless you count seasoning it once properly seasoned iron requires no different care from any other pan     for the pretentious sake of being old school  depends really its pretty dumb if thats why you use ci but assuming thats the only reason to use it is insane its a different tool for certain jobs    cast iron for baking and highheat use  nonstick for delicate foods which stick easily  stainless for generating fond so you can deglaze and make pan sauces  copper for jam candy and emulsified sauces    i think its pretty dumb to use ci for everything but to suggest it doesnt have its benefits is completely wrong
  so its the same as cooking any other food in a pan got it
  i did it perfectly and it still sticks
  i did it perfectly  obviously you didnt
  i did it why cant you admit that cast iron is prone to sticking
  you didnt    im a cast iron fag and i used to think the same thing its just really really difficult to master    straight up learning it isnt worth the time and frustration it is marginally better than regular pans so now that i can do it right i enjoy it but if someone had told me it would take literally years to get it right and many many botched meals i wouldnt have bothered
  i do stupid outdated things for imaginary points on the anonymous internet
  dollars to donuts  i fucking love this saying why isnt it more mainstream
  this holy fuck ill take another /pol/ thread over one of these
how do i cut an union   no relevant picture sorry  i want to make tiny pieces
  scissers
ez    
how do i cut a union  open fire on fort sumter
  put the onion in the blender for 2 minutes or so
this is how i do it as a guy with no knife skills  cut off top and bottom  cut incision through top layer and pull it off  cut in half from top to bottom  onion should now look like pic related  cut slices front to back yellow bulby things should be the last slice not first so the slices stick together for whatever reason  now slice left to right  works every time i hope my instructions are readable

  labor unions  the judaism in this thread has just increased by 500
  huh
  huh what
  a human resources department
  what does judaism have to do with labour unions
tis is a really good guide except for the useless horizontal cuts    
  capitalism  good  unions  socialism  jews  bad    i guarantee youre talking to an amerifat
  yeah i know its just /pol/ garbage but even if unions meant socialism all marxistleninist communist parties have been aggressively secular and marx and engels were famously atheists it caused great personal trouble to engels due to his religious family and their mocking of religion was very controversial at the time the famous quote religion is the opiate of the masses from marx plus israel and most large jewish groups around the world are right wing and very anti communist and anti socialist how cut off from history and politics do you have to be to really think this stuff
  its literal corporate astroturfing and it works very well the idea of workers leveraging their market power to get themselves higher wages is completely capitalist

what are some good radish recipes ive got a lot of these guys and outside of salads ive got no idea
uuuuuuhhh boneless pizza
i saw eric ripert spread butter on them and eat them raw its pretty good shit
roast them and serve as a side like you would potatoes
  theres only 1 good radish for that and its french breakfast radishes any other kind is nasty   luckily you can find them in supermarkets now
  use them in a red pasta sauce
  smashed radish with boiled dough strands is pretty good
  i like to fry up a steak and then deglaze the pan with shiraz and sautee halved radishes and garlic in it then at the last minute wilt the radish greens in it and serve up with the steak its the laziest fancy side dish ever
  cut into flowers or halves squeeze fresh lime juice add salt and good hot sauce like black label valentina tajin optional though great on jicamas
butter a piece of good bread and add thinly sliced radish i love that shit
  sammich in any sandwich where you would use cucumber you can use radish instead or both
  radish soup
  thats s very cute mouse i hope its your pet
would you go to a resturant where you can pick your own waitress and waiter tbh some click better with you then the other
  that black guy is banging the other two waitresses

hows the stool
  gout my dude
  are they really peas though
  i go like 3 times a day it probably takes around the same time for me to shit as it does to piss pretty nice actually
too much fiber can actually be a problem it rarely comes up because 90 of people get too little instead theres probably a decent amount of phytic acid as well which would be something to consider
  ive been thinking about thos beans
  really what in them causes gout      unfortunately not
   is this bad for my health
  purines in legumes and beans can put a massive strain on your kidneys and uric acids build up in your joints something along those lines   my doctor told me to cut back on the rice and beans because i had high uric acid cleared right up
  shit nigga i should get my uric acid levels tested
do you leave milk and cookies out for santa
yes but im santa
  eats you instead
no but i leave carrots out for sinterklaas horse owo
  based zwarte peit poster
  this nigga eating pepernoten
every year i leave out a spread like this and a note which reads    touch this and you die    he always heeds my warning
  yes but both are home made the milk gets yellow after some time
i was poor growing up and would leave out sprite and potato chips there must be a santa though because it always got eaten
  that wasnt santa that was me
  that was me after i was done fucking your mother builds an appetite
  not in like 25 years
  leaving food out for burglars     do you live in sweden
  i did one year its a good way to find out if you have a mouse i left it on the floor next to the tree after my parents got rid of the mouse only caught one we kept finding pieces of stale christmas cookie stashed all over the house that little guy was a busy little boy
tfw mother cheated on my father when i was 9  he found out about it on december 24th  kicked off and went bananas  beat the shit out of her and threw her out of the house  instead of putting cookies and milk out for santa he made me write out a detailed account of my mother getting fucked by another man  said to leave it out so santa knew that this house had a cheater living in it  next morning opened my presents alone whilst dad was sleeping in bed  mother came back 2 weeks later and they got a divorce  every christmas with him after that he made me do the same thing  only difference every year was that the man fucking my mother became more like santa so one year hed make him have a red hat then hed also be fat the following year  when i stopped believing in santa at 15 he kept making me do it  tfw dont talk to him anymore

  no christmas is a pagan holiday
i leave my butt out for santa
anyone have experience with a perpetual stew    
  im disappointed this didnt turn into a sundae ramen thread
most of what i eat is some kind of soup curry or chili ive done this with soups a few times right when the soup in my fridge is about to go bad i use it to start another pot of soup kind of similar to how the same sourdough starter is used and changed over hundreds of years for some bakeries     it still scares me though like something bad or infectious in the broth cant be cooked out so i try to finish it quick i think im probably being paranoid though after reading ops article     its fine really it makes new flavor when you cook soup like this but its very very subtle the flavors you get are certainly new and interesting but nothing super special
  i wonder if a hungarian paprika fish stew would be a good starting point
  thats a bit different because hunters stew is boiling 24/7 for several weeks or months if you constantly heat/cool something bacteria will keep multiplying when its cold enough heating it might kill the bacteria but wont get rid of the trash they leave behind which can also cause food poisoning
  having a constant pot which is either added to or taken from but not emptied sounds wonderful to me
how does something like this not eventually go bad
  slop of random shit  lul  muh medieval inn experience  skip out on vaccines and otc meds to get that immersion rolling
  constant boiling prevents bacteria and mold development
reminds me of the community soups in kc
  constant heat ensures no bacteria growth
  probably not     every time you boil it youre pasteurizing
  probably not what
  ive done something kinda similar reusing liquid only from stews and definitely not used every day i froze the bitch   off flavors were gotten after 34 uses not sure whatll happen if you do it continously
  perpetual slop o shit
  my mom does one every winter she starts a pot from thanksgiving leftovers and keeps it on the simmer burner till new years adding something whenever it dips below half its fucking delicious but it tends to get too salty towards the end
  common bacterium will multiply under non cooking conditions anything less than 65c  they will be killed off during extended periods above that slightly less than a rolling boil
  as i said bacteria isnt the only thing that causes food poisoning the trash they leave behind also can and no amount of boiling will get rid of that if a piece of meat start getting purulent or slimy you dont boil it and and say its ok to eat because youre pasteurizing it
  reread what i said amerilard
  then your first answer didnt have jack shit to do with the first post you quoted you should try reading it again yourself
  botulinum makes spores that survive up to 128c
  but bacteria really is the only thing that causes food poisoning its possible to have other chemical poisons in food but thats not food poisoning its just poisoning food poisoning is only from consuming poisonous chemicals produced by bacterial cultures living in food
  jesus the amount of brainlets with no reading comprehension i have to deal with today is astounding
  bacteria is the only thing that causes it it does not spring out of nowhere learn to write before you accuse other people of misinterpreting you
  alright you fucking retard what do you think the trash they leave behind in my post means what do you think the they in it refers to  it refers to bacteria you retarded mongrel and the trash is what you call poisonous chemicals produced by bacterial cultures living in food  i was discussing whether killing bacteria was enough to prevent poisoning which i was arguing wasnt  when i said bacteria isnt the only thing that causes food poisoning i meant living bacteria  you were literally saying the exact same thing i was while telling me i was wrong  so get fucked and double fucked you retarded inbred motherfucking triple nigger faggot
  imagine the crunch on that bad boy
when i was younger i used to do this with ramen     not exactly the same thing but we were poor so you got more flavor if you constantly reused old broth and such left over    youd end up with chicken oriental and hot and spicy all together after like 50 bowls     tasted pretty good but i doubt it was super healthy
  perpetual stew no perpetually fucking ya mutha all eternity long xd lmao rofl
  you added nothing of note to the conversation back to kekkit for you
this reminds me of chongqing old hot pot in the most traditional places the same oil is used again and again and again from customer to customer some places boast having the same oil after 50 years people are split because some people say its the tastiest whilst others say its dangerous and disgusting
  i have a perpetual bone broth always cooking its quite easy to keep it at a high temp without using much energy just turn the stove to lowest setting and put a lid on add some cloth under the lid if its not tight enough in your opinion   and 3 times a day i bring it to a quick boil and then back down      the beauty of a bone broth its extremely frugal and healthy when eating chicken the bones need not be discarded but instead broken in half and added to the broth   this is custom in countries like korea the resulting broth that is often high in collagen and other proteins is extremely good for your skin and ligaments seems i went on a bit of tangent here i like talking about frugal foods     oh and brown mushrooms go really well with this they add a deep brown color watch out with peppercorns add a spoon too many and leave it in too long they will of course gradually release more and more intensity into the broth   if you want something more fat and yummy and collagen rich pigs feet or any kind of mammal feet for that matter are an excellent choice for they are very high in collagen i believe ducks feet are the best   unfortunately here in the west this kind of simple knowledge is not known the same goes for herbs we have growing everywhere very few think to pick them instead they opt for crops littered with pesticides it looks like i went off on a tangent again       and i know the duck is not a mammal
  phone poster begone
  the gas bill must be expensive
  lurk more
  its electric stove i just keep it on lowest setting
  this got me really interested i definitely should try this
    someone get this hothead outta here
    i was gonna sayid love to try this but id be scared of burning my house down when i leave    wonder what some definite donts would be when making this i would think beans and rice since theyd turn to mush and you could never really getv them out of there also dairy obviously but maybe im retarded
  with a big enough pot and enough water you wouldnt have to worry about it unless you put the stove at the highest heat
  just a 3 day perpetual beef gulasch which i added ingredients to 2 times apart from potto which i added 34 hours before eating them as to not overcook them i bought a slow cooker some time ago which i highly recommend
i was thinking about doing something like that on a stove pot just keep it all the time at the lowest setting and do a quick boil 3 times a day but im kinda worried about keeping the stove on unattended during nights and grocery shopping even with the lowest setting    whats the probability of any accidents happening if i keep the stove constantly on the lowest setting
  get a big pot keep the lid on and dont overfill it
  see    crockpot/slowcooker is the safest to leave unattended they are designed for that purpose
  this anon is right    just let eggs go bad for example not boil them all the bacteria is dead you still wouldnt eat it right because the bacteria have already produced toxic chemicals and killing the bacteria will not reverse that it will only stop them from producing even more
  hows your gas bill
anybody else started exclusively eating mres
  not eating mres but most of my food is freeze dried or dehydrated
  are you trying to land in the hospital from constipation
  i want to eat a genuine us military mre but the fuck if i trust ebay resellers
  find an army surplus  my wife was in the air force she also taste tested mres she says most are bretty tasty but super packed with nutrients she also says bretty much this 
  i was in the infantry for 10 years if i never eat another mre before i die ill have lived a great existence
id buy some to be able to fix a quick meal in the pinch but they cost an arm and leg for whats in them
  ate enough mri already    i do miss the beans and weiners one sometimes desu
  why the fuck would you do that
  i havent taken a shit in over a year now thanks to this diet
  i havent taken a shit  you take shits  i leave them
  t never eaten mres for a long period of time
  that couldnt possibly be healthy or economical
  ive never had a problem with them mres come in sealed pouches inside another big sealed pouch tampering would be obvious the seller removing items would be obvious and paypal pretty much automatically sides with the buyer these days in the event of a dispute
    almost unpleasant
  no but i usually keep some in my room for midnight snacks
  you must like shitting footballs or something
there arent enough tiny tabasco sauce bottles in the world
how do you deal with the price i cant find any source for under 45 a serving
  i only ate them when i could get them for free the company i worked for was working on an rd project with one of the mre contractors    paying money for mres is a fools errand unless you need them for camping or something like that
  how hard are your shits theres a reasonshy them shits come with toilet paper
  yes so you can save up 2 mre issues of tp over 3 days so you can wipe 6 times when your ass reaches critical mass and you have nothing but blood and a mess to dense it has no smell
  i was never in the military but i spent a good amount of time training medical staff outside refugee camps which were under military guard and if i need to assist for fieldwork which was uncommon because im a civilian for weeks at a time these were a staple fucking shitting in a desert latrine sucks enough but the constipation jokes are no joke that and the locals found a white dude shitting highly curious so there was always company
  cant say i have no fucking faggot
  anons on /k/ have been doing this for awhile it never ends well
  dumb larper
seem pretty pricey
the militaries own tests on mres show that they dont provide enough proper nutrition blood tests show problems in less than a week     the conclusion was that soldiers need fresh bread eggs milk and fresh fruit and vegetables without it they lose combat effectiveness
  thats 100 bullshit and if it wasnt they would just provide a multivitamin or fortified drink mix
had to eat nothing but mres for 17 days once never again first time i had real food after i nearly that myself
im a wildland firefighter and eat mres regularly not bad but could be worse some are pretty good usually just buy some other shit in fire camps
  are you trying to land in the hospital from constipation    probably cheaper to do opiate addiction
yep i started watching steve like 10 months ago and got hooked on mres fuck what these guys say i dont know about pops there with his 10 years in the infantry what the mres were like then but these seem fine no problems i have at least 1 a day
i honestly cant believe how much food you get per meal like those mres do you eat those 3x a day the main the crackers the dessert the protein drink the chocolate the coffee etc 3x a day
  go put on some body armor and a 70lb pack and walk around your town a few times
  i relied on south korean military rations for a week it was interesting
    i mean like even when they are just sitting around masturbating all day doing nothing or do they have a field kitchen then
  lol why do you also wear astronaut diapers instead of using toilets both are terrible and necessary solutions for problems you dont have
  or do they have a field kitchen then  they masturbate there too
  you only eat mres in the field regulations say soldiers are supposed to eat 1 a day with 2 hot meals military cooks dont really cook they do bitchwork instead so soldiers have to eat 3 a day sometimes
    really the dude at my work was a chef in the british army and reckons every single meal they had 2 meat 1 potato dish and 1 veg dish ready for the guys
  i honestly cant believe how much food you get per meal like those mres do you eat those 3x a day  thats because most of us spend all our time either in bed sitting down in a car or sitting down in an office whereas people in the army are forced to wake up early in the morning and do physical training / marching / running for ridiculously long distances like 10 miles a day while carrying heavy equipment plus whatever other day to day physical exertion they end up needing to do on top of training if you ate the amount needed to support that much physical activity while not exerting yourself at all then yeah you would either barely make it through a fraction of that food quantity or else youd eat it all and gain a shit ton of weight first thing you notice happen to a lot of people who come back from the military is they balloon into fatties since all of a sudden they have their freedom back and dont need to exercise anymore
  it depends on the size of the unit a company is not going to get its own kitchen a battalion or brigade will
what is some nice seasoning for pan fried chicken  my spice cabinet is filled to the brim and practically all of the ready made seasoning you get here in germany is just salt and msg with little beyond
  i do salt fresh ground black pepper red chili flakes paprika powdered poultry seasoning sage rosemary thyme thats pretty traditional anyways if i want to get exotic i add a pinch of cloves cinnamon and cumin just need a pinch of those tho
  not what you asked for but this theres a no msg version too but youre in germany so either might be difficult to find maybe itll be at a commissary on a usaf base we have foreign sections in our markets i bet you do too and usa stuff would be foreign to you in germany
  whats your aversion to salt and msg its just a component to most spice mixes
  i like salt pepper and cumin   this being said dont sear the chicken to hard as it will burn all the spices away
  she likes her cumin if you know what i mean
  i add this to almost everything
  i just got some of this for the first time and im using it today i am doing a sausage bake w potatoes and onions and bell peppers and a bunch of this stuff
  the problem is not that it contains salt and msg but rather that these are practically the sole ingredients beyond anti caking and sticking agents
  99x from marionkay  this is kfc herbs and spices
does anybody know a good recipe for cajun/creole seasoning to make yourself  there are like 300 online but which are somewhat definite
here are the 13 herbs and spics  nutmeg  white pepper  thyme  rosemary  sage  black pepper  oregano  savory  sweet  ginger  poshmy favorite  winter  summer  salt
bump
  i always use cheeto dust to get that extra zing in there
  chicken and a lot of oregano is good stuff   salt pepper and garlic powder is a given
  just made some friend chicken sandwiches with chicken breasts dusted in a mix of flour cayenne pepper curry powder and salt i forgot to add black pepper it was decent but you dont want too much curry powder im guessing the following would be good for a 220g chicken breast cut in half    1 tbsp flour  1/2 tsp cayenne pepper  1/8 tsp curry powder  1/2 tsp ground pepper  1/8 tsp salt
bump
how about some marinade for oven baked chicken breasts
how many people here had parents that were absolutely terrible cooks i love my mom and i always ate whatever she made for dinner but 90 of the time it was pure garbage just awful shit either completely tasteless dry meat or some amalgamation of healthy ingredients in a casserole dish slathered in cheese shed always cut corners wherever possible and frequently that meant microwave meals and food with no seasoning whatsoever the worst part is shed mention how much she hated cooking but refused to let anyone else cook  makes me kind of jealous to hear about families with traditions of cooking and wonderful family meals
  ah shit me too boss
  my mother is mexicanitalian she has always made delicious food
my pappy liked to grill steak and burn the shit out of it until the char to meat ratio was about the same as the breading to meat ratio on a chicken nugget whats funny is hed put effort into marinades and seasoning and all that and hed just burn it all up just a big charcoal nugget with shoe leather interior
      feels bad man why couldnt my boomer folks just take a little time to learn how to cook good food im disappointed that i have to learn all of this myself i guess ill just have to be the model for my kids someday hopefully that my parents never were for me
  mom used to be breddy good at cooking nothing really special but kid me loved it but the quality took a nosedive after she started working to 90 premade garbage now after dad and her broke up she doesnt even keep food at home she just eats at work and stores snacks everywhere
my mom is pretty good at everything she cooks and my dad used to cook mostly churrascos and asado he even had a chorizo secret recipe but besides that i dont remember any other dishes he used to make my mom in the other hand can do everything as long as she has the ingredients and the recipe
  mom is a great cook it takes up a lot of her time but man does she make some great food    it really rubbed off on me and my siblings we do a big family cook together for thanksgiving and christmas eve
my mother is a fantastic cook every single day she cooked something good for dinner
  my moms cooking was limited to anything that could be boiled  literally everything was boiled nothing was ever baked or fried we ate boiled chicken rice boiled beef steamed veggies and that was it so fucking bland  all my friends parents made these delicious meals with various ingredients and flavors i was always so jealous
  she still single    fuck you and your happy family
my mom makes the worst pork chop on the east coast you need two glasses of water to get that bad boy down
  read this in an italian accent for max kek
  we also ate a family dinner every single night which i didnt like sometimes as a child but now that we are so close i see the benefit    my siblings and i will probably be friends for life its nice knowing that i will have these likely permanent family relationships my whole life
mom can cook traditional mexican food sopes mole tamales enchiladas etc and breakfast food but overcooks/half asses everything else  dad can cook more technical stuff like steak and shrimp but fucks up easy shit like pancakes and only cooks like once every few months  mainly get fed boiled chicken and overcooked vegetables
  my siblings and i will probably be friends for life its nice knowing that i will have these likely permanent family relationships my whole life    delet this
  boomer  take a little time to learn  i think i found your problem
  my mom in the other hand can do everything as long as she has the ingredients and the recipe  my mom can do that too but the problem is shes lazy and will skip any step thats slightly hard then she will complain that the recipe didnt turn out right drives me crazy since i know she has the skill but she doesnt have the drive
  sad imagine your enjoyment incest porn being ruined by having real siblings
  im more into diapers anyway
  moms do this when they dont love you
growing up it could be kind of painful  mom takes recipe  removes half the ingredients because she made it before without them  no salt its not healthy  overcooks everything to make sure its done i never ate a runny egg or less than well done steak until i went to college
  my parents use too much oil and salt for everything including what they eat always complaining about the salt sometimes the salt in a curry would be the deciding factor for whether theyd get along that night and theyd do big batches so everyone would be microwaving some shitty bony meat boiled in garlicginger paste and oil that congealed to jelly in the freeze    but then for some reason they cooked perfectly normal during parties variety was good regular measurements they only tried when we had guests
  my older sibling who helped out with taking care of us was a horrendous cook   both her and my father couldnt season a chicken to save their life and it was the most bland shit so id wait for my dad to go outside and play with the dogs to add seasoning to the chicken and not say anything and hed wonder why it would taste so good    at the very least he was open to trying new recipes that i wanted to cook and would assist me in the kitchen without being incompetent
  nobody makes me anything to eat  
  nope my mom was hispanic if she bought boxed food shed find a way to add her twist to it and make it better
  t ungrateful younger sibling     younger siblings are all trash
  nice anon  stay close to them
dad is oldschool mechanic/farmer  mom is stay at home mom  but she doesnt even cook and clean just sleeps all day  dad comes home from working 12 hour days grumpy as shit like most working class dad  but i kid you not to this day he can outcook almost any fucking cook ive had food from everyday hed come home tired as shit and then make us everything and i mean from scratch home made pizzas burritos roasts every night we had good ass food and every kind of food  really really appreciated that shit  i ran into some friends from high school not long ago and they all wouldnt shut up about how amazing the food my dad made was when they ate here hahah i told him he needs to start a restraunt but he just enjoys it as a hobby
  im from a similar family situation my siblings are all good cooks the downside is the obesity im the only one in my family who isnt obese my bro is actually morbidly obese as is my niece a downside of coming from a family where shared meals are a sign of love is that the people you love tend to eat too much i know the conventional wisdom you see on tv is that eating crappy food makes people obese and while that may be true it isnt the case in my family they all eat good food  quality ingredients cooked from scratch  just way too much of it
  how did he not divorce your stupid cunt mother
  good quality / low calorie dude
  right and just because you know good food and how to cook it doesnt mean you have any fucking concept of portion size my family is a testament to this
  based and redpilled
  fuck    my family eats like shit because they are shit cooks we had a fucking boston market turkey dinner for thanksgiving fuck it all i told my mom that i was severely disappointed in the dinner before i called her the grinch for destroying good family traditions this year im setting the record straight for christmas dinner   im planning  roast lamb  mashed potatoes  stuffing  roast beef  turkey  gravy  im good at delegating tasks so i will instruct my folks on what to do for prep and in the kitchen
    not him but some people unironically are too good for this world heartwarming story
  is your mom super hot or what i dont see what your dads getting out of this
do americans really eat banana and mayo sandwiches
i dont
  ive never done that or seen anyone else do it peanut butter and banana sandwiches are pretty good though
4channel is so bad at night screw you australians
  so you are telling me you didnt see the video where joye make one
  what is a joye no one in america makes sandwiches with bananas and mayo if anyone has started to do this then they are not originally from here are doing it for internets or they are insane
  do yuropoors really eat dogshit and muslim semen tacos
  seething
      literally what in the fuck are you talking about
did we ever figure out what poor people eat
  at least xhe has internet access so xhe can continue to scam online
  usually whatever provides immediate satisfaction for an endorphin rush with the absolute least amount of effort thats why most are fat and spend more money than healthy people based on available wealth
  fuck poor people
poor people eat dirty meat shitty fast food and drink milk its because theyre prime for advertising will sheepishly buy expensive products will spend their last dollar on healthcare and are too stupid to nourish themselves with plant food
  we
  tveganigger
  will spend their last dollar on healthcare  dont you mean taxpayers will spend their last dollars to pay for healthcare that only applies to poor people
  live in a country with free healthcare  be taxed 8 of your salary for said  free healthcare  once you have a problem you see that it isnt covered by the national healthcare package or even private insurance  even basic ailments like psoriasis isnt covered and you have to pay for every treatment  what is covered you might ask  virtually nothing more than common colds but dont worry your money is well spent on curing bums gypsies and drunkards exactly the type of scum who never pays or payed taxes
  very poor person here  my family of four used to get food from the food bank at the local church and it was mostly nonmeal items like croissants cookies soda yoghurt etc with some pasta some rice and a small assortment of canned goods sauces legumes fruit etc  i think the food is sourced by regular people who just donate it so if thats the case the church didnt actually plan what to give out but its super weird to think of these people buying stuff specifically to give to the poor who dont have food and choosing relatively expensive snacks over cheap things that can actually feed someone  bless their hearts anyway theyre still much better people than most and their generosity didnt go unappreciated by us at least
poor people are generally stupid they spend their money stupidly they eat calorie dense junk food because it tastes good
  8  try 4590 depending on which socialist shithole it is
  candy alcohol sugar water and fried meat
  how is it stupid to buy cheap calorie dense food when you have little money the immediate use of food biologically is to satiate hunger sensations and to provide just that calories  plus it is pre prepared so if you dont have time the resources and/or ability to prepare food there is that added bonus to it as well  there are many obvious things drawing attraction towards fast food if you think about it logically seems most people are so blinded by there hatred of poor people they cant even try to consider all the potential contributors  also just i case you are all completely stupid not all poor people eat just fast food i personally rarely do because in my country it is quite expensive and i have multiple medical dietary restrictions
  90 income tax
  we but to answer anything from this list like thunderbird then they get on the night train to disaster  
  sounds like france to support the influx of niggers and islamics no wonder the eiffel tower needs a fence around it these days
  sounds like isnt a source if it is a policy of a country shouldnt be hard to find one 
  dont smile at me faggot  
  wwwgooglecom  this isnt reddit faggot
  poor person reporting just for the record i eat cheap caloriedense food because i work 12 hours a day 5 days a week i want to be able to retire someday not continue working my ass off forever so i have to work my ass off now    i bust my ass every day and im exhausted ill eat my cheeseburger and ill like it
  if you really just wanted calories youd eat beans and rice
  they should be pissed about this but for different reasons legitimately why is this lacking every single staple eg the aforementioned butter but contains a shit load of cheap carbs when i was dead ass poor for 2 years food like this almost killed me and every day i felt like i was starving in pain even if i ate a lot i just got over onset type 2 diabetes and spent the last year undoing all the damage of what being on a cheap carbs diet did to my body mind and stress levels it goes beyond appetite ruin weight gain and possible diabetes the blood sugar spikes from all the bread home made to reduce cost further i cant imagine how bad store bought is rice and processed corn caused me to be tired all day lose all motivation killed my work drive gave me depression and stomach ulcersthe list goes on we seriously need better diet education in this country when people think its okay to have overwhelming amounts of carbs little protein and no fat i cant imagine how fucked this is for a child    that having been said why is she complaining they didnt give her kids diabetes with juice what the fuck is with parents thinking juice is acceptable for children its like a milkshake youre buying in bulk all the time
  you must suck if working 12 hours a day and youre still poor then youre not doing much are you a felon or something
  american with a mechanical job at the labor level thats really all it comes down to im not able to invest from where im at right now and everything else is pretty much just treading water
  its a private charitythey get snaps as well
  excuses excuses
  be poor  gets handouts  compains  what an actual piece of shit
  i sincerely hope they use all that snap on butter eggs meat oil cream and other high satiety food just because theyre ignorant and uppity doesnt mean i want them to suffer the kind of way only a shit diet can make you suffer
  what would a jumping spider say to what you wrote
  expanding on this a bit    look its a combination of a lot of things if you live anywhere in america you know about the poor nutrition the subpar education the revolving door labor its been discussed all up and down around other boards at the end of the day what it comes down to is this  your job if you want to keep a good job is going to suck every last ounce of energy out of you every single day they want you to do your job plus the jobs of two other people whose positions they cut back to trim the fat from a department two or three years ago you will work unpaid overtime when requested and you will work holidays although pretty much anywhere decent will give you time and a half or double time for that and youll live with a sacrifice to your family life your personal life and your leisure thats what hard work non managerial work work for people who actually expend energy getting work done means now if youre lucky enough that youre somehow more valuable to the company as an idea man than someone actually turning a screwdriver or building something then that wont apply to you but to us guys down here were exhausted so hard we feel it in our bones you dream of deadlines and failures and the eternal tired even your sleep isnt your own why would you even ask why people under those conditions dont want to cook sometimes we barely even want to shit shower and shave but we do it because as people are constantly reminding us we could go be homeless if we dont like it
  you asked a question and they answered you whats the problem
  shut up with the copypasta youre fucking pathetic and should be feasted on by jumping spiders youre so full of shit that you must be from cnn or msnbc
  that was a bullshit copypasta answer not a real one
      i just took the time to type all of that out by hand because someone asked the question as to why poor people would want to go and consume cheap calorie dense food i am a poor person who consumes cheap calorie dense food and i do it because im fucking tired and i dont want to cook with the few exhausted hours i have to myself im sorry that that offends you but it isnt copypasta
  why even bother coming into this thread if you arent even going to consider the answers people are giving you even if you disagree with someones choices surely you should try to understand them to figure out how to change that behaviour you dont like just calling them names seems like its far more lazy than this person writing out their view honestly   if you hate what they are doing so much why dont you try to change it
  nigger thats the point the charity aims to help people beyond what snap does she has no right to complain coupled with snap shes getting more food than what most lower class prople who dont have snap get
  it doesnt offend me i just think its lame that you spend all that time but cant take 3 minutes to say make a wrap i bet you have a lot of cats and kids too whos to blame for your problems the government and why should taxpayers pay for your problems
  i consider them allright but youre like an ex gf of mine i can understand and consider but that doesnt mean that i have to agree that really triggered her and why she while very hot was not marriage material
  im not a newfag but jesus your pic made me rage
  i could take three minutes to make a wrap sometimes i do make a sandwich or cook up some meatloaf or make mushroom soup usually on the weekends when i have a little time to myself after the one time i actually have time to get a legitimate uninterrupted alarmless sleep each week i have no cats and no kids i have some small savings but money does find a way to fly out of your hands here in the states there are a lot of taxes now and i pay them all like a good and probably stupid citizen i do not expect anyone elses taxes to pay for my decision to work for a living although i do agree that its a pretty poor decision down in the labor trades    im still too tired when i work a 12 hour shift especially if its the fourth or fifth 12 hour shift in a row i live in a country where the fast food is everywhere and its cheap and you can even get healthy food from a drive through if you take the time to look around im going to eat that cheap readily available food and fall into bed because i need to get at least six hours of sleep before each 12 hour shift    what i dont understand is how you dont understand that
   claims hes not a cat boi   types out shit to defend bullshit  yeah right if you know so much why havent you learned that working hard and getting paid for it is far better than working long as i wrote are you some kind of felon or someone that cant pass a criminal background check
  okay do you honestly think calling people names is going to completely overhaul a massive part of their life do you think that you are actually going to change whatever it is you dont agree with but just calling some one lazy or a liar or whatever other insult if life was that simple i cant imagine people would have any problems  if you think all poor people are choosing to be poor or are liars or what ever why even bother engaging at all nevermind where you got these ideas from    when i look at people i disagree with i can look for the reason for why they do that thing and and why what they do is wrong and separate those two things if you want people to change you cant lead them in a never ending cycle of why do you do x into that reason is not good enough you are fundamentally flawed thats just completely pointless for everybody
  this is 4chan and calling peope names is pretty fun i get called them enough deal with or go back to baby zone reddit
  maybe you prefer /mlp
  working hard  getting paid for it    as someone who works hard for a living i say this choose one and only one    you can work your fingers to the bone and itll only get you bony fingers if you want to get paid here you need to own something that you can rent out to working plebs like me
  why would i want to work my fingers to the bone youre such an idiot
  mcchickens
  you must be pretty hardcore and stupider than a box of rocks at that
  im not trying to make any kind of emotional argument so i dont have anything to say re calling people names is fun though i do wonder why you find that fun  im just curious as what logic you have for this endless cycle of you do bad thing why to not good enough you must be liar or criminal or lazy even if those labels were accurate people dont turn into those things for no reason its called cause and effect again if you hate the behaviour shouldnt you look for the original cause of it then you can get work on removing the thing you dont like  i can see you are mostly trolling but you clearly at least somewhat believe what you are saying just trying to have a discussion 
  friends and i call them chicken mcnegroes
  now add a child and shit diet into the mix i cant imagine how single parents would even fry an egg when most cant afford butter enjoy scraping the pan dont understand seasoning due to wrecked pallate from all the processed carbs and lack of cheese due to money ive been in situations that bad before and even boiling was too much you kill your body at work come home to easy trash food that gives no energy and watch tv throw in a kid as many americans do and youre fucked if you cant afford their school lunches on top of that your kid is getting a pbj for all 8 hours
  in most cases the nonmeal items are donated by stores and are products that are close to the expiration date dealing with the hassle of the tax writeoff costs less than simply tossing the food once youre talking about upwards of 100 a week spread out over dozens of stores        it also appears to be a specific handout for a christmas dinner not a general food handout
  the original cause is look to yourself  shakespeare said that  dont be so arrogant as to think that others myself that is havent worked long hard hours and i do think youre a lazy fuck  we make guilty of our disasters the sun the moon and stars as if we were villains on necessity fools by heavenly compulsion   king lear act 1 scene 2
  white single no criminal record no animals grew up with animals they piss and shit everywhere and i wont have it in my living space    i have to work to support everybody else in this country who wont i guess that makes me dumb as a box of rocks    what the hell do you expect me to do i dont want to manage and i dont want to get into crypto or investment banking my lot in life is shit but i work for a living and im proud of that its about the only thing i have to be proud of but dont act like thats a sign of lack of intelligence all on its own the middle class has disappeared because companies dont have to pay labor anything anymore theres a steady endless influx of third worlders willing and able to take my job if i want to give it up looking for better terms sometimes i even do that and sometimes i even get them but theres no digging out from under the fact that rent bills and taxes will get your money i dont have an llc to park my petty cash in
  dude if you live near pittsburgh i will slow cook you a rack of ribs for 5 hours and drive it to your house
  my mom used to work 2 or 3 jobs to make due after my dad died so give me bullshit i love to read it from you idiots
  except meat is the most nourishing food you can eat plants give you cancer
  in most cases the nonmeal items are donated by stores and are products that are close to the expiration date dealing with the hassle of the tax writeoff costs less than simply tossing the food once youre talking about upwards of 100 a week spread out over dozens of stores  could very well be but im in italy not the us so things might be different  also i know a lady that does bring stuff there which is why i thought the food was being donated by the people in the first place  perhaps its both i dont know  some of the basics like pasta rice etc was uebranded like pic related
  im not far from there just over the pa border in ny that said i can do that myself
  buying raw meat and cooking it at home is cheaper and healthier than buying processed shit from a fast food store at a premium
  might be different  fuck yeah were not owned by merkel and dont have to deal with her bullshit islamic and nigger influx from her ww ii guilt complex
  sounds like something that was possible even if it should never be required of a person only before 2008
  different in the context of how food banks get their food not different in each and every thing  is this bait
  so my laziness sprang out of the ether into my mind thats the root cause of it  i never said you dont work hard i personally tend to think all humans work hard in some way it just seems statistically improbable that they wouldnt have had to at least at some point in their life  i could give you my personal sob story if you like but unless humans secretly have the power to warp reality the thing causing me to be poor cannot be changed through will
  hes what you call a bootlicker
im poor but asian so food is cheap since its mostly vegetable and cheap meat plus rice is half of our meal we also have a lot of asian market so its easy and cheap to find ingredient though we eat pan fried noodles a lot of dim sum and rolls fried rice curry soups braised/fried meats egg etc i cook for my mom niece 2 nephews and 2 brothers the one with the kids his wife died so hes living with us so it has to be somewhat little nutritious we use a lot of cheaper cuts of meat that arr good still like pork belly and chicken thigh ground pork for rolls and other thing is 1/lb here too i think a lot of time problem is of poor people dont know how to cook dont know how to shop have shit palate or dont have the time but most poor families i know have at least 1 adult that is a neet or almost but i do think we are lucky to live where food is good cheap
  most is from churches and temples thats a fact at least in new york   it helps a lot of folk most folk really need it temporarily and dont make a life of living off of it
  ill call the waaambulance for you if you want
we already know what they eat
  ill take that as you dont want my reasons for being poor i cant control alright but it can never hurt you to learn more about the world and all the experiences people have in it  and should i take that as a yes or a no as to whether laziness happens just cuz    you seem the intellectual heavyweight so i really want to know your thoughts on the topic 
  2014 article about richies get taxed hard   tax was removed anyway
  i just dont care about your problems   been there done that so to speak   you should go to /therapy
  whats your point you mean estate taxes folk were already taxes on that so thats double taxation and thats wrong for rich or poor
  do you go around with a pleather jacket with a little a in a circle youre a toughguy arent you
  yeah dude im a regular billy badass  the other day i crumpled up the paper from my straw and tossed it next to the garbage can instead of throwing it away properly
  ewwww thats pretty tough
well im poor but i dont get food handouts nor am i american  i cook stuff for myself and almost never eat fastfood most of you probably never heard about what i eat so it doesnt matter  you americans are trash ppl nonetheless
  that means so much from some asshole anon that blames america for all of its problems yet doesnt mention where its from
  oh so youre not going to answer my question   i said i was poor silly i cant afford therapy if i had that money i would be using it for things more basic than that im not offering to help myself im trying to share some knowledge with you about some of the reasons people cant just pull themselves up by their bootstraps or whatever     you seem very unwilling to engage with that though even though its sort of the topic of the thread
  i dont blame america for my problems im not related to america in any way nor do we live there you are just trash ppl
  double taxation which is unfair i hate to tell you this but people are taxed in lots of ways other than estate taxes in every country in the world   there would be no way to pay for a state if the only taxes were estate taxes even if they were 100 estate taxes lol
  i like hearing about new kinds of food i wasnt aware of what are some things people like you cook in your coutry
  7 limes
  this is this year income tax rate based on your yearly income   yearly income means the money you got in your pocket after the immediate taxes they take on salary which already sits around 4050 of the money that was allocated to you by the company that hired you
  those taxes are reevaluated nearly every year saying it was removed once doesnt mean its not coming back soon especially since its still discussed regularly in the political places macron is digging the countrys grave with his expenses at some point hell have to find new honeypots for his i want reforms for hte sake of it dictatorship
  you shouldnt be so obsessed with your superiors shitholer
  no it isnt
  yes i wasnt questioning the existence of people paying taxes at multiple stages or whatever i was questions the existence of a 90 income tax   and those taxes are at different stages so im pretty sure that the percentage rates wouldnt be additive if the other taxes you are referring to actually genuinely exist at those rates
  i once went to my church food bank  in the bag of food was a boxed velveeta brick i went to use it  noticed soneone took a huge bite straight from the cheese i went back  talked to a church rep aboit it and was told thats normal now ill never go again for fear of people tampering with the food
  how is it stupid to buy cheap calorie dense food when you have little money    because nutritionally they tend to be worthless that dollar fastfood burger may have hundreds of calories but it sure isnt healthy for you nor is it properly satiating     if they were smart they would know cheap calorie rich foods which would not break the bank nor be unhealthy would include all the foods they shun because its too boring and their undisciplined taste buds would reject for being too boring and arrogance would say to them they are better than that poor people food
    you dont seem to realise this was a food handout for christmas dinner not one for general living standards which if those poor people are economised on and planned accordingly they probably would have got from their standard food handouts which would of had those staples they whine about why dont they use the money they saved by getting that handout to spend on those staples they require
  the sick thing is that carbon credit tax its not called a tax but it is and it goes straight to niggers in africa as if they werent getting trillions already it hasnt helped them much
  we did some food collection thing in high school and almost everyone brought more expensive stuff and shitloads of shitty cookies
  why people under those conditions dont want to cook sometimes we barely even want to shit shower and shave but we do it    but we do it    and by god you will get the discipline to look after yourself too
  if thats all that happened then youre lucky at least some savage nigger didnt take a dump right there in front of the church
  thats federal and doesnt include state and local taxes and also sales taxes
  good job ignoring the rest of the post m8   and i hate to tell you this but filling your stomach with food tends to be what removes hunger from the human animal and the immediate requirement for food are calories and basic electrolytes   of course people require other nutrients but acquiring that in every meal is not a biological necessity and a vast majority of those substances have long term stores in the bodies and/or take significant time of dietary lack to have significant medical effect and most importantly people dont feel hunger due to lack of micronutrients hunger is a combination from physical and chemical effects that arise from an empty stomach and a myriad of hormonal interactions excluding those with specific medical conditions    the natural human response to this is to eat if its all someone has access to or they want it for whatever reason then they will eat fast food not really rocket surgery
  why are you assuming they saved money from getting that handout do you think every person who receives food aid has money to spend on food
  if you kill yourself then you wont have kids and cant spread your stupdity to other generations have you considered killing yourself  put your money where your mouth is
  huh
  stop being such a god damned victim i was sympathetic up until i dont want to manage if youre the upstanding white boy that you claim to be and youre not a complete autist who doesnt have any meaningful relationships start a business sure you might fail and sure itll probably mean even less free time than you currently have but its the only opportunity you currently have to take your life into your own hands and have a meaningful chance of improving your lot in life you can make endless excuses but it is no ones decision but yours who you make money for if you want to keep making it for other people go ahead but i think you ought to think about how you could make money for yourself youre a hard working respectable white boy with no criminal record and no family obligations so you really have no meaningful excuses beyond laziness and autism
  we use a lot of cheaper cuts of meat that arr good still like pork belly and chicken thigh  that stuff is only barely cheaper than for instance pork loin and chicken breast in the states even chicken bones can be a couple dollars a pound feels bad
  just start a business
  just cuck for someone else until you die
seem alright for nothing
  piss off victem its pretty easy to start a corporation as long as youre not some criminal nobody is stopping you i bet youre a shillary supporter
what are some dishonest dishes we could serve how would the service be dishonest what about the decor
  molecular gastronomy
  the secret sauce is actually my fermented cum
  what are some dishonest dishes we could serve  literally everything on the shitty food made pretentious blog
  serve kobe beef
  serve the entire sysco finedining menu
  lol
  we hire dinotendies as executive chef
  and hire a pr agent to plant a 6000 word think piece about bringing the 90s seattle grunge aesthetic in fine dining with at least six quotes from and a picture of our executive chef dino tenderoni in thrillist
  for the recipes we use  lard instead of butter  instead of beet roots you just get beaten up to the root  human meat instead of pork  pork instead of human meat  after 8 every dish gets replaced by a single chicken burger
serve only organic products  serve the best vegan pho use only pork bone broth
  what are some dishonest dishes we could serve  drinks  water  from the hose out back fill up a really fancy glass container and call it responsibly sourced artisanal mountain spring water from a secret spring in southern france and charge 1299 per glass all wine is just franzia and thunderbird  main dishes  a prix fixe tour of culinary masterworks hungry man and lean cuisine replated and given microgreen haircuts 287 per person
  food  like these anons said         decor  get an open floor plan ikea furniture and a bunch of trashy decorations or literal trash and call it something pretentious like noveau gastrique claim its a modern hipster place with gourmet meals and fine art     service  just have the chefs be really hipster and pretentious and use big chef words to describe every meal so no one knows what theyre eating also stack tiny portions on top of each other in the center of the plate and drizzle sauce around it and like  said have chef dinotendies top everything with an effervescent foam to further add to the pretentiousness while delivering hardly anything
krab but call it crab
find a bunch of shipping pallets break them apart and make benches and tables also make some crude art and signs with them too free decor and it looks like half of the modern hipster places these days
  after 8 every dish gets replaced by a single chicken burger  i like this that way the boh can clean up and leave on time and not worry about stupud fags expecting to come in an hour before close and still get served
  dishonest  go back to /tv/ and make those stupid blade runner posts over there
    i like these ideas
when making beef stock do you always end up with such a huge amount of fat  i can fry my eggs for a month with this shit
  its not a small pan
add it to butter 1 part beef fat  2 parts butter for crispy pie crusts
  anyway here is the idea  i remove the fat and put it aside in my fridge for cooking  i take 15 liter of stock to make soup from soon  the rest i will simmer down to a glace or thicker for use in either stews deglazing or soups in these cases i would add water to it before hand but it can stay longer in my freezer and take up less space  at the same time i took the bones i simmered for 24 hours and am simmering them again for another 24 hours in new water this is to see how much taste you can still get from a resimmer
  noted    was thinking about putting it in the microwave to even out the bowl but this works fine
looks goo ding dong where did you get the beef bones i find them hard to find considering i do not have a butcher around did you add any herbs
  yes and putting it in the fridge so the fat hardens and you can just remove in in chunks like that is a great shortcut if you dont have a fat separator
  farmers market      you can put tallow in the freezer and grate it for pie crusts
what are some cookbooks where all of the recipes are impossible for anyone but the author to make

can you sousvide a live lobster how long does a vacuumsealed lobster take to die
you could completely cook it while its alive if its low n slow enough
  wouldnt it suffocate during the vacuum sealing
  i think so but some animals can hold their breath for a really long time i just want to try it as an experiment they dont feel pain supposedly
  the water wouldnt be hot enough to kill the lobster so you would have to kill it before hand
    why would you cook a dead lobster
why vacuum seal it just throw it in the water lobsters live in the water he will be fine
  i do this a lot actually its no problem the lobster still seems to be alive for quite a while depending on the temperature i just blanche it in boiling water in the end for like a minute max so it gets the color almost like sashimi
  of course they feel pain how else would they know they are hurt
  by looking
  if you stick a knife in the lobsters head it will work but it has to be right before cooking
lol i once put a live lobster into a regular pan screaming hot with just a bit of oil had to hold a lid on it the thing kept moving around great method as well     next ill just deep fry a live lobster
  pretty sure most things will die if you put them in a vacuum sealed bag even without putting them in hot water
  deep fry a live lobster  anon if that works  its actually tasty you need to take that shit to every fucking fair/carnival and/or get a food truck
gas it with cyanide
just had lobster 2 nights ago i would probably eat it everyday if it wasnt so damn expensive lobster is the ultimate rich mans food
  id be worried about the internal pressure cracking the shell or any liquid causing your backyard to get napalmd
  but im afraid of under/over cooking it
  just do it pussy
  i dont like lobster though
  i dont care i want to know if it works
  then fry a lobster
can you save larry the lobster
  your body reacts to a lot of stimuli that you cant feel your immune system responds to foreign bacteria before you even show symptoms of sickness your balls retract when its cold without you noticing your heart beats faster when you drink caffeine without you telling it to its all mindless instinct  a lobster reacting when its bodys been injured is the same mindless response
  what about the intellectual lobsters you know the ones with graduate degrees
  ill graduate them right into pot of boiling water
  graduate degree  intellectual  only the ones with phds in philosophy are introspective enough to feel pain
  well said    or a turkey fryer if anyone is brave enough
  i dont think that bodily functions and getting a claw ripped off feel the same to a lobster you could argue that the way their brain interprets pain is different but there is no way that they do not feel pain that would be terrible for longevity
  are you a fucking biologist prove it nigger
  why dont you prove that lobsters reacting to injury is a mindless response
  no i said price it first so do it or youre scared
settle down now lads do you really think that a lobster would care about your pain if it got you in its robster craws
  transocean  trans  aint just the frogs that are gay baby
  a lobster would snib off your head without a second thought
  do you worry about the emotions and feelings of an ant or spider you step on
itt barbarians
  how do you properly boil a toucan sam beak on/beak off
  beak off use an icepick through the neck to hold him on the cutting board then a quick chop of the meat cleaver takes off the beak a minute or two in boiling water muffles the screaming and also makes it easier to remove the feathers
  thank you anon ive been doing it very wrong and its already cost me three fingers
  no problem those beaks are really sharp kitchen safety first
  jesus fuck man just put it in the freezer and then boil it the freezer doesnt kill it but lowers the metabolism to a point where its basically high and wont feel a thing because it dies before the metabolism rises enough for it to get stressed from the threat of death the meat stays rather tasty compared to nonchill lobsters why the fuck would you waste time and money on some lobster vacuum
  after the second finger id considered shooting the sam but did worry about ruining the quality of the birdflesh he also hates marinade and got sauce all over my kitchen when i tried to baste him
  they do feel pain however they dont process it like humans do the pain worsens the quality of the meat though
  eh thats a myth pain doesnt have any effect on taste he sounds like he was an asshole i would have gutted and deboned him before killing him if i were you
  humans dont feel pain either
  not anymore i dont
  nah mate i am pretty sure they do they just dont feel it like you do pain worsens the quality of the meat tho
  this is why you always stun your longpork from behind before you bucher them
  youre speaking to the wrong group were on 4chan on a saturday night after all
  i thought they just did that for fun
  the kitchen currently belongs to the bird but my new plan is to gas the room before breaching with an improvised flashbang and wrastlin the indigent sam into the pot once and for all ive already accepted that this may cost another finger wish me luck
  yes which is why im not the type of asshole who steps on them
  also preemptive defense
  i suggest using a heavy plastic those flea bombs have a lot of warnings on them might be a cheap solution dont worry about the finger as long as you still have one you should be able to angrily point at and poke people
  you dont step on spiders
  based or should i say baste  
the snipper would snip the bag and escape
  just stab it through the back of the head before cooking    lobster is the ultimate meme food its a pest back in the day fishermen would throw the lobsters back into the ocean or sell them to peasants there are recorded riots from prisoners being fed too much lobster when railroads were invented however the fishermen managed to trick pretentious retards coming in from the countryside into paying a shitton by saying that lobster was fancy thats why it costs so much
  every point in this thread is a meme including yours
  that sounds crazy since lobster is delicious id rather have a tail than some random ocean fish filet tbqhf
  the lobster vacuum is going to be a christmas present from a friend  only getting the bluetooth version
  checks where we are  accurate
  maybe lobster tastes like shit when not cooked right
  possible i dont think ive ever had lobster cooked poorly so i cant really judge maybe people back then didnt pair their lobster with butter you dont need to certainly but im of the opinion that it does improve the taste of the dish
why has lobster always been so expensive all it is basically a large red crab
  lobster is a butter delivery vehicle you like the taste of butter just drink a glass of melted butter at that point paula deen
  by that logic so is popcorn but unbuttered popcorn is still delicious too
  objectively wrong it needs salt and butter
  plain popped popcorn tastes good buttered and salted tastes better
  not necessarily ive had pop corn with olive oil on it and it tasted pretty similar plus there are the cheddar and caramel versions of it
why do people pretend to like lobster
  if the pain worses the quality of their meat thats pretty fucking clear they process pain like humans ypu autistic moron
  since it was prisioner food and not fancy food it was often overcooked to the point of being a vaguely seaflavored rubber meat
  assuming the body temperature got above 130 degrees f you could eat it alive i wouldnt want to though but you could i dont buy the theory that lobsters dont feel pain man poor guy survives getting sous vided probably more cruel than just boiling it to death only to get eaten alive what a way to go
has /ck/ died as well this entire site is dead
  /ck/ has been dead cept for deenz lads but no one will ever stop them bastards from getting to their fishy treasure
its saturday morning most are sleeping in you filthy australian
jannies killed this board
  newfags are having a hard time navigating to 4channel thats all
this is what happens when they prune al/ck/
  i enjoy
  r9kikes  theyve been shitting up /fit/ too  honestly why cant we counter raid them or get their faggot asses permabanned   reiko did nothing wrong
everyone got banned for posting questionable sfw material and calling eachothers niggers
    this it seems it global even on /g/  theyre even complaining about it here    its a sweeping purge to get rid of undesirable content to attract companies that want to advertise here   wouldnt be surprised if eveyone is migrating to infinity chan
  we are bunkering down and trying to hide from the future influx think about the currents events of the past few days the switch to 4channel the announcement of neon genesis evangelion on netflix it can only add up to one thing
  anything that isnt advertiser friendly is getting removed
  talkin bout deenz
im slightly intoxicated and driving to this fine mexican establishment   what should i order
order of the supreme court to have you incarcerated
  lol dude dont you know that drinking and driving is illegal and kills people xdddd
  im slightly intoxicated  do the world a favor and get an uber or take public transportation
  welcome to taco bell would you like to try our _____ combo  no thank you  alright what can i get you  more beer  we dont serve alcohol  two soft chicken tacos  would you like to add a drink to that  no thanks
  this but unironically
driving drunk is a shitty irresponsible thing to do but theres no denying weve all been there a few times do yourself a favor though and find a del taco taco bell is shit tier food and always a dissapointment
  two fritos burritos and a 5 layer grilled add onions and red sauce with lots of fire sauce to dip them in
  fritos burritos  why are these pushed so hard here the fritos are always soggy and disgusting
  the rolled chicken tacos are back and fucking delicious
  theyre terrible
  youre terrible you probably eat the mexican pizza like a mongol
order the pig staking out the taco bell for drunk drivers to mind his own business
  who even orders the mexican pizza  the cheesy gordita crunch is objectively the best thing on the menu
  true fuck the mexican pizza ill agree the cheesy gordita is nice i usually get it with a fritos burrito since the rolled tacos have been out again though i get the gordita with 4 rolled tacos
  cheesy gordita crunch  best on the menu  more like best thing on any fast food menu anywhere
tacos de caca
  fritos burrito was only good when they were in that 2 duo   i always customized them and swapped the nasty fritos with beans
pintos n cheese
steak quesarito is the best thing on the menu
  this but with shredded chicken  nice digits btw
a salad then throw it to a windows outside and run
  nachos bel grande encherito mexican pizza and a crispy potato soft taco the patricians order when one is imbibing
  fast foods dont sell beer in america  whats the point
  why order a fast food beer when you can just sip on the can you picked up from the gas station while waiting in the drive through
  we have cars and drive throughs and flasks of vodka in our cars and eating in the restaurant is seen as pretty trashy
    im of the mind that 6 beers and under is perfectly safe for driving slowly at the speed limit the few blocks my residence to the taco bell         the mexican pizza is a top 5 menu item you filthy plebs
  no anon you are going to crash into a pack of school children and kill them all  you dont know your limits and you will die if you drink and drive
  its pretty gay tbqh ignore these insecure faggots theyve probably never experienced a glorious place like spain where everywhere from bus stations to mcdonalds has a fresh tap of german beer for 3 having a beer with your bus driver on a drive from leon to santiago de compostela is kino
  where do you live that packs of school children are out roaming the streets at midnight
  having a beer with your bus driver  bus driver  drinking beer  good lord
  they come out whenever they sense a nearby drunk driver
  public transportation  kino  good lord
  this level of dismissiveness can only come from a completely unjustified sense of confidence your intoxicated driving skills really arent as good as you think they are anon
    these niggers get it
      yknow if it werent for (((madd))) driving while tipsy wouldnt be the grave heresy it is in the us i mean fuck i drove a straight truck for a moving company and a beer or four was the most common tip i ever got
  its just a shitty hard shell taco the worst thing on their menu after those taquitos with extra bread wrapped around it for no reason you probably order pizza with breadsticks ie a side of crust
  your driving skills   calm down initial d we aint gettin hektic were just cruising at 25 mph making full stops and calmly waiting our turn in line im more worried about drivers who find this to be a feat of skill tbqh    in spain theyre mercedes charter buses with captains chairs for every seat with fully internet browsing capable smart tablets built in its much comfier than driving in a country you dont know and you get to just watch the scenery roll by whenever you want    sometimes a beer or two right before i hop into rush hour traffic is perfect im relaxed and kind and sociable im more apt to let other drivers in and more patient waiting for my gap to open up its pretty great
  eating in the restaurant is seen as pretty trashy
  im sorry you were molested by dough as a child but that doesnt mean we cant like it
  what should i order  a taxi
  a shitty hard shell taco the worst thing on their menu after those taquitos with extra bread wrapped around it for no reason    thats not accurate at all
  mcchicken  mcdouble  small fries  large tea
  if you live a few blocks from the taco bell why dont you just walk
  only the drive thru stays open late
  aside from a squirt of ranch and a drizzle of cheese between the taco and the bread thats exactly what it is
  i never understood why places do this its like theyre encouraging drunk driving

  snakes are cool but possums are filthy vegetable and fruit theives and spawn their babies in my garbage can fuck those bastards theyre vicious too
  theyre vicious too    youre thinking of raccoons     opossums are marsupials of peace
  literally cant shitpost without calling someone a cuck  the absolute state of nu/pol/
  fuck opossums theyre stupid ugly and gay
  baste and breadpilled

  jesus christ that thumbnail
  i want to watch this show
does anyone have the webm of the guy feeding a whole scoop of food to the fish
  hemmingway   /lit/ oldfags reduced to hitandrun b8 on /ck/  absolute state of 4chanenel
soy
  im a huge orson welles
  i knew that i would find this picture here
    bbut people said splitting the site would quarantine /pol/ to the red boards are you saying those people were actually retarded newfags
  rome  corn  this bugs me
  why you can read for yourself it turns out mobile armies require quite a bit of corn
  fuck you
  a cat is as tall as me
  it was desperate delusional hope that it would lead to a cure for the cancer that killed this site
  4chan as a whole always talked shit about niggers and faggots and jews whether it was ironic or not what killed the site was the massive influx of normies who expected everyone to confirm to their standards
  agreed 100 however those people you speak of they are all on /pol/ and they all came here because of /pol/ during the last presidential election
  and here i was at 174cm thinking i am short
  were both subhuman manlets theres no difference between you and me
  they are all on /pol/  i dont agree with this sure most of them stay on /pol/ but when they do branch out to other boards they dont take the time to get acclimated to board culture   and they all came here because of /pol/ during the last presidential election  the election actually wasnt nearly as bad as people make it out to be and there is still a strong influx of newfags even after it i believe its roughly half edgy redditards and half unironic leftists who want to debate people
  fuck you
  well apart from 19 centimetres im sure were pretty similar do you perchance have brown hair and many moles throughout your body
  but when they do branch out to other boards they dont take the time to get acclimated to board culture   this is one of the biggest problems though and it goes hand in hand with expecting everyone to conform to their standards    the election actually wasnt nearly as bad as people make it out to be and there is still a strong influx of newfags even after it  i dont know it looks pretty bad to me from that graph and while that influx of newfags occurring after the election may not have been due to the election itself i believe it was still due to political events occurring during this election cycle   the more that invade the worse it gets because they all seem to believe the notion that popularity is a good thing for 4chan so they continue to push for it
  what a nice and well mannered cat  is it yours anon
  does this count

  corn is a newworld crop  how did romans know what corn was
    /k/ here its just how the teaniggers chose to translate the latin word for grain he isnt actually talking about maize
  is there a more overrated author than hemmingway i was just so floored by the lack of talent he had as a writer while reading him how he approached the world in a vacuum how he missed to forest for the trees how he hardly understood people
  how does a bear know what apples is
      the latin word for grain    which digging though my copy appears to be frumenti in case anyone cares
      the ol cornbait still managed to hook a few      i like him but im not a huge fan i think his dialogue is good and if ive just finished some henry james or something its nice to wind down with hemingways short clipped writingstyle

rate my lunch cu/ck/s
i hate that cheese is sickening  fries are alright though
lose the tomato and add another corona and its perfect
shitty mexican spic beer  bland greasy fries  disgusting cheese  pickles  mayo  pathetic bun to burger ratio    99/10 would eat any day if not for the cum on it
drinking beer out of a clear bottle
i go to 5 guys maybve 2 or 3 times a week at work for lunch    its pretty good but 13 for lunch is a bit much but worth i make it back in the time im eating it
  also cajun fries are a must
why ruin a perfectly good meal with that spic piss water
  for the amount of money that you just paid for that fast food crap i can get chicken breasts for two weeks    t /fit/
  eating chicken breasts
15/10
  i dont like the fries not crispy enough
  how fat are you be honest
  250 lb / 5 11
  65 320lbs come at me bro
  5 ft 1 406 lb
  spic beer    try again corona is the usa it made for the usa market owned by a different country compared to corona in mexico  mexican corona cannot enter the usausa corona is made in different breweries
  picking the worst piece of chicken cut marketed for women in some meme attempt to make them think it makes them lean      kys
  fuck you the cheese is the best part
  you better have gotten the raw jalapenos on that thing literally the only reason to go to five guys
  the fries are too salty and theyre served in a fucking cup  its too expensive  i like peanuts  the soda dispenser at the one i go to is one of those touchscreen ones which i like  the aesthetic reminds me of freds a much better burger place
  when you want a 15 wendys double five guys is the place to go
      le 15 dollar meal meme  i feel like i need to make an infographic on how to order there  step 1 order little things   they make the menu confusing on purpose to throw you off and make you buy bigger things they give you the same amount of fries with the little fries as they do with the large for half the price they just throw them all in the bottom of the bag   step 2 get all of the toppings possible  youre literally paying for every single topping that they say is free if you get a plain cheeseburger youre better off going to mcdonalds or something  step 3 dont order a fucking drink  go to mcdoanlds and get a large drink for a dollar or just drink water you fat fuck   any time i go to five guys i generally only pay around 78
  any time i go to five guys i generally only pay around 78  or i can go to wendys and get an 8 meal that includes a drink
  people pay more for quality shocking i know also a small fry at five guys is basically a large or bigger from anywhere else
  just order water and get soda when they are too busy and not watching what are they gonna do call the soda guards on you
  quality    its the same shit as wendys the only difference is that feeling you get when you think your not buying a gutterlevel fast food meal
  wendys is better though
  kek i love when other boards sign their name tell tale sign of a newfag
op here ive enjoyed your replies but was disappointed at the lack of nasty comments     this was not the best 5 guys burger  fries ive had the fries were overcooked and the burger was good but not great maybe it doesnt live up to my false memories    a few months ago i tried shake shack which has similar stupid prices idk lads shake shack might be better but 5 goys has better fries im torn and confused and will cry myself to sleep tonight thinking about this
  thats what you get for not buying a mc chicken
  you forgot to grab some peanuts op
  op here yes maybe all roads do lead back to the 100 mcchicken
  eat real food/5
getting toppings on a fives guys burger  getting it with just cheese and mayo or mustard is all you need
  being so poor you have to budget and fuck about money spent on food
god damn hungry leaving ck until i eat ive had like no solid food in 2 days
  ask them to do them crispier you autistic tard theyll even double dunk then if you have a nanogram of charisma and its not busy even though its against company policy  then they become godly
  ive been to mexico multiple times it still tastes no better than say mgd its pretty mediocre
  buy chicken thighs or tenderloins if your going to brag about price those both taste better too
     youre gay arent you
  paying more for less    all those toppings are included in the price of your burger its why its so fucking expensive if youre eating at five guys youre throwing your money away not getting any toppings
shit looks cash   wish i lived in america
eating that much food   for lunch   i shiggy diggy
  my broken white people tongue gets overwhelmed if there are more than a few flavors in my mouth at once    i bet you cant enjoy a good steak with a sauce either has to be just salt and pepper or your tongue stops working
do you think they serve big sl0ps of shit there
  your mom did when she spat you out of her sausage hole
lol sneed

relatable thread
hm
  i wish i had a friend like that
does anyone have the one with the bunnies in the kanye video saying your such a fucking retard
hey kyung never thought id see your zany ass on /ck/ of all places how was /co/     also i just had this wonderful idea for casu marzu flavored cheezits itd be kinda notlegal but itd provide a lot of protein due to the cooked maggots inside n outside the crackers
anyone else here eat dirt but have to pretend to only merely be chewing it to see what texture it will make when you spit it out to avoid scrutiny of your friends
  we should make brownies out of our own shit itd be fantastic for the environment and our health
when are you taking the cast iron wok pill
this would be good for home use because most people dont have a jet engine installed in their range like at chinamin restaurants
official cast iron or rankings    dutch oven  griddle  fry pan  waffle iron  wok
  fry pandutch ovengriddlewok
    this guy gets it  not sure if it would work though  why bother  the wok is designed to move food in and and out high heat quickly  cast iron creates a great sear  no need to fuss with it
  carbon steel is better for woks
what can i buy that is similar to these products
  i think pb crisps are similar
anyone know how to make them
  i found a recipe frens
  f
try these
closest thing would be koalas march or hello panda cookies    theyre hollow cookies filled with cream no peanut butter flavor though
  mr peanut is racist and offensive to people of color
lets see how wrong you all are
  3  fpbp   /thread
it all depends of if its a sandwich or just stand alone
45
23
2 or 3 is best 4 is passing and 1 would be ideal if it wasnt dangerous
  6 because fuck you    you cant /thread your own post you brand new faggot
  6 is perfect crispy and crunchy
  its hard to tell how crispy it is from that pic at first i thought 2 looked the best but then realized that 1 was raw it has to be crispy but shouldnt be burnt so probably somewhere between 3 and 4
  i obviously just did you troglodyte
3 if im eating with eggs  4 for a sandwhich
  this thought i fear 1 might be too chewy
  dangerous    buy better meat anon
  dangerous  pretty sure bacon is already cured anon
  3  anything else is subhuman
1 or zero between slices of fresh white bread washed down with red wine
im honestly not picky but i prefer as crunchy as possible without being charcoal
   youre not supposed to be a faggot  everyone   lol i luv eating gay anuses and sperm  (((you)))   you sure showed me
  ok trump
  4 or 5
4
2 or 3 i accept anything beyond that is an abomination
3
4 crispy but not burnt is the only way bacon should be
  as a texan i like some over cooked meat but not on steak or bacon medium rare and 2 maybe 3 on bacon all the way
  between 3 and 4
  3 or 4
      patrician
  0    
  5 or 6 doused with maple surp
25   no further discussion needed
  anywhere from 25 theyre all fine for different reasons and im happy with any of them on my plate 1 is raw and 6 is just crunchy char
somewhere between 3 and 4      wanting colon cancer
  all are good i would eat any of those depending on my mood sometimes i want something crispy and charred sometimes i want something soft and chewy fuck limiting yourself to one style of bacon
  id lean more towards 5 since im a crispy crunchy type guy but i pretty much agree with this this anon and would eat everything from 25
  its a flyover thinks his opinion is anything episode
  4 i like the fat to be crispy
  325
  either 3 or 6 depending on my mood 4 and 5 are disgusting though
  i like a bit of fatty bendyness to my bacon personally so id pick 3 but theres no wrong answers anywhere between 25
4
  13 4 if you want crispy
  i never knew it was possible to be so based but also so wrong at the same time
  thread about opinions on bacon  complains    k then
  this although 2 is still fine
   this i even understand burned bacon like burned toast can be comforting
1 is raw 6 is burned 24 are ideal
46 is where it should be people who like limp under cooked bacon are the true cancer of this world
1 and 3  pieces of 1 will be snacked on while the rest gets to 3  in my house we call this attrition and its the reason we buy more of certain ingredients than the dish actually calls for
1
  people who like 46 have the true cancer of this world
  im just messing with you
  24 is fine for me
1
  anything between 24 is good all the others are unacceptable
  get fucked sweaty 
  45 it needs to be crispy bacon doesnt taste that good so it needs that crunch
  this right here
  either 3 or 4 for me
  all of that bacon is cooked like absolute shit i prefer my bacon cooked properly
  3 with my eggs or on my sandwich 4 in my salads or other recipes which would use chopped bacon
4 if its thin and 3 if its a thicker cut
  the fact that he did has proven you wrong
  36
5 4 still has some of that undercooked pink stuff on the top and i dont want to get sick
  tthis
  either 3 or 6   4 and 5 are disgusting though  retard
  three or four depending on my mood    everything else is just raw or burnt
4 is the perfect level of done
i want a big plate with a mixture of 26 but mostly 3
  paper thin bacon  burn to ash before properly cooked  shallow taste
  3 for sandwiches 4 for eating by hand
  why do you suck so much cock could you just slow down for a little while please
  hey you cant /thread your own post even if you have the objectively correct answer     anyway /thread
  lets vote  no strawpoll  
sometimes i like 3 sometimes i like 4 depending on my mood everything else is overcooked/undercooked
  bacon
  the fact that it didnt work proves you wrong brother
why is there no option between 1 and 2 1 is too little and 2 is too much
  4
  i like my bacon to have some bite so 3 or 4 if im having grits or hashbrowns 5 would be acceptable
crispy bacon on a sandwich is absolute pleb tier
  4 is perfect
  based and red my friend
  that meme started on /v/ actually not reddit
i unironically eat raw bacon  god tier
  324  everything else is trash
for me its rare so 1
  1 or 6
any and all depending on circumstances i love the texture of 1 6 tops salads/soups/ice cream perfectly
  the correct answer is that it if you pick it up by one end it should have some bend to it but if folded in half it should cleanly break in two
  are you fucking gay has to be at least 4    mother fuck you scared bitch
  you cant /thread your own post    /thread
  frozen and fresh from the refrigerator
  45    crunchy is the way to go
  based and redpilled
turkey bacon
    3 is glod 4 is ok but the perfect state of bacon is between the two where all the white fat has rendered out and just good gelatinous bacon fat and crispy pinkish brown meat is present
  theres literally 0 difference
3 is the point where you have fully broken down some of the fat without crisping it to all hell
  dont listen to those newfag redditors on 4channel you can absolutely thread your own post  /thread
  1  also that bacon looks yucky
  1 or 6    no middle ground
  3 or 4 all but raw are ok though
3 or 4 depending on what im cooking
  2
  its already safe to eat raw bacon anon  as in youll most likely not get parasites you might get cancer tho
46 its best in oatmeal too whats the point of bacon that isnt cronchy
  different settings for different uses
  ideally somewhere between 3 and 4 but ill eat 25 happily 6 is just plain burnt
all these people not going with 4
  t subhuman
  t vegetarian in denial
  bacon  you guys are all fucking degenerates
  3
  my nigga
6
  2/3 if its crispy its not right
  /thread    3 is the optimal medium ground
  123456
wanting limp bacon
  thats every meme
  whats going on here
  comforting a guy who chose  bacon 4
  burnt or raw    you must not be a gordan ramsey fan
  fpbp  /thread  your own fucking post    but you also arent wrong
  2
  from the back  both are great at 3 but if you havent tried back bacon then wtf are you even living for
  aids
  you cant /thread your own post  and yet somehow he did
35
  fucking this  idiots who like eating charcoal get out
  thats just thinsliced pork chop belly bacon is the only real bacon
  not liking a bit of chat  tastelet
  liking a shriveled fat deprived meat resemblent crunchy peice of ash  taste  i bet you cook pork to 165 degrees fag
who tabulating the results i cant do this shit
  your mum likes a bit of chad
  usually a three the bacon must be firm to not flex when held but cannot have a crunch usually this requires it to be cooked at a slightly lower temperature but for longer
  underrated

  what happened to you
  job market sucks being on the line sucks getting 25 cents more than the mexicans next to me who dont speak ernglish sucks i hate the food im making and i dont really like being yelled at over cutting a pepper skew its a shitty cert/degree/whatever and its worthless in the long run
  yea if you dont seek out a worthwhile job with standards the ones you go to where they hire illegals sounds like franchise jobs did you have experience before going to school   im working at local restaurant rn and i got a manager position a month ago yea you get screamed at for doing shit wrong but some people like the chaos of a kitchen although not as many can handle its stress
  i was working in 3star places in new york city dont even start capping out at 40k/y  fuck that i have aspirations
  whats your dream
  damn 3 star joints taking mexicans what the hell
  10/h on the line dont even start they know its cheap labor too everybody knows its not worth it to go to cschool unless you are going into the advanced/paperwork side of farming corporations or inspections or whatnot
  never had much of a life goal anyway   if i only end up making barely enough to get by what the hell else would i do if i had enough   same thing as i would poor just sit around and not exist until my next shift   i like the industry and the place im at now anyway   i hope you can find peace anon if not find the neutral acceptance of life where it might not be happy but doesnt suck either
why is sourdough so much easier to digest than regular bread were we not meant to eat unfermented wheat flour but only in fermented and predigested forms

the shape of the glass affects the taste    this is bullshit isnt it
  no actually the alcohol smells goes around the rim so the middle where you put your nose can get more aroma from the non alcholic parts of the wine/booze
  more surface area  more evaporation  stronger odor  more subtle scents brought out you can try this for yourself with a bunch of glasses of different sizes like shot glass rocks glass wine glass small drinking glass etc
  yeah  dont listen the the fags saying otherwise
try having a martini from a mug and tell us if it didnt ruin the experience
    japans proved it cunt
  guess they have made different kinds of cups for 1000s of years for no reason soyboy    what a queer reaction image btw makes you look like a twat
  t
  tell that to belgian breweries  they know their shit when it comes to glassware
  affects the smell
the width and shape of the top of the glass will affect the aroma the shape of the rest of the glass will affect flow and gas volatile esters ethanol carbon dioxide release    most whiskey and brandy glasses are designed to cut back on the aromas effect on taste but they are also designed to trap as much of the esters and ethanol as possible  basically tying the scent you get from the snifter to the flavour as you drink    red wine glasses tend not to curve too sharply inward  if at all  theyre letting aroma out and letting the wine breathe or helping to oxidize any harsh tannic aroma and flavour your last sip of a dry red wine should be significantly sweeter than the first if youve taken more than 5 mins to drink it    champagne flutes are designed to promote prolonged effervescence minimal surface area soft convex curvature all the way to the rim a lot of highly carbonated german and belgian beers will use the same concept at a bit of a loss to the aroma    convex glasses are generally for heavily aromatic beers  ipas belgian wheats that sort of thing some sour/lambic glassware has a convex base and a slightly concave top to try to steer the aroma  not sure how well it works    straight glassware is primarily for looks function tumbler pints for instance or straight volume steins
  imagine the smell
  as long as there is enough surface for evaporation after tumbling the liquid the actual shape of the glass does not matter at all    so yes its a semimeme
    to the best of my knowledge and experience that glass in particular holds all the alcohol fumes at the bottom and all of what you want to smell if funneled into your nose at the top so you dont burn your nostrils i actually had someone mention to me once that the flaw of the glencairn is that at the end of the drink if you tip your glass to heavily for the last few drops a small cloud of alcohol fumes fill pour out and up your nose/into your eyes     tldr not a meme just a bunch of ignorant people who refuse to believe otherwise because they didnt expect it to matter and cant get over themselves
  it affects the smell which in turn affects the taste but not by enough for me to give a shit
  its like the empires with no clothes  there is some massive bs getting around out there and people making millions from it  it goes into any industry  for example if some retard looks at a painting and says oh it means this the artist will generally just agree in the hope of making the sale
  emperor
  perhaps but there are benefits to them the smell does concentrate in the narrower part it is easier to swirl the drink it whether that has any benefit on the tasting im not sure but if you want a glass that does those things then a glencairn is a good glass     i have them i use them but i also like to use a stemmed copita/tulip glass its just personal preference also they arent expensive so its not really a big deal to buy them     strangely enough i think ive only ever been served whiskey in a glencairn once in a bar/restaurant
  oh i totally get that hand comfort if you want to go that extra mile im just as happy to drink from whatever bc the glass is just an item to carry the liquid to my mouth im perhaps not refined enough to many but i have no time for those kinds of people anyway
  are you drinking cheap whiskey
  it doeasnt matter after few glasses
  this   i still own a glencairn tho you can use it for any liqueur or liquor you drink straight doesnt have to be whiskey
  youre a brainlet what you smell contributes to what you taste and those glasses concentrate the aroma toward your nose
  i enjoy thin glasses more than thick ones 812 oz glasses more than larger/smaller ones clear glass more than colored glass etc     theres a lot that goes into enjoying a drink than just what the raw flavor of the liquid is
  i believe that ive always noticed the last sip out of a glencairn glass tastes more alcoholic and burns more it even happens with wine at the bottom of a wine glass sometimes
  experience and taste are different things
  the tldr sounds like me
    protip close your eyes and blow into the glass before you do that gets rid of all the extra fumes
  whisky is so much better out of a tulip style glass the glencarrin knob is fucking retarded though honestly any stemmed tulip glass is good for whisky just not a mongoloid tumbler
  it might but realistically the people who claim to notice the difference are probably just kidding themselves  this study demonstrated when you submit a wine to multiple competitions the probability of a wine getting a gold medal at a given competition isnt affected by the wine getting a gold medal at a different competition and is explained by chance alone    and this one demonstrated expert wine judges with professional experience in the wine industry fail to provide consistent evaluations when theyre unknowingly given the same wine multiple times    and lastly this one showed university of bordeaux students from the faculty of oenology will describe white wine using stereotypical red wine descriptors when given white wine that was made to look like red wine with food dye  
    we all know wine snobs are frauds but what does that have to do with whether or not glassware has an effect on the drinking experience
  yall niggas is too pretentious its a bunch of rotten fucking grain or rotten fucking grapes chill with it    this its proven all that shit tastes the fucking same muh 500 a bottle wine muh 500 kinds of glasses its all bullshit
i have one of those coke glasses you can get your whole face into and it definitely changes the flavor  makes subtle flavors much more apparent    in fact its impossible to drink diet soda from it because the fake chemical taste becomes much more pronounced
  so what youve said is  here are multiple studies that show factors beyond the liquid in the glass influence taste and perception of flavour  a glass doesnt make any difference
  everyone look how cool this guy is i bet he drinks black coffee like a bad ass
  i drink instant coffee with butter in it
  he said glass not material obviously ceramic is going to taste different than glass when you put your mouth to it as will metal and plastic
  post jap glassesplease
  different judges have different tastes  a lot of judges dont know shit and/or the wine changes as its exposed to more oxygen  people who are in the process of training to make wine dont know how to taste it    wow youve sure convinced me      its proven all that shit tastes the fucking same  yep all beer tastes the same all soda tastes the same all coffee and tea just drink water lol
  thats nuts
  no your just a faggot    /s we all have our tastes
  designed to cut back on the aromas effect on taste  also designed to tie the scent you get from the snifter to the flavour as you drink
  explain your process
  when i put a /s it indicates sarcasm  in reality i too have never tried instant coffee and butter but everyone in you neighborhood would probably smell it
  you can sign your name with a bic or a montblanc but you already know which one youd rather write with
  different judges have different tastes  no you idiot its not just different judges having different tastes there was no statistical relationship at all between performance at multiple concurrent competitions and winning was determined by chance alone thats pretty fucking bad its not like the expectation is even to have identical results at these different competitions all that was needed to pass this test was for their to be some correlation between results at different competitions no correlation means even if there were some real difference in quality the decisions being made at these competitions werent being determined by it  people who are in the process of training  people who are going to university specifically for wine as subject matter and its telling apart red and white wine not exactly a lot to ask for    no i explicitly said it might make a difference but that people who claim to notice it are probably just kidding themselves since factors way less subtle than glass shape directly involving the wine itself get overridden by psychological factors for expected taste and even those professionally involved with wine fail to demonstrate the basic ability to consistently score multiple instances of the same wine poured from the same bottle if the wine itself is something the most reputable tasters are failing to demonstrate a capacity to taste and consistently recognize then its pretty unlikely some random amateur wine enthusiast is going to successfully notice a much less blatant potential source of flavor difference like glass shape its more likely you just believe youre noticing it since expectations for taste lead people to believe theyre noticing that taste
stemless wine glass with a roulleau triangle mouth and inverted complimentary base
  for whiskey/brandy sort of if its too open of a lip it wont concentrate properly for beer its highly important i tried to pour a belgian quad into a long pilsener glass designed for wheats/lagers and it was foam city ruined the beer
  glencairn  glen cairn  glen cairn   cairn    cairnkicking /out/ anger rising
  look what im doing with my life mom
  youre supposed to put the /s after dumbshit
    glassware doesnt change shape though in the mouth where it came from wont change the taste its all just aromatics   as example i was making irish coffee one time and poured a shot of whiskey absolutely no odor at all coming off of the glass i was baffled took a sip tasted how it always does     youre making your argument off of data that isnt related to the point of the thread
will it enhance the aroma of my sodie pops
  try it with something cheap or volatile first  cheap whiskey grappa slivovice something like that a vessel that will let you inhale directly while drinking can make the aroma overwhelm the flavour considering the aromas largely ethanol youre setting yourself up to taste burning    i had to explain this to friends last night who didnt like the whiskey they brought  do a shot out of a shot glass holding it in your mouth for five seconds then one out of a highball or a small bowl if youre apprehensive about the taste in the slightest bit youll probably inhale sharply over the wide vessel and your experience will be like swishing rubbing alcohol rather than picking up any real flavour    so yeah sometimes to tie aroma to flavour you have to stifle the scent a little
  i did  what came after was my actual opinion
  in this case i was saying its okay to not like something
ive always had the impression that you can order pretty much whatever classic cocktail you want at a fully stocked bar obviously its bad manners to order a 20 ingredient drink during peak hours and obviously you shouldnt order anything more complicated than a rum and coke at a beer forward pub or an npc tier sports chain but i had thought that old fashioneds negronis martinis manhattans etc are fair game most mid tier restaurants with reasonably equipped bars  am i wrong am i being a dick for ordering these cocktails ive heard recently that some bartenders hate making these things the two main reasons seem to be  theyre time consuming to make  but this doesnt make sense to me because most classic cocktails only have three or four ingredients does it really take much longer to make a martini than it does to make a rum and coke are bartenders really reluctant to use the boston shaker in front of them theyre paid to use  and  theyre outdated cocktails no one drinks anymore  this doesnt make sense to me either who the hells never heard of an old fashioned or a manhattan theyre old but theyre not forgotten i thought people ordered them all the time    so whats the deal i dont want to break bar etiquette and piss of bartenders i know they have hard jobs but it also seems to me like whiskey sours daiquiris negronis etc are standard drinks any bartender worth his salt should be able to whip out in less than a minute are bartenders just worthless and lazy or am i placing an undue burden on them
  as the night goes on everyone is drunk and its not like youre really going to tell the difference anyway
you go there and order whatever the fuck you want to drink and they make it for you because its their job and youre paying them money for it if they do a bad job making the drink you want then find a bar that makes what you want    do you really need that explained to you why is it your problem how busy they are or what the bartender feels like doing or whatever the fuck
  it isnt really my problem obviously theyre there to serve me and i can order whatever i want and i will if im in a fuck it all mood im just interested in figuring out what the norm is  there are things called social conventions normal people try to adhere to i know autists have a hard time grasping this
get done playing at a bar in downtown  free drinks for band  ask bartendress for a manhattan  i dont know how to make that also our vermouth here really sucks  can you recommend something  pfffsh well what do you want  something like a manhattan  i dont know anything like that  loosing my patienece at this point  how about just something fruity  well what kind of fruit  you know what just give me a double shot of jack  they dont even fucking try theyre as autistic as you and me
  ordering cocktail etiquette  tips
  i dont know how to make that also our vermouth here really sucks  can you recommend something  pfffsh well what do you want  something like a manhattan  i dont know anything like that   my patienece at this point  how about just something fruity    how the fuck can you get to this point and not know how to make a manhattan she even knows that vermouths in it so how the fuck is she confused about finishing it off
  right  i literally watched her make a gay fruity colorful drink with bitters like an hour before for some drunk cunts i seriously dont know why she refused to make it
how hard is it to order from the fucking menu    honestly unless you are in a proper cocktail bar why would you be ordering a cocktail perhaps its different in america but in the uk bartending isnt a respected job it wouldnt be expected for them to know drinks that arent on the menu unless you were in a fairly expensive cocktail bar
  this its called the service industry for a reason if that bumble fuck wants to passive aggressively fuck up my order he can eat shit i have had a bartender at a pub who was packed for a special live band place tell me straight up they werent serving a particular cocktail that night so i just ordered a gin tonic instead     concerning yourself with how paid help thinks of you is a tremendous waste of time and energy along the same lines the waitress isnt your friend and she probably doesnt want the d she just wants a healthy tip the only reason youd be concerned about the social conventions of the wage slave class is if you have to mingle with them outside their work ew
  most bars have a menu that has over 100 drink names just sitting somewhere collecting dust where i am from not to mention if it is a fully stocked bar then one should assume they have all the ingredients to make any cocktail and if they dont should be able to learn in like 30 seconds especially if their menu says they make it
  an hour before band arrived   boss the band gets free drinks  bartender free drinks  boss beers the band gets free beers
  find a cocktail bar i was working in a bumfuck part of washington and they had a few places that specialize in preprohibition cocktails
  lmfao normally most bars yes but this bar hooks it up for the band  literally the next month i played the same place with some dude bar tending he had no problem making a manhattan and i discovered that day that i absolutely hate manhattans and now stick to shots only
  time consuming makes a little bit of sense because some bartenders dont get an hourly wage they just get tip based pay now most places give bartenders an hourly wage so time consuming really shouldnt matter     outdated drinks  i dont even know how id respond to this thats a stupid comment
  dont be an asshole and order obscure complex shit during busy hours  yes a bartender should be expected to make basic common drinks like old fashioneds manhattans negronis martins etc at any time     the international bartender association has a list of standard cocktails which any bartender is expected to know there are 77 of them
  there are at max 20 drinks people in the us order regularly    when i worked it was mostly the same stuff
  i dont doubt it but i still expect bartenders to make drinks off that list with minimal fuss    its no different from expecting the chef at a french restaurant to know how to cook an omelette even if omelettes arent commonly ordered there its a fundamental skill expected from a professional in that field
  a daiquiri is a shurefire way to gauge a bar keep if he cant make that right ill just sip on bottled beer
  im assuming you mean a traditional daiquiri i hope
  it just depends on the class of the restaurant  odds are that an applebees bartender isnt going to know what goes in a normal martini and has never heard of a negroni most bars are the same way shitnigger druggie staff with high turnover rates everyone is always new etc if you want a good martini old fashioned manhattan etc a real cocktail not a mixed drink like vodka cranberry or rum and coke then you have to go to a more upscale place to get what you want the stockedness of their bar should be a good clue as well do they offer only silver tequila ten kinds of vodka and captain morgan youre in the wrong place  you cant get a french 75 at a dance club just like you cant order prime rib at mcdonalds      america is not at all like that brits have no taste        most places dont require a bartender to have taken classes or done any training my first bartender job didnt give me any training at all and it was a relatively nice place that did banquets and big events it was just me a stocked bar and a cocktail recipes app
order complex drinks  tip a little extra    this isnt hard
  most places dont require a bartender to have taken classes or done any training    that doesnt change my expectations i just label those places as shitty remember that op specified fully stocked bar i take that to mean a pretty serious place not just the bar counter at a local restaurant or some shithole     place that did banquets and big events  thats not a real bar
  damn you sound legit beta as fuck stop caring so much about what strangers youll never talk to again think of you
  autism technically a fucking fridays or applebees has a fully stocked bar    a fully stocked bar usually just means have your base liquors and then a handful of apertifs or liqueurs     like another anon said you have to go to a more upscale place to expect them to stock the next tier up of ingredients like carrying chambord instead of just creme de casis
  thats not a real bar  it was but thanks for your ignorant opinion    that doesnt change my expectations  well if you were smart it would i dont expect fresh cilantro at a taco bell and you shouldnt expect a good bartender at a cheap holeinthewall lcd bar you get what you pay for dumdum
  it was but thanks for your ignorant opinion  what kind of real bar hires an untrained bartender   calling that place a real bar is like calling a mcdonalds a real restaurant     get what you pay for dumdum  that was my point entirely i dont expect good bartenders at a cheap hole in the wall lcd bar because thats not a real bar
  the international bartenders association founded in england mind you has maintained a list of standardized canon cocktails that any bartender worth two shits should know for nearly 70 years  theres literally no excuse
  what do you call a place where the majority of the products consumed are exclusively cheap alcoholic beverages
  bar buys booze at wholesale prices  bar sells booze at two or three times what the liquor store charges  somehow the bartender still deserves a tip for counter service    ill never understand
alcohol is basically one giant meme and people tricked themselves into thinking their drug of choice is a cuisine you drink to get drunk and everyone silently agrees it all tastes fairly awful but drink it for the psychoactive effects
  get out of here randall go write another comic about that girl who dumped you 20 years ago
  you might as well extend this metaphor for tipping at all
  there are degrees to outrageousness and bar tipping is the worst of all
      its still the idea that waitstaff arent paid as much and are expected to be paid directly via tips
   is on low price  probably a dive
  counter service isnt waitstaff
  lol you fucking moron a dive bar is still a bar and it will have a fully stocked bar but wont serve you a fucking vesper
  its still the idea that waitstaff arent paid as much and are expected to be paid directly via tips  thats whats odd the fact that a bartender is not a salaried position is counterintuitive    i look at it like this  food at a restaurant costs 3x the ingredient cost that goes to pay for rent insurance and the wages of the staff who prepare the food the kitchen  likewise wouldnt a bartender be paid wages the same way the kitchen staff is
  lol you fucking moron a dive bar is still a bar  but its not a real bar     it will have a fully stocked bar  i doubt it will be anywhere close to fully stocked     wont serve you a fucking vesper  yeah weve been over this thats because its not a real bar    i think that you arent grasping the fact that in my mind a fully stocked bar takes that to a nearly literal extreme most bars are not fully stocked
  so in your idiotic worldview most bars arent real bars then
  you can order a cocktail at any fully stocked bar and the bartender should be able to make it for you   but dont expect anything good or even decent at some place that isnt a cocktail bar   ie dont try going to joes sports bar and grill and expecting the 21 year old bartender who just started bartending to make you a good old fashioned   a good indicator of a place that you probably shouldnt order a fancy cocktail from would be anywhere that serves food or is considered a sports bar
  most bars arent real bars then  that would be correct    its no different than how most places which sell food like mcdonalds or subway arent real restaurants
  what kind of real bar hires an untrained bartender  durr what kind of any business hires people who dont already know how to work there  most places hire people who need job training what world do you live in    from your senseless replies all through this thread im gonna go ahead and assume youre just angry about something unrelated in your life and youre taking it out by acting like a pompous cumstain on a sfw hair braiding forum you still gotta be 18 to post on 4channel kiddo
  ok brainiac hire a bartender and pay him a fixed wage no tips thanks and see how well that works out you wont be able to find a decent bartender and anyone who sticks around will just begrudgingly make shitty drinks at a snails pace
the only cocktail i enjoy is sangria
  this analogy isnt equal not all restaurants would have every single ingredient for every dish and they have solidified menus you order off of would you be upset that an italian joint doesnt make giambotta because it isnt on the menu and then not call the place a restaurant
  no one cares
  this im a bartender and 90 of our orders are  beer  highball or whisky on the rocks  gt  monthly special usually vodka with some sort of juice  tequila shots  once in a while someonell order something fancy like a moscow mule or a long island usually manager does those drinks       most places dont require a bartender to have taken classes or done any training   this usually getting a bartender job is hey youre white like talking to people and are a functioning alcoholic too welcome aboard go wash these glasses and pour beer into mugs all night  its not exactly a skilled job
  this analogy isnt equal  its not meant to be its meant to be close enough to get the point across
be at a bar in ecuador  9pm  its a weekday so its only me and my friends  order a negroni with beefeaters  bartender is a long haired beardy fat dude but whatever i dont prejudge  sorry we only have w and tanqueray at the moment  well then make me one with tanqueray  looks behind him  sorry i just realized we dont have any tanqueray left  no problem how about you make me a manhattan    he looks uncomfortable  i dont really know how to make it but i will look it up   order it with jack daniels green   i watch him mess up bad  wayy too much angostura   take a sip  look man this is undrinkable here try for yourself  he is disgusted  im not going to pay for it but how about you make me a rum with coke zero  sorry sir we only serve pepsi  mfw
  this is exactly correct op stop being an incel and just order what you want if they bitch about making it go somewhere else be sure to tip them if they are making you something more complicated than a jack and coke i personally feel any mixed drink should get a tip just because it requires more work than pulling a tap    obviously you seem half way courteous so dont ask for something ridiculous on peak hours but something as easy as a whiskey sour or old fashioned should be ok really anytime    if you like crazy stuff go to a cocktail bar or fucking order something off the drink menu at applebees but we are talking classic coctails here not something crazy complicated
i have never had a problem with ordering an old fashioned/manhattan/martini in any bar ever    whether it was crappy or not is an entirely different story
    what are some good cocktail glasses  glencairns are too small for most cocktails and i find snifters are too big as well
  so is your definition of a real restaurant equivalent to your definition of a real bar that they should be fully stocked to a near literal extreme as you suggest which implies they could cook just about any dish requested
  depends what the cocktail is     personally i prefer coupe glasses to martini glasses but both work for similar drinks i have old fashioned glasses which i use as well
  but i really dont think it tastes quite nice and i know quite a few people that also think it doesnt taste bad and quiet enjoy a nice glass of what ever they like
  for true cocktails served up  libbey 3770    for cocktails served ontherocks or liquor neat/rocks  libbey 9033    for sours daises flips possets served up  libbey 8054    for fixes sour ontherocks  libbey 135    for highballs coolers and long punches  st√∂lze 3500013
  the wide shallow coupe allows a drink to become warm faster than almost any other drinking vessel a chilled coupe allows faster warming than any   other chilled goblet its only defensible use is for toasting with champagne wine the coupe should never be used for mixed drinks
  show some self respect and pride for yourself and learn how to properly make drinks a moscow mule is fancy to you its a vodka/ginger beer highball accented with a 1/4 oz or so of lime juice    long island iced tea is a charged punch aka collins    1 oz fresh lemon juice  1/4 oz simple syrup  1/2 oz dry gin  1/2 oz light rum  1/2 oz blanco tequila  1/2 oz cura√ßao liqueur triplesec  shake with ice and fine strain into collins glass filled with  1 1/2 oz coke  fill glass with ice  garnish with lemon slice
i learned to make my own cocktails because i was too nervous to ask for them at bars then i became an alcoholic because i kept practicing life is funny
  its really painful to continue reading your autistic posts there is no such thing as a real bar if a place is a bar then its a fucking bar dipshit going forward with the mcdonalds comparison someone else made it might not be real food aka less sophisticated and sloppy non nutritious but its still real food for fucks sake so shut the fuck up you stupid nigger and fuck off
  well structured and comedic with a good punchline nice
  no u
  this happened to me too actually 2 or 3 fancy cocktails at home a night gets to you after a while
  how is it possible to be this beta
  there is no such thing as a real bar if a place is a bar then its a fucking bar dipshit    it seems my use of the term real bar triggers you what words would you prefer that i use to describe the difference between a shithole that cant get basic drinks right versus a place with a skilled bartender and a broad selection of spirits i think calling one a dive and the other a real bar gets the point across pretty well    what should i call the latter if not a real bar
  how about good bar and bad bar  the term real bar comes off as pretentious and i think you know that you just dont want to lose the argument at this point
  red solo cup
  dude fuck bar etiquette  that is just bullshit bartenders make up so they can bitch about having to do their job  if they have a full bar they have a fucking full bar order whatever the fuck you want and if they say aw man dont you know its bad etiquette to order something like that when its busy or some shit like that say aw man dont you know you are paid to make fucking drinks and i could give a fucking shit less if you have to wash out a fucking shaker    i fucking hate when service workers act shitty to their customers  mostly because i am one and because i work in a hotel i can literally never be anything other than nice and accomadating or i get fired   meanwhile bartenders and liquor store cashiers get to be a dick to me whenever they fucking feel like it   drives me up the fucking wall
  i could give a fucking shit less if you have to wash out a fucking shaker  putting your own spin on that stupid mistake just makes it even more retarded
  hasnt absorbed the social conventions of the bar scene through observation and mimicry  thinks he can get off anywhere calling others autists
  what mistake would that be fucknut
  fuck off nigger the shaker and wall of liquor behind the display are just fur decoration and everyone knows it most of those bottles have probably been sitting there since 1975 the last time it was socially acceptable to order a fucking brooklyn or martino youre a dick for ordering anything other than beer and shots  ill bet you ask for your drinks stirred not shaken you fucking mad men larper
  nah dude seriously fuck the bartender i gave up on them making a good old fashioned because nobody apparently knows how to make it correctly except me dude if im paying and fucking tipping then i will order whatever i want i dont care if its a hassle or not im the paying customer
  other anon im beginning bartender and i try to learn a new cocktail everytime its quiet enough its funny but my shaking is shit atm what famous cocktails should i learn i did old fashioned martini espresso martini daiquiri and cosmopolitan so far everyday life is gin tonic/mojito beer/whiskey obviously
  if you can care less it means you at least care a little dipshit
  try to think in terms of drink types rather than focusing solely on the recipe for example if you can make an oldfashioned whiskey cocktail correctly you already know how to make a sazerac cocktail all you do is switch out the bitters and give the glass a rinse of absinthe     if you can do a mojito which is a charged punch aka collins you already know how to make a tom collins by switching out the rum with tom gin the lime juice with lemon juice and and leaving out the mint     there are only up to 7 elements that go into all drinks and there are 8 drink genres with lots of sub genres once you learn how and what elements go together to create each genre you can easily create your own drinks
  solid advice thank you i might draw a kind of tree with every types of drinks
i ordered an old fashioned at an upscale sushi place with a full bar and a dedicated bartender they acted like i asked for virgin piss hesitated for 15 minutes then brought me a rusty nail
  thats weird because i would pay for a pill that makes you not get drunk so i could drink a half gallon of porter with breakfast and chug bottles of brandy without killing myself i would drink four bottles of brandy every day  guess im just a liar
  a book that explains this and lays it out very well is elemental mixology by andrew willett
  i feel the same way anon dont listen to that tastelet next to pretty girls good liquor is probably my favorite thing in the world i know its corny but the smell of a good islay scotch literally puts a smile on my face
    fuck that shit  a good book is where its at then good liquor then girls and/or boys
  post /stacks/ to we can criticize your taste in literature
  t triggered burn out bar tender    so youre usually too drunk to mix by noon i assume
  make sure to give them extra bonus money for the product you paid money for because they had to do their job people shouldnt be expected to do that normally
  already posted it     look upon my might lit dick ye mighty and despair
  based
late weeknight at a suburban bar fairly empty  want to try a negroni never had one before  walk up and ask for one  uhhh i havent heard of that before  cant remember the ingredients b/c pretty drunk so they just give me the cocktail menu  theres exactly 5 cocktails on it and the negroni is the first one on the list  dumb fucking whores
  id expect a real restaurant to be capable of making standard dishes from their relevant cuisine    i expect a real bar can make me any wellknown cocktail like a manhattan or a negroni  i expect a real french restaurant to be capable of making standard french dishes like roast chicken beef bourginon cassoulet etc i expect a real italian restaurant to make their own pasta inhouse etc
  who is randall
  good bar works just fine for me     term real bar comes off as pretentious and i think you know that  no i didnt know that     just dont want to lose the argument at this point  what argument im happy to use a different term if real triggers you for some inexplicable reason good bar it shall be    now that weve settled that  i expect good bars to be able to make standard cocktails with no fuss im not talking about silly shit that nobody ever heard of i mean wellknown stuff like the aba list    i dont waste my time with bad bars
  i remember at one point going to a local irish pub and i continuously ordered beer all the while the bartenders were acting pissy towards me but that changed as soon as i gave them a 6 tip at the end of my bill and then they started to smile at me the stupid fucking cunts
  that is the correct response
  its not worth it i dont know how a drink with precisely three equally proportioned ingredients can vary so much in quality between bar tenders but it does if im at a shitty place like that ill basically just order really simple stuff like a gin and tonic really i shouldnt be ordering anything though
    as a negroni guy this   ive never had one i didnt make but even making them myself ive seen that they can change pretty drastically the garnish seems to be pretty particular
  cringe
id say walk the bartender through the steps if they dont know what it is but dont expect it to be any good  like anons have said dont expect a sports bar or a pub to make anything fancy i use to work at a wetherspoons mcdonalds of pubs and id have people asking for some crazy shit it was fun telling people we dont serve coke only pepsi people would get mad over that
  spoons  my uni anime society lol meets at a spoons every thursday and it sucks i just order a single zacapa and try to draw it out as much as possible if it wasnt the only thing my semidepressed friend did with other people i wouldnt go
  mate try working there its like working for scrooge enjoying those sticky tables and menus too haha
  ive got a friend of a friend who works there she seems to like it but i think she just likes having a job while being a student  enjoying those sticky tables and menus too   yeah mate its the authentic english experience and ill never let anyone take it away from me no matter how much those pakis try  you were wrong to call it the mcdonalds of pubs mcdonalds is alright every now and then the faecal particles are only on the selfservice things
op youd live traditional bar culture here in japan  its calm and quiet and you order cocktails from a professional bartender who makes them really well  then you smalltalk with wagies
  a hemingway daiquiri right
  not anon but i would gladly settle for just your straightup traditional daiquiri sour fresh lime juice no sour mix no blender    1/2 oz fresh lime juice preferably from florida key limes  3/4 oz simple syrup 11 sugar/water  2 oz light rum matusalem ron platino works fine    shake hard for at least 10 seconds to chilldilute and aerate  fine strain into chilled 5 1/2 oz or so goblet  marasca cherry garnish    most of the classics are so simple but if the person behind the bar doesnt know or care how to treat these ingredients youll probably wind up with a shitty drink
  most menus for cocktails are going to be house specials theres no reason you shouldnt be allowed to order standards that they dont normally have on the menu
  go to the bar near me thats big on its cocktail acumen and does a fantastic job of it usually  get fantastic martinis exactly as ordered  order daiquiri  tell me they dont have a blender
  dive
  tipping in general is unamerican and should die  
  pop culture has turned a daiquiri into a strawberry 711 slushi with some liqour in it pretty far removed from the original drink    adam is un american and should die
  adam is un american and should die  i see you hate being told the truth
  adam ruins everything  its like you want us to believe the opposite out of reflexive disgust or something
  awww its so cute how shit your opinions are    i hate wellresearched honest goodfaith factbased comedy shows because of some stupid reason
    newfaggots itt taking this b8
  most of the classics are so simple but if the person behind the bar doesnt know or care how to treat these ingredients youll probably wind up with a shitty drink    the same exact thing can be said for food
  eh theres always the old reliables that take no effort like the gin  tonic jack  coke etc if youre at a crappier place
  we dont all drink like braindead fratboys
if a bar cant make a negroni just order a beer or go somewhere else because its not worth it
    just get a jack and coke you autistic bastard
  or stupid
  who the fuck wouldnt want to drink massive amounts of porter with no consequences
  if the bartender doesnt want to make it its probably not worth getting the cocktail in the first place ive never had this issue because in place that doesnt seem to serve much cocktails i get well drinks or beers ultimately order whatever you want but if everyone else is drinking beer the place probably doesnt do good cocktails
  ah yes the classic highball not likely to get messed up but its still possible a highball should be served in a tall glass 95 oz or so with 3 ice cubes 4 if using a larger glass a lemon twist is the traditional garnish but some people prefer a lemon or lime slice     the correct ratio is 1 part strong liquor to 2 parts weak carbonated mixer so 2 oz liquor to 4 oz mixer would be ideal     a 13 strong/weak ratio is served in a larger glass and called a cooler
seriously sure you can buy jacklinks brand for like 15 but it is too moist for my liking     just buy your own dehydrator and    nah man when im in the mood for jerky i dont want to wait 3 days
thats why you make it before you want it dumbass
  fuck u asswhole
because meat is mostly water and you lose a lot of water when drying meat its not really rocket science
  if meat juice fuelled rockets better than tnt it would be fucking rocket science
  rockets are fuelled with tnt
  this is why i only buy dried and cured meats im not paying for water in my meat
  or dynamite/grenades whatever you get my point
  yeah water is free and you can always add it back later saves space and you dont have to refrigerate either only a moron buys waterlogged meat
what do i think of these
shit thread needs more onion rings
yummy
crispbread is toptier
are there actual finns in them
  only if its poutine rings
case and point
  are these popular in usa t finn
  neeevvvvveeer heard of them the fuck is a finn anyway
  not super popular i guess but its definitely the most popular of crispbreads id say just about every grocery store will carry them either finncrisp or wasa
  i havent seen this brand yet but i get the swedish wasa crispbread quite often the sourdough is great
  you think they taste like shit
itt post your best dinner youve had recently here i had baked beans with peas and chips simply delightful
  well if you enjoy it then good on you op 
  slop
  thanks anon
im curious to know what your phone is my phone is an old version of android but the camera still great
  bully    its a few years old now
dont like the idea of mixing peas and beans
  im sorry for your parkinsons
i wouldnt even feed that to a pig are you from the uk by any chance
  thos beans
  anon im so sorry this is the best recent dinner youve had
  honestly bongfriend im not upset with you im just disappointed however this disappointment doesnt take long in turning to anger and disgust when i think of the injustices that my american people have faced at the hands of yours on this board to think that the same people who ruled enslaved colonized or occupied nearly every nation on earth at some point were the same people to pass their genes down to the likes of you  unwashed tastelets who cite baked beans with peas and (((chips))) as a best meal of theirs how fucking dare you britcu/ck/s utter a single sly word about american food  being high in fat or muh hfcs xd or whatever your obesity rates are much worse than ours just for the record  when this abomination is what britshits and their europoo cousins consider food starchy carbs slimy carbs and veggie carbs all with no notable flavors of their own unseasoned no doubt microwaved you old world fuckers make me sick
  imagine being this mad at some fries and beans
  how do people even eat soggy crinkle cut chips digusting get some wedges you fucking peon
  chips
chicken and ham pie with mixed vegetables and gravy didnt end up using much ketchup but i put it on in case i needed it
  correct
  meh id eat it and like it but kind of safe and boring
  hypothetically what would you add to it
  lose those shitty unseasoned vegetables ketchup and replace with some oven roasted brussel sprouts or something instead
  i guess theres only so much you can cook up on a psych ward before the nurses get wise
  old world/europe  anglos  implying muricucks and britcucks arent the same thing
  baked beans  with peas
  legumes and legumes whats not to like
  i would honestly view someone lesser than would otherwise be the case were they to be exposed to myself as an individual who would so brutishly nay so savagely mix their baked beans with their garden peas simply rediculous behaviour
  brussel sprouts  fuck that steamed broccoli is better in every way
  bluepilled
american buttercream is absolutely disgusting everything about it is horrible the texture is unappealing the flavor is lacking in every way whenever i attend some sort of party where cake is being served i scrape the frosting off because it is almost always disgusting american buttercream you can tell just by how it looks it has this awful powdery appearance large air pockets and edges that dont hold i would rather eat fondant than american buttercream i despise every soccer mom that thinks swirling shitty sugar butter on a cupcake makes her anywhere near equivalent to a real baker in every single case that american buttercream is used swiss or italian meringue buttercream could be used instead and create an infinitely better product it looks better it tastes better and it feels better the amount of extra effort it takes to make a swiss meringue buttercream compared to american buttercream is marginal if you cant cook egg whites over simmering water and operate a stand mixer you have no business baking anyway if you are planning on baking and want to put frosting on a cake do you and everyone else a favor and learn how to make swiss meringue buttercream
staring at selection  paralyzed by indecision  stand there for 15 minutes  other customers have to push past me  this choice is too difficult  haha just kidding red baron is the best
  that shit costs like 6 a pie you could spend an extra dollar and get an extra large 2 topping papa johns pizza which blows all frozen pizzas out of the water completely and if you disagree youre a retarded pleb with shit taste
  lol if youre able to get an xl pizza from papa johns delivered for only 7 you must live in a third world country where american dollars are worth much more baking pizza at home is the smart and efficient choice much more affordable and it comes out just as good as delivery better even since its fresh and hot right out the oven as soon as im ready to eat it it also doesnt take 45 minutes to an hour to get to me i also dont have to tip myself for cooking it no youre the retard here
  is this a coupon once deal or are you just joshin
  calling pizza a pie  fuckkkkk right off
tombstone all the others are crap but they are expensive crap tombstone is best value vs taste
  i meant large sorry not that it makes a big difference     its a special easily identifiable on their website think theres been great deals every since the based nigger fiasco
  its literally the definition of a pie you dumb fuck
  its literally the opposite of a pie
  pie sweet  pizza savory  nonamericans sure are dumb
  45 minutes how long does it take you to make a pizza from scratch
  large papa johns pizza for delivery  8  plus 4 delivery fee  plus 1 tax  plus tip  5  yeah nah brah
  piesweet    imagine being this egocentric a trait unique to americans and thirdworld shitholes with corrupt governments
  what i said delivery takes 45 minutes
  imagine being so dumb that you dont know the difference between crust on the top and crust on the bottom
  not getting carryout  did i fucking say its 7 with delivery no i fucking said its 7 drive your lazy fucking asses to the store and pick it up ive saved literally hundreds this way
  depending on how much you let it rise knead it etc anywhere from 30 to an hour for the dough quick bake i just use sauce from a jar and throw toppings on quick bake for less than 10 not too bad just plan ahead
    i am an american unfortunately get rekt you stupid niggers
  with a top and baste of pastry  what are you not understanding here you are wrong 100 pizza is not a pie and never will be
  the point of frozen pizza is having something in your freezer for when everything is closed and youre too lazy to cook comparing it to takeout pizza is retarded
  oh so now i have to get dressed probably shower brush my teeth then spend gas and time driving to the store to get my pizza which will be either a not ready yet so i have to wait or b ready for 10 minutes so its cold then i have to drive it back to my house gas and time  alternatively i could pay less money less time and less effort to get a pizza straight out of the oven  there is no win condition here for restaurant pizza frozen wins every time
  look guys i baked a pie
  pasta is not a pastry
  pizza crust is not a pastry
    rekt
  is the crust soft on this
  this is wrong on so many different levels i dont even know where to start      pizza is not a pie and never will be  wrong
why does the mere mention of pizza bring out the retarded autists like this
  typically  can you read retard pizza is a pie youre wrong pizza is a pie youre wrong pizza is a pie youre wrong pizza is a pie youre wrong how does it feel to be wrong
  what board do you think youre on did you get lost on the way to /lgbt/ faggot
but for me but for my money though its gotta be ginos pizza because theyre the only pizza place with crisp bacon strips and not just swuishy bacon crumble as a topping
  its 250 you stupid dumb fucking woman no wonder youre fucking fat i need a goddamn beer
  its 250  its literally not shut the fuck up you depressed nualcoholic
  for me its the uno deep dish
  yes i know what you said making pizza from scratch should take a couple hours  the effort involved theres no point in making pizza at home when pizza places make it better and faster than you steaks yes make at home pizza no
  it literally is drinking is for idiots dumb fucking bitch where do you live dumb fuckistan
  bitch ill go there tomorrow and buy one and take a picture of the receipt along with my giant erect white cock and post this shit in here if this thread is till up just to prove your jew little ass wrong
  deep dish fucking sucks its more like tomato cake than a pizza and the concept of tomato cake is revolting  traditional crust the exact correct ratio of crustsaucecheesetoppings
  just grab your favorite or whatevers on special   dont go to the supermarket unless you know exactly what youre getting
  i use instacart its much better than shopping in person living in a first world country is great
  oooh look at this roastie dumbass paying desperate white kids for pics of their dicks its 250 dumb bitch stay mad stay in your land bitch men are speeking   suck another dick maybe youll be able to afford that cheap pizza
  what is wrong with you this is what happens when you abuse alcohol fellow 4channel citizens take note
what happened to my frozen pizza thread
  if youre going to be that lazy at least grab the freschetta    better alternative is to grab an aldi behemoth cheese pizza for like 5 bucks and add cheese/toppings/seasoning as needed
  so is pumpkin pie in the same category as pizza then
  idk  but for me its the generic open nature nonbrand frozen pizza
where can i get stuffed crust pizza hut shut down
  looks pretty bad honestly
  oh it sucked i think it was a gluten free crust i wasnt aware but it was just awful
i would kill for more of these
  digiorno has a stuffed crust pizza
for me its definitely the red baron brick oven frozen pizza crust is soft but crispy on the bottom pepperoni is flavorful good sauce ratio only thing it needs is a bit more cheese  
you got an mre i bet it isnt nice tho    muah 
  nice
  hey i just wanted to let you know this is the worst thread ive ever seen on this board

  its been like 2 months now and i still have no idea what the deal is with this girl
  i cant put my finger on it but that video is so pure/cute/sexy her blue eyes wig and outfit combined with the half serious/half kidding kpop dance drips youthfulness while the lyrics/content of the background song place everything in an adult setting the final dab brings it all together this flirting of this dead meme shows she is intelligent and knows how to parody herself and the tik tok platform
  good rundown  i feel this person tho   its really weird when there is a meme that doesnt really resonate it makes u feel old
  i guess they never miss
    i dont even know what the video is ive never seen a link to it
  hey i just wanted to let you know this is the worst post ive ever seen on this board

ive heard that its fatty relative to other meats and causes cancer whats the /ck/ ultimatum on pork
haram
  
everything good is bad for you get over it
everything causes cancer  breathing causes cancer
  pigs are a trash animal eating trash animals is subhuman and bad for you
  unironically muslims have it right pork ham bacon its all garbage  salt pork is good for soup but grocery stores dont carry it so wtf ever  only reason anyone would eat that garbage is that its cheap
there is literally no empirical evidence that pork or processed meats causes cancer that study has not been replicated and it was flawed in the first place     food science is an utter joke and is basically 99 conjecture
  unironically this
  existing causes cancer
its not great for you mainly because it causes ass cancer and then theres a poor fat to protein ratio  but imo its not bad every once in a while
  100 less likely to be a terrorist if you consume pork
  explain jews
  genital mutilation makes a man lose himself
  cut my dick off then if it means mr shekelstein will make me a banker at goldman sachs
  charlottesville dead beg to differ kid      idk the stress caused by clickbait worrying about everything giving you cancer is probably far worse than occasionally eating cured meat stress is the real killer
  its good for you
pork is just as if not more lean as chicken    
bros why is it so good    i am never drinking normal water again
  its a diuretic
  if you would rather buy unsweetened tea at a markup instead of brewing it yourself then it seems we have highly different philosophies about the value of money
  do you ever eat at restauants
  i understand your point that no one makes everything themselves that said restaurants dont serve their food out of plastic bottles that sat in the hot sun on a shipping pallet several states over
  that one is pretty good the other flavours are packed fucking full of sugar
  its just tea its convenient to buy one at the gas station with some jerky im not going to buy a bunch of pitchers and jars and premake tons of iced tea to clog up my fridge youre approaching autistic levels of caring too much
  i like the unsweetened green one
     got some of their tea bags recently go black tea with berries and black tea with vanilla to try
redpill me on salt
food for the asian bug horde
  the true original umami    dont let these dweebs tell you otherwise all those savory taste buzzword is literally just salty flavor
  makes me thirsty
its bad for you
makes food tasty but too much will make you bloated

  you need to eat some but not too much your body can handle a little oversalting but not undersalting
  has anyone even died from lack of salt lmao
  shouldve said pink himilayan
  yes although not usually because of lack of salt in the diet but instead from illnesses which causes hyponatreism lowsodium
  how did people survive before they found about salt mining then
  they drank animal cum
  they lived malnourished lives and died before what we would consider middle age
youll die without it
  like i said its not usually because of lack of salt in the diet you need such a miniscule amount that its very easy to consume enough without actually needing to produce raw salt  but it can be caused by diarrhea dehydration and other more serious illnesses of the liver and kidneys where it is often fatal
    yes drinking too much water has killed people dilutes the salts in your body
  i almost died from this but fortunately one of the symptoms was paranoid schizophrenia so my relatives got me to the hospital in time
  how much fuckin water did you drink
  uh dude this thread is about salt
  kek
  all salt more or less has the same nutritional value dont listen to the psuedoscientific subhuman faggot lurking in the gutters of this board who will link you a video of a new age naturopathic medicine nut as evidence
  autism
    put too much salt on food  ruined  be careful
  has anyone even died from lack of salt lmao  seriously salt is easily one of the most basic and essential biological needs why do you think those uf scientists who invented gatorade made such a big deal out of restoring electrolytes gatorade is basically just water sugar and electrolytes plus other nonnutritional supporting components like food dye buffering agent emulsifier and preservatives    hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalized individuals  hyponatremia even when mild is associated with increased mortality  the risk of death during hospitalization is increased by more than 50 in patients admitted with hyponatremia compared with normonatremia    how did people survive before they found about salt mining then  if salt is necessary for animal biology how is an animals meat not going to have salt content i dont understand your question ancient people ate animal meat and raw animal meat has salt content    basic report 05309 chicken cornish game hens meat only raw  sodium  68 mg per 100 g
  anything other than mortons pickling  canning salt is shit   its like 3 dollars at walmart for a whole box  this is the only salt that is literally just salt  all other salts have bleaching agents or non caking agents or additives or toxins from the water if its sea salt  its stronger than others so use less than normal  the only kindof salt that can compete with it would be himalayan but theres pros and cons  /thread
  i was drinking  15 gallons/day over a period of several months it really fucked me up they basically had to force me to be admitted to the hospital because i was a raving lunatic and even when the er medfag told me i was in serious danger of dying since my sodium level was so low i laughed hysterically and told him to fuck off out of my face im leaving he had security restrain me and gave me a shot to knock me out
  based and mcspankypilled
  redpill me on salt    we need to give back the jobs for the pepper because the salt took all of our money and jobs
  i almost died from this but fortunately one of the symptoms was paranoid schizophrenia so my relatives got me to the hospital in time    i was drinking  15 gallons/day over a period of several months  schizophrenia was a symptom of your 15 gallon per day water consumption wouldnt it be the other way around with your decision to drink 15 gallons of water daily being a symptom of schizophrenia
  wew lad
  idk the paranoid schizophrenia went away after they cut my water intake and my sodium levels got back to normal in retrospect it was stupid to drink that much water but there you go unless im really working up a sweat i keep my intake  2 qts nowadays
  yeah i know all these times i heard people talk about seasoning they were literally just talking about using salt you dont have to use a lot but if you dont use salt your food is going to be tasteless
  what motivated you to drink that much water if not mental illness i dont understand you dont even need to drink any water theres enough water content in everyday food and drinks to cover your hydration needs    medical myths  the advice to drink at least eight glasses of water a day can be found throughout the popular press one origin may be a 1945 recommendation that stated a suitable allowance of water for adults is 25 litres daily in most instances an ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 millilitre for each calorie of food most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods if the last crucial sentence is ignored the statement could be interpreted as instruction to drink eight glasses of water a day  another endorsement may have come from a prominent nutritionist frederick stare who once recommended without references the consumption around 6 to 8 glasses per 24 hours which could be in the form of coffee tea milk soft drinks beer etc the complete lack of evidence supporting the recommendation to drink six to eight glasses of water a day is exhaustively catalogued in an invited review by heinz valtin in the american journal of physiology
without enough a lot of stuff is horrible
  my family does not understand this   make food   oh this is so good did you season it or something  literal verbatim quote
  idk why i guess i thought it would keep my body cleansed or something plus i had stopped drinking soda and was using it as a substitute it wasnt mental illness just tardation really
  nacl    consider yourself redpilled
  how do animals get their salt tho
  you dont need to drink water you can get it from drinks  if you do any amount of physical activity you need water if youre an office pleb then im sure chugging cola can keep you hydrated enough that your muscles dont lock up but not everyone hates themselves enough to drink 2 liters of pissy cola  please post your daily intake of food and liquid captain soup
  salt licks i keep a block out near my deer stand and have to replace it every 6 months those fuckers love those things
always important to season to taste  theres nothing more bland than underseasoned food
  not him but here you go    cumulative urine output at 4 h after ingestion of cola diet cola hot tea iced tea coffee lager orange juice sparkling water and a sports drink were not different from the response to water ingestion    back in 1945 the food and nutrition board of the national research council stated that adults should take in about 25 liters of water per day which is roughly the equivalent of eight glasses of water but it also noted most of that intake level was already satisfied through the consumption of food without the need for the additional drinking of water and as other nutritionists of the time noted any shortfall in water intake could be made up through the consumption of beverages such as coffee tea milk or soft drinks one need not specifically drink water only in the form of water  one doctor who has made this his research focus dr heinz valtin searched through many electronic databases and also consulted with nutritionists and colleagues who specialize in water balance in the body in all of his research and in all of the research we conducted to doublecheck his work no scientific evidence could be found to suggest that you need to drink eight glasses of water a day in fact scientific studies suggest that you already get enough liquid from what youre drinking and eating on a daily basis we are not all walking around in a state of dehydration  tldr you fell for bottled water company propaganda
      over the last few weeks those who visited the british medical journals website might have noticed an advert for a new public health initiative hydration for health it is sponsored by danone  which owns the evian volvic and badoit bottled water brands  and urges healthcare professionals to encourage people to drink more water claiming that evidence is increasing that even mild dehydration plays a role in the development of various diseases  margaret mccartney a gp and columnist saw these adverts and complained about it writing an article for the bmj who admitted we hadnt followed our own guidelines the advertisement bypassed our editorial checks about the lack of evidence  and citing the shortcomings of many studies  that people should be drinking more water
  table salt has dextrose in it
  you fell for bottled water company propaganda  badoit is pretty gud tho
  thats strange ive been drinking a gallon of distilled water everyday for a year and a half and im perfectly fine did you not eat enough salt with meals i would imagine thats easy to do if you dont eat a lot of processed foods
  thats probably it i rarely eat processed foods just fresh dried or frozen vegetables fruits dairy and meats once in a while cured meats or sausages but not too often almost never eat at restaurants or fast food medfags just said it was too much water for too long a period they did a bunch of tests too because they said there are illnesses including some cancers that can cause dangerously low levels of sodium they also wouldnt give me sodium supplements because they wanted to ensure the sodium levels returned to normal on their own with just restricted water intake live and learn i guess
  the absolute state of burgerland education
  that doesnt even sound that much if i count tea and coffee too im easily drinking 5 liters a day and i weigh only 70 kg
  a gallon of distilled water everyday    if i count tea and coffee too im easily drinking 5 liters a day  if i ever have my own business im definitely going to make sure whoevers in charge of marketing has a background in bottled water sales assuming you guys arent just rusing me here and actually do guzzle that much fluid on a daily basis that you need lots of water all the time meme has to be one of the most effective propaganda efforts of all time
  how do animals get their salt tho  aside from salt licks theres naturally occurring salt in grass that ruminants can get at with their heavier duty digestive system its not uncommon for them to fail to meet their minimum salt needs though not enough salt is a major factor in grass tetany since when their sodium level is too low more of their magnesium gets used up
  lol what you need new tastebuds mate unless salt is explicitely stated in a recipe with a fixed quantity i never add salt in my food and its far from tasteless
  based post wars were fought over salt      depends what youre cooking anything raw plants flour all meat especially most other shit everything you make from scratch requires salt and benefits from it salt goes into ice cream it goes into cakes if you dont salt meat when you cook it you are not cooking not even discussion health here salt is literally paramount to cooking and if you are not using it daily you are not cooking no chef measures salt application except for baking that isnt related to their own method of measurement
  yea you build up a tolerance to salt i think i used to love salt so much but i decided to cut back on it just so i never have to deal with health issues and it took me maybe a month to find things not bland anymore
so if i order biscuits with sausage gravy in an english restaurant in great britain aka the united kingdom because scotland and ireland love it so fucking much what are they going to serve me cookies with fucking blood pudding sauce  why is it so hard to get a traditional southern breakfist staple in the england
  why would u want that for breakfast when u can have a full english lol
  i ordered an english muffin in england once they had no idea what the hell i wanted
  lad we were very familiar with your mums english muffin but were a polite country and didnt act like we knew you should thank us
  jokes on you i have two dads
  theyre not going to know what you mean i love biscuits and gravy but you cant expect us to know about regional food from across the pond     although you gave me an idea for an english take on it blood sausage gravy on savoury scones i bet its going to be delicious
  mash haggis in to a patty and fry it instant scottish scrapple
    in a pan not deep fry it fyi
  how about you suck my dick instead you fucking retard
  jokes on you one of them fulfills the role of mum no judgements here just sayin 
  nah theyre both the guy makes for some very confusing houseguests
  blood sausage gravy  oh god please dont if you want to try and approximate it strip the meat out of a cumberland sausage casing and create your sausage gravy ffs
  youre right of course but i cant help but wonder what blood pudding gravy would taste like youd probably need some good fatty pudding
  what does blood pudding taste like ill admit ive never had it before
  sesame chicken
  tastes like chicken
  ask 4 a crumpet next time
  thats what ended up happening
  dont forget to add grey poupon
  so if i order biscuits with sausage gravy in an english restaurant in great britain aka the united kingdom because scotland and ireland love it so fucking much what are they going to serve me    if i order american food term with american food term in not america what are they going to serve me    depends on whether any local foods have the same names in which case probably that
is it worth buying a rice cooker i cook my own rice but i can never get it consistent and i wouldnt mind the convenience on top of that
  no
if you eat rice often then yes
  if you shell out for a good one if you get a shitty 20 buck one then dont even bother to live anymore
  depends how much rice you cook i would say if you cook rice 23 times a week its worth it i live in a small apartment so i try to avoid buying appliances i have a technique for rice that is very consistent basically you simmer for 1015 mins and let sit with lid on for 1015 mins find the amount of water that works for that for me its 166g water for each gram of rice i have a method where i put a saucepan on the scales zero out the scales add a certain amount of rice then without resetting the scales wash the rice and add water until the scales reach the new amount i think this is more consistent since if you wash the rice then add a certain amount of water you dont control for how much water you add when washing the rice
  i have one of these my mom brought back from asia  served me well 10 years old and still going strong
just get an instant pot or some other pressure cooker multi bullshit thing and do 1 cup liquid to 1 cup rice i usually do 3/3
inb4 autist that spergs out about how cooking rice on a stove isnt difficult at all and how everyone who uses a rice cooker is a lowtest faggot soyboy because he cant understand the meaning of convenience
  oh sweety this is a rice cooker
  if you eat rice at least once a week then 100 yes
  use it for turkey heh
  good god yes even an idiot could cook enough rice for an entire week just by filling up that machine and pressing a button     a few tips though rice needs to be rinsed two or three times before cooking it any way and rice cookers need to have the top part disassembled to clean off evaporated starch after use
  nice try but you know damn well those things are designed like sieves to allow rising steam the only rice youre cooking in those are ricedumplings
  as a korean i cant even imagine making rice without a op pic do westies use oven to cook rice
yes it just works if you enjoy rice and cook it often theres no reason to not get one    theres this one guy on this board who absolutely hates rice cookers and will try to convince you to not buy one hes very dedicated he will debate people for hours if not days about it
  also if you dont need to cook rice ocassionally i recommend hetbahn just microwave this then ta dah better rice than my mother ever made
  its the same whteoid who thinks bottled water is a scam and only buys bottled hfcs instead
  ill take the baitno i dont use my oven to cook ricei use a small pot on my stove to cook itand desu even that is too fucking easy
  sometimes they use one of these source am a westaboo have learend many westie recipes such as the tomato sandwich la palla valenciana and even the most authentic recipe ambrosia salad
rice cookers are for mothers who are feeding 3 and college students who do not want to bother it also can start cooking for you when youre out to classes also if youre from a country that has rice as a dish everyday its well worth it
  also if youre from a country that has rice as a dish everyday  you mean the united states    your days are numbered whteoids
wash your rice well in a sieve add it to a saucepan and add twice as much water simmer with a lid on until water is gone done dont waste your money on a oneuse meme gadget
  its only worth it if you use it to cook turkey heh
  he washes his rice
  heh
    h e h  e h e  h e h
  el turkey jej
  heh
  yes i use mine all the time and it turns out great why do people debate so much over a 50 appliance thats convenient i also use it to steam meat buns
for some reason it feels as if this device should be the odd man out and not people who cook rice in pots i find cooking rice so mind numbingly easy i cant imagine paying anything more than free for such a thing add pot add whatever water ratio you like cook done its convenient enough as is i can however imagine if i was raised with one or was gifted a good one i would use it but kinda feels like counter top filler too
its easy to make say lemon rice or other types using a rice cooker cause of the keep warm function you can just toss w/e you want in the rice mix it up and close the lid
i was clean for almost a week before this latest relapse and now its business as usual again seems like i was close and now the disappointment is overwhelming  how are you holding up bros  also raremedium rare mediumdog foodwell done  how

  my first girlfriend broke up with me after i had come home from work drinking before leaving and all the way home and i had passed out before she got home i woke up and saw that it was 7 on the clock and thought it was dawn i knew i was too drunk to drive so i was calling for a cab to get to work when she walked in coming home from her work she took me to a hospital and i went into rehab that didnt stick    doing better these days though  taking it a bit more easy  got shit to do that is actually important to me so that helps    keep it real

  find something else to do and find ways to feel better about yourself i cant tell you what they are i dont know you see a psychologist if necessary
  switch from weak ass sake to 151 rum      but seriously this     and maybe listen to some dr drew pinsky podcasts
  take a walk and listen to classical music
  ok thanks this actually helps since i have many hobbies just have to focus on those and not the bottle getting shit done should be the name of the game and 4chan has a lot of communities for those hobbiesshitty but good once you dig deep     thats instant vomit for me and i am incapable     yeah anything that gets me active is probably a good idea i have a great beach near where i live i should go just fucking go and listen to my thoughta as i walk on that endless sand see what happens nothing but good can come from that interaction with the eternal blue horizon
who here /heartburn/
mods
  ah the stomach cant take it  i know that feeling        be careful with the beach walking  i used to live on the california coast and would get plastered and put on my earphones and stumble to the beach it was awesome and romantic and id spend hours out there    then id wake up in somebodys bushes in their backyard right before sunrise      here here  i took some tums antacid about an hour ago but i think that might end up doing more damage in the long run
  i was in the same boat 4 months ago suffering from sweating shaking and diarrhea after going clean for 1 day after getting a job i really cut back on my drinking down to 12 servings every day and 1 day a week without any alcohol currently on my longest clean streak now which is 2 days i know 2 days isnt that long but were gonna make it bros
  they all taste the same
ham and cheese is objectively the worst  barbecue chicken is objectively the best
  lol who even eats that
  underachievement
  mom said to get hearty snacks
  college students at least i did these were the ones for me packaging is different and the bread might be different here but it was the lean pocket chicken parmesan if i recall the only other one that was passable was the lean pocket pepperoni the philly cheese steak was horrific as was the meatball marinara or whatever it was cheap calories you can do in a microwave and at least get some protein as opposed to ramen or whatever theyre not bad honestly
  who even eats that  janitors who clean up messes on anime image boards
  thats the most depressing wellington i have ever seen
  this
  pretty much this
chicken pot pie was pretty dank
  fuck you i like the ham  cheese
  i liked the taco flavored hot pockets the best rip
  then youre an affront to the human race
  i used to have a co worker who would bring in a mega pack of these with his lunch fattest fat fuck i ever knew also crazier than shit he used to have arguments with people that were not there worst part was that when you walked into this situation hed button up and become normal again without mentioning his outburst glad he finally got fired
  anything crunchy
  the free ones
i found pic related today at the grocer  i guess all the pushing of getting this back on the shelves   now i need you anons to go try them and eat them lots so that limited time label comes off   these poptarts were so good as a child in a single mother household
  im gay btw not sure if that matters
  it explains why your favourite flavour is filled with cum     but for me but for my money though its gotta be breyers orange creamsicle ice cream the only one i couldnt find for four years
optimal nutrition for optimal results  these nutrition facts are for a slightly different variety but im sure its very similar
  usually im not a fan of breyers they put to much stuff peanuts chips etc in and it bothers me but i could go for as much orange/creme that they give
  btw for people who dont know each pack includes 2 pastries so its recommended serving size of 1 pastry probably doesnt reflect real servings
  damn right best cheap breakfast foodstamps can buy
btw  did that anon post the recipe for the pb crisps  tease pic of the final product was the last i saw it was just a day or two ago  if they brought that back life might be worth living
  theres nothing quite like starting your day by dumping 50g of sugar on your liver
  shit i was drinking hot tea for a while and i used so much sure that it was easier just to weigh it 104 grams for my large cup of tea   breaking news eating egg yolks helps your liver regenerate but only if not too far gone the liver is an amazing organ also should mention your liver regenerates even without helping it along but only if not too far gone
  104 grams  thats 26 teaspoons wtf m8
  while i fully agree less sugar the better but you got any papers on that egg yolk claim not hating i eat a ton of eggs just curious
  coke blak  never  vanilla coke  sometimes but only in cans you assholes which are 3x more expensive  lays limon chips  i was 2800 miles away when i had them in 2001 but theyve come to my store in the last year  planters cheese balls  never
  right it was like 56heaping silerware tablespoons but i wanted the perfect every time but i was eating 2 packs of poptarts sometimes it got me addicted and i wonder what has kept me from getting the beetis
  spent 5 straight minutes looking for a reaction image for your post i dont know if im more horrified disgusted or impressed please fix yourself
  5 minutes hell i would of changed the channel  the verdict  i toasted up a pack and poured some milk  the crust is a little softer but the taste and smell are spot on just like when i was young  i might not of toasted long enough i burnt some others a few weeks ago in a toaster oven
  tfw remembering sleepovers at my poor friends house  his wino mom was super nice and would take us to the grocery store where wed load up on chips ice cream deli food whatever  would always pick up a box of pop tarts and munch em straight out of the box and watch one of his old ass vhs tapes before we crashed for the night  wed also shower together because they wanted to save money on water heating or something
  i had friends/family die because you cant live with a non functioning liver so i started learning about the liver thats how i came across the info  choline is involved in transporting fat and cholesterol away from the liver to tissues that need them when choline levels are critically low fat can build up in the liver impacting its ability to detoxify our bodies yikes    i know its a blog but im not spending more time on it
  cookies and creme are better  in contrast kelloggs frosted chocolate vanilla creme pop tarts barely taste like chocolate theyre a lot more floury than the cc and my initial impression is that theyre bland as hell the lighter brown color is symbolic of a much lighter flavor the pastry itself falls flat on the cocoa making matters worse mine had such a thin layer of vanilla filling that i could barely taste it kelloggs frosted chocolate vanilla creme pop tarts include vanilla extract whereas cc did not which makes it even more disappointing that i hardly recognized its flavor the creme is overpowered by the dough when eaten dry    toasting the kelloggs frosted chocolate vanilla creme pop tarts doesnt solve the problem it just adds a burnt toasted flavor to the boring dough i still didnt taste the vanilla center no wonder these were discontinued    
eating any of this nasty processed shit
  all of that is spot on except the low key chocoflavor is just lovely and compliments the sauce perfect  of course there is less sauce just about every company is cutting as many corners as they can get away with  get this nigger out of the thread asshole  thread closed
  more like poptards
kinda unrelated but i went to my big super market the other day and in the cookies isle theres a huge fucking variety of different chips ahoy cookies different flavors different textures different sizes i never knew this was a thing and some of them looked pretty fucking tasty     no wonder kids today are so fucking fat
my moms still dead im still a garbage cook so my favorite food is never coming back
gonna cook a sirloin later any advice on what to do with it i dont mean how to cook it but a good recipe
  do not salt it until youre 30 seconds from putting it on the pan
  i was gonna use my sous vide actually i season it right before it goes into the bag
    id dice it up and make a steak and ale pie
  fug that sounds good especially with a homemade buttery crust
  balsamic vinegar
    love a good pastry on a pie i am partial to a puff pastry lid but mustard glaze on the top is really nice when doing any kind of steak pie
  sous vide  the ol classic olive oil garlic and thyme/rosemary
  you actually dont want any oil or butter on it while its in the bag it waters down the meat
tried some homemade hog jerky  it was actually pretty good kinda tasted just like any other jerky just weird because i typically think of deer or beef jerky but it was pretty awesome
thoughts on poutine and its variants like the pounair
  man can you find me that thread from last night about the guy butchering a deer i cant find it in the archive or catalog
  just chili cheese fries for canadians
is it possible to make meat with the sheer level of crunch and crispiness as a shawarma places at home
  based
horsemeat fries are the clear winner
  i love poutine but its only good in qu√©bec because its the right cheese im not a fan of the thousand variations i like mine normal i just add black pepper on it    its really about the cheese anglos just dont use curds maybe wisconsin might make it right also i remember when the anglo canadians used to bash the meal saying it was shit and in the last decade theyve presented it to the us as a staple canadian meal like they invented it typical anglo faggotry
  its good shit but here in portland its trendy aka overpriced
  i dont know about that but there was a thread on /k/ about a guy who killed and fucked a deer
oh    oh yeah    you can really taste the um the spices    and the cumin    oh
  leans too much to the right  mmmmmmmmmm
i dont know this man why do i hate him so much
  
  he has the eyes of a murderer
mark must be stopped at all costs
  the bodies where are they
  i really hope this fucking faggot is faking all this shit on purpose because he knows it will get him more views to act so outlandishly retarded either way im deeply disgusted by him
  u dont

  he is leaning to the left though retrad
stop spamming this ugly piece of dogshit here
this insufferable twat again fucks sake /ck/ god fucking dammit this dude is worse than jack    yes im fukken triggered
  his face is perfectly shaped so as to invite punching
  this theres just something about that face that speaks directly to the midbrain all that learned civility is bypassed directly and only the primitive need to kill and fuck remains
  good to see someone actually saved my screenshot of this wanker
  who are these kikes
what bodies
oh wow
    jesus christ  i thought the dude from brothers green was annoying
  the lean is directly proportionate to how unhygienic the food is    food made in a modern kitchen in a city  hmm thats good    food made in unwashed hotplate in grandmas backyard surrounded by goats and stirred by hand  leeeeeean  bug eyes  hehehehe  woooah you can really taste the spices
he should do porn
he looks like mix of korean actor jang hyunsung and mexican character quico
    this was too funny for me to not screencap
  top zozzle
does this guy always make idiotic and infuriating faces or is it just cherrypicking with the screenshots
  a little of both
hes unstoppable
consumes entire 711
  literally kill yourself
  nope
  eyes of a leftist scumbag
  post of a faggot lmao
  dont you have somewhere to shoot up or bomb like your brethren
whats his ethnicity
  already got 10000 upvotes on /r/4chan you are so fucking mad
  i hate this tasteless tastlet faggot everything you put in your mouth isnt an orgasm that fucking faggot some things are just meh and some shit is just gross stop playing it up so much actually describe it
    the posts of your typical shitlib always offended and always dishing out low tier responses intended to strike at ones self esteem like a woman does from within a clique    fuck damn i wish i could try some leftist in a nice soup too bad the meat is probably of extremely poor quality
  rape his muoth with a knife fuck bitch asshole i want to shit his intestines
  he ate them all
  threadly reminder mark used to be normal  watch one of his old videos  
  normal how can you say that hes not even eating anything in that vid
  he has an ancestry videoyou know the results looks like his moms side is chinese and his dads side is germanic/nordic/anglo/whatever
  he cute
  ofc hes a hapa
  i didnt know jackie chan had a youtube
  he was a cool guy before the incident
  you can really taste the ingredients that this dish is comprised of    this is why i hate food shows always the same verbatim bullshit
  damnmate ruined his life
  his constant and desperate efforts to seem enthralled by east asian cooking/culture are obviously some kind of freudian need to reaffirm his mothers worth after she got impregnated by a whte
  the acidity of the lemon really shines through this dish  yes its a fucking lemon tart you tedious prick
  i heard that guy is some kind of molester and his wife is a man
  why does his voice here sound deeper than his current voice is it the mic quality
  the only food that hes claimed to have no liked was actually expired meat in some asian country  why would anyone trust this guys opinions
  el goblino
  what a supreme gentleman
  most big youtubers have a fake accent
  hes leaning to his right fucking mong
  retard
    learn your left and right retards
  retard
tell me were the bodies are  widens eyes exagerated smile grows larger what bodies
    you too must look silly now morons
  someone makes a meme if that t shirt
  fuck off mark
  this guy is involved in human trafficking
  you can taste the spice in there
    what happened to him
  mexican character quico  i knew id seen that face somewhere before
  i starting watch his video regularly but after awhile it gets repetitive  he just bums around japan china korea and south east asia  he eats the same shit  claims something is the best version hes ever tasted when hes said that a few videos back  i will admit his eating at convenient store videos were cozy
waaaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuu
  mens level of testosterone decreases when they find a partner it decreases even further when they have a child
  he is a mixed mutt with psychological problems
  the adrenochrome changed him
  what
i want to see mark drink water
  he cute
wiens is shit mike chen is the superior asian reviewer because unlike wiens he doesnt googly eyed praise and love everything he actually has constructive criticism
  ok this is epic
  this is the last thing all those innocent thai children saw before they were buried
  that facial expression  it smells like his last victim
  adrenochrome  i dont even know what that is
  mike  pure asian a bit cringy but has a heart of gold and is anticommunist if the food sucks he wont be afraid to admit it  mark  hapa half chinese half white clearly something wrong with him from the way he tries to act human hes a nice guy too but there is something darker behind the facade everything he eats makes his eyeballs bulge out and is apparently very delicious to him
  id start them kicking banana trees as soon as they can stand if you cant stand your ground or run away hes gonna get you
  i bet he has a nice masculine vagina
  this video is making me want to kill myself
  human youtube thumbnail generator
  stirring something by hand makes it dirty     its probably cleaner than have a load of teenagers not give a fuck on minimum wage they dont give a fuck
  wow wow what do you think mark 20  wow wow hahaha wow  who is that mark 20 faggot that mimics him in some of his videos is it his brother
his eyes unnerve me
  so youre saying if i want to slow my balding i should actually find someone to put up with my shite
ripped  flies business/first class  slays commies when hes down eating asias finest foods  doesnt have any heyyyy check it out or mmmmmmmmmmmmm gimmicks  lives innawoods with his own home gym  mikey is /our/ guy
  i just hate his chinese accent that occasionally leaks out and he sounds like hes going to hock up a nasty mucus ball whenever hes casually talking
  ohoh fuck
  siding with chinamen   ever    polcucks i truly not ready for whats coming
does /ck/ take kindly to buzzfeed
  of course thats why he does it although it doesnt make it any better because the content is still produced
/our girl/
  incident
  tfw no rie waifu
  he was an edgy stoner back then and one night he and some friends were trying out a satanic ritual for the lulz and because they were all high as fuck at the time did not properly close off the session resulting in mark apparently being possessed everyone wrote it off as just a bad trip when mark passed out and woke up the next day just fine but ever since marks voice sounded different he over reacts every time he consumes something and he developed a trademark stare he does with his eyes bulging out this is all based on the accounts of one his old friends that stopped hanging around him after that night so nobody is certain if its all a lie or not because mark himself does not admit to anything when questioned
  how does he stay thin despite what he eats the exercise routine he shows definitely wouldnt do it and he cant exactly do all that frequently when traveling
  its creepy the way watching other people enjoy things has become an industry what the fuck man
hes crap and youtube wont stop recommending him to me every time i search for street food or food related videos    can youtube programmers fix your failed algorithm stop recommending him to me
this guy is creepy as fuck plus he looks like hes the son of a sex tourist or something
as soon as he goes to react to a bite someone should kick him in the face
  good thinking thats the only time he is vulnerable to physical attacks
  oh man thats brutal  spoilerbut true/spoiler
mark wiens threads are the best thing on /ck/
mark is handsome
  horsefaced jap that works at buzzshit  /ourgirl/  nope
his new pakistan series is awful the food is all oil slicked meat shards cooked by brutish men because women are not allowed in public he doesnt interact with his wife because thats harambe she has to walk behind him and stay silent pakistan looks like an absolute shithole and most of the youtube comments are praising mark for showing the real pakistan and its people and not the negative media portrayal
  he doesnt interact with his wife because thats harambe she has to walk behind him and stay silent   but she always does that though
    asians tend to store more of their fat as visceral fataround their organs rather than subcutaneous fat like blacks and whites while on the outside they may look healthy their guts are swimming in harmful adipose tissue
  but she always does that though  alkalized
i wish someone would smell me like this
  
i like food ranger and mikey chen mark is too much of a meme
  love mike but he really needs to go to some new countries we get it 7/11s are awesome pho is awesome kbbq is awesome i like that he went to italy hope he does some more stuff in new places soon
who is this guy
  yeah he should go to mogadishu and go mia during filming
  it appears that he tried to hide his autism by emulating the cool kids depicted in american college films and eventually just decided to embrace his autism and psychopathy
  edumacated folk are scarrrwwy  good thing we have geds so you can stand in line take fetanyl and heroin and wait for the factories to open again which never will but at least muh illegals wont have jerbs either ok
  what a queer thing to say
there is a video of him commentating on his mother in law cooking and saying she is one of the best cooks ever as she cooks some duck shit    the idea of the girl bringing him home for the first time to meet the folks and him doing his bug eye leany routine around the supper table is cracking me up describing spices and ghee as he wolfs down handfuls
  she makes him eat bones thats why he looks so funny
  lol what is this comment kys    t more educated than you
  imagine mikeys farts after he devours 5 servings of spicy lamb hotpot haha
  what would you do if you were on a date with mikey
  make hoptpot sauce just the way he likes it  feed him shabushabu  kiss his cheek to get rid of a grain of rice  have gelato together  sloppily suck his thick spicy cock after the date in our hotel room until he cums in my throat   mmm its thicker than the cream broth we had earlier
  is mikey still doing that thing where if youre in his area he will gladly take you around town to try out restaurants together maybe you should messaging him
    mikey pls
  hhow much for the whole course  happy ending haha asking for a friend
  mike is pure he wouldnt be giving out himself like that i think for costs you split the bill with him
  i got banned for 3 days the last time i posted this face
  bad boy
  i mean guy fieri is basically the same style though marks definitely has an innately disturbing quality to it
  yeah hes basically that guy who watches trailers while staring at the camera and making goofy faces i think the target audience is little kids mostly
    that was naked lunch right
  what is this even about
  must be nice to have rich parents
  i sure hope you dont have an important job
  i remember this junji ito story
  hed still be pure if i were his bf
  all his videos get 1mil views he must make decent money on ads
  i think it was fear and loathing in las vegas
  eyes wide shut  kubriks final film and the one that got him killed
  you can really taste the um  you can taste the cum  yes mark we know
  hey guys check this out  mark weiner  buahahahahaha
markusan
  this guy is evil
   not using tomorrow    shit tier taste t b h
  hes literally admitted to being possessed by demons multiple times
  thafs because he doesnt know how to pronounce s sounds he always pronounces s as sh
  what the fuck
cumin is pretty dank though    get the whole seeds and toast em in a pan them frind them up so its all fresh    aw fuck yeahmmmmmmmm
  trevor is worse than mark   best are those channels where the host isnt even on camera and they just record vendors making the food
  based
  his parents are christian missionaries and he went to some christian cult school in africa its a feat he isnt more fucked up
  he doesnt hes visited his parents who live in a shitty little house with an abandoned car out front
oh the juicinesss mmmm and the chilli oh wow its incredible mmmmmmm
what a shit thread im surprised that males would actually stoop to this level usually only women are this petty kill yourself a numales worthless fags
  wtf man spoiler that shit
  sanpaku eyes  yep checks out hes gonna die soon
  he travels for work probably between china and the states hence why he flys first class all the time he probably rakes in tons of flight points and hours and usually just does videos on asian food because its all he can get in
    checked
  he doesnt go to china actually because hes afraid of being arrested for being part of a banned cult falun gong
  and the fact that hes got such a nice healthy body would make him prime material for the chinese government to sell his organs
  he said to the right implying camera right not his right
  somebody needs to do one of those creepy photoshop edits on this pic   i would do it if i knew how
  bombs that somehow got mailed without a postmark and had a get er done isis printout totally not a falseflag  dont shoot up a baseball stadium or country concert buddy
  because right wingers cant be crazy ding bats
  holy psychotic break batman you okay buddy raid didnt go as well as planned
  i didnt say that synogogue shooter was a right winger pissed at trump for not being antisemitic hence why i didnt rebuke that  but the bomb thing is hilarious lazy and blatant false flag you cant mail a bomb with a package that isnt postmarked and a bomb requires an ingition source and explosives there were no bombs and seriously a sticker that looks like the isis flag that says get er done its all so laughable the media shut up about it quick for a reason
  trigger device would maybe be the better term im not gonna look of homemade bomb anatomy there was no timer no chemical fuse nothing
  crazy people doing crazy stuff doesnt make any sense  really makes you think
  so being crazy means you can get a package through the federal mail system without any postmark yknow that stamp they do to every piece of mail to date it and void the stamps the ine required for the package to be mailed interesting tell me how
  i watch him when i wanna see a nigga feastin on oriental food
  its nothing but a joke anon you shouldnt look into it
the eyes of a madman
  1 million views means roughly 2k which is nice but not baller
  there were police already massed outside of the cnn office in nyc a week before the bombings they knew this was coming
  hes a registered sex offender
  is it not enough creepy for you ok there you have sweaty creepy mark
  why does he look so gaunt he looks as old as my 70 year old father
  its because of the spicy food he eat
i sincerely want to kill this guy its a primal urge i think id jump him on instinct if i saw him in real life how does someone with a face this infuriating not get beaten half to death every time he goes outside
  hfw people in every country like him
  bullshit i bet if you see him in real life youll squeel with joy and ask for a picture and autograph
  t mark wiens
  honestly i would then post the pic of photo with the caption i met a serial killer today
  arbys hoodie  when youre so pure and far removed from being a roastie you can wear a roast beef suit and its not awkward
          day of the rope you fucking weirdos
  in case you havent been paying attention youre the weirdo on /ck/ 
  go back to 4chan this is 4channel a progressive image board
  hes trying to steal the soul of those poor noodles
why is this thread still alive
  jesus christ this fucking guy that huge head on that skinny neck the eyes it doesnt make me mad but i feel a primal distrust and hatred towards this mn
     voice got higher pitched and for some reason his neck got thinner now his neck is pencil thin
  doesnt like a hapa
  the adrenochrome does things to you
why does he do the wide eyed mmmm face every tiem
  he got hitched and had a baby
  reminds me of this guys absolutely retarded expression every time he takes a bite of anything so awkward what are you supposed to say when he makes this face and stares at you
  im gonna kill you ray romano
  that fucking face cringiest part of that show
  cringe
  when you rip a fat nut into the preschooler you kindnapped 3 days ago
  faggot of yourself
  but wait its leftwing muslims that do that wat
  i hate this fucking face show is actually decent but this face makes me cringe every time
  see  
  ok this is yummy
    why is everyone that likes this show fucking gay
do we have a problem here
  imagine trying to justify your stupidity this hard
  hes not wrong at all
this is a paragraph from a book about casinos describing about the buffet at the luxor     are you a trough monster
tfw not a trough monster
  caring what buffet workers and line cooks think  bring me my mtdew and shut your mouth  t trough monster
  based
  alpha as fuck
i mean what the fuck else are you going to do in vegas they have casinos and buffets  complaining about literally onehalf of your citys tourist attractions seems stupid
making a pig of myself is my favorite way to eat
  are you a trough monster  yes im there to utterly pillage the meats and seafood im that guy you always see walking away from the seafood section carrying 45 crab legs and prime rib on a tray vegas buffets are 3540 bucks youre damn straight im getting my moneys worth
golden_corraltxt
  just make sure then when making blue berry muffins at my casino that the berrys are evenly distributed among the muffins
  this whoever wrote this should really just kill themselves
  guy reports on how a vegas buffet organizes its food and reports that buffet workers referred to the real cuisine crushers as trough monsters    he should kill himself
  buffets are like a fight man against restaurant  you win if you consume more in food than what you paid to get in
buffet workers  yeah i can eat more than a 54 beaner
  hookers man
  70 at some casinos drinks are usually though
    t triggered fatlords
  are you a trough monster  no i tend to avoid buffets as i dont like to overeat nor am i a fan of mediocre food
  absolute unit
  unironically based
  based  troughpilled
  yes i am a trough monster i waddle my fat ass straight past all of that salad bar bullshit and go straight for the prime rib and seafood tasty meats deepfried treats  i pile them on one plate two plate three plates four ima beast if i dont dump a solid twoflusher after a visit to a buffet then i have failed as a human being
  best scene
  take the trough pill you fucking pussy
why dont buffets simply add appetite suppressants to their food
i went to two buffets in vegas the cheap small indian buffet in a shitty casino was infinitely better than the big varied expensive buffet the food was mediocre in both but mediocre indian food is better than overpriced mediocre generic bullshit  plus at the indian buffet i was sitting next to some vidya semifamous people and got to eavesdrop on their shop talk  the vita never stood a chance boys
  wouldnt work fast enough
  i live in vegas and dont understand the fascination with buffets i can eat maybe two plates if im hungry so it doesnt seem worth it
  you have to understand buffets were a combination that everyone who survived the great depression loved a cafeteria combined with the idea that you could eat as much as you wanted baby boomers inherited this from their parents cafeterias are all but gone with the exception of hospitals military and the occasional lubys but buffets have always been inferior to cafeterias
  paying to have sex with s condom on  no thanks im young and attractive enough im sure i can find a drunk sloot eager to make a bad decision in vegas buy some molly and i can bait em in two or three at a time like does to corn
  i have zero incentive to do so
  im the second post tagged im actually scrawny as fuck working at a buffet in vegas and complaining about people being fat is like volunteering at a soup kitchen in detroit and complaining about people being poor crackheads what the fuck else would you expect working at a buffet
    have you guys never worked with customers  customers are awful of course staff is going to complain about them employees dont complain about customers who are cool but in a tourist city like vegas im sure the great majority are giant assholes
only if i did badly at the tables because then i often a free ticket and im earning my money back
  its still cooked and wasted at the end of the day if no one eats it lose lose dumb fuck
me trough monster  me eat buffet into bankruptcy
  prostitution isnt legal in clark county
  i live in vegas theres a shitton more to do here including world class dining and entertainment if you think its just gaming and buffets you either havent been here since the early 90s have never been here or are the lowest of low class    i work in corporate for the casinos and its actually really interesting to have a real understanding of what the buffet thing costs overall and what the benefit of it is to your property its a low cost way to give people perceived value
  i feel bad for the semicolons you raped
i dont eat at buffets very often but when i do i consider it to be a challenge to eat as much as i possibly can
  good for you lad
  thats how all buffets work and yes however high end it might be if its high traffic its always fucking disgusting
  you case the fucking buffet before you get anything who doesnt case the fucking buffet
  amateurs
buffet pricing is weird    if you are as the op terms it a trough monster it makes perfect sense to go to a buffet    but a buffet needs to make money so every dollar they lose feeding the trough monster they make by overcharging you t normal eater either by having the price too high or the quality too low    i never eat at buffets unless i already know im going to be stuffing my face you can get way better qualityformoney by purchasing a single dish most places    my goto example being brunch at a caf√©  there are two right across from each other near my home one offers a brunch buffet the other a variety of brunch platters  they cost about the same to use beverages are almost identical in price but the quality at the buffet is well lower than the quality at the table service place    i guess if i had multiple kids the greater variety of combinations at the buffet would make it easier to make sure that each of them could find something to their taste but when its just me the wife and the one single sprog thats quite unnecessary
healthy fruit snack/gummy substitute that is not dried fruit i want something like welchs fruit snacks that i can eat 5 packs a day of without ingesting 100grams of sugar or artificial sweeteners i have my reasons asking for a small friend
  just eat sugar free
fruit roll up or fruit by the foot  gushers if you take it easy
  worry that the artificial sweeteners are worse than sugar tho
  both of these have too much sugar for my purposes my friend needs to consume 5 packs of fruit snacks a day  so am looking for a healthy substitute that wont cause internal damage at that next level 5 packs a day habitual use level
  why dont you just eat actual fruit
  hahahahaha this is /ck that would be too complicated for op
  i cant use fruit for personal reasons dont want to blog just looking for that magic healthy fruit snack substitute i have considered some internet recipes that use fruit puree and gelatin but none of them seem quite right the texture would be more like pate de fruit or jello i think not gummy enough gummy bear recipes seem like they would be too hard in texture
  i cant use fruit for personal reasons  oh just fuck right off
  try dried apricots those are unsung heros
  dude what gummies are pure sugar or sugar substitute  you enjoy them more because theyre sugary shit    eat fruits jackfruit is good although sadly hard to find rambutans are good too as are persimmons if you dont have acid reflux like me and are careful about the annoying skin and super fucking annoying leaves
does anyone have a gummy or hard candy recipe i could play around with is stevia bad for you
  cant use fruit for personal reasons  what like fiber just dont overeat and/or buy so much and get some baby carrots or something to satiate your urge to snack
  are you from /pol
  almonds baked fruit chips smoothie pops chestnuts vegetable chips homemade not that store bought shit
  although they are delicious my friend cant eat a lot of dried fruit it is a laxative
  by the way if you do manage to find jackfruit it has to be sliced jackfruit because a whole jackfruit is too fucking big and wont last for just one person before going bad instead creating a giant chasm in your wallet
  stevia is called the healthiest sweetener but many studies are divided on whether they cause problems long term or not though i would stick to minimum sugar anyways it placebos you into thinking its ok to heavily consume sweeteners which can lead to sugar addiction if you go sweet might as well go with the og sweeteners like honey and multiple types of sugar like granulated confectioners or light or dark brown
  ah he/she has stomach problems red meat helps prevent pooping and more nutrients are absorbed and theres less stuff that needs to be disposed in the ways of ie defecation
    im potty training an autistic child and using fruit snacks as a reward ok dont tell me to use fruit/ or that im doing this wrong unless you yourself have potty trained an autistic toddler i just want a fruit snack substitute or healthy candy recipe not to discuss the whys and wherefores has to be candylike or indistinguishable from a regular fruit snack but not packed with corn syrup aspartame and bowelloosening vitamin c
  your baked fruit chip idea gives me hope thankyou
make gummy bears with kombucha fruit  gelatin
    i am thinking of using honey and fruit/veggie puree with 2x gelatin or agar agar in candy molds     pooping less sounds good but its hard to get toddler to eat red meat
  have you ever tried these what texture do they have why add the kombucha i read a recipe for these and had these questions
  try feeding them it via stroganoff although limit sour cream and avoid butter and replace it with oil or margarine
  rice pudding
    sorry that came off bitchywhenever you mention autism in a thread it goes offtopic and im just looking for a healthy fruit snack or candy recipe
  he might like that thanks i will try
  gimmie that pud pud
  rice pudding is so good and he loves tapioca pudding but for my purpose it needs to be a portable small candy he can eat one by one with as much time as possible between pieces as an inducement to stay on the potty with one pack of fruit snacks he can clock up to 5 mins sitting time
  i hate that prison skinhead guy he ruined their happy worldjoe gilguns character was such a good leader before that jerk showed up
  how about crystallized ginger snacks
  i know its weird shit
  in other words he doent like pudding enough for it to be used as a reward and it would feel weirder giving him pudding in the bathroom
  wow i forgot about those that might actually work or maybe those chinese ginger chews that come in the rice paper wrapper cut into small bits
  either way try those out its good stuff
  yeah the crystallzed ginger and pic related are so good might help his stomach issues as well thanks
  eating artificial sweetener based gummies  you know theres a reason why they dont have calories right its because you dont digest anything do you really want to rape your bowels just for a simulation of sugar flavor  
  there are these ginger gum things too theyre hard to find and great to help mitigate a hangover
  thankyou i had no idea and might have tried will use honey and fruit puree probably maybe some dehydrated strawberry or apple chips and ginger candy if he likes
  thanks i think i just saw some on amazon
  these are even harder to find than ginger gum
  autism  have you tried throwing it away and trying again
  thats just rude
  welcome to 4chan the land of autistic lucky you got here before the safe for work boards were divided from the others
  but have you considered my suggestion     gookmoot is retarded
  omg i love those
  god no matter how many times i read this the fucking diction and description is just way too god damn funny hot damn lol
  your nazi suggestion of throwing away babies doesnt work
  not that guy this is op suggesting you should climb into a dumpster right now and close the lid and wait for garbage truck to arrive
  that might be a waste folk can make soylent green wafers out of it
  i want something like welchs fruit snacks that i can eat 5 packs a day of without ingesting 100grams of sugar  why not learn some self control eat just one pouch and continue to enjoy your favorite fruit snack
  look up agar dessert recipes its exactly what you need
  dont feel ashamed op even moreso dont let the people here get to you as for gummy snacks i think gelatin is going to be your best bet also look into agar flakes theyre practically like gelatin but i think create a thicker gel like substance    good luck op and best of luck to you and the child you are potty training
  its not actually for her but for her autistic child to train it to act normal
  kombucha is a probiotic really good for the stomach i dont think a toddler would be to happy to eat these though kombucha is a fermented drink and its for people who like fermented drinks it has a slight beer like taste and feel but its not beer
  maple syrup is also an option a bit pricey but an option nonetheless
  yar matey
i had some brie cheese and it tastes like cum  what  the  fuck
wtf i love brie now
  you fancy your own jizz do ya op
  what other kind of brie could you be talking about
  oh sorry i came in your brie
  you want more zaddy
i dont know what cum tastes like because im not a fag but brie is the ultimate party cheese put it on a plate with a spreading knife and some crackers some little slices of baguette party guests can fix it up themselves and it seems way fancier than it really is tasty stuff
ef et looks loch comb and et smails loch comb et es comb
  sheepsmilk brie is my go to when im hosting a party but its usually on the firm side got a favorite gooey smear style brie
  why does your cum taste like brie
so do mushrooms
mmmmhmmmm fill me up daddy
  not him but my cum has had many flavors over the years depending on diet brie is definitely one of the most common flavors it is especially prominent when i havent been eating many of the foods renown for sweetening cum such as pineapple
  superior soft cheese coming thru with none of that moldy rind baggage
  bbbbrrrraaaaaaapppppp
op admits to knowing what cum tastes like
    based brap posters
  why are you constantly tasting your own cum
  what are you talking about cum tastes so much better
  why not just all circle jerk onto some ritz
  because its the most efficient way to clean most of it up you reclaim the nutrients and save on water and towels/tissues
  please dont use dia to shitpost
  i might just need to suck a dick after all
proteinrich food tasting like semen means it is a healthy food
  dick cheese brie
  op proving his faggotry
  now i cant suck cock without thinking abou cheese thanks alot op
  wtf im a faggot now
  whats /ck/ stance on cambozola
  i found one really good and gooey brie at a kroger a few years ago but ive totally forgotten the brand name
owo
  lol
  makes an excellent cheese sauce
  just jack off into the toilet if lack of tissues are an issue
  i have no idea but thought the same thing when i first tried brie    raw dough thats underfermented has that smell too sometimes i think its some combination of salts and proteins
i dont know about the taste cause i never tasted cum but i did notice how brie cheese smells similar to my cum as i masturbate often and like to smell my cum
  makes sense why fags like brie so much like me
if your cum tastes like cheese you should try eating healthier drink soy milk instead of dairy milk
  definitely has a bloomy rind
  i was just about to make this exact thread what the fuck  brie tastes like pungent death who actually eats this shit
  people who dont have garbage palates defined entirely by tendies and diet coke
  hes never tasted his own cum just to see  fucking queer
  if you want your party to smell like ammonia then go for it
  maybe youve eaten to much brie
  brie only smells like ammonia when its gone bad
  knowing what cum tastes like    feggit
  my personal fav   goddamn grocer hasnt restocked it in two months
  the germans make a delicious version with mushrooms
  your brie went bad brie has an especially strong ammonia flavor when it spoils which is why it tastes like what you said
  nature has set taste for male semen
is this a cheese thread
  male semen
hey i have some cheese like this that i cut and am wondering if itcan just be put back in the fridge with an exposed gooey side        hmmm should i throw mine out it kinda does smell like that and doesnt taste too good      this is informative do you thin ki should throw mine out i just cut a piece off and its not very good it looks fine im thinking if theres any way to salvage any of it
this is me    never mind i just took a deep wiff of the cheese up close and felt like hurling i took another one just to be sure and i almost threw up it doesnt smell that bad but if it has this kind of effect on a person then i think it should be throws out    anyways thank you to the guys who made informative posts
  i had some brie cheese and it tastes like cum   eat better cum
  you will never host the ultimate epicurian decadence sampling different flavors of cum cleansing your palate each time then retiring to dine on human flesh after butchering each specimen in turn eating only a small morsel each
  confusing epicureanism with hedonism  i shiggy diggy
  im going to have to get some of this
  how long do you lot keep your cheese  why dont you put it in the refrigerator 
    based philosophicallyliterate pedant poster
why does my pan always come out looking spotty and weird when i season it in the oven
turn it around if you put it normally in the oven then some oil can pool in the pan and form these disgusting sticky spots
  do you mean flip it upside down
  excess oil season upside down wipe dry after its been 15 minutes in the oven and continue seasoning
i just want to make some eggs why is this pan so complicated
it has aids
  yes isnt it obvious that oil will pool in it if you leave it rightsideup        why is this pan so complicated  its not your ignorance is whats complicated    your pan looks fine go cook with it stop worrying about tiny little details which dont matter
  it was upside down you dumb fuck this pan is shit
they always do that when you season them for the first time dont worry its ready to be used    developing a really good seasoning takes a while which is why its recommended not to wash them with detergent
  eggs  youre going to want to cook other shit in it for a while before trying eggs the seasoning builds up over time as you use it and eggs are one of those things that find their way into any spots that arent seasoned enough do your bacon in it and a steak or two maybe some other proteins probably 4 or 5 meals before trying eggs  also you dont have to reseason after each meal just wipe it down with water and then heat it up to get all the water off the heat from this will add any missed oil to your seasoning and work to build it up
  imagine being an american believing no soaps the way to go
  it was upside down  good     pan is shit  no youre seeing a normal variation in surface finish and are sperging out about it its fine you are worried about nothing stop that just go cook in your pan
  too much oil
  americucks are the ones who panic about germs and shit and disinfect everything
do people unironically use cast iron
  use mine frequently so yes
  i dont see why you wouldnt for certain cooking tasks its by far the best its pretty dumb to try and use it exclusively though different tools for different jobs
  all the fucking time
  yup you used too much oil faggot op scrub it and try again
i have found that if you cook yakisoba using a sauce consisting mainly of ketchup and worchestershire the seasoning will build very fast
  you can keep seasoning every time you use the oven
  put it face down  after the first 10 minutes or so in the oven take it out and wipe it down throw it back into oven and finish seasoning process
  thats not seasoning you dumb fucker thats a dirty pan    why would you choose to use ci for yakisoba anyway
  i do it for the yous
falling for the cast iron meme  rofl just get teflon just werks literally
all my cast iron does this but it performs perfectly well that looks good to me
  sorry i like the tasty maillard i dont really want bubbly watery stewed ribeye
  i have found the absolute best ting for perfecting or brushing up the seasoning is making fried potatoes in it you need high heat for that and it takes a pretty long time and the potatoes also go excellently with the lard that many people like for seasoning
i spent two hours last night seasoning and my eggs are still sticking
  you can get it with teflon ive done it hundreds of times maybe try handling a teflon pan instead of falling for dumb memes  if you are such a brainlet subhuman you cant then still get a teflon pan for eggs you know you can own more than one pan
  season it to where you think its perfect now season it for 4x as long as that and you should be good
  youre dumb and fell for the meme if you think you can do that with cast iron just get a teflon pan
  two hours  nah son the norm used to be to chuck the thing in the fire when it was cleaned and oiled and over hours itd get seasoned put it in your oven immediately after cleaning and oiling it use the oven as normal and assuming its had a few hours roasting itll have a nice hard kinda plasticlike coating on the bottom which is 99 as good as teflon  although yeah for eggs just use a damn nonstick iron is too heavy to properly shape a french omelette anyway  iron is still my preference for most things mind
why do trannies hate teflon so much
  your pan is fine i have one that looks like that too it doesnt hurt anything just cook on it like normal
  holy christ just use a metal spatula your wooden dildo is for your boyfriends anus
  the shiny immaculate pics people show are of the pan just after its cleaned and oiled not seasoned this is how its supposed to look  try it yourself hit it with a metal scourer get it immaculate dry and oil it up then take a pic itll look shiny and new then you heat it for hours and this is the result still one of the greatest pieces of culinary kit mankind has ever known
  after teflon
turn it around those spots are disgusting  oh you turned it around  youre a sperg those spots are normal  the absolute state of /ck/ retards
  cast iron apologists
  this you should try and wipe as much oil out of it as possible
now that the dust has settled what the fuck was his problem
first post
  ronald mcdonald was a fake irish british stooge from the north trying to keep hamburgers from true paddies
he tried to start burglaring turds and people dont go for that shit
why is the current version of hamburglar so soy
  heyyyy i remember the fry guys lmao
mayor mccheese needs to get this shit under control
he just really liked hamburgers
remember when they remade the hamburglar as a sexy daddy type
  if he liked hamburgers he wouldnt steal hamburgers from the worst hamburger restaurant in the world
  nothing will ever be under control again
dont mind me just best ben  jerrys flavor coming through
  excuse you shitlord
wrong
      brand loyalty is idol worship  ben  jerrys is shit too overpriced as well youre paying 300 what you normally should
  but but we won two years ago  tomorrow was supposed to belong to us
  imagine buying such a small container of ice cream
  the stuff is always on sale at my grocery store ive seen it as low as 350 for a pint compared to the other shit they sell its literally the best ice cream you can buy
  its on sale so that means its a bargain  american education gentlemen
  imagine being a fat piece of shit
  qualityquantity always you fat fuck
  non dairy    wtf is wrong with you    also ben  jerrys is shit and arguing over what the best flavor of shit is is stupid
  pls
  imagine actually having the palate and body of a child that you not only like but crave ice cream
  ben  jerrys is shit  then what type of ice cream should i be buying at my local grocery store you little contrarian prick
  you shouldnt be buying ice cream at all unless youre out and active to meet your calorie deficit you fat fuck
  pic related is me i eat papa johns twice a week and three pints of ben and jerrys a day call me fat again you stupid nigger
  never actually had it before is it savory
  fatty
  what the hell is this even supposed to taste like vines and jaguars
  and im vegan btw
  savory  i think its a bit more on the sweet side but getting bigger pieces of pistachio i think theres a bit of saltiness to it its very good though my personal favorite flavor and ive tried tons of em
  youre fat
  yes vines and jaguars exactly
  3 pints a day isnt that like over 3000 calories    do you run marathons every day too
  implying im a poor fag who is worried about spending an extra couple bucks on quality
  i meant a week my bad
  why do you have a shirtless pic of yourself you gay
  vanilla ice cream with chunks of cashew and brazil nut brittle in it  great with a mug of hot black coffee
  bragging about having money to spend on garbage peasant food  when you could be making superior ice cream at home on your own with minimal effort and healthier ingredients  bruh
  no sorry
  ok that makes a lot more sense lol
  well thats pretty fucking gay faggot
  if youre going to be bragging about being able to spend money on food and shitting on poorfags at least post a product that matches your hubris
  ben and jerrys icecream is so overrated and overpriced  haagen daaz connoisseur and even the coles storebrand are way better
gelato    pfffft
  i hate both ice cream and gelato but gelato is superior to ice cream in every way
  your head look tall and weird did you edit it
  i hate both ice cream and gelato  weirdo
  i hate both ice cream and gelato  what is wrong with you probably an asian with a little penis that cant properly digest dairy
  liking sweets  underage and/or fatass detected
  he has a receding hairline and tries to make up for it by having a taller haircut which just makes his head look like a misshapen squash
  im neither of those things   you can enjoy sweets without overindulging you know life doesnt have to always be all or nothing
  one taste is overindulgent for me  always found ice cream and other assorted sweets to be absolutely repulsive
  yeah so like i said weirdo
  4chan
  touche but even for 4chan youre weird
  blocks your path
  fudge pieces  its just hard chocolate  why do all ben and jerrys turd tubs do this
  i would say the majority of 4chan is addicted to sweets and junk food so i am the abnormal healthier one here
  overpriced as well  found poverty bitch
  what do normies think of your aversion to ice cream
  girlish makeup products for men lining the counter  this is why we need ww3 and the draft you daft cunt
  ur just poor lmaooooo what do u mean you dont want to buy a bag of shit for 1000 dollars overpriced lmaooo nope ur just poor lmaoooooo
  the products literally say nu  kek
  girlish  i dont see anything that could qualify as such maybe you should stop thinking the world should be as dirty as you to be good
  they dont care because theyre not massive cunts like you guys
  everyones a cunt mate
  note the word massive
  i am the abnormal healthier one here
i like phish food and smores even though they are very similar
  4chan is full of massive cunts  and yet here you are
  eating ben and jerrys
  ben and jerrys is quality  get a load of this guy
i like phish food or half baked if i really wanna treat myself i get everything but the
only ice cream ill ever buy from a store is h√§agendazs  either vanilla or pic related  havent touched bj since that black lives matter shit they signaled a couple of years ago
  forgot pic
  tpbp thought i would miss it when i started boycotting dont actually miss it
ben and jerries is always disgusting and slimy to me  why the fuck does it look like that when it melts
  ben and jerrys  quality  u wot m8
  poor quality
  i will stop buying bj when another company makes a better chunky monkey
  ive always been hearing some meme that its ben and jerries thats the only real icecream and that most stuff is usually something thats barely cream
  the pistachio ice cream has a taste of something secondary something aromatic or subtly complimentary i want to say saffron but i 100 know it is not saffron or anything similar its fragrant like rose water or something the ingredients dont really reflect anything besides pistachio though so idk
  that person is a shill or liar its not even good for prepackaged ice cream its not anywhere close to the same league as decent parlour or home made ice cream
  yeah its one of my friends that was kind of a brand whore when we were younger  i just told him to fuck off every time because ben and jerries is actually just straight up disgusting most of the time  its like paying 3 times to price just to get sick
  its a testament to the power of marketing/gullibility of people that its as popular as it is
  nah you do sound like a fuckin freak my man
  svyisuu olfomh gppf
    lol what do you care like it effects the taste at all  get over yourself man
  that stuff is pretty good for mass produced shit obviously nothing will be as good as local creamery ice cream
i just make my own ice cream on the weekends if i have time
i wish they still made creme brulee seems like now you cant get a flavor anymore that doesnt have fudge covered something in it strawberry cheesecake and cherry garcia are very good though
  its not about flavor its about not giving money to insane lefty jews
  one would eat tasty icecream because it makes them feel a little bit better for a short period of time why would one ruin that feeling and support a company that promotes rapefugees     i too have stepped over to haagen dasz and other alternatives
((()))
  shitlord  the 2009s called they want their slang back
  guys i think i finally kicked my ice cream addiction by drinking cold almond milk while chewing on dried dates the milk has to pass through the dates so i can taste the cool sweetness wash over my tongue it is heavenly and gives me the same hit as ice cream use to if not better
who was in the wrong here
  fat manlet
  obviously the consumer
who has the hilary clinton flavor  it was her churn
  brand so unhealthy founder cant even eat it anymore after requiring major heart surgery from clogging his arteries  vermont  ben cohen and jerry greenfield  pleb filter dessert food for giganormies
its just vanilla cookie dough for me
  the jimmy fallon flavor is actually pretty fucking good
  fat nigga
  coffee and ice cream
  this best one for me  i regret eating it almost every time but its so fucking good
  bruh   look at this dude
americone dream
  his face for those wondering
  bruh  lookit this dood
  damn lol
  current year  3  ingesting the frozen jew
  i didnt know there was a connection between jews and ben  jerrys is this true
  nobody knows how to make good pistachio ice cream  sweet cream with soggy pistachios in it is boring as fuck pic related gives you delicious pistachio flavor with every bite
  unless someone is worshiping said brand as a god then no it isnt idol worship
  theres absolutely nothing wrong with not liking to indulge in sweets but there isnt anything wrong with indulging in them either of course only if moderation and self control are practiced
  cross of st peter is evil  youre an idiot
  dont you have q posts to jerk off to over on 4chan
  im a jew and i like it every once in a while is that enough of a connection for you
  takes selfies in hotel rooms  my sides
  im a jew  i seriously hope youre not if so fuck off kike your kind dont belong online goys invented the internet and crypto not your parasitic ass
  in an increasingly atheistic society worship takes other forms
  top left gaywad
  this shit is great tho
  go back to pol dude wtf lmao
  real pancakes  how does that turn out  sounds good though
  pretty good i dont know if theyre real pancakes but they have the mouth feel of real pancakes theyre not frozen solid very soft
    sounds really good where can i find this ive never seen this at my local grocery store but then again i havent exactly been looking for it
  dont know how far they distribute tillamook is a famous local oregon brand pretty sure they do the whole west coast but dont know how far east they go
  holy fuck looking at their website is making my dick erect so many intriguing flavors i need to fucking try some of their shit tell them faggots to start selling shit in the midwest please i would purchase this shit over ben and jerrys in an instant
   ben and jerrys  truly op is a faggot
for me its huckleberry cheesecake the best ice cream flavor
  of course this is the first post
  imagine intentionally giving your money to marxist jews
  correct answer
  i only buy one pint a year but for me its phish food
  hes never had affogato  all of italy is laughing at you
  absolutely based
  italy  laughing at anyone  any country that cant build a bridge should shut the fuck up
i love brand  whats your favorite product by brand  nno im not getting paid by brand  everyone who bothered to seriously reply is retarded
this is godlike but i havent seen it in years
nonfat yogurt  flavored whey powder is a great ice cream substitute add some aspartame to sweeten it even more if needed  i make my own yogurt so that its dirt cheap
high effort low rewardfood/fruit/whatever edible
lets cook this son of a bitch then pick it apart for 6 minutes for a thimble full of meat
  part of the reward is picking it apart imo youll never understand the satisfaction of pulling claw meat perfectly intact out of its shell afterward you get to play with the empty claw and its tendon and pretend to be a crab to annoy dinner guests 3
  tiny amount of meat and lots of bones
  all organic foods
  picking crabs is more of an event than a meal sitting at picnic table drinking beer and picking crabs is top tier comfy
  if you really do this nobody you are dining with finds it cute or enjoys it
  jesus how lonely are you my dad would do this type of stuff when we were kids i still do it to fuck with my girlfriend
  that sounds a lot better than  where it ended in 3 its all about how it comes across
  preferring a guy doing it and cussing rather than a cute little girl doing it and making cute faces  jesus how gay are you
  not eating crab gut like a bitch  you bitch
  what is wrong with you lol just play with your crab claw im sorry i got you so riled up
  tfw eating the yellow stuff inside the shell because its yummy  tfw dont know wtf it is
sandwiches    like wtf dude you have to get 10 ingredients out of the fridge and then assemble them all in order and then put everything back in the fridge
  its a bit of a hassle maybe but its not as bad as actually cooking and has high reward if you make a good one
  oranges  low reward
  oranges  low reward  you go fuck yourself now son
i like their taste but eating them is too messy
cum    im gay btw
    messy ass nibbas  dont  me
  an orange is way less effort than cooking
not only does it take a lot of time it wrecks also your tongue
  thats the best fruit though
  orange is high effort high reward
  die in a fire motherfucker
  get the ones you can peel with your hands if youre a lazy sod
id like some macadamias with a side of broken thumbs
  how one added sentence and a 3 can enrage the channel guests
  based
orange shills are in full force today i see
  this you have to cut up veggies and shit and you finish the sandwich in like 1 minute    you also gotta toast the bread and shit  fuck them
  you just suck as youre biting into it or go the extra step and cut it into cubes after you cut it into slices and eat with a fork
pomegranates is high effort high reward   antioxidants  more vit c than oranges  may increase testosterone  decrease blood pressure
  artichoke hearts f u im going to the store
chicken feet  theres way too many bones and shit its so annoying to eat  t gook
  sounds like a wholesome time anon
  so sad seeing froggy die  not worth it
  baste and clawpilled
  oranges are as low effort as apples or onions how the fuck do you complicate eating oranges
  i like that one wish the main character was a girl though
do any of you just eat a kiwi whole instead of pealing it first skinning it just seems to be a waste and the skin isnt bad at all
  orange  high effort  youre peeling it wrong
  i do its a nice surprise when you realize you really can just eat it im not 100 sure but it probably has some decent fiber and micronutrients too
  indeed i was fooled thinking that eating the skin is bad until a friend told me that you can eat them as they are i still cut a small piece off each end though its my favorite fruit now because of it
  it tastes better with the skin
fuck these things and bomb iran
  i feel the same way are we just lazy idk    spread condiment with knife  place piece of meat  wash hands of meat juices  spread more condiment  wash hands of meat juices  spread more condiment    fuck
  whats the source of that comic
  
  uwu
  how is this high effort literally just cut it into four pieces and its perfectly edible
  pineapple is better cooked than raw
  this is true like how you cant stop eating pistachios or how candy that comes in little wrappers is satisfying
  this it always takes me around 15 minutes to deseed it just for a bite of fruit
  wash hands of meat juices  excuse me what
what exotic animals would you like to taste people who have eaten exotic animals what and how was it
  gator is fine its nothing crazy it wont give you a wow ive never had anything like it before feeling
gator is actually not that hard to find even in minnesota
    this it tastes like slightly fishy chicken
  aliens
  mexicans taste like shit thats why i just dump the bodies in the desert
i want to taste prime dinosaurs and mammoths and dont suggest eating frozen dead mammoths or birds which are regarded as modern dinosaurs
i have had jellyfish tasted like snot but wasnt prepared well according to an informed friend cow tongue isnt exotic but underappreciated i live in gods graced land california so ive had a lot of sea urchin abalone eel crabs geoduck  all neat stuff
kangaroo steal emu omlette and even though they are a pest i want to eat locusts   heard they taste like shrimp
dunno if dog counts as exotic but i ate dog in beijing  had deep fried spider in vietnam fucking thing was huge the vendor grabbed one live from a barrel shoved a skewer through it and slunk it straight into the fryer
  did it taste good
  i wouldnt mind trying cat and dog just to see what they taste like
kangaroo though a friend claimed it was shit  bear  racoon
ants you can just pick them off the ground nothing they can do about it
  u sure
  kangaroo is ok nothing special if your friend hates it he probably overcooked it its very very lean
  everything in moderation anon
  what does dog taste like
  bear is really good racoon is meh
want to try bear desu but ive heard its loaded with trichinosis    also keen to taste moose and i wonder what rhinoceros or elephant or giraffe meat is like
foal i wonder how it compares to veal
  theres a market in chinatown in mexico city that sells lion giraffe elephant and monkey meat from some zoo or imported from africa i dont know mostly sell it to tourists
  is there a way to verify its even real they could just be selling regular meat and marketing it as something else happens with seafood all the time
  i think they sell those big ass guinea pigs in mexico too people get busted trying to smuggle those over the border to the usa capybara i think theyre used in weird ass south of the border religious rituals
    almost all reptiles taste like fishy chicken
deer/venison probably not the most exotic thing but still would like to find a place that serves it
  gator is ok best breaded and fried osterich is beef but better so is yak deer and elk kind of taste the same very gamey buffalo is like dry beef slightly gamey warthog tastes like shit gamey to the point of bitter hartebeast is delicious almost as good as ostrich
  alligator  unironically tastes like chicken when fried up in gator nuggets tasty  camel  tastes like very flavorful beef that also has that grassy/mineral flavor of lamb to it  goat  tastes like lamb but more beeflike in texture  venison  lean and gamy in a good way tasty  elk  tasted more like beef than venison to me lean  bison  essentially very very lean beef i find it hard to work with ground bison without cutting it with tallow or lard but it is tasty  boar  i had it as real cured bacon made from a wild boar it was 12/10 tier amazing    things i currently want to try  moose  emu/ostrich
  i had a shark vindaloo once  was incredible    would like to try most animals so long as theyre not spiders octopus or squid
  caviar and ostrich
horse sausage  taste great donkey meat  was in china the spices didnt reveal the real meat taste fried dog in philippines  actually taste really good insects in thailand  just crunchy like over fried french fries spider in cambodia  taste like crab meat at least the legs didnt eat the body
  the first time i had it my father and i bought it at a supermarket thinking it was mutton made a stew out of it realized months later when i was actually able to read chinese that it was dog it had an odd chew to it but other than that not really anything special  i later had dog at the dog king restaurant and it was pretty good got a tasters menu i guess youd call it crispy dog dog soup a braised paw from some breed of large dog with the paw you just sort of peeled the flesh away from the bones      if youre asking about the dog read above  as for the spider it mostly tasted like the coating of spice the vendor sprinkled over it not quite sure what it was but it was good crispy for sure he warned me that the spider still had its fangs and that they might get caught in my throat i just pulled them off with my fingers ate the whole thing kind of reminded me of over cooked squid but not as chewy the abdomen sort of popped when i bit into it but tasted like fryer oil and the spice mixture
  are you in australia and claiming that kangaroos and emus are exotic to your country i am laughing at the idea
  id like to try zebra or antelope id kinda like to try guinea pig too ive heard they eat them in south america thats all i can really think of ive had the opportunity to try a lot of different animals and i found most of them to be novel but forgettable       as the other anon said roo is very lean and easy to over cook ive had it a couple times a few years back i wouldnt go out of my way to try it again but if you happen to come across some try it    every time ive tried bear it was always gross i hear it depends pretty heavily on what the bear had been eating recently but im in no hurry to try it again
  goat is exotic  wut
    i used to work for a company that sold alligator and reindeer meat i always regretted not trying it
i ate dolphin in china oncs
  flyovers think any kind of meat that isnt boneless skinless chicken breast chuck steak and bacon  exotic shitskin memefood designed to make me feel uncultured and demand slavery reparations and ban jesus and santa claus
  gator tastes like chicken as do most reptiles
i want to grill and eat a fucking unicorn
just had one of these for dinner with kraft parmesan and an icy cold can of budweiser real good
how did you envision this thread turning out when you posted it
  what
made from scratch sauce  so this is what tomato paste and salt is called now
  they are good for only a buck
  can confirm they are tasty wish they made bigger servings though
admittedly when im living out of a hotel room banquet spaghetti is pretty damn good i get the mega meal version with extra meatballs 2
  everyone should know that starting a thread in /ck/ will result in insults and abuse just like all of 4chan or 4channel i certainly expect it thats the fun part
  op also ignore this nigger
  these dont taste bad cooked in the oven but the tiny portion size just aint worth it
  the serving size stays the same no matter how much you put on a place    just buy two if youre that hungry
do people really do this  putting black pepper last on a steak
  faggot
  if you put it on first it just turns to ash are you new to this
  yes but it works better with fresh pepper not grounded crap that lost all its taste and flavour before reaching the store
  this nobody likes a light dusting of charcoal on their steak
  yeah unlike salt pepper burns really fast
  i season before and after there are oil soluble compounds in black pepper which will flavor the fat before and during cooking but some of the more volatile compounds are lost when cooked and need to be added back at the end
pics of beans where there shouldnt be beans

  haha epic  heading over to /pol/ to post this right now
  horrible and incorrect post
  being objectively wrong
  this is really just no cheese where there should be cheese and no sliced sausage where there should be sliced sausage    or you think it would be too dry
  this is the correct answer to the question
  thats just way too much beans and they look way too syrupy/watery but thats just my opinion
le hilarious reddit xd    
  its literally a reddit thread made popular from r/casualuk call me a faggot for knowing that but at least i dont post this shit to epic 4chan

    not being overjoyed about beans in the wrong places   me seething     beans where beans shouldnt be is universally well received if you dont like beans where there should be no beans  you dont save every img you see of beans in erroneous places then fuck you nigger kys

  besides can we just admit we all browse reddit and move on the le reddit bantz is getting stale
  jokes on you my mother died last month
  ive never gone to reddit before  ive clicked a link or two and the reply system is retarded  you can keep your shit site
  its not that browsing reddit is the issue its using their style of posting on this site thats annoying its the same for any other website if you go on tumblr saying senpai or thicc and using the 100 emoji people are gonna call you out for being a twitter user but reddit is really faggy and 4chan is really edgy so it always looks more pronounced when you mix the styles
    trying eating shit before you post fag

is it legit advertising or 4channels sense of humour
  why do people that post on an anime image board talk about fast food a lot  ok reddit
ive never even heard of johnny rockets so if it is advertising theyre not doing well
  why is reddit to ask why /ck/ consistently shills for the major fast food chains
  why does a food board talk about some of the most popular food in the country  youre a real einstein
  theres a difference between constantly talking about fast food and literally posting adverts with for me its the big mac
anons eat a lot of fast food because theyre usually young and poor they find it fun to take pics of their order and make threads about it its also fun to pretend to be a shill for reasons not entirely clear if you try it youll probably get a kick out of it
  they find it fun to take pics of their order and make threads about it  why do they do this  why isnt this taken as some kind of sign of horrible mental illness at which point the people doing it are locked way from society in some horrid asylum for the rest of their days
  if taking pics of your food is a sign of mental illness then wed better send all of instagram to the nuthouse lol
  its just shitposters unwittingly advertise /ck/ doesnt have enough traffic to warrant shills /v/ /tv/ and /co/ have shills but i doubt /ck/ does
  i dont see a problem with taking pics of food that has a purpose for example if youre showing someone how to cook or if you have something really special that is worth photographing    but taking pics of fast food whats the point of that its not special its shit why take pictures of shit
  why would anyone advertise wendys delicious never frozen burgers on 4chan
  maybe they do it to try and convince themselves that theyre not eating dreadful swill its easier to choke down a shitty chicken sandwich slathered in mayo if you tell yourself its a masterpiece of modern cuisine notice how these memes are always about shit you can find on the dollar menu its clear theyre eating it out of necessity
  dreadful swill  except it isnt god youre an insufferable faggot
  lmao ok harold
  for me its the mcchicken
     i think its because they are younger people who dont know anything about food or cooking
  its not bad a little expensive for diner style food
  goddamn i fucking love wendys never frozen old fayshioned hamburgers best in the bidness
  friendlys   johnny rockets  havent had those but that pic is missing the new taco bell rolled tacos theyre more or less like a taquito as most people know them but they come with up to three sides choice of avocado/guacamole spicy ranch or our signature favorite nacho cheese head to the border now and stop being poor
  /ck/ has always been a fast food board because no one knows how to cook
  fuck i could go for one of those right now also wanna go to mcds to try that new mushroom swiss chicken always wondered how it would taste on a grilled or fried chicken patty instead of a burger
  you could buy a bag of a dozen taquitos from the grocery store for the same price and fry them yourself and theyd be much better fritos burritos and the 5 layer is where its at
  for me its the naked chicken chalupa fuck why dont they make that a permanent menu item already
  you call it chilllin shillin whatever  its only shillin when they pay yay
  at least half of us are morbidly obese
  i take pictures of a lot of the stuff i make sometimes its worth showing off other times it reminds me of something i need to fix next time either way its kinda fun to flip back through the meals over the years and see how my cooking evolves and improves over time
  or if you have something really special that is worth photographing  if thats not how you feel about your taco bell order then youre probably doing it wrong
  please leave
  its shitposting you dumb cuck
  that thing was gross and also tiny
4chan is nothing but shills and viral marketers how do you not know this already
  i think you mean 4channel friendo
  horrible asylum for the rest of their days  where the fuck do you think you are
  locked way from society in some horrid asylum for the rest of their days  how are you going to pay for that
  is it legit advertising  some yes    the rest comes from idiots that think its cool to be brainless sheep walking off into obesity and diabeetus
  instagram is a sign of mental illness in and of itself as is all (((social media))) thats little more than attention whoring and marketing    its cancer
  4channel is not social media aimed at attention whoring and marketing  anon i
  dont eat fast food there is a good chance it has rat urine on it
  anon i  dont really know what anon means
  is it legit advertising or 4channels sense of humour  why are you this retarded mcdonalds alone serves something like 70 million customers per day maybe the fact massive amounts of people eat fast food all the time has something to do with all the posts about it
  dont be racist
  people
what happened to the jollibee shilling
  some yes  i dont even believe theres occasional fast food shilling here honestly there are social media jobs for fast food chains but im pretty sure they use the kind of social media you can actually bring up and discuss activity on openly in an actual corporate workplace eg twitter and facebook i mean how would that even work with 4chan  anon i notice with your latest viral marketing campaign on 4chan were seeing an incremental uplift of 10 among our gas the kikes race war now demographic lets take the template for those targeted bait thread initiatives we ran last quarter on the traps are gay and enjoy your monday wagies segments and add in some redpills about our competitors being good goy cucks for israel
  theyre the vast majority of our species so they have more right to be considered people than you anti fast food fags do
hardees breakfast food is pretty good so happens that one is right close by my house so those mornings when im rushing around hardees is a life saver
  hardees is a life saver  sounds to me more like its an enabler to your shitty time management skills
  go eat some baked kale
 mfw people seriously think a major demographic for fast food chains is a bunch of autists on 4chan
    i bet you and i could be acquaintances i see the same truths you do but often when i explain this i am the odd duck its disheartening
  back in my day if you didnt have anything worth saying you fucking lurked until you could at least ask worthwhile questions fucking millennials
  massive amounts of people eat fast food all the time has something to do with all the posts about it  that doesnt hold water if that were true youd hear people discussing fast food all the time irl and you dont ive never heard anyone bring up or have a conversation about fastfood irl i mean never the only explanation is shills
  thanks doc
  if that were true youd hear people discussing fast food all the time irl and you dont  real life isnt an internet forum with an explicitly set topic of food you retard also i have a really hard time believing youve never heard anyone bring up or have a conversation about fastfood irl were you homeschooled and then immediately began working at a monastery i cant even count the number of times people have discussed fast food at my office ive heard people complain about popeyes calling boneless wings wings when theyre really just chicken nuggets ive heard people talk about the mcrib being back ive heard people talk about how subway doesnt do 5 footlongs anymore do you live in a third world country or something
  cant even count the number of times people have discussed fast food at my office  i would expect that to be the case when you work at a fastfood shill farm shill
  im a software developer you idiot maybe you should stop going off your schizo meds
  youre not schizophrenic and youre not imagining things either    this board has more shills per capita then any other board ive been to and yeah the mods absolutely get kickbacks for letting these viral marketing teams shill their products here every single day     ever wonder why those al/ck/ threads got banned anbev shills paid off a mod and now they have a nice safe /beer/ gen to shill all their new releases     ever notice those taco bell threads where a guy buys the newest product and does a product review you think that guy is just doing it for yous hes a god damn viral marketer this place is chock full of them     or how about those monster energy drink gens that were constantly babysat i could go on and on but i think you get the point /ck/ is shill city
  because poorfags on neetbux cant afford decent food
  for me its the bk 10pc
  why does a website filled with young male americans have so many posts about the food theyre extremely overrepresented as customers for  its a mystery op    posting adverts with for me its the big mac  you genuinely have autism fyi  also i notice real ads for fast food on other websites yet on 4chan what i see isnt fast food ads but ads for stuff like 21 awkward vacation photos that will make you cringe or get 999 free credits live webcam sex and 4chan advertising is dirt cheap if fast food places wanted to advertise to you so badly theyd pay people to make shill threads why wouldnt they bother also paying the couple of bucks required to have some over the table ads here
it happens on every board its just for fun i hope  
  cnncom   mcdonalds has now begun advertising on the notorious racist web site 4chanorg there are already widespread protests and the mdonalds ceo has stepped down in shame after saying i dont know what the fuck i was thinking
  yes and thats why mcdonalds doesnt pay people to do shill threads here either theres nothing to gain and everything to lose if a single laid off and disgruntled former corporate employee with knowledge of what their marketing department is doing goes to some news outlet about it im sure they do have social media teams but thats for shit you can actually plan around measure performance on and discuss openly in an office without getting in trouble for creating a hostile workplace with exposure to the sort of content thats on 4chan meaning shit like twitter
  tfw theres builtin plausible deniability for advertisements because everyone assumes theyre ironic when in reality literally the only point of an advertisement is to keep a product in the forefront of your memory so it can be readily called upon whenever the need arises organically   wow i love 4channel i cant remember a time when shitposting wasnt overwhelmingly for branded products available near me
  its almost like people cant believe theres anyone willing to sit in front of a computer for 8 hours spamming ads on popular sites for rupees or somethingnah people arent that stupid
is there an easier way of doing this

  its just dice dont embarrass yourself irl
just use one of these
is there a better way to do this
  cut it into really thin slices then smash it
  i doff my fedodo do you good sir
  actually yes  when you get ginger immediately peel it with a spoon and stick it in the freezer  then grate it with a microplane when youre going to use it you can do a big piece of ginger in like a minute if its frozen

vegetables that dont belong in fried rice  carrot  should only be raw and used as garnish like shredded daikon  peas  seriously what the fuck  corn  imagine eating grain with your grain
rice
  eggplant
  are you confusing corn with the egg in pic related
  fried rice  no fries  who names this shit
  thats egg anon
  corn
  peas and shrimps are the biggest offenders ive seen so far   corn is alright but i could live without it
bag of rice bag of frozen veggies few eggs a little bit of oil throw it in a few tupperware boxes side dishes for the weekdone
pineapple
  corn
i use fried rice to get rid of veggies i have laying around it doesnt matter what they are making some right now with shittakes red pepper green onion carrot and napa cabbage
  imagine eating grain with your grain  its healthier to eat a mixture of grains instead of just one
  i peel a carrot then continue using the peeler to make thin strands to help color up my rice when im frying it i scramble one egg per cup of rice shred up any leftover meat i have made turkeyfried rice last week and it was great and give it a quick independent fry while the rice is softening   combine with green pepper if you like or dont corn is not an acceptable ingredient in any respects who even does that
  the whole world disagrees with you
  fpbp
  you know how to live anon throwing mushrooms red onion and zucchini in nmine tonight
new jersey nigga fried rice is good  also ever had an order of spics and niggas  plantains and chickenwings godlike
plain white rice is the best rice
  even better if its uncooked so yum
  it has its place  young chow fried rice is god tier  really good yellow pork fried rice can also be god tier  any brown fried rice immediatly disqualified
  decided to spice it up with a little kimchi and gochujong ended up great cheers
  peas add a delightful sweetness everything i agree with you on
  looks good m8
  carrots  mushroom  spring onions  yellow onions  green peas  corn  green peppers  egg  spam
  cauliflower especially big ass chunks
  egg  spam  excuse you
this shit and prok flied lice do not mix
  nothing is allowed
lima beans
  do egg rolls have any eggs in them
  yes
  egg and spam are vegetables
    never seen cauliflower in fried rice it seems weird to add filler to what is already filler its essentially cheap leftovers to start with i dont know why you would want to dilute it more with flavorless veg with bad texture
  ive not seen this either but i really do hate broccoli stem in my fried rice thats probably my biggest gripe aside from corn which ive also never seen
  ones i get never do they should call them cabbage rolls
  no one asked you motherfucker
  shit taste literally theres nothing wrong with any of those
i used a carrots/peas/corn/green beans frozen vegetable mix when i make fried rice its easy and makes it more nutritionally balanced
  jarrin root
  i dont even do this but i checked your digits statistically significant  yes the frozen shit mix is the reason for some of the really bad fried rices but also understand this is poverty food for s    this guy learns from experience which is a trait i tend to value remember it all comes out your ass in 12 hours
  i forgot to mention onion too
this guy made a milk steak  
  huh
  how much soy does this person consume on a daily basis
does anyone go yellow sticker hunting at supermarkets a few hours before they close to get some reduced foods what are some of your best discounts    for some reason my supermarket always has fresh whole fish that nobody touches so i always get it for a fraction of the original cost
parents go grocery shopping  always pick up shit like a whole loaf of bread or a gallon of milk thats like a week away from expiration because its cheaper  end up with a shit ton of expired food that nobody will throw away because they dont wanna be wasteful
  i only get meat vegetables and baked goods the meat and vegetables can be frozen and the baked goods usually last a good while after their date has passed some boxed/tinned stuff also gets reduced and they keep forever i wouldnt buy milk unless i was going to use it your parents could freeze the bread if its not going to be used it freezes really well just keep half out to use and put the other half in the freezer
  are they poor or just boomer food mentality/habits/misinformation/etc
  its not poor to buy food thats going to be thrown away anyway at a reduced cost aslong as you store it correctly its perfectly good to eat why would you want to pay full price for something when on the day it expires it is heavily reduced if youre not going to use it right away then freeze it food will last after the expiry date most of the time anyway the date is a guide not an absolute
  when im in the uk most of my meat is yellow sticker im not bothered about use by dates as long as it looks and smells ok its typically ok to eat a few days after the date anyway
  be me  live next to 24 hr winco the goat grocer  exclusively shop after 9 pm to avoid normies  only buy meats on sale  when i want my pick of the litter for special events i go after midnight when the stock has been reset by the swing shift
  truly the best shopping experience
  what is your best meat discount how much did you save im planning to go on christmas eve to see if i can find cheap turkeys and other things to stock up on for the beginning of 2019
  not that guy but i got a tomahawk steak from ms one christmas which was down from 25 might have been more to 3 that was a good day got 2 whole salmon for 1 each in asda once as well     worked at sainsburys one christmas and there was always a load of smoked salmon as yellow label they always overstock smoked salmon at christmas and it lasts quite a while
  i scored some chicken thighs for 49 cents per pound the other day im pickier about my holiday birds so i got a fresh raleys brand turkey for 87 cents per pound for thanksgiving where i live raleys has the best value on turkeys because they source them all from the same plants here locally in the central california valley as the pricier brands
  nice find on the steak friend
  i once bought about 12 haggis for 10p each     the cashier made a remark along the lines of someone likes haggis fucking bitch
  what time did you go i hear 1  2 hours is best to get the lowest price but also if you leave it that late others might get in and buy all the good stuff before the last reduction happens
  i wish turkeys were that cheap in the uk
  once i purchased a 15 lb whole brisket for about 30  i barbecued 2/3 of it 1/3 still in my freezer and it made a fuckton of food i r8 7/8
  you should have waited outside for her and gave her a good kicking rub a haggis in her face for good measure who the fuck does she think she is
  time varies but typically your options will be limited if you leave it that late     ive noticed ms start to do yellow labels quite early  normally 3pm asda i normally find good deals around 6pm    it probably varies by individual store though
  yeah they produce the fuck out of em here in the states for holidays california has a pretty large turkey industry too so ive literally never seen them sold out at the grocery store from thanksgiving to christmas and the fresh ones go on fantastic sales because theyll actually spoil turkey and ham can always be had for under a dollar a pound this time of year europe has much more affordable goose duck and foie gras tho a goose here will run you anywhere between 50100
  shops arnt shut for boxing day this year too since its on a week day so there will be less just the christmas eve and christmas day dates theyll be getting rid of think i might go slightly earlier then i can always go again later
  we can get a 5kg / 11lb frozen turkey in aldi for 12 so i suppose its not too bad but from what iv read from people about past christmases is that you can get fresh turkeys reduced down to 250 if you get there at the right time when theyre expiring
  once i had this marked down thick ribeye i was trying to scan at the selfcheckout i swore i heard the beep and bagged it nobody noticed  checked my receipt later saw it wasnt on the list cooked it that night it was in the top 4 i ever made was it only good because i didnt pay for it
  got some nice steaks that cost 20 down to 75p at waitrose once just eyed the guy putting the labels out and waited for him to get to the steaks
  how did you not get the unexpected item in the bagging area when the scales detected extra weight that didnt match whats on the screen
used to go on christmas eve at around 4pm    because they were closed on christmas day and mega amounts of stock if you went there a couple of hours before their early closing theyd have stacks of turkeys joints and packs of meat at 80 off    they dont do that any more they either take it out back for the staff to get cheap or they give it to charities
  my store got rid of those and replaced them with a pair of cameras that are even more annoying
  it was the last thing i added to the raw meat bag its the only walmart i know where it doesnt wait for the red light weight thing to weigh it and change to green its just habit to place it in the bag and put the bag in my cart  but some other walmart locations machines are very finicky and even have audio things that announce everything youre trying to do  im in a white neighborhood
wanted a cheap meat for a curry  waitrose had veal for 50p so veal curry it was    i know it was a waste but
  why was it a waste
  hmm are you sure its not store specific maybe its just certain supermarkets that dont do it anymore or certain locations even if i couldnt get meat i would still like to get some of the bakery stuff like the cookies and cakes and things i mean i dont really care if they give it to charities they probably need it more than me and its christmas after all so if it makes someones holidays better then i suppose its a good thing what pisses me off is when they just throw perfectly edible food into the bin they could reduce it to 001p but instead they would rather throw it away
  you dont waste veal on a curry its a meat that should be enjoyed on its own not drenched in a sauce but for 50p and if youre craving a curry who gives a shit
  ms at christmas is based for reductions i got a bunch of great stuff for 95 off ill usually pop in whenever im nearby at the second reduction time 530pm at weekends but its always a battle with the old women and asians who follow the worker around the store and grab every single thing that gets reduced
  veals kinda mild and flavorless its dressed up in lots of dishes
  twice a year after chrismas/new year and easter my supermarket make big discounts  like 50 on  festive chocolate and candy with a easter bunny or a santa print on it because they know that no one would buy them outside the holiday season and they need to get rid of it asap because they need room to sell other stuff in january  usually after chrismas its bedding tablecloths and towels sales    they also make big discount on fine new year eve food like smoked salmon or foie gras also half the price so its nice
  new years is a good idea they will get getting rid of all of the christmas branded stuff ready for the new stock in the new year lots of party food and things reduced i would imagine
  always go for the sales makes cooking a bit of a challenge   also 99 cent loafs of bread that i can just freeze is better than buying full price
one time i bought some tri tip that was 50 off when late night shopping i was high and didnt really look close enough at the meat the deal just seemed to good to be true so i purchased it with my other regular items i got back to my apartment and opened it up to fry and the meat was black on the inside portion and permeated through much of the cut i just accepted i fucked up and tossed it havent really bought any yellow sticker items sense then
  you threw away perfectly good meat and you dont fry a tri tip son
  is it really good to eat even though the meat was black and i dont have a bbq so how else should i cook tri tip
  your supermarket keeps bread on the shelf when its more than a day old one week is too long for you to get through a gallon of milk
  smell matters more than color red meat naturally goes off color due to oxidation if you arent bbqing tri tip you should roast it
  yeah yeah
  i bought 25 pounds of organic grass feed ground beef for 250 a pound marked down from around 78
  sticker hunting is for grocery cucks the real discounts are in the dumpster out back
  winco is by far the best grocer there one by me in lewisville tx and i go there all the time at like 2am because i work in kitchens and i hate the mexicans with their kids at walmart
  fuck yea on winco late night shopping  cheap prices everywhere  all the employees are restocking most with headphones in  not being asked if i can find everything every ten seconds  hardly anyone else in the store just other late night shoppers with occasionally the odd drunk or stoner looking for snacks at the worst  people working the register at night are super chill  not getting asked to donate to some charity not being hassled for club cards not being offered a credit card  can bag my stuff how i want and at my own pace while making pleasant small talk  would only be better if self checkout was still open for when im feeling antisocial but thats a petty gripe
      winco is the best grocery store cashiers topped out at 47 an hour when i worked there
  but a fresh loaf of bread is already a week away from expiry
  used to work ims at walmart  enter a new item into inventory  name it after my coworker  set it at 99cents  put it on their shirt  call them a cheap whore  i was in the midst of printing out my own prices for booze when i got fired
  winco the goat grocer  not based publix  for shame
  all those green cavendish nanners in a state that should be banana kino  thats a big yikes from me dawg
  what are plantains
not dumpster diving  get cucked stupid anons i just found 50 of fresh sushi that the local market just threw out enjoy your expired milk and brown fruits
  but i wasnt insulting them i was trying to figure out why they would buy more than they know they would/could eat hence the rest of the post after the 1st question mark nothing wrong with poverty just strive for higher and make it out of a tough situation
  at my supermarket they cover all of the food they throw away in blue dye so people cant take it
any yellow sticker meat that has a use by date of a day or two i just portion and put in the freezer and take out a portion to defrost when i want to use it freezing meat keeps for many weeks possibly a month or more so i see no problem doing it this way as it does not affect the time to use by date whilst it is frozen either
what is /ck/s stance on rolling rock
  american piss water
  the best beer out there
  its fine as far as cheap shit goes i get it when i dont feel like drinking yuengling
    i agree with these statements rolling rock is cheap piss water but its also not too bad at all when compared to other brands of american piss water out there i would take a rolling rock over a bud any day
  rolling rock  on  the roll n rocker
  lets be real this is the response op posted this thread for
nice lemoney undertone best bang for buck beer next to hamms
its pretty good gets skunky easy though
best beer if youre trying to be cheap as possible way better than busch or natty
  its a cheap beer that doesnt have that much character it has a slightly off weird taste but its not unpleasantthere are better beers in that same category such as pbr and narragansett
hes gonna take you back the past
  best beer 7/11 near my old place sold both 12 packs and 18 packs for 999 lol i still dont know if it was an error or what

  the only reason i know this beer is because i watched avgn as a kid
  he doesnt know  rolling rock is bud in green bottles anon sorry you had to find out this way
  it gathers no moss
  to play the shitty games that sucked ass
  for me its the beer refreshing hamms from the land of sky blue waters  hamms the beer refreshing
  i wish they still had those commercials there was something subliminal in them because i would immediately get thirsty while watching them even as a kid probably one of the many reasons i became an alcoholic
  its the shit we gave our pledges back when i was in a frat dont remember it being that bad remember it tasting like all other light beer    but i was always a natty/busch guy in college put so much of that shit down that they should have sent me a letter thanking me for my contribution to the company killed atleast a case or 2 a week by myself    also as a guy who has lived in austria and had some great beers there is nothing quite like popping a top after cutting the grass during the summer light beer is for true american chads      flaming homosexual       /thread
all beer is piss water lets remember that theres no such thing as fancy beer
  has a really shitty aftertaste but is fine going down

  ive been making mango sorbet at home and wonder what its like in comparison  hau dew
  yeah its alright homemade is probably fine but if youre a 35 year old cat woman branded will do you just fine
  pretty easy basically puree mangos then strain it through a sieve   mix in sugar salt and lime juice to your preference then throw it in an ice cream maker
  right on sounds simple enough thanks
  why not add some chunks of mango to mix

i guess they really think 6 fries is a reasonable amount to eat
i dont get it
  daily mail
college professors  2018
  but theyre just pieces of potato that have absorbed oil why do they let idiots be professors at harvard
  eating more than 1/10th potato is too much    fuck off
the posts calling out university professors for being complete hacks probably triggered the soy faggot mods
imagine having to eat more than six fries and a burger that is basically a death sentence
  sounds about right french fries are one of the worst things you can order salted deep fried empty carbs are bad enough but then people dunk them in sugary tomato paste
  they also nuked a taco bell thread because op mentioned he like to eat taco bell drunk and we cant have any trace of al/ck/ left    this and theyre lowkey getting triggered by the /sp/ tier janny posting i figure its probably pissed off alckies behind it
  i miss pre2014 4chan that didnt have these beta cuck janitors ruining the site of everything good
6 fries are like 400 calories or something anons professor is right and generally know more than you    my professor told me to stop drinking soda daily and i lost like 30 pounds by switching to this ginseng tea alternative it costs a bit more but eating healthy to lose weight always does
  i dip them in ranch
  soda    i dont understand why people drink thosez and so much of it a 20 ounce serving can be as much as 70 sugar and i see many people down several of them in a day
  6 fries are like 400 calories
  professor is right  top laffs its not the 1980s anymore people can learn things on their own now
  sugar is addictive but they dont tell the public that
  its not the 1980s anymore people can learn things on their own now    education bad  orange soda man good
  so is caffeine do you want to ban coffee and tea now
  who said anything about bans consumer warnings would suffice
  never said i wanted to ban anything what you just did is called a strawman
  back in the 80s we still had schools and universities that educated people now they just fill students heads with ideological bile
  t never been to university  most universities are fine anon people only think all universities are bad because the only ones they hear about are the exceptionally crazy ones my university regularly had controversial conservative figures come to speak and there were few protests
  no one here said anything about banning anything overconsumption of sugar is a big problem and we really should educate people better on it and nutrition in general
stop enjoying things the things you like are now bad  harvard college professor
  i went to a university back in the early 00s major political science honestly quite a few of the nonstem majors were already corrupted by then i was a huge lefty back then and saw the proto version of all this socjuc insanity things have only gotten worse and the shit even coming out from normal universities is absolutely ideological brainwashing
  true its close to not eating any at all which is exactly what theyre trying to express junk food is bad in excess
  yes because a countrys technological development should rely on undereducated tradesmen and executives who only know how to make money without scientists we wouldnt even be able to maintain our current standard of life let alone keep up in the 21st century
  is that what he said i suspect youre still in high school
  hurrr just google it    and guess who wrote all those scientific peerreviewed papers quoted in all the shiny articles you read scientists do you really think knowledge just appears without anyone working to find it
  based brother dean
  as opposed to a gated cabal of kikes that only exist to self propagate and drain as much money out of a country am i right remember the climate change goy 10 oudda 10 kike scientist agree its true give more funding
  its what he implied if no ones pursuing higher education then tradesmen and hucksters are exactly what youre going to get if you think the era of nostrums snakeoil and lobotomies were the good old days by all means skip college and swallow it all up what you dont know about cant hurt you right
  sure because i would obviously pinch pennies in the government or green startups to make money and not the incredibly wealthy and influential fossilfuel industry theres nothing more vulgar than judging a researcher by the size of his wallet
  and now were in the era of degeneracy advocacy and peer reviewed fake science the exact same shit that comes from academia
  those uneducated tradesmen are the people who help the country function with real world skills if there is one tragedy that has happened over the last few decades it is the loss of respect for plumbers electricians and sanitation workers scientists are great but the mass majority of people who claim paychecks producing papers are not doing anything to help society in a real sense i want us to get to mars as much as anybody but most universities are not just doing nothing to help that but hindering it
  dont try to change the subject your rants of degeneracy have nothing to do with the hard sciences of biology and chemistry take up your complaints with the social and gender studies bunch and their petty politics stem has no time for that kind of bullcrap when peoples lives depend on their results and especially not conflictsofinterest how does it feel to know that the people arguing about biased liberal science are the very same folks whore bribing scientists to publish dishonest research about climate change
  thats an understandable problem but you solve that by promoting trades as a viable career path for people who dont want to go into highereducation not by trampling the value of hardearned scientific knowledge its more precious than you can imagine because all practice depends on it
  no what he implied is that a professor in 2018 does not project the same intellectual rigeur of professors from earlier dates what he probably implied within this implication is that theyre all just parroting prescribed certain prescribed views but i wont go so far as to speak for him to that extent
  nobody is shitting on those hard earned scientific knowledge that is great but the chorus that everyone should go to college has created a swamp of people who shouldnt be there that is why there is a rise of vanity degrees all the while vocational disciplines have been downplayed or outright mocked     there are real scientists and engineers to help but more and more over the last decade universities are catering to vanity degrees than anything useful to society
  yes but most professors are liberal and liberals make me mad so i hate them
  i go to a fairly liberal college in a very liberal city and its pretty normal most my classes were politically neutral besides the occasional trump said a bad word on tv lmao even the women in history class and latin american and us relations class run by a castro fanboy werent even bad but this is post election 4chan so they think universities want to lynch you for being conservative or some shit now
i find it funny that the pussy homo mods banned the original thread only to get a bigger second thread thread that actually talks about interesting things
  mods mods mods pleaseeeeeee
  here is the article that the daily mail is citing  consider for instance that a large serving of mcdonalds fries is 510 calories nearly the same as a big mac 540 calories she said the agriculture department lists a serving of fries as three ounces which amounts to 12 to 15 individual potato sticks or about 140 calories  there arent a lot of people who are sending back threequarters of an order of french fries dr rimm said i think it would be nice if your meal came with a side salad and six french fries  i get where theyre coming from
  college professors  now libturds want to dictate what vegetables i eat too
imagine eating more than six fries and thinking that isnt enough

chef creates the healthiest meal ever and look how pleased he is with himself    its a chicken curry with rice hooray    for the curry    20g coriander chopped  200g fresh or frozen blueberries  2 tbsp freshly grated ginger  3/4 tsp salt or to taste  500g lowfat greek yoghurt  4 cloves of garlic finely chopped   3 tbsp olive oil  1 tsp turmeric  2 tbsp ground cinnamon  1tsp chilli powder  500g of chicken breast cut into bitesized chunks  1 tsp garam masala    for the pilau rice    2 tsp cumin seeds  2 tbsp olive oil  1 small onion sliced  1 tsp turmeric  1 grated carrot  1 cup basmati rice  1/2 tsp salt or to taste  50g goji berries  handful of peas

i own 3  because  im american
gimme the low down on these pans /ck/
  the cock is more like it nyeh heh heh
  its a pan with a newer type of nonstick coating thats supposed to let food brown better but still be nonstick whether its any better than traditional nonstick in terms of not sticking is hard to say but the coating is supposed to be harder to chip off and less toxic if you accidentally eat bits of the chipped off pieces
because i got an old revere ware one that works just fine
    ive used one got a set for christmas  theyre teflon free but i dont know what they use in its place so maybe its just as bad  theyre not fucking magic if you do something like miss a spot buttering or oiling it and let shit fry directly to the pan its still going to stick obviously  when used properly it definitely performs better than normal teflon pans stuff browns better and shit just slides out of it eggs left me with a completely clean pan sans oil of course  the caveat is that it is probably actually more susceptible to wear and tear mine are still in perfect condition but thats because i dont use metal utensils when cooking with it and the fact it warns not to probably indicates its easier to rip the coating with sharp instruments like metal spatulas    theyre marginally better than normal nonstick pans and at least in my area cost the exact same but not worth it if you cant get past their flaw of needing nonmetal utensils i assume
  i have a no name three ply and its great i wouldnt trade it for anything
  i see this shit in asian cooking videos all the time they fry in em and scrape em with metal utensils why arent they more common in the us
  theyre slowly taking over in canada theyve got some really fucking aesthetic eggshell white ones but i have no idea what the state of them is in the states    do the asians ruin them scraping them with metal utensils
  theyre slowly taking over in canada  fucking pans theyre even worse than immigrants
      i see this shit in asian cooking videos  popular in canada  theyre popular in canada because canada is fucking chinese
  because nearly every other tri clad pan brand is either cheaper with similar performance or way fucking better for just a bit more    if i want top of the line demeyere budget option cuisinart usa pan makes a set at a great price that is easily equivalent to ac and theres a ton of options in between honestly allclad is for basic bitch plebs
  because i bought some 11 dollar carbon steel one at the restaurant supply store that was made in spain and it will be good until im dead
  never understood why people tolerate those awful handles
i have an american clad 7 ply above 3 ply seems to be overkill but the 316ti exterior piqued my interest over the 18/10 of the all clad
     here that was the second reason the american clad was a lot more comfortable to grip vs the all clad
so far i only found use for this making pumpkin soup is this thing overrated
so far i only found use for this making pumpkin soup is this thing overrated
  i think so    yes theyre convenient but they kind of fail compared to a proper blender a proper blender may be more work but it can do many things that a stick blender cannot do like crush ice and produce extremely fine purees    i consider a blendtec vitamix or smilar to be one of the most important and commonly used tools for any halfway serious cook
  if you get one with multiple attachments theyre a lot more useful for small batch ie forever alone cooking especially if you have limited counter space but the basic 25 ones are really only good for pureeing soups
  i got one of those i use the chopping attachment all the time far more than the blender  i just wish it had more uses its so much easier to clean than a proper blender could probably make mayonnaise with it too i guess
  i like making pancake/crepe batter with it  a normal blender would work too
ganache emulsified sauces coarse textured blended soups
garlic soup broccoli soup leek soup mushroom soup any kind of blended soup really
    i see i should to up my soup game never really been that much into soups so far but i want to use my blender
  i consider a blendtec vitamix or smilar to be one of the most important and commonly used tools for any halfway serious cook  eh they arent the best tools of refinement you wont get as good of results than using a tamis/chinois/foodmill combo
  its so much easier to clean than a proper blender  i cant think of anything easier to clean than a vitamix or blendtec jar      granted a tamis produces a better texture youd be dumb not to use the blender before that not to mention the blender has far more uses than a tamis does my point about the blender being important is because of it sheer range of uses
  i cant think of anything easier to clean than a vitamix or blendtec jar    an immersion blender for one
  youd be dumb not to use the blender before that  its not necessary plus youd have to add water to use a blender since cavitation
  how so    a 1peice immersion blender is more difficult to clean because you have to be careful not to get water inside the motor    the 2pc immersion blenders can be taken apart to make them easier to clean than the 1pc ones but the bottom part with the blender head on it is usually only waterproof from one side thus you have to be careful not to get water inside    the vitamix or blendtec jars are sealed and contain no electronics they are no harder to wash than a mug easy to do by hand or just chuck em in the dishwasher nothing to take apart nothing you have to be careful not to get wet
emulsions and whipping if you dont do soups desserts salads or french white sauces you wont get much use out of one if you do you might end up having to wash the tip four times in one night to not contaminate the vinaigrette for the salad with the aioli for the fish course with the bernaise for the beef with the whipped cream for dessert
  how ot clean immersion blender for dumb anons  stick blendy end into warm soupy water  hit go button on and off 3xs
  take blender  stick head in soap water  turn on for 3 seconds  rinse
  anon you literally just blend some dishwater with it
  but the bottom part with the blender head on it is usually only waterproof from one side  dont know about usually but i know this isnt true for mine tefal quickchef not really an expensive one either
  i have one with all sorts of attachments but i make a lot of soups and stews so its a given i need it     but its also excellent for making salad dressings and quick smoothies     tools are made for a reason so make sure before you buy one you have a purpose for it not just to have it for one or two things
      1 you only cleaned part of it you sloppy fucks  2 how is that any easier than blending soapy water in a blender jar
  2 how is that any easier than blending soapy water in a blender jar  that only cleans part of it you sloppy fuck
  do you wash the base of your blender
  that was my point see
  before you buy one you have a purpose for it  sounds like proper advice though sometimes its really hard to pass on a deal  a nice looking gadget
  it cant read   youre only washing part of your vitablendtec blender you dumb fuck
  yup    emulsified sauces  eg mayonnaise which is super easy to make    coarse textured blended soups  its easier to just blend in the pot than transfer to a blender and then pour back in
  its easier to just blend in the pot than transfer to a blender and then pour back in    not to mention its far better if you are doing a large batch that wont fit in your blender in 1 go
  i believe i already found a nice blender project in my mail today  
  youre only washing part of your vitablendtec blender you dumb fuck  sorry i didnt realize i was talking to an actual retard ill spoonfeed you sweetie    my point was that the durr just stick it soap water and run it shills are making two mistakes  1 theyre not doing a thorough job cleaning  and  2 the same halfassed method can be applied to a normal blender as well which means an immersion blender has no advantage even if we were to halfass cleaning    i advocate thorroughly cleaning any blender this process is easier for a countertop blender than it is for most immersion blenders for the reasons explained in     i am not advocating halfassed blender cleaning of any sort
  i am not advocating halfassed blender cleaning of any sort  the bottom of your blender isnt being cleaned dumbass thus it is half assed
  this process is easier for a countertop blender than it is for most immersion blenders  not him but that is just straight up bullshit
  i dont wash the base unless something gets spilled on it i do wash everything that my hands touched while i was cooking that includes the grip on my immersion blender
  the bottom of your blender isnt being cleaned dumbass thus it is half assed  theres usually no need to clean that anon thats the point of a proper blender the dirty parts separate from the hardtoclean parts      what makes you say that    stick jar in dishwasher  wipe down keypad    vs     blender  wash attachment while being careful not to get water in the wrong end  wash motor while being careful not to get water inside
  theres usually no need to clean that anon  just like the top part of an immersion blender
  just wash your hands and you dont need to wash everythign you touch if its still too dirty then you sound like some kind of germaphobe and should probably wear disposable gloves anyways    also you should be washing the buttons on your blender and you probably grip the base while attaching the top so its still more work than an immersion blender
  you grip the top part of an immersion blender therefore it needs to be washed      i do wash my hands often  youd still be an idiot not to wash the things you touch  germaphobe far from it     the buttons on your blender  well a proper blender like a blendtec is designed for that it has a smooth keypad with no gaps that can retain food or bacteria it is easily wiped down     the base while attaching the top  a pro model blender is designed that you dont have to do that the jar just lifts on and off you dont have to touch the base except for the on button     its still more work than an immersion blender  nah youre talking about things youve never used youre right that a lot of blenders are a hassle to clean though the ones where you have to take the jar apart are a huge pain in the ass theres a reason i was careful to specify commercial models like vitamix or blendtec it turns out that professional equipment made for busy bars and restaurants is quite well designed
  alright if youre actually going to stick to that nonsense be my guest this is too absurd to argue over
  i only use mine once every couple of months which is why i have a cheap 10 one from walmart
  wash attachment while being careful not to get water in the wrong end  what kind of cheap piece of shit immersion blender are you buying that you cant clean both ends with water
butternut squash and chilli soup
  i use mine for protein shakes batters soups sauces beans fruit waters salsas and fresh fruit spreads its easier to clean than a blender too     tools are only as useful as the people that possess them
  tfw my 30000 ton cuisinart blender from the 80s has lasted literally my whole life  pft
  my moms black and decker toaster from 1986 died this year rip
  it cant be the cheap pieces of shit my 20 kitchenaid is fine with it    maybe garbage from that middle ground of cheapest model of a name brand so youre literally buying only packaging not even an aliexpresstier product
  literally none theyre immersion blenders theyre designed to be immersed in liquid even the cheapo ones
    this is what im saying ive never owned an immersion blender that you could wash both ends of the removable stick or even the inside of the handle piece   these fools must be buying their tools from cheap chinese websites
  couldnt
  no i mean even cheap china shit is fine with it the only possible thing that wouldnt be would have to deliberately be made to break if you did to encourage sales of a more expensive model
  with what  wrote black bean soup soup too blend half and keep half whole for a really good mix dont forget the epazote
make mayonnaise
    use it on taco meat game changer
  yeah i was about to post this the videos of retards using blenders and slowing adding the oil are well retarded just crack an egg in the bottom of a mason jar add your vinegar and salt/mustard powder or whatever and then just pour all of the oil on top start the blending at the bottom and slowly pull the stick up to incorporate the oil gradually but i mean if people want to dirty up their blender and autistically slowpour the oil into it i wont stop them
  what kind of cheap piece of shit immersion blender are you buying that you cant clean both ends with water    most of them read your manual the only moisture seal is in the bottom next to the blade itself the other part where it connects to the motor unit is usually not sealed    ive owned braun kitchenaid and some kind of walmart cheapo over the years and all of them eventually failed due to this problem
  fpbp  too bad the thread didnt end there
  dunno about the burger brands but i just checked braun multiquick 7 and it shows the lower part as dishwasher safe the same for my tefal quickchef
  sounds like yours are dishwasher safe then not all of them are    maybe its a time thing that manufacturers have sorted this problem out my experience with them is about 10 years old at this point
  10 years   yeah theyre pretty much all dishwasher safe now except the very cheapest ones
my favvvourite sound
  i fucking love champagne i look for any excuse to drink the stuff i buy the cheap as hell bottles too i love it just the same

which of these cereals is the healthiest
  why are you so obsessed with your health wow you get to live for like a year longer cool
  its not just about living longer its about having a better quality of life
  and you think choosing between 3 barely marginally dissimilar cereals is going to somehow have any noticeable difference on your quality of life
  157g sugar no thanks fat ass
  i am like you op trying to crunch the health number game it truly is about feeling the best you can i would go for the middle one i find it hard to believe there isnt any sugar which is usually what i check first but that has the lowest sugar and sodium but pretty good protein and fiber but you need to incorporate other things breakfast alone wont cure all that ails you
  its only 1 tablespoon in 35oz of cereal    it has sugar as an ingredient so i think the zero added sugar is just a limitation of the nutritional information/labeling
  whoops i was looking at added sugar i would go for whatever has the lowest sugar
  a gram of sugar is way too much let alone 157
  if the aim is really to go health conscious you should consider not eating a processed cereal i personally enjoy steel cut oats with fruit natural sugars you can moderate much better than processed foods
  prolly the 1 in the mid
  depends what you are looking for ezekiel provides more protein than the other 2 the middle has the most potassium but the middle has sugar     healthiest id say ezekiel simply because it provides nothing but organic grains in the ingredients and salt
  i would get the ezekiel one if it was 3 times more expensive than every other brand
  far left fewest calories and a lot of fiber the protein in wheat and other grains has a dog shit amino acid profile and should be ignored have an egg or two on the side
ezekiel 49 cereal is the healthiest by far    fiber one is inedible  all bran is packed with sugar and fat
your better off buying a 5 pound bag of flour than ezekiel cereal theyre basically the same thing but the cereal is much more expensive
  amino acid profile  egg on the left all bran on the right both normalized to 2002kcal 28 large eggs 770g cereal    the cereal doesnt seem too terrible although the egg is obviously better
  kelloggs allbran original  lowest amount of sodium  lowerend amount of calories  significant amount of protein   great source of potassium   appropriate amount of sugar and good amount of fiber   good amount of unsaturated fat   it overall has the greatest benefits compared to the others if i had to choose id choose kelloggs allbran original to include in a post workout meal
  sauce
  dont hire this person as your personal trainer
  depends on the composition of the rest of your diet and your own personal levels of health fitness activity and a dozen other things that make it difficult to say off hand    whats your tdee and current macros fig if you cant awnser those questions then i cant even pretend to awnser yours
  cereal isnt healthy its from a bygone time when manual labor was more prevalent and you would burn off a 500 calorie breakfast before noon the big breakfast meme is outdated look at those cereals upwards of 300 cals and thats before the milk and whatever else youre gonna have on the side
  tell me with big boy words why its the worst cereal of the three anon
  muh calories   weak cuck
  467g fiber per 100g  sounds interesting
  heres why the egg is better the lowest egg number is 356 of what you need highest is 662 so a bit less than twice as much of the most abundant of the essential acids compared to least abundant the lowest cereal is 81 compared to 390 so one acid is about 5x as abundant relative to the least abundant your body needs the essential acids in the right proportion for protein synthesis because it cant produce those particular acids on its own so the least abundant essential amino acid acts as a bottleneck on the protein you can actually utilize unsurprisingly meats have them in almost perfect  so a gram of meat protein is a gram of usable protein
  cronometer/nccdb    obviously getting all your protein from the cereal would be silly my point is that its not a terrible amount for part of one meal
  some people eat cereal everyday what are these mental gymnastics youre going through
what does /ck/ think of vienna sausages
  i think i was 5 or 6 years old the last time i ate those
theyre a staple in nordic countries
  honestly i like them but dont buy them on purpose
  i feed these to my dog instead of dog food
  based
  shit
i love em i grew up super poor so these were a staple i still enjoy a can of these every once in a while great for camping too     ever hear of a puerto rican dish called salchicha con gandules the best way to eat them
i grew up poor soo i occasionally get a craving for mashed up vienna sausage with mayo and hot sauce on white bread
  puerto rican food    my hombre
i ate them as a kid and remember enjoying them and wanting to vomit at the same time
  my kids love it true story if my 4 year old son would eat regular food i would be happy until then he can have as many baby hot dogs as he wants
  what hole did you crawl out of it youre on the wrong website pal
  ive never had them are they good they seem like they would be good in a survival situation
i was broke growing up so i still enjoy them with saltines and hot sauce
  the closest i can describe the taste to them is spam if youve had it and in russia and other countries have a potted meat called pashtet or pate but in tube form they are good for survival as they are high in sodium and protein so if youre on fumes its a good quick pick up
they are great and dirt cheap you can have them different ways or just outta the can
  were not all wizards like you
grew up eating them and deenz on fishing trips still pack them to go fishing and will occasionally bust out a can with some crackers at home recently had the bourbon bbq flavor and was not a fan too sweet might have to grab a can this weekend
  eat regular food  hell on earth detected fuck the midwest
the maillard reaction is a chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars that gives browned food its distinctive flavor seared steaks panfried dumplings cookies and other kinds of biscuits breads toasted marshmallows as well as many other foods undergo this reaction it is named after french chemist louiscamille maillard who first described it in 1912 while attempting to reproduce biological protein synthesis
eating meat is gay
  then gay we be
who here drinks raw milk not so easy to get in the us so im wondering if its worth the trouble ive recently switched from regular pasteurized/homogenized milk from big brands probably factory farms with cows on shitty diets to grass fed nonhomogenized but still pasteurized milk and its definitely a big step up
  raw milk is fucking awesome i live 20 minutes from a farm that sells it in glass bottles and it tastes so fucking creamy and tasty
what the fuck is raw milk
  exactly what it says on the tin
    former subsistence dairy farmer here drank exclusively raw milk when i ran my dairy given that we werent selling it there was no real reason to opt for pasteurization    that being said i think pasteurization isnt as big a factor in taste as people may think id opt for a pasteurized milk from a reputable small farm with good practices and good cows over anything else really unless the folks milking are being very very thorough with every single cow and maintaining equipment in perfect condition theres going to be some poop in that milk so its good to give it a little heat
  its an american finds out at age 25 that normal milk is highly processed garbage episode
  it tastes so fucking creamy and tasty  just like the semen you ingest faggot
    its a eurocuck drinks his milk out of a bag episode
  its good but raw goats milk is better imo if you can get jersey milk then that stuff is godtier
  this guy is right ive lived in the midwest my whole life and had access to some pretty good local dairy the cows their diet and their breed are really what matters just get it pasteurized it doesnt matter if you truly must have milk then go for pic related     jersey milk is fucking amazing
i would but its illegal in australia fucking nanny state
why is he so autistic about frozen ingredients it literally doesnt make a difference
  the difference between frying a frozen corndog and making one with fresh batter is huge
  because he comes from fine dining and doesnt understand the realities of the economics of running your average restaurant
  why do people have an issue with snap frozen vegetables there are some vegetables that need to be fresh sure but for the average person at home frozen vegetables last way longer and also retain more of the nutrients because theyre snap frozen almost immediately after picking
  this is what people who dont at michelin starred restaurants actually believe
  dont what
  because freezing food the moment it stops being frozen rapidly declines in quality
  his most famous restaurant is a shitty burger joint
  im pretty sure he says he uses frozen peas too
  it depends on the show hes talking about  kitchen nightmares  frozen bad  master chef  frozen okay
  sure for the average person at home the average person at home isnt a restaurant thats charging people money to eat their food freezing most ingredients decidedly reduces their quality with a few exceptions if youre expecting people to pay for your food it needs to be good quality both to compete with other restaurants and from an ethical standpoint      again  professional restaurant  frozen bad  home cooks  frozen ok
  half the time they lie to him about it being fresh then he looks in the freezer like fucking always and uuuh yes its frozen chef    he cringes at frozen ingredients because his usual strategy is a tiny menu of high quality universally liked food you can afford to buy fresh ingredients if your menu is 10 or 15 items and half of your entrees use the same stuff    but when they lie to him he gets pissed
i always thought his issue was with frozen meals/items    is the calamari fresh  yes gordon cooked yesterday and freshly frozen    but i would guess he also has an issue with poorly run kitchens that buy huge amounts of meat and then freeze it for weeks and months to the point it loses its quality
  what i dont understand is why they lie do they honestly think he wont be able to tell and they stick to the lie for as long as possible im sure sometimes its played up for drama but other times im positive the restauranteurs wouldnt be that adept at acting to make it look like theyre lying just to be caught out later
    the servers lie because thats what the head chef/manager has told them to say on top of that they are the ones earning a pittance while having to lie to customers and take all of the complaints    i definitely see the appeal of dropping the head chef in the shit knowing ramsay is about to go back there and tear him a new arsehole
  the servers lie because thats what the head chef/manager has told them to say  i dont think ive ever seen a server lie its always the owner when ive seen it
  
  is this bait his team was still making the food but the restaurant was too small to actually accommodate the cooking they prepared it nearby and drove it over every day in refrigerated vans the issue is when people are buying sysco garbage or something not when the kitchen is a little further away than normal
    ive seen the servers lie theyll also sometimes form a little bond with gordon and admit theyre forced to lie once he calls them out on it maybe this only happens in the uk version though
  tldr he richfag they poorfag
he doesnt like frozen food in restaurants because the food is being upcharged with little to no work  done often while being dishonest to customers imagine paying 15 for a serving of shitty frozen ravioli you could have made at home for 3
  doesnt make a difference    read some food science or modernist cuisine it can majorly degrade food quality especially if its just chucked in the freezer and not suitably cryfrozen      maybe its a murrica thing but most restaurants over here will charge 20 equivalent for a main and not use frozen vegetablea the issue in murrica land is the deprioritisation of food quality over quantity and inexpense
  just realised how much this guy tries to emulate marco pierre white
  lol just the fact thati have to read a food science article to prove your point just indicates that the issue is nonexistent there is no difference you moron
  do you go to a restaurant to eat food you can make at home or something better    if you want to eat shit why spend 100 to be served trash ingredients stay home
  it does make a difference but in some cases frozen is better    during freezing water turns into crystals which have a larger volume than liquid water did this tears down cell membranes frozen fish will be a lot less firm than fresh fish in some cases this is exactly what you want  for example calamari is never used fresh where im from its always frozen first because if you use it fresh it will be rubbery
  just because i have to read a physics article to understand that gps needs relativistic corrections to provide correct position means that its not really necessary and the issue is nonexistant    if you want to understand why something is good or bad and distinguish between methods of freezing that dont damage food and those that do you need to understand what freezing does to the structure of food this is a matter of science    but frankly if youre paying no attention to modernism in food and the scientific approach therein youre a foodlet and can return to takeaways and murrica junk food
because it is a tv and him spazzing out is what makes him money
  this is such common practice why cant people just do a little research before complaining about fucking anything
  he worked for mpw
    is this bait his team was still making the food but the restaurant was too small to actually accommodate the cooking they prepared it nearby and drove it over every day in refrigerated vans the issue is when people are buying sysco garbage or something not when the kitchen is a little further away than normal  it isnt so black and white like that it was the equivalent of individual microwaved frozen dinners and for that experience you dont claim you are otherwise dining 4 star at 4 star prices with adequate chefs making food seconds away from you to order youre not youre increasing a profit margin through deception
  dont into dont even something like that
  yeah i know but it is more than that even the way he has his hair is like marco the way he talks everything
frozen vegetables are always nice i think he probably uses frozen peas once in a while
  depends on what youre using the vegetables for tho i agree frozen peas are just fine by themselves
its worth mentioning that a lot of the restaurants he visited had a high amount of frozen food being claimed fresh additionally most of the employees freezing the stuff did it improperly so the food was always freezer burned and not fit to be served anyway i even remember knew scene where some frozen meatballs had actually gone moldy somehow its not just the frozen food its the incompetence that went along with it
  if it happens in the uk version it probably happens in the us version too just with more fake drama sound effects and dramatic background music
  thats racist as hell
  male a salad with frozen iceberg lettuce and get back to us
  burgah  ftfy
  based flyover
  dont forget to grill it too
  screw you for including the word lettuce so i couldnt make that one really obvious joke
  you try paying for all kinds of drug habits and three kids being in charge of cooking frozen food is the only thing most chefs can do due to damaged nerves and brains they take great pride in it too
  someone whos eaten frozen food their whole life wonders why fresh food is superior  thats like asking why are brand new shoes better when my old shoes with a hole in them cover my feet just fine its a difference of quality you retarded idiot
  food that is precooked in a restaurant and frozen usually isnt frozen correctly proper freezing of food requires temperatures that arent available in a restaurant setting
  ive watched a lot of kn and he doesnt always ask if the food was frozen but when he says it tastes frozen he always ends up being right if the niggers didnt lie about it every time i dont think hed make as big a deal about it
  theyre more nutritious and flavorful than non frozen ones so naturally anyone would same with lots of other frozen vegetables and fruits only exception is if you grow them out back in your garden and pick them fresh
he always has to change their fucking signs too sometimes they actually end up looking worse
  no snap frozen peas retain all the nutrition they had on the day they were frozen fresh peas continue to degrade on the way to the store in the store in your home all the way up to the moment you get around to cooking and eating them
  your normal restaurant goer 99 of the people cant tell the difference between a soup made with flash frozen veggies or nonfrozen ones regardless restaurant type
  frankly most of our customers cant tell the difference between watereddown pizza sauce and soup made from fresh handsieved tomatoes
  they lie because thats what the producers told them to do it would be a less popular show if the staff were completely transparent about the problems and gordon fixed everything instantly reality tv isnt reality at all its all fake do you think masterchef is real too
    i disagree you have to put yourself in their shoes the restaurant is failing likely the customers are complaining egos clashing theyre trying to maintain a high standard and good reputation its understandable the servers would be instructed to tell customers that all the food is fresh    in walks gordon finally the servers who have had to deal with all the shit get to drop people in it
  we just have very refined attention spans is all
    just shows how much he looks up to him even if its subconscious on his part
    what did he mean by this
  did you just agree with me but said you didnt agree thats a new one
  lard has completely replaced this americans brain   jesus please get nuked
i just love when a nigga bring his whole crew its just a bigger piece of cake for me to chew a hole through
  i think its less about it being frozen and more about how long its been frozen nearly all the restaurants he goes to help on his shows use frozen food thats been there for weeks or months and then they also lie about it being fresh or only recently frozen nobody would be okay going to a restaurant and finding out that what they ordered was some old ass shit thats been sitting in the freezer longer than the average time between automobile oil changes
  those numbers  checked    do tell though what is the difference i like making tomato soup from scratch a lot but often it tastes like thin pasta/pizza sauce

  if you look at maslow hierarchy of needs food stability is very low on the list and its satisfied for even the poorest in first world countries thanks to social nets    the desire to be self sufficient is obviously seeking to fill the self actualization need which is at the top of the pyramid   if you cant understand the appeal then you are probably on one of the lower levels     perhaps when you find love or a sense of community you can evolve to this stage
  clean and gut a deer  kill and clean a chicken  yes to all but you obviously cant you larper since the term clean does not describe the process the term for removing the guts of a deer is field dressing and theres another entire process described by butchering involving skinning and dismembering into primals a chicken is not cleaned either it is dressed now make sure you quadruple lock your 250 sqft apartment door while youre at home
  no but i could never kill anything also worms even dead ones are too gross to touch to even consider trying to hold steady while trying to hook it id hook myself on accident three times and give up again  now gardening thats for girls and foreigners ive grown habanero peppers before and i never will again its too fucking hot to be outside in florida
yes  no  yes  yes  no
  isnt that undressing a rabbit
  not op but seriously dishing on him because he didnt use the correct vernacular gayass snob
  talk your words good you sound dumb if you dont
  i know you learned woodcraft from youtube or some online forum because you snob out on shit like terminology vs chad family wisdom where youre trained by you grandad who was trained by his grandad who didnt know and didnt care about that shit
  this absolutely blew that lad out
  im not op but ive done everything on that list at one point helping family out hope thats based and redpilled enough for you but seriously not using the correct terminology in any field really makes you look like you dont know what youre talking about
  thats a little lewd anon someone post cream cheese bacon bunny

hey /ck/ /tg/ here last week i saw a thread about medieval cooking and cookbooks but it didnt get very far can you give me a list of books and research on what cookery was like during the tudor/medieval times how was the kitchen laid out larders what were the feasts and how many guest and manners of the times
  youre better off asking /lit/ in the hopes that some nerd interested in this niche topic is hanging around we only talk about fast food and ecelebs here
  go to a renfair and ask those whackos im sure at least one person will have an encyclopedic knowledge about it
  forme of cury is the only resource i know of even has a couple dolphin recipes if i remember correctly
  take clene whete and bete it small in a morter and fanne out clene the doust √æenne waisthe it clene and boile it tyl it be tendre and broun √æanne take the secunde mylk of almaundes  do √æerto boile hem togidur til it be stondyng and take √æe first mylke  alye it up wi√æ a penne take up the porpays out of the furmente  leshe hem in a dishe with hoot water  do safroun to √æe furmente and if the porpays be salt see√æ it by hym self and serue it forth
  why didnt they translate this shit to english
  take ten gallons of ale and a large cock the older the better parboil the cock flay him and stamp him in a stone mortar till his bones are broken you must craw and gut him when you flay him then put the cock into two quarts of sack and put it to three pounds of raisins of the sun stoned some blades of mace and a few cloves put all these into a canvas bag and a little before you find the ale has done working put the ale and bag together into a vessel in a week or nine days time bottle it up fill the bottle but just above the neck and give the same time to ripen as other ale
which one do i order to get a rub n tug
find a flaw oh wait you cant
what is it
  headcheese fried not stirred
  scrapple everything they dont use for sausages and hotdogs thrown into a bucket and turned into a mush brick then fried by based pennsylvanians for breakfast everyday
  nasty
  the southern equivalent is called livermush
  blurry pic in the background
  aka scrapple but watered down for pussies who are afraid of scrapple
  
  no actually it is typically pretty spicy you dumb ass
we have it too balkenbrij really good
  scrapple was too hardcore so we toned it down  lmao
  this is actually considered cuisine in america
all memes aside if you eat this every day it will kill you
  nope it uses quality pork its also very simple to make    scrapple is something like a meaty fried polenta cornmeal to which seasonings and relatively lean cooked meat usually pork have been added the cooked mixture is poured into loaf pans and refrigerated overnight to stiffen    
  the base color
  doesnt have green colours on it
scrapple is good but goetta is betta
  the only flaw is that its not based jaternice
scrapple is absolutely godtier and anyone says different hasnt tried it goetta is a close second though harder to get outside of ohio
  its not nasty the flavor is pretty mild
  sounds like a bonus to me
scrapple is alright pork roll is the real king of northeast food
  nope it uses quality pork
how similar is scrapple to spam
  hashbrown patties
  looks like neeses liver pudding top notch stuff
theres an amish grocery across the state line into indiana best fucking fresh fruit you ever tasted peaches plums half a dozen types of apples the last time we went they were selling one pound bricks of scrapple for 79 and i bought it all still have about 15 pounds in the freezer
  goetta yes that stuff is awesome
  very different texture is much softer before its cooked way less salty way more flavor its like comparing a dollar store steak to a peter lugers if youve got a kroger nearby check the freezer section
  is that spam  i cunt it thinner let it fry until its thin and crispy  once in a great while ill do thicker slices like that but its never as good
  spom
  aka scrapple but watered down for pussies who are afraid of scrapple  i would consider livermush the robust more flavorful version of scrapple actually not everyone likes liver so yea    i like both items myself and though i havent made it from scratch id be more likely to do that myself than order it out anywhere that wasnt a real farm to table kind of craft joint i am suspicious of catching cjd from pieces and parts that include too many parts from brain spine and nervous system ehh     scrapple is delicious texture that lacey crispness at the edges from the included cormeal contrasting with the soft and mushy middles and the velvety buttery mouthfeel from all that gelatin in there its amazingly good
  buys megacorporate pig slop and extrapolates their disgusting ingredients to small local artisans  you need to get out more often
  how similar is scrapple to spam  spam is mushy blended ham so that saltcured flavor is in there  scrapple is like overpulverized sausage meat mush a very mushy jimmy dean texture but unlike spam has that grain added superfine cornmeal so when its sliced and panfried it gets a truly crunchy seared coating with maillard reaction browning flavors there it is not as heavily spiced as a jimmy dean sausage the only thing that could be similar to spam is that it is delectable and moist in the center
pork loaf gloucestershire pudding
  no matter what you eat everyday it will kill you  what do you eat that makes you think youre immortal
i just ate a pound of boiled buttered brussels sprouts  now off to give my boyfriend his birthday present 
  buttered  absolutely disgusting
  hahahaha  bbbrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaappppp hahahaha
  buttered  there was no point in eating those disgusting greens
  how is that disgusting
cold soups are underrated as fuck any other cu/ck/s that are fans    why cant tastelets into cold renditions of hot dishes
i drink cold soup everyday i usually put citrus in water and let it steep at room temperature for 20 minutes while i sip it i might get bold and put some cucumber in my cold soup one day    faggot
  dumb tastelet
  based
i made okroshka does it count
    why do gooks pretend their food is anything but tasteless fermented trash they had to invent to keep from starving
  sour grapes anon
does gazpacho count i have a spanish gf that makes it for me a lot
  youre not wrong but the same could also be said of stuff like bread cheese rice potatoes
  it counts
  mfw
yeah boi cold soups is where its at especially on a hot day one of these bad boys and an ice cold beer makes for the perfect summer day
  only tomato soup i like
  i plan on trying this asap
  i only take my gazpacho pipping hot
  i only like the tex mex version with tons of sour cream and cheese
is salsa a cold soup
  god but they are pricey why am i poor one of the only good things of summer aka hell on earth here
  go back to russia
soups cant be cold reeeeeeee
  sneed
does cold fish soup exist
  what does she taste like
  are those radishes  weird tarator if so
where can i buy the best stevia sweetener what brand should i get liquid or powder the only thing i found at the grocery store has erythritol and that stuff gives me the runs
  the best  chemical    huh
  its a plant bruh
  its a chemical extracted from a plant
  amazon i buy powder brand doesnt matter because liquid is usually sweeter so you have to use really small amounts to not overdo it powder i just treat like regular sugar though it is also sweeter so use less
is it really that weird to mix your pasta in a frying pan i had a guest over today and they mocked me for it i mean i cook my pasta like everyone else meanwhile i fry some meat chopped chicken breast for example when both are done i drain the pasta add it to the frying pan with the chicken throw in some pasta sauce i made before od bought premade mix it up and let the whole thing simmer a minute or two inside the frying pan i dont see whats wrong about doing that
test
  seems like the kind of guest that you shouldnt invite back they should be glad theyre getting a free meal in the first place if they not only dont like it but also mock you as a guest then fuck them
  is it really that weird to mix your pasta in a frying pan  no you make the sauce in the pan then add the pasta for a nice coating most people do this fat retard  take your premade shit and shove it up you dumb faggot niggerhole
this is the problem about having people over helicopter the next guest who has something stupid to say
id lob the heads off of those kinds of guests and mount their heads on pikes and then have some fun with their wives and daughters
      trolld hard
unless you make those onepot abominations putting pasta in the pan always makes it better it binds the sauce to the pasta perfectly and if you are reheating it is a superior method to microwave
  you need a whirly birdn
  this is the traditional way of making pasta
  underrated post
thats how italians do it so u can shit on your friends next time doing it
whats a food youve always wanted to try but never had a chance to    for me its truffles ive never had them even though im very much into foraging i even have friends who get them often but somehow have never shared them with me i dont even know how much im missing out on here
bread
monkey
  i dont even know how much im missing out on here  depends really good quality truffles ie perigord black truffles or alba white truffles are pretty amazing and incredibly distinctive theyre not really something you can substitute for winter truffles from other places can still be really good but theyre not on the same level in terms of intensity of flavor/aroma
  jam/marmalade that isnt processed grape jelly also real garlic cloves
  taco bell
pussy
  arent the white ones going for like hundreds of thousands in auctions
  what kind of fake garlic cloves do people sell youre starting to make me doubt my own experiences
  what the fuck have you been doing with your life
  garlic salt and garlic powder dumbass
  those arent fake cloves you fuckin retard
  dumbass by real in the culinary world people refer to fresh produce or non cellulose cheese
  are there really places where theres no grocery store or anything where you can buy fresh garlic even though ive frequently used the salt and powder ive taken for granted that the real things arent actually hard to get
  im on the same boat op the best ive tried was a truiffle oil spray that wasnt even real truffle but it tasted great on pizzas i can only imagine how the real stuff tastes
  it only just launched in india
  do you at least own a cool little honda 250 beater motorcycle
  im on 4channel on a saturday afternoon  so no
  he doesnt post on 4channel while putting around curry town on his ruckus
a pear  i have never tried a pear
ive never tried otoro
  garlic cloves  do you not cook or even eat out at half decent places jesus fuckin christ
  maybe alligator i ordered it at a restraurant but was told they were out of it one of these days ill try it i suspect as others tell me that its no big deal i still want to try it
  you lost the plot sure places sell garlic cloves but if making something at 3am sometimes the powder works best especially if on leftover pizza

/beer/ general  not a containment thread edition  previous thread 
first post
tried bourbon county stout on tap yesterday honestly couldnt figure out what the fuss was about seemed overhyped in better news popped open an 18 month old aventinus eisbock truly the pinnacle of malt delicious following it up with a lovely pic related
  almost looks like a mikkeller label
  hey i have that chemistry book too
  which one theyre all pretty good reads
  the central science one ive been meaning to finally get to it it came in the mail a month ago but works been nuts and ive had zero energy to crack the fucker
  reposting
  i agree but the hype is more for the variants than the regular we still had 2017 regular bcbs sitting on the shelf at my local liquor store in october
    smells like inbev
  why do americans love budweiser light so much
  because were fat af and you can drink them all day and all night
  tastes like nothing pic related is an actually decent light beer though
  we have this on tap where i work and fucking holy god damn shit its so dog darned delicious
my favorite light beer
      low abv berliners are great for drinking all day and they actually taste like something
best beer best design
  whyd them flemings name a coffee after the antigaymarriage bill
for me its gotta be pabst blue ribbon of course affordable and delicious its truly the best beer
  cant drink it anymore its inbev swill replaced it with st bernardus tripel      troegs barrel aged some of that at one point id love to try it great beer
  rudy van de kelders finally in secondary didnt photograph it hes back to being a red just needed racked off the yeast tried a bit while i ran some quick tests and hes definitely in the 10ish range possibly a great success
  we dont have bernardus tripel but we do have quad on tap dope as shit
  the taste is rank   nothing special about this beer
  acid reflux
this was good
      this dude invented light beer in general
  i wish i could try fun stuff like this but unless i ship it from out of state costing a fuckton theres no kind of store anywhere near me in the midwest for buying stuff like that
  i remember you
  yeah its based i dont care if inbev bought it as long as its still good
  what shitty part of the midwest do you live in that you cant get beer
    especially basic bitch stuff like stone   stone have 50 state distribution  lazy much
  nebraska i can get beer but mostly basic stuff apart from my local brewery which is its own brand    they do in basic bitch general stores or in select alcohol shops or bars or whatnot ive only ever bought alcohol at stores within commute distance
  berliner  thats a beer for women
  search stone beer finder    most likely they will have other shit
  we still had 2017 regular bcbs sitting on the shelf at my local liquor store in october  the worst part of living in a place with good beer culture is limited release stuff disappears right away
  theres your capitalist oportunity awaiting be the first microbrew/imported beer store in your area
  meh
can we all just likestop pretending anyone on earth likes beer and doesnt just tolerate it to get drunk
  you know there is a more efficient way to kill these threads right
  
  how does it compares to the rochefort 10  the 10 was great taste like figs and dry fruits
  fuck off cunt
  nice you put the beer in front of your meme chemistry books for the picture so you can try to look smart dumb faggot
  8 is also great
  maredsous has a similar setup too their 8 is a dubbel and the 10 is a tripel if you like rochefort youll enjoy them as well     its not as heavily bottleconditioned as well so chances are it wont blow up on you as easily my workplace is always 50/50 when it comes to bottleconditioned beers boulevard sixth glass rocheforts etc depends on which bartender opens the beer for us to pour still delicious nonetheless get a wide goblet for it if you can also
i like molson 
  you cant make this up
drinking this in flyover land right now
  his father was a dressmaker  thats all i need to hear ahout light beers
  i hate being drunk but love beer im really hoping someone starts focusing on n/a beer and making it actually palatable
  dont drink 3 thousand in a sitting
ok this may be a weird question but here goes what is your favourite abv level/range for beers and alcohol in general if you want to provide more detail
  i only drink once a week and am not obese so two beers does me in usually i just fall asleep from them and wake up groggy
what is the worst style of beer and why is it india pale ale
he doesnt know about pic related with some fresh lime juice  pitiful
  thats a normal beer interaction i wouldnt classify that as drunk unless you are shooting for recruitment to a certain quasi religious group letting the depressant do its work after a normal day of work
  because the chad ipa fucked your mother and skipped town
  i thought this article was ridiculous but i guess youve proven theres a market for this sort of thing   huh
  i just dont like the feeling though once in awhile its fine but i dont want it as much as i want a beer
  what is the difference between a meme chemistry book and a normal chemistry book
  it all depends on how the judge in the glass house feels at any given moment    when the red quads all bottled up i should shoot a pic of a few of them in front of my old university textbooks they might be memey science books but theyd at least be oldschool memes
  as far as i am concerned a chemistry book is about as unmeme as something can get
  if im going to be drinking a lot below 6    if im going to be driving i really appreciate a midstrength around 35 that tastes good thankfully these are becoming more common now    if im just having a few beers and not driving then it doesnt matter
  on a weeknight a single 85 pint with dinner or two 65s spread out over a few hours   at a weekend lunch with a friend where im driving and have plans for later in the day a 55 pale ale is ideal   friday night at home up to two pints of 85 or one triple around 1011   summer daytime drinking steady pints of 354 usually berliners or sours   i dont drink liquor or wine
  i go by the beer my favourite beer is schloss eggenbergs 23p urbock at about 10 i also really like wychwoods arrowaine which is less than 4    my favourite cocktails a bit of nonsense in around the 30 mark but i also like single shot gin caesars    i go by flavour  getting messed up is a bit of an afterthought
  make way for the obviously superior cub beer
my dog once picked up its own ipa because i dont take shit from anyone    stay thirsty my friends
not liking ipa  its like you dont like flavor
not liking literal human feces  its like you dont like flavor
hurr its shit because i dont like it  youre exactly like the faggots that hate beer
  the higher the better obviously
pour a shot of coffee liqueur into a beer glass pour a stout over it drink it trust me on this
humans evolved to detect toxins as bitter tasting we tend to survive when we spit out toxins because they taste bad as opposed to swallowing them to look and feel manly  ipas objectively taste toxic literally youre not any more of a man for enjoying high ibu ipas just as youre not any more of a man for enjoying high scoville chili peppers
  when will flyover stoutboi learn that modern ipas tend to sit under 50 ibus and often around 30
  ipas objectively taste toxic
  but hes right
so many tastelets in this thread ripping into ipa or stout etc what the fuck does it matter what you think is good the craft beer market is so fucking huge that you can find any style you want just because every brewery makes an neipa now because its popular doesnt mean they stop making stouts if you truly appreciate beer you should be able to find positives in any style most styles have an insane amount of substyles or adjuncts that can totally shake it up too
  antiipa posters that arent trolling are flyovers dont even know what neipas are
  flyovers are the only ones making decent ipas m80
just cracked a 11am lager were in for a good day lads got 7 more where that came from
  living the dream
  go back to sleep pumpkin youre delirious
  just randomly adding the word flyover to things you dont like even though they have nothing to do with the midwest
ipas are alright if you ask me but stouts and xpas are the superior choice
  flyovers  your point is invalid and you are a low test nigger
  i hate beer but thats an incredibly aesthetic can   whats a good beer for people that hate beer those dark ones look okay are the chocolatey ones good i think irish red something or other sounded pretty ok
  unironically a great tasting beer
this was lacking in flavor a bit but it was alright
  low bitternes ibu stouts are the best beers for people who dont like normal beer ie girlfriend  better if it has the word chocolate somewhere on the label
who here /festivedrinking/
can we get a discord uwu
  there is a glut of shitty ipas flooding the market that sit on store shelves and get old you cant be unaware that ipas are over represented most ipas taste extremely simliar with only small variations no one makes maltbalanced ipas like dogfish head or samuel smith they are usually one note bitter hop bombs
  this is one of the very few christmas ales i enjoy
  the midwest ipa is the only consistent ipa around both coasts have now made two meme ipas that will fade into nothing in a small amount of time we saw it with the stereotypical west coast ipa the shitty milkshake ipas and now the hazy neipa its nice to have once in awhile but most people just want something well balanced and easy thats why the midwest ipa will forever be around while all the bullshit memepas will be phased out by the next shitty trend
        get this zoomer swill out of here      now this is epic
  i feel like winter ales fuck up the same way fall beers fuck up just overspiced garbage this one is pretty balanced with it sierra nevadas winter warmer is pretty good if your into something that tastes like malta spic malt drink
a beers manliness is determined solely by its color darker  manlier
  ipa  sissy numales  stout  masculine men of character and taste  your post is correct
  the bigger more established breweries tend to do the seasonal beers better imo if i dont feel like risking getting a garbage beer i love going for anything sierra  inb4 big beer shill      based and redpilled
  yeah i bet you prefer a lot of things darker
  only a true cuck would project their fantasies like this
  yikes
stout  islay single malt whisky  ipa  mal√∂rt
  milkshakes were also new england mid atlantic is about tropical ipas
    why did you automatically assume it was sexual he couldve been talking about dark sausage meat which could go great with his dark drink
  being a beer snob  cringe
  mlady
  yep
  your hamfisted effort at equating pretentious ass drinking culture sucks islay tourists are all faggots
  see     beat you to it cunt
  vb loooong neck    
  agreed beer sure is delicious mmm lets laugh at all the people who are obviously inferior to us because they dont drink beer we sure are smart and attractive because of our beverage choice dont you agree
another week another monkish release
  xkcd is shitty every day

here you go   simple as    everything else is fag shit youre drinking to get drunk not to swill the booze in your mouth like wine and talk about its zesty woody accent that you totally can pick up     fucking benders
  not yet
drank some unfiltered sardinian beer one hour later i had to pee and my dick was burning like fucking hell  dunno if the thing were connected but beer was delicious
  youre drinking to get drunk not to swill the booze in your mouth like wine and talk about its zesty woody accent that you totally can pick up   porque no los dos
  sardine beer sounds gross
  stella is the last beer id drink to get drunk
      then youre a bent freak
  victory never seems to impress always disappoint for pa brewers troegs is better
  my god that guy on the left must have to piss
  everyone in that line disgusts me only the worst people wait in line for beer
  he doesnt live near a brewery that produces beer worth waiting in line for  i genuinely feel sorry for you anon
any australian bros tried this not bad pretty smooth taste
  drinking to get drunk  maybe you are im drinking to enjoy a delicious and relaxing beverage that complements my meal
  you must be wrong because my opinion is the only one that matters and i cant stand beer in fact i think beer is so gross and that my limited knowledge and palate are so important that im actively seeking out those who seem to enjoy it to tell them how wrong they are look im even going to make a straw man argument and say that they are the ones being confrontational about it watch watch me pretend to be a retard see how much you thought i was a retard jokes on you im totally not a retard and just love cocks in my mouth garblegarblegarbleilovecocks    xkcd belongs on either /co/ /sci/ or /lgbt/ fuck yourself
  thats from the company of sardinian women
  bent freakazoid
  yeh its ok i bought case of it to take camping and it was good to session on    little creatures has gotten pretty shit since mitsubishi bought them out though what used to be great beer is now overpriced average beer
  then youre not drinking beer idiot
  stella is the the euro adjunct lager of le highest class        inbev garbage
    any good craft recommendations
    stella artois used to market itself under the slogan reassuringly expensive but became popularly known in britain as the wife beater beer because of its high alcohol content and perceived connection with aggression and binge drinking  abv 4252  i dont get it
  he doesnt enjoy the taste of beer  whats it like to be a child i forget its been so long
  beating your wife is a bad thing  hello numale wife beater is a selling point like saying it has no artificial flavours
  it was popular with the kind of dipshit who thinks paying extra for tarted up carlsberg at the pub made them look wealthy even though they pregamed eith frosty jack before heading out most of its competition slid in at 5 or below so the 52 abv just masked the fact that it was only really popular with drunks trying to impress the rest of degenerate chav culture is where the name came from
  have you tried any beers from feral brewing    the hop hog and karma citra are both pretty good    sometimes they bring out an assorted six pack that is really good but it has a few dark stouts in there not sure if thats your thing
  t tarquin bender   back to drinking shandys
  im having another raspberry sour at this moment also had a hefeweizen earlier eos by nebraska brewing co
    if he likes dog dags the closest thing from feral is sly fox  mountain goat summer ale is also a good similar one  note these 3 are all kinda pseudocraft breweries that have been bought out by the big boys
  feral are pretty decent when theyre fresh but at most places youll find them theyre shelf turds    most people who are really into craft beer dont drink them anymore myself included
i like kirin ichiban
  their grand cru a blend of their bourbon quad and their whiskey barrel stout is pretty fantastic
  hes an insecure faggot who feels threatened by anything that isnt nascar and hooters
  i was always disappointed by it
  get a load of this guy
what should i go get here  
started with pic related yesterday  the more it went the more the cherryish tones disappeared and at the end it was pretty much a sour toffee great but i would have expected more from the barrel aging
  hitachino nest are generally decent you can get them here in the us at whole foods and bottle shops but at about twice the price of that site
  and ended up with this one which was way more tough and dry at the start but since it was very dry you end pretty much quaffing it
  bruh if you dont want to drink beer thats 110 fine nobody gives the guy who drinks gts in my group of friends any shit and only one dumbass ever gave the straight edge guy any shit i do like it though
  i think this is pretty much the tone of that comic 1/3 way up the page this being 4chan in the age of persecution at least one persons going to at least pretend to sympathize with the guy passiveaggressively drinking beer to fit in
  yeah i know what you mean i homebrew and its pretty easy to beat anything they sell in a woolworths/coles bottle shop   i just recommended feral because its pretty easy to find any where i didnt want to recommend some obscure brand that cant be found in any bws    bridge road and stone  wood are pretty good fresh
  staropramen nonalcoholic tastes almost like the regular staropramen imo   but even though i like the taste of beer i still dont really appreciate the whole drinking beer without getting drunk thing its one of those things that worked for hundreds even thousands of years and dont need to be reconstructed
  belgium and germany are quite good at it most other countries just throw a bunch of shit in the vat and hope it sticks
what are the must try german beers preferably ones you can commonly find in normal grocery stores in germany and not some specialty shop
  aecht schlenkerla for goat smoked beers  anything schneider weisse for goat wheat beers  classic doppelbocks celebrator salvator korbinian etc  hackerpschorr is a really good hefe imo

sorry im new to beer what are the normal yellow light beers called seems like everyone here only drinks thick dark stuff
  what are the normal yellow light beers called  urine aka ipa
  hey thats so cool anon  i got this piece of shit resealable beer from my dad a while ago gonna see how it tastes
  okay fuck me i touched the lid and the whole thing blew off like a gunshot i dont know where it is and my ears are still ringing glad it missed me desu    tastes shit btw
  ipas arent light though in color sure but not flavor that anon is thinking of american lagers
  american  i wish theyre from all over the world my friend
  why do anons hate ipas anyway im a stout/porter and pilsner man myself i dont get it their okay they just over saturate the market is all
  because 4chan is littered with contrarians
  i dont like them because well i dont like them and more importantly its bloody hard to find anything else
  its really not though
  i just recommended feral because its pretty easy to find any where  cause theyre bought same with pirate life little creatures 4 pines wish there was a proper list for them all    inb4 lion and cub dindu nuffin  every time one of these guys picks up a beer they make it blander every time
  its not anons its one vocal cunt with a pile of memes
  well okay its hard to find anything else at supermarkets if you go to an actual beer shop or pub its not
  i find it more annoying cause theyre an opportunity cost for the brewery you gotta have a house pale an american pale an ipa a session ale and then your next moves after might be a stout something lagery or a crazier ipa and now youre either long past or a long way to messing with stuff like wheat or sours or barleywine  i dont even hate ipas but im not a hophead and neither are most people so its a wonder how someone hasnt cracked the skunky lager grip on sales without resorting to moar ibu
  they taste like pine sol and soap yes all of them
  bbut mmuh neipa  fruity pine sol and soap
  stouts are basically black coffeeish in taste porters are a step down if you dont like intense coffee hefeweizens have a slightly sweeter profile than most beers but i hear they can be a bit divisive i like em good for summer
  stouts are basically black coffeeish in taste porters are a step down if you dont like intense coffee  most stouts these days tend to be very slightly sweet so i wouldnt say black coffeeish
  i wouldnt say ipas taste like poison but drinking one always tastes like im munching on pine needles
  again no its not there are a lot of them but there is still a ton of other available styles around and any store almost every widely distributed brewery has multiple styles available
  not that guy but shop local even my local acme sells local brands like neshaminy creek which contain far less ipas
  my local supermarkets craft beer selection is over 90 ipa
  i dont understand the hype behind japanese macrobrews and im a huge weeb i think their beers are served cold as fuck just to mask the crappy taste i drank plenty of asahi sapporo and kirin on visits to nipland but i would never be able to tell them apart in a blind taste test
  i doubt it seriously most breweries force their other stuff on stores whether or not they want it or have a demand unless you live in some shit state that only pumps out ipas then you just live somewhere shitty
  unless you live in some shit state that only pumps out ipas then you just live somewhere shitty  i live in california i live somewhere shitty no really 90 of craft beer in supermarkets here is ipa
  for example my primary supermarket the one two blocks away from my home has about 40 ipas one stout zero porters and a few assorted pale ales and wheat beers thats literally it for craft beers i am not exaggerating
  that makes sense then sorry about that brah make a road trip to the midwest minnesota is starting to be overrun with traditional lagers and sours i love it wisconsin next door has an incredible array of shit as well but then you have to listen to delusional packer fans it gets tough
  one stout  and of course its shitty retard guinness  id be fucked if it wasnt for my local terribly overpriced bevmo
  pa is also a good state for beers neshaminy creek troegs manayuk philadelphia iron hill lancaster lotta good beers lot less ipas forced down your asshole
  is that where troegs is from i see that stuff posted here a little bit and want to try it out a lot of out of state stuff has been weaseling its way into mn lately so hopefully one day i can try it i doubt i can sway my gf to use her vacation to go to pa
  yeah its located in hershey pa pretty good stuff from the very few ive had heard good things of them but never bothered going down there
  no you dunce i think i know my local supermarkets better than you    tesco even removed all their remaining ales in favour of ipas
  in my experience the people complaining loudly about ipas are willingly oblivious to all the other options in front of them
  rather funny that your experience is so counter to mine isnt it  drink your fucking ipa american you better like it because they took out westmalle to stock it
    you have the palate of a child literally an eater of tendies and kraft mac and cheese
  that is the brewers decision and probably supported by their market no one conspires to make them sell those
  no they didnt and how the fuck would you know
  yes they did and i know because it was on clearance one day and in its spot on its shelf was a new and interesting variety of ipa  suck  my  anglo  cock
  my local supermarket had a sierra nevada narwhal in once once it was lovely it was immediately replaced by a hop bullet ipa that has since become a regular
picked this up after work pretty good desu although i wouldnt really say it stands out
  i think you just want to be upset about something
  i think id much rather have my westmalles and my chimays and my st bernarduses like the rest of bloody europe and not be upset but hey perhaps ive completely misunderstood my own feelings and this is all an attempt to have sex with my mother
ipa
  i used to feel the same only liked dark stouts and ales for years tasted a super hoppy ipa and thought nah thats not for me a few months later i got this tingling in my gums like i wanted to chew on gum or a plastic straw for some reason remembered the ipa got some swished it in my a little up in my gums and all i can describe it as is that it satisfied this craving for a bite that all other carbonated beverages dont seem to match i still mostly drink darks but once in a while i just fucking need that stringent kind of bite the ipa has    is this limited to me or does anyone else feel similarly fairly specific to that bite im talking about
  narwhal is a once a year release you fucking goon
cringe or based
  nah i agree you have to get accustomed to the bitterness just like when you first start drinking beer or coffee
    damn that name brought back memories i remember having troegs perpetual back when i was in college in ct i remember it tasting very bready but enjoying it nonetheless    anyway i got a makeyourown sixer at the store today  21st amendment blood orange ipa  uinta hop nosh ipa  founders all day ipa  reubens hazealicious ipa  paulaner hefeweizen  pike brewing monks uncle tripel    ive tried the first three
  but i liked both those things from the start
for me its coopers pale ale
  hackerpschorr might be my favourite nononsense brewery their wheat is as good as their gold is as good as their dunkel their oktoberfest beer is well i mean its good enough for oktoberfest    very clean beers basically right on target with what german wheats golden lagers and dark beers aim for
  in german  helles so helles lager hellesbock maibock etc will be light beers pilsener or pilsner is essentially the super light version of a helles lager    pale ales are a more hop/yeast forward version of essentially the same thing its a different yeast variety brewed warmer and not usually stored for as long cold storage or lagering an ale leads to a lagered ale or a kolsch india pale ales are hoppy new england ipas are a bit hazier and a little more fruity in their choice of hops technically any ale lighter than a golden/orange colour is a pale ale regardless of hop content but brewers tend to bitter them up a fair amount
  theyre brewed dry and pale a japanese take on the americanindustrial version of a pale german lager mexican beers did more or less the same thing and packed them up in clear bottles to skunk them a bit
  she is hot i dont blame you
  lager some pale ales wheat beers
  theyre popular with weebs and are at least better than american macro lagers but not as good as euro ones
i love this shit
  having another one tonight
  she certainly is enthusiastic so i dont think you have to try that hard but just know shes damaged goods going in     id prefer fucking your sister
where the fuck is the al/ck threads just woke up and opened a shitty lager to feel like a complete shit
  unibroue never dissapoints
  is any of their fancier shit worth
  i have the same exact edition of meissler inorganic good stuff    im an organic chemist though so i feel i should instantly talk down to you presumably an anal chem faggot while simultaneously sharing with you mutual disdain for p chemists    fuck them
  7 is the perfect abv imo
  62 for me
  8 i think  alcohol in general  anything between 7 and 20 anything too alcoholic i cant relax while drinking it feels like im aiming to get drunk rather than drinking to taste and anything too low i cant get tipsy enough to relax
      47 master race  then i can crush 12 pints
  i wish i could afford twelve pints
just back from belgium and managed to bring a 6 pack of westvleteren 12 back ill probably have one every 6 months or a year to see how they age
  kek dont mail beers
  kernel imperial brown stout in the back    my man
  the fucking state of your living conditions
  yeah back in the day i first started drinking shitty american macros and i tried a heniken since it was new and foreign it sucked but once every few months id buy a tall boy at 711 to scratch that bitter skunky taste itch than sierra nevada got distributed and i suddenly liked bitter beers t flyover 30yr boomer here
  812 too much and the beer ends up tasting boozy
  how much did it cost
  the last room in the last house in the last letting agency available because i wasnt sure until the last minute whether the unid let me retake the year    its tiny and the blinds are white so they let all the light inand theres a street lamp outside my window so i masking taped up a blackout curtain luckily its cheap as fuck i spend most of my time at my gfs anyway    thank you for listening     ye boi  i preferred the de dolle though which is strange because i usually dont like sour beers
  oh yeah and the door doesnt shut thank god my flat mates are absolute lads
  anyone who says under 10 is a woman and probably likes ipa which tastes objectively bad
        move out of your den of faggots then     this is what a midwestern grocery store looks like right next to the cigarettes dip and ammo
  ate my picture
  ipa is bad    tits or gtfo
  thats 2499 per bottle for for the box    what the fuck
  hey guys ive never heard of anything    per bottle
huh
  empty 2018 cbs bottle for 80  is this nigger serious
  selling full bottles across state lines without licensing violates federal law and you are a faggot    its full hence the cap
any other pa bros drinkin mad elf this shit tastes good it might be too strong though
  speaking of the great midwest this beer is fucking delicious
anyone else get drunk and like to watch beer reviews on youtube
  ive only had a few white stouts as they are seem cringey on first glance but ill be damned if they arent delicious fat orange cat sees some midwestern distro and their white stout is delicious
is sam adams boston lager good worth buying or should i buy something else from sam adams
  its fine their winter ale is solid and rebel ipa is good enough for a cheaper ipa if youre into them    ive never heard of them or seen any of their beer up here one other brewery does a good golden coffee ale in minnesota though insight brewing pretty good shit
  the fuck part of the midwest is this ive only ever heard of shit like this sitting around in the south and california
am american whats good beer to buy is hofbrau good or is that just imitation german shit
  hofbrau is german not imitation whatever that means
  sherlock fucking holmes    let me help you with that where its born
  little connecticut brewery same distributor as decadent omnipolo and eviltwin for alot of the east
  i mean like middle of fucking nowhere or an actual city
  ill have to keep my eye open since we get omnipollo and evil twin here already
  little town cities tend to get stuff quicker is all i split my time here and lansing and the difference is i can leisurely by shit at any store here and in lansing it sells out at the hipster store and sits for a while everywhere else
  i live in one of those urban white people neighborhoods and hyped single release beer like those sells out absurdly fast sometimes i have my parents pick stuff up for me in the outer suburbs where it lasts a little longer or at least you dont have to wait in a fucking line for it but i have never happened upon a stock of limited beer that big i have only seen anecdotes of people running into that stuff in the south or our west
  yeah we also have massive bodies of fresh water and no hurricanes or earthquakes
  i live in milwaukee so i am familiar with the water
  probably also familiar with laker grocery stores then    this is the hipster one in lansing to the right if that reach in meat case is a bar with 45 beers on tap little plastic cup holders for your cart to drink and shop they are realy the only ones with bottle limits though so the can fuck off
  every bar in town and even the town on the other side of the bay has decent whiskey around for reasons also
3 of these fucked me up  pretty decent for a hobo beer
  this guy has the right idea
some schizo maniac in my local store lectured me for a full five minutes about how this was the shit and anybody drinking anything else is retarded naturally i had to try it and its pretty good
  all cats are grey in the dark  its a benjamin franklin quote about banging milfs
  thats abitas weakest offering try some real beer from them like their amber or the turbodog brown ale but rn its like youre drinking soda mixed with beer good luck s
  they made a wildfermented version a while back as a oneoff that im really sorry ive missed out on troegs is a fantastic brewery thats fairly underrepresented in my area    in other news finally got my hands on a bottle of ba expedition stout i wasnt being memed on this shit is very fucking good
  it was okay before the russians took over the brewery
  ba expedition blows kbs the fuck out if the water sir enjoy its alot rarer than my picture indicated
  should clarify the picture from my shopping adventure love the troegs btw
  why is there a black drag queen on the bottle
  because southerners
  oh look the ipas are gross poster foesnt know shit about beer    go figure
my go to beer cheap tastes great 51 abv    fucking italians man they know whats up
  the good thing is feral havent lost their quality yet hopefully cocacola treat them differently than other big companies do
thread results  pretty good count 5  sierra nevadas winter warmer  feral hop hog  feral karma citra  new holland dragons milk  abita purple haze    pretty decent count 1  86 original special blond beer    pretty fantastic count 1  boulevard brewing co grand cru
  the boot is good if youre in louisiana i dont think they sell it out of the state
  ive only had one white stout  my buddys brewery made it for the album release of a mutual friend it sounded neat and i was excited to try it it had no flavour the hops green coffee and malt just cancelled each other out and the whole thing came out like thick slightly bitter perrier might whip up a sweeter batch myself to see what comes out unless i can find one in the meantime
  almost everything else they make is better than their flagship lager but its not bad
  try to have just one beer with dinner  end up killing a 6 pack and taking 4 shots of rum thats not even mine  do i have a problem
  yes
  well ill try dry january and see how that goes i do really think i should quit
  why not dont drink december if you dont start now you never will trust me
  this christmas/new years break is the ultimate test
    yeah no way in fuck i can do christmas / nye with the company i keep
  honestly youre not too far gone i think youd be surprised at how easy it becomes after the first week id seriously recommend trying it out starting today if you end up drinking on christmas and new years youd still know you can actually be sober for a prolonged period of time
  i have no problem not drinking that i know i can do i just wish i could have a few drinks with friends and not always be the one who gets too hammered its like a switch goes off in my head after my first beer and i have to keep drinking and all judgement goes out the window
  if you really need substances to cope just take up weed ideally vaping far less destructive to your body
  i get too noided i end up thinking the fbi is after my teeth or similar delusions
  try sativa instead of indica
  start meditation and practicing mindfulness it will help you deal with the paranoia a lot better
pass out at 2 am  wake up at 5am  continue drinking  still drunk 10 hours later  thanks i hate it
  unibroue never dissapoints  accurate    youve got that backwards sativas are way more prone to inducing paranoia and/or psychosis than indicas
  yeah my bad
my most recent purchase turned 21 under two weeks ago excited to buy my own beers now
  1 peroni
  i like their octoberfest only available seasonally though
  i dont get it
  its garbage
new thread    
who here dino buddies  preheating now
  i just put them in
  just about halfway there now
  out of the oven
  why are they so pale    wouldnt it make more sense to have deepfried them
  voila served  dinos are pretty ok frozen tendies but there arent enough pterodactyls even though they use one to represent their product
  thanks for your concern  yes but too much effort
  you dippin those in some ketcup
  not him but those appear to be very cheap low quality chicken nuggets the oil you fried then them in would probably be worth more than the nuggets or at least the time you spent setting things up then cleaning it up even if he just left everything sitting out and heated up the same oil in the same container and fried a new batch of autism dinosaurs everyday for the next week like a fucking slob    id have thrown them in the oven too
  just ketchup  if he doesnt throw some horseradish in there hes wasting everyones time
just go to kfc even as a kid i didnt think these were that great
  no sir just a dash of salt
  id have thrown them in the oven too  just think of them adorably breaded dinoshaped kikes
this must be the quality posting that faggot anon in the nigger cooking thread must be talking about
  much more high quality than whatever the fuck you posted
op here  thanks to everyone who posted  one of my kids likes these  i think they suck but whatever  the kid likes them and requests them occasionally not a big deal  i just wanted to make a tendies thread for you cu/ck/nts  i hope you all have a gerat week  and dont eat this crap its not very good
halloween time is gone  so are the bat shaped nuggets why even live anynore
  what kinda dino is the middle one  hulkasaurus hogan
  middle one  misshapen pterodactyl  thanks for asking anon
  holy crap  i just noticed you organized them by dino type  do you pretend your a bigger dinosaur when you eaten them
  pls refer to   thanks for posting
bumpon for the love of tendies
when i worked at a dinosaur museum sometimes id get these at the pub and hum the jurassic park theme
  wa la
  i wish this was true
          fuck you for ruining cooking alone for us
  i had nothing to do with that you huge sperglord
  i miss these so much
  this is the proper dinosaur egg one of those lasted me like two or three years when i was a little kid

share stories about food workers    be me  45 minutes ago  go to my uni dining hall  the food is actually fairly decent  go to one station where they have beef stroganoff   may i please have some beef stroganoff  guy behind counter gets a plate and pours the sauce onto the plate   no pasta  look down at plate confused  cant tell if hes being an asshole or just really stupid  ask for pasta  go back for another serving a few minutes later  hes figured out that people automatically want pasta with it but now he puts the sauce on the side
did you dab on him
  what degenerate messes up stroganoff     inb4 dubs
im sure hed never seen or heard of the dish before if he had then he was fucking with you pretty good    not his fault if hes never seen or heard of it
  you    a retart  checkd    lel yea thats the obvious explanation youd think the guy next to him at the station would have seen it before and told him though its a pretty common dish and these people work in the food industry
  whoa
  honestly whatever    hes working at a uni dinning hall its probably his first job and at least hes learning
  based and checkpilled
  guy fieri is looking pretty good these days
  fuck off /asp/ie
  inb4ing your own comment is definitely not fucking based anon
  working as chef in a reasonably well rated restaurant   we cooked things like pasta rice stroganoff bolognese ect in big batches  divide them into tupperware portions and stick them in the walk in fridge  microwave everything  management insists we do it this way to save time  get stoned after every shift to deal with the radiation  found head chef pissed off his face in the walkin more than once   fuckin microwaves
  youd think the guy next to him at the station would have seen it before and told him though  im sure the guy next to him told the guy to not put pasta on it just for a good laugh    i worked in a spot that the workers for some reason would draw lewd pictures on the newly cleaned stainless as soon as you would go drop stuff off at the dish dog the drawings were done with raspberry sauce or chocolate sauce and it was usually cock and balls pictures
  you cant fight those dubs
  be me 17  need a job  go to city hall  easily get a job that pays 11 an hour and has me set own hours  be me 22  1 year waiting period before real job  decide to not be a neet during that time  go to job board  easily land 20 an hour gig after declining a 15 an hour gig  all of these entrylevel in a smallermid size town no real experience or education needed    are you food workers brainlets
drink a 200ml cup of whiskey  equivalent to 1l of wine in alcohol concentration  dont feel nearly as drunk as drinking even a 750ml bottle of wine  did i get scammed
  wine always produces a sloppy drunk for me also stealth /alc/hemist thread
  your body is digesting each differently
  me too shits my absolute kryptonite like sleepy drooling retard pounding headache in the mornings if i over indulge on the wine but beer and liquor isnt like this    this
  different booze creates a different type of buzz    but yeah wine is pretty intense sometimes it makes even the toughest mother fucker all bubbly and sloppy
  i guess dehydration plays a big part ill just avoid drinking and eating for a day and drink the rest of the 1l whiskey bottle and see what happens
for me  beer drunk  loud douche waaaah waaaaah usually ends in tears sloppyness drunk type    whisky drunk  chill mellow sloppy slushy drunk    anyone else
  750ml of wine will be processed rather slowly in the body over a longer time seeming more drunk 200ml of whiskey will be processed fairly quick
tfw only like getting rum drunk anymore
  isnt drinking faster supposed to make you drunker though i want to maximize the drunkenness peak for fapping in the bathtub rather than making it longer
  speed drinking is an amazing way to get fucking sloppy on less alcohol  down half a 26 as kraken in 15 minutes  get infinitely more drunk than ever in my life
  rip your kidneys and liver
distilled hard liquor is easier for the liver to metabolize than wine
  thinking drinking 800ml in one day is going to ruin your liver and kidneys like that
fucking previous thread was deleted because the word dgnerate was unironically not 4channelappropriate im asking because of the meme where faggots put ketchup in everything but what are some dishes or sauces that could legitimately use some ketchup
  so youre ban evading good to know ahem mods
  im not ban evading i was just warned post those 4channelapproved foods already
  i prefer the spelling catsup just to be contrarian  some good barbecue sauces are made using catsup as an ingredient  catsup is also an ingredient in meatloaf glaze
  you can use it as an ingredient to make your own sauces
only acceptable on french fries and cheeseburgers use it on anything else and you have the palate of a child
ketchup is a low tier condiment automatically hold anyone that consumes it in very low esteem
use to eat it on pasta
  the only person ive ever known to use the word catsup molested children
i used to be a ketchup guy when i was fucking 12 ketchup is lowtier shit taste i have a friend that uses it on everything fucking disgusting
people that smother it on absolutely everything have undeveloped taste buds or autism
ive never seen anyone really go nuts with it except for french fries and hash browns
  my brother has actual autism and does indeed smother ketchup on everything
mfw eat turkey with ketchup on thanksgiving
  tell me stories about him and his antics please anon
  its good anon i tip my hat to you )))

alright boys i got a big leg bone and some leftover chunks of venison   i thought about making some type of soup but i cant decide walk me through this shit
  if your leg bone doesnt fit in any of your pots you might need to get it chopped down at a butchers provided they have a saw there that will go through it    other than that potential problem ive always treated venison stock like any other really closer to mutton i suppose i usually bake half of the bones adding some dark beer halfway through to try to extract some marrow i start the pot off with mirepoix with extra onion get that translucent add the bones water then bay rosemary thyme maybe a little marjoram or oregano black or white pepper and a decent amount of salt when everything else volume consistency richness is dialed in    ill keep a tub or two in the fridge to make use of it and freeze the rest
itt post your creative snacks

  keiv is nasty i like the aldi brand for 1 each pretty based
  /ck/s own pocket pussy
  senpai
  more like cock pockets because its chicken anyways they suck shit just drips everywhere
  hot pockets taste better than these do
  never had one of these is it really that runny
    its garlic butter in the middle the one in the picture looks more like oil though
  sounds unhealthy hope its worth it
  just a shitty off brand
  i do prefer alabama hot pockets
  i think one of the murican users got to it first otherwise itd be cum dripping out
  ouch thats not bants worthy of a bong you must be a fucking bogan
  kiev is nasty   i like the aldi brand kiev for 1 each pretty based    pick one
tfw i used to eat one of these every day for lunch when i was a kid with my dads patented shoyu/worcestershire/franks red hot blend on it
  is chicken kiev a ukrainian dish or a russian dish

so uh what the hell can i do with flaxseed     lets just say i recently acquired a decent amount 400500 grams about 1417 ounces for our ameriland friends of it and i have no idea what to do with it
  is it whole seed or ground you can use this in addition to breads cereals and if its ground you can use 1 tbs of water for 2 tbs of ground flax meal as an egg replacer for baking
i put ground flaxseed in my oatmeal
  whole seed what can i just throw it into food raw
  you have to crush flax for it to be digested little nigs are chew resistant and go out the way they come in if their coats are intact
  someone post how flaxseed has more estrogen than soy tenfold
just add a little flaxseed to everything its nutritious and goes with anything
  if its whole its nothing but decoration for buns like sesame seeds it must be ground or milled to be a useful food product whole seed is not digestible
thoughts on driving after a night of drinking     i dont like sleeping over at peoples houses and will usually just drive home
  its too easy to get overly comfortable with driving drunk youre better off following the law even if you think you are being safe
  depends on amount ive had and the amount of time ive given myself to dry out
based and redpilled
please do not drink and drive
it might work a couple of tiems but sooner or later you are going to have an accident
  id be lying if i said i didnt do it same with most people i know i have made a major effort to take uber if im going any further than 35 miles though     honestly theres a worse stigma about it than there should be but some people suck really bad and get obliterated then hop behind the wheel
  he doesnt drink at home  he pays for over priced drinks   he tips his bartender after getting fucked  based reddit frog
  hope you are rich if you get caught its 10000 plus no driving for a year
  driving drunk is super fucked up unless youre going to taco bell
  drinks alone at home  where theres not even the pretense of seeing friends or meeting a girl  not a frogposter    life still has surprises
  yeah ive done it more than a couple times but i dont condone it  a family friend didnt put her seatbelt on for some reason or another on the way home with her family and a drunk bitch hits them head on tara died the next day because her liver was damaged in the crash how ironic the drunk bitch was sentenced to seven years but is probably dandd as i type  my heart goes out to those guys two young boys that might never remember her
driving drunk is not as huge a risk as people make it seem if you can competently drive while sober without making mistakes you can drive drunk notice how most drunk driving accidents happen when a new driver is behind the wheel seasoned drunk drivers dont make these mistakes
  driving drunk is not as huge a risk as people make it seem  would you feel this same way if your loved one was killed by a drunk driver i really doubt it
  please take some time to go back and read the rest of my post
  hate to agree but unironically this    i cant stop you from making bad decisions drive the speed limit turn your music down be paranoid use your blinkers
  im not that guy but my uncle killed himself and i dont get all cranky and shitty every time someone commits suicide same as im not going to throw a tantrum about guns if someone i know gets shot    thats not to say i think people should be drunk driving all the time but i think this is the inevitable result of cities who offer absolutely no public transportation but heavily encourage you to get drunk off your ass at bars and sporting events without putting any responsibility on the money grubbing people encouraging it    but people go overboard like the screeching madd mothers who think having one miller lite with dinner is tantamount to drinking a bottle of whiskey and going 120 mph home
  the thing about not a huge risk is that probability is a little counterintuitive sometimes if you have 99 percent chance of making it home fine driving drunk on a given occasion and do it once a week youve got about a 40 percent chance of having a wreck within a year  obviously its tough to say what the exact chance per incident for a given individual would be but the point is that making it a habit turns an accident into more of an eventuality than a possibility
  driving drunk is not as huge a risk as people make it seem   nonsense    if you can competently drive while sober without making mistakes you can drive drunk  no    notice how most drunk driving accidents happen when a new driver is behind the wheel  yes risk  risk  more risk its still dumb to increase your risk at all    anything which is a potential distraction or affects your reflexes is fucking idiotic to drive while under the influence of that includes smartphones
  yup i basically learned how to drive with a blunt in my mouth and i rarely get pulled over and always stone cold sober because i wont even be thinking about the possibility a cops right around the corner
i ride my bicycle when im really drunk but not my car  loosing your license is pretty inconvenient
  i read it and ive been there the worst wreck i was in was when i was in my mid twenties with a good buzz and new tires wanted to see how well i could take those turns it wasnt until i came back with a truck and chains to pull my car now facing the opposite direction out of the ditch that i realized i flipped my car the back window was shattered on the asphalt and the roof of my car was scratched up i wish i had video of that shit  but im almost always a careful driver driving drunk can bite anyone in the ass when they least expect it
  teenagers at drivethrus will motherfuck you and rat you out to police while lying to stall you or illegally detain you  how not to sell a chalupa
ive driven drunk before sometimes even really fucked up as a matter of fact im drinking a 24oz of modelo cause its cheap af in my car i only drive drunk if im not overly fucked up i drive drunk when i know i can handle it if not then i just stay at the persons place or call an uber 
  you need to go out and live unironically people who act like this on the internet are always sheltered to lifes realities everyone is gonna drive drunk a few times in their life it happens if you know how to control yourself and your vehicle its not a big deal   to be honest you have a point there though if youre making a habit of drinking that much on a regular basis youre probably planning things out beforehand and should have a dd or something set up
looking forward to you getting your stupid ass killed so you can stop shitting up the board
  i drive drunk often im good at it   fact i can drive better drunk than you can sober  its almost like a video game its so fun sober driving is so boring but its so immersive when i have to triple check look everywhere oh shit did i use my turn signal accidentally drove home drunk on the highway without my headlights because it was a new car and i forgot how to turn them on old car    love it will continue doing it be warned i got a 3 day ban from all boards from /o/ of all places because apparently encouraging illegal behavior is now against the rules right after i made my drunk driving thread  tips and tricks  keep a medium size bottle of listerine in your glove compartment you dont have to use it but you do have to open it and pour some out  dont think you can just do it from the start it requires practice drive buzzed drive tipsy with a friend in a quiet parking lot and see if you can park different ways within 8 seconds  signal always even if no one is around even while sober it gets you into the habit so some cop at the end of the month wont be using you for his quota signaling should be automatic
  you dont have to use it but you do have to open it and pour some out  wat
hmm ive driven drunk many times i actually delivered pizzas while perpetually drunk on the job every day you always get the dui when you least expect it i got off the job and picked up some food for my gf and i she asked me to park down the street from her house to wait until her step dad left for his graveyard shift he didnt like me going over too late anyways i passed out in my car and woke up to a cop knocking on my window that shit fucked up my life for a good 2 years even for the first one never driving drunk again completely not worth it 0/10 experience
  so what happened    you lost your license for a year had high insurance premiums when you started driving again    what else
  keep a medium size bottle of listerine in your glove compartment you dont have to use it but you do have to open it and pour some out  
  not him but losing your license for a year is a big deal especially for a delivery guy there goes a whole year of wages your employment options from there are then limited to shit within walking distance and shit close to public transport then after a year struggling for survival making 11 bucks an hour flipping burgers you get kicked in the nuts again by your massively increased insurance rates
  lost liscense for a year car impounded two weeks house arrest one year probation weekly alcohol tests you have to pay for with dudes literally watching you piss if you fail dayweek jail time 80 hours of weekly therapy classes you have to pay for madd panel insurance through the roof 2 years ignition interlock 80 a month about 1000 dollars in court fines overall it really is around 10000 just awful and thats for the 1st i hear the second is doubly bad a third is a felony
  thinks drinking is only for seeing friends or meeting girls  im not saying youre necessarily underage but i am saying youre 19 20 max
  not to mention i obviously lost my job and my family hated me for awhile with having to take me to all the bullshit probation and therapy appointments it really just wrecks your dignity and self confidence
  good you got what you deserve for being a retard i have no sympathy
  bro ive fucking killed people because of that stupid thinking  yea yeah it was just a few drinks nothing i cant handle  boom i killed a mom i was 17 i went to jail i spent a long time gone pissed away my life im an older man now i like cooking i work for a furniture shop as a mover they gave me a chance a few years ago i appreciate it i keep to myself never drink but dont have friends to drink with anyhow   change your ways son  you dont want to do what i did  can you think of children having to grow up without a mother for a completely avoidable reason can you sleep easily  i can fuck that bitch id kill her again she was my ex and i never had to see my dumb ass kids again
  not him but youre starting to sound like an alcoholic
  no way 37 minimum
  based
  that was my first post chief
  fuck that bitch  exactly
  i can except that it was pretty stupid what is was doing im sure most adults have driven drunk at some point in their lives i just fucked up by becoming addicted to it and doing it every day to feel sober and drive safely without going through withdrawal its behind me though i learned my lesson happy i never hurt anyone
  like pottery
  can you think of children having to grow up without a mother for a completely avoidable reason can you sleep easily  i can fuck that bitch id kill her again she was my ex and i never had to see my dumb ass kids again  based redpilled and high iq 150
  really depends on the state first time offender here and im looking at probation and community service selling my car so i dont have to deal with insurance or interlock i can lyft and instacart everything and i dont need my car for work
  im sorry anon i didnt mean it
  this is 4channel please stop posting drumpfs penis
  im 32 nothing wrong with coming home for a couple of beers or a little bourbon and relaxing but booze is a major social thing sitting at home and getting plastered because its cheaper is clearly much worse than going out for friendship and women

    not the listeranon but its basically a boozy airfreshener meant to confuse the nostrils of a curious cop
  not worth a dwi my dude  t got a dwi
  i dont know what to tell you chief drinking alone is not a good habit
  thats sus as hell though if i was a cop and i smelled listerine which has a very distinctive smell in a car on a traffic stop i would know for sure that he was trying to hide the smell of booze
  actually driving to where you gonna be drinking  for what purpose you know youre gonna get blitzed and not be driving why leave your car there do you also drive yourself to the airport and waste money on parking your car there for a week when you go on vacation
  you dont go on vacations you wagecuck stop pretending
only drink once a week  once i start i cannot stop black out every single time  its like a fucking switch is flipped in my mind once i have that first taste do i just need to quit
  the first step is admitting you have a problem
  had a simillar expereince with my new car taking turns way too fast while completely loaded  ended up taking out a telephone pole   how the hell did you get out of it without a dui though
  you need to drink less but more often
  blacking out is the worst part of drinking that is if you didnt kill someone  at least change the amount
  yeah i can do that my moms an alcoholic and i love drinking i can put two and two together and say i was fucked from the start    i do not like drinking during the week i do not need the calories and even then i am sure i will over indulge
  thats the thing once i get a buzz going i have to keep going
    how do you get drunk decide to do something fucking stupid and not expect something bad to happen even if im piss drunk i still have a voice of reason in the back of my head letting me know what is and isnt a shitty move if youre driving drunk but paying attention and dont decide to do some le crazy epic driving shit youll probably be fine
  im like this i can go months without drinking no problem at all one sip of alcohol and im taking it way too far
  more than that having a dui on your record basically bans you from international travel unless you like going to shitholes
  it can be cultural if everyone in your country grew up drinking as a child then they are going to drive drunk most of the time they do not have accidents because they are so used to it happens in puerto rico all the time tourists are the ones who crash when they drink and drive drinking is viewed differently in different cultures
  only canada afaik
    hes under the delusion that taking a swig of listerine is going to trick a breathalyzer machine or the cop using it
  it sounds unbelievable but its true  when i arrived back at my car with my moms 4x4 it was only 3/4 mile from home 2am and there was no way i could get it out of the ditch by myself so i left it on the side of the road real close to the state route 33 in west virginia i also left a note for my mom to wake me up when she reads it  that i wrecked my car  within a half hour my step dad helped me get it back to the driveway   20 seconds later a state trooper turns on our road and looks at us as were looking at the damage he passed us by and seen no wreck which someone called in most likely it could be seen from the state route and he never came back  i bent the frame up in that old vwfox a great car with brand new tires gone  i was not extremely drunk 45 coldones
  1 is too many and 1000 is never enough
  buy only a sixpack  go to bed when youve finished it  wew so hard  or just switch to weed instead
  you got lucky  mine was on a busy road and cops were on me in minutes
  it happens when you dont have a realistic choice wanna watch football after work not enough time to drive home and catch an uber plan on going for a quick drink and it turns out youre having a great time oops didnt leave the car at home because i thought this was going to suck
  tried that last friday ended up justifying drinking room mates rum
  yeah pretty much
  more countries than you think basically all the good ones
  thats just you being a cunt   stop being a cunt
  so what do we do quit god i love getting drunk but if i cant control it i have to quit
  damn lucky  i should mention the car sat all night ma didnt read the note until 8am  and i know if i wasnt trying to have too much fun on those curves i would have a perfect drunk driving record
  i used to have that problem but it sort of just went away by my late 20s maybe its a d developmental thing
  having a dui on your record basically bans you from international travel  how would that even work like logistically
  i mean im 25 and i was like this at around 21 but it went away now its back
  not only did my siss bud tara die from a drunk driver but my same aged uncle died of drinking his liver dead   im the same way when i do get drinkin too much whole bottle of captain black out  i just hate blacking out not being in control so i dont drink often if at all   maybe you need a new drug
  i have a totally weird attitude towards it i never drink the day before i have to work or the days that i am working if im off the next day i get so fucked up its like im a fraternity pledge i like to think i have a unique sort of functional alcoholism
  its always interesting to ctrlh in the morning and see what i was ranting about the night before
  i fucking hate the blackouts so much i am always the one who gets the most fucked up and needs to bait out what the last two hours of my saturday night was about
  you arent mad at me  why  you know because of last night  what do you mean  you know that thing i did  oh yeah that was pretty funny but you took it too far    just fucking tell me what i did

adults guide to drinking outside of the home    figure out how long youre going to be there  if its a sort of thing that could end at any time drink only beer at a reasonable rate i cant get drunk from beer unless i try so i just keep my intake at a social level  if youre going to be there a while get trashed but keep track of time  make sure to drink water  if youre there for more than 3 hours or so eat food even if its just a sandwich or peanuts/pretzels  drink more water faggot that aint enough  even if youre socially retarded you can easily recognize when the night starts dying down  the first couple of lightweights/i have to be up in the morning types leave first maybe finish your last drink around then depending on how much how long and of what youre drinking  you may not want to seem like a fag that has a strict cutoff so nurse that last drink as long as you feel comfortable and again drink water  unless youre getting blitzed in public which is fucking retarded both fiscally and socially you can usually recover from almost any amount of alcohol in about 90 minutes  eg you know the bars shutting down at 200 and its 1245 maybe do a shot and get another beer but nurse that beer and start drinking water    ive driven drunk countless amounts of time and not just tipsy but straight up blackout one eye open my innermonologue is slurring and that whole bottle is gone drunk    hell drunk driving is actually really fun so long as im alone on the roads    it was definitely something i did in my early 20s but now it terrifies me    dont get me wrong im completely confident in my driving ability especially after just having a couple beers with a friend but the paranoia of being pulled over actually affects me more than the alcohol again im a massive drunk unless i try beer cannot get me inebriated    at the same time if i surpass a certain threshold which doesnt happen anymore drunk driving is fantastic
  sleeping at other peoples houses can be pretty comfy depending on the person of course  observe their nightly routine  observe their idiosyncracies  get up and eat breakfast together
  how hanging gutting or electrocution i cant get a gun so thats not an option
  tldr drink to keep up but dont overdo it and just fucking wait before you start driving    theres a legal limit for a reason if you feel too drunk just kill some time if youre out in public getting drunk youre likely with some people that you can socialize with so burn a fag and talk about conspiracy theories until youre legally sober enough to pilot your car    ill never understand the stupid fuckers that go out to a bar get completely trashed to the point of falling over and fighting random people and then immediately decide to try and drive home    like seriously the difference between you going home mostly safe and sound versus you getting into a fight with a policeman is like 75 minutes that you could have easily spent bullshitting with friends or at worst loitering around the bar smoking a few cigarettes or whatever    fucking retarded man

  he said he enjoyed driving skunked and thinks hes not drunk when hes drinking beer which means he doesnt even know when hes over the limit your summary is not accurate
  hope you catch a dui before you kill someone op eat shit and die subhuman
  unironically neck yourself faggot
i got into an accident earlier this year at 730 am after drinking wine all night i rearended a guy then a few weeks ago i was drinking my 12th beer on the way home and clipped someones parked car just two blocks from my house my car was so fucked up the passenger door wouldnt open i didnt bother to go back and look at the damage i did to the other vehicle   in both situations things more or less worked out for me no cops involved but they were still minor pains for me to deal with just makes me think about how awful a dui would be even if i didnt hit anyone ive been drunk driving pretty successfully for a few years now but this year with those two incidents kinda woke me up to the reality of what i was doing i dont want to do the time so i dont do the crime and i just drink at home and walk around if i wanna get out of the house
  youre a moron and youre endangering other people for no real reason
is she right about british food
  someday it will be accepted that gordon ramsay and anthony bourdain were black men
  yes
  oh shit its the quintessentially british girl
  didnt read the caption and realize that it was this nigger she shouldnt be saying shit about food after that embarrassing cake she made for that old ass queen over there
    brown  check  muslim  check  pussy  check    she can say anything she wants and they will all still try to eat her shit and plaster the quotes as headlines she has the trifecta of pc invincibility
  i think her point was that british food has been influenced by all the countries they came into contact with and there isnt much thats 100 british but thats true of all countries that arent totally isolated and was a really stupid way of saying it
    a non british muslimong telling the world that the word british is more diverse than youd think this is what is wrong with the world
        it does exist but britain expanded its reach for ingredients 100s of years ago and have been able to enjoy a variety of dishes for decades meanwhile her relatives are still eating chickens out the back yard with the same 10 spices every single day
    prove
  pretty much  british food is more just stuff on a plate ie full english breakfast
  she is just projecting
you could say the same thing about italian food  or even moreso any middle eastern/mediterranean/eastern european food each country may have a couple specialties but almost all of the dishes are the same from country to country  this bitch is bangladeshi their food isnt any different from india or pakistan  i cant stand her personality honestly she seems like a creep and the show seemed obviously rigged  gross
  asian muslim  shes just a sand nigger not even an indo or something who happens to be muslim what a fucking disgrace this is as cringe as the indians calling themselves asians
  white chef proclaims african food doesnt exist  career ruined  worldwide riots  its all so tiring
  idk what criteria you are going with here but i consider people from bangladesh pretty much muslim indian seems more currified than west pakistan from what little i know
me me me    look at me    look    at    m  e    my skin brown    my opinion     listen to me    me brown
  indians arent asians
  you could say that about literally every cuisine around the world but nobody says chinese cuisine doesnt exist or mexican cuisine etc this is just more multiculturalist propaganda to destroy british identity
  kinda funny came here because i felt like /pol/ lead me more racist than i like myself just to find /ck/ being /pol/ with shitty food
  polniggers raid a board and ruin it  yep
  4chan was never racist before /pol/  you sure got it all figured out being here since 2016 and all
  i never said that you retarded polnigger this board just wasnt littered with retarded polniggers like you before this year
  casual racism has been a part of every board since day one you underage dope  omg a racist comment in every 50th thread  its a le /pol/ invasion  calm your tits lady
  not him but im a retarded polnigger and have been on /ck/ since about 2011
  casual racism has been a part of every board since day one you underage dope  i never said otherwise you retarded nigger maybe if you werent a triggered newnigger faggot youd comprehend that you half aborted trogdolytes have progressively killed this board     pol invasion   thats because youre a retarded polnigger white knighting your awful board and shitting up this one
  why is every polnigger such a retarded inbred read
  his go to insult is to insinuate that the person hes replying to is a /pol/nigger  this is how i know youre either underage or extremely new to this website its probably both nowadays
  my parents arent even from the same race or continent
  sstop calling me names  go back to your containment board you fucking half breed nigger
  i think ill stay i have some polnigger friends im going to invite over as well i think theyll like this place )))
  polnigger humor  cringe
  she thinks im joking
  i didnt say you were unfortunately your parents didnt smother you long enough as a toddler so your reading is very poor    polniggers are so fucking milquetoast
  embarrassing post
its another retards getting worked up over a clickbait headline episode    i dont know whether i hate the media or the worked up brainlets more at this point does no one bother to read past headlines these days
  were just having fun stop taking it so seriously mr reddit spacing
  reddit spacing  only redditors say this
britain has a magpie culture which is not necessarily a bad thing there has been a revival of older cooking trends going back centuries but much of our food culture is shaped by our island nature and imperial past
  magpie
  im a redditor and i dont say that
  magpies like to steal things britain being a state that has invaded and been invaded tends to absorb aspects of many other cultures

anyone here ever made baked brie tips or tricks
  its really not hard     just dont take it out if a bit starts oozing out it doesnt always mean its done yet the inside is probably still not melted
never did it but i like watching/listening chef johns recipe 
dont buy cheap bread to dip in only big fat breadloaf
you might say im uncool you might say im unhip but for me its the tangy zip of miracle whip
its my favorite for cold cut sandwiches and blts but dukes for the rest
  my mom thinks its too spicy i know shes a walking white boomer meme
you might call me crazy  might not understand my ways  but miraclewhip is straightup shit  compared to mayonnaise
  
  absolutely unironically disgusting and haram kys now
    video related
    you shut your whore mouth you will never make a decent potato salad without this nectar of the fattie gods
for me its the mayonnaise with lime heres one of my favorite use for it    bread  pic related   ketchup  its a really nice tangy flavor that makes my spit glans go apeshit
  that really makes me crave a whip sammy
  how does this shit taste like i never had miracle whip since its not available in stores here
my mom thought that miracle whip was just a high end mayo brand i never liked cold cut sandwiches until i moved out and bought a bottle of actual mayo in college
  for me its always miracle whip it is superior to mayonnaise in every way  taste texture smell any time id usually get mayonnaise id rather have mw tuna sandwiches and deviled eggs and potato/egg/chicken salad especially ill fight you mayofags till my dying breath over this

i get the squirts for a week after only one glass but damn do i love eggnog whats your favorite recipe
i like to dip my penis in the family nog jug 
  sounds chilly
  yeah egg nog is my im gonna have diarrhea but dont care because its so good guilty pleasure
    imagine being so elderly and infirm that you get the shits from egg and rum
baltimore eggnog circa 1882    into a metal shaker add    1 egg discard shell  1 teaspoon cinnamon freshly grated  1 oz heavy cream  2 teaspoons superfine sugar not powdered  1 oz christian brothers sacred bond bonded pot still brandy   1/2 oz wray  nephew white overproof rum  1/2 oz blandys 5year verdelho madeira wine    dry shake to emulsify ingredients  fill 3/4 full with ice  shake for at least 10 seconds to chilldilute and aerate  fine strain into chilled 7oz goblet  grate a good amount of fresh nutmeg on top  sprinkle a small amount of mace optional
  go oz yourself
  discard shell  xd
  drinking that much high fat dairy will make anyone shit their brains out
  i much prefer it alcohol free still good that way dont get me wrong i love booze but theres something about eggnog
  i like eggnog but i always end up not drinking a carton of it i legitimately just cleaned out my fridge 3 days ago and threw out a carton from last christmas
  anyone with crippling lactose intolerance and a severely weakened sphincter from too much buttsex maybe
  i just chugged half a carton of it and have had the most disgusting farts since i drink dairy daily without consequence too
  evidently not
  getting farts from lactose  yeah youre lactose intolerant soyboy
  you dont believe someone on 4chan is telling you the truth im shocked
  id say its more getting dyspeptic from drinking 3000 calories of egg/cream slurry
  half a cartoon is roughly 725 calories youd need to drink 2 litres to hit 3000 calories
  the alcohol especially higher proof will make the raw eggs safer to drink but if you want to try that recipe without it maybe substitute 2 oz of whole milk for the alcohol
  just looked at my container 230 calories per serving 16 servings per container half of the carton would be 1840 calories     ill give it a whack why not
  how large is the container
  the standard half gallon milk container
  thats big cartons are only 1 litre in my country i still suspect youre a soyboy though
  its 2 litres anon im not a soyboy but i dont care if you think i am
  clearly you do soycuck
  it seems like you do
    i also own a nintendo switch i enjoy playing games on it
  case closed then
  indeed
  disgusting fuckin nigger probably dips his weewee in the chili too      post your recipe
  i can drink that much and not a single shit will come out fag

what are some major food related crimes/contaminated food scandals in your country
there was that huge comerica park scandal last year
publix will often price things like 3 for 6 but if you buy a single item its still just 2
someone raped 2 boys chopped them up and served them in his restaurant to get rid of the bodies the kids were missing for weeks and the townspeople didnt even realize they were eating the kids
there is currently a cdc ban on all romaine products in the us grocers and restaurants are putting up signs saying no romaine    how is that a scandal its a good thing
  it dupes consumers into thinking they have to buy more of something if they want to get a good deal i dont personally care because i know how it works but it feels a little scummy to me

  italy is notorious for exporting diluted olive oil
  i dont doubt that it happens but source of it being a widespread issue
  a lot of it is named and packaged to look italian but actually isnt so you need to be sure its not some fake pretenditalian lowquality product  on top of that not all olive oil made in italy is top quality so among the italian ones you need to make sure its one of the good ones  so a lot of people use the subpar ones and dont know about the real deal

  chopped veggies dont contain anything else than the veggies if you meant freezed ones those are actually better than if youd be buying them fresh and freeze them after that yourself because these companies use industrial methods for freezing fast temperature reduction aka flash freezing what you most certainly can but dont do at home
there was a person who died eating plastic rice imported from china apparently there were lethal levels of lead in the plastic
  chopped veggies dont contain anything else than the veggies    foods dont need to contain other stuff to be considered processed a bag of just apple slices are considered processed because they were sliced fuck bottle water is considered processed if it was ran thru a filter even most apples in most places are processed because the have a wax coating most foods are processed
  but you do realize the difference in the level of processedness between eg processed meat products and flash frozen veggies no

 japanese vending machines   very huge variety of cold drinks and food even cooked food      american vending machines   chips soda water gum pretzels frozen food that you must microwave    are japanese people based
  no theyre racists and homogeneous countries are bad
  their vending machines are pretty cool they dont have a lot of vandals so they can count on them not being trashed
  theres a vending machine at my school that serves hot drinks its pretty cool
  that machine doesnt dispense ramen you enter you money and selection and tt gives you a ticket which you take over to the counter
  putting spaces after the   what the fuck is wrong with /ck/ posters
do they just use these as an antisocial way of getting food or is it a way of getting food after hours    they dont exist here because theres enough availability of around the clock restaurants that you wouldnt eat trash food from a restaurant even fast food is likely better than what horrors probably fill that thing and people would shut them down for sanitation issues in a heartbeat
  theyre for japanese businessmen who get maybe 4 hours of free time and cant be fucked to cook their own meals
  so a coffee machine any country has that
  most vending machines charge you like 6 for a tiny crappy burger or meal they are over priced worse than fast food yet people think theyre really neet because theyre autistic
  i got a coffee can with an evangelion figure from a vending machine in japan it was cool a bit overpriced but cool
  this    though this ham and cheese didnt seem like a huge ripoff definitely needs more ham but damn thats a decent amount of bread and cheese and real mustard actually considering the fucking size of the bread thats a decent amount of ham  
  asocial  antisocial would be actively antagonistic
most vending machines only do drinks the food ones are actually somewhat uncommon in my experience they do have a crazy number and they are owned by different companies so the contents and prices vary a lot okinawan lifeguard and chikwasa drinks are the goats
    see   these are used in the front of food stores to take orders as an electronic waiter it then gives you tickets which you give to the cook
  this but unironically
  actually thinking you receive your food instantly  thinking a machine actually cooks your fresh food

  they dont have a lot of niggers so they can count on then not being trashed  japan sounds like heaven
  japanese vending machine  produces a small ticket    american vending machine  produces actual food
  i said americans not leftists
  lived in japan for 12 years   you can get almost anything in vending machines except snacks like chips and chocolate   hot and cold drinks alcohol dress shirts neck ties disposable cameras batteries usb stick glass bottles of work hot food like fries fried chicken pasta and soup     but gaijin you wan chocorate bar go home filthy gaijin pig
  glass bottles of work  huh
  but gaijin you wan chocorate bar go home filthy gaijin pig  i got chocolate from 711 or family mart when i wanted it their selection is pretty shit but i ate a lot of chocolate macadamias in red boxes those were good
  
  japanese vending machines are meh ops image is a ticket vending machine it doesnt give you the food you just buy a voucher that you hand to the cook to make your food
  damn i knew you guys were weaboos but holy shit
  hey shinichi marry me so i can get a green card for weebland

  lol
  they dont have a lot of vandals    not being enriched will do that
  i remember hearing on in a video by vox on youtube once that the japanese love automation use cash for just about everything and have sky high labor costs which altogether causes such machines to be so extremely widespread compared to everywhere else
  vox
  i know i was bored that morning and awfully hungover
  you make it sound like the food literally comes out of the vending machine those things just give you a ticket and you give them to someone nearby to make your order    but yes the drink vending machines are the best in the world over there
  i always got some looks at family mart when i stopped in for 6 giant beers and a tube of pringles i think they were a little jealous of my big american robustness
          it comes from the machine
  that might be the case but like 90 of machines that look like that just print you a ticket you give to a cook
  stratocaster
  yes i should have noted that a tiny portion of them do dispense food most of them however like the one in ops pic do not

  how does the one that comes with a beer check age id or is that not required in japan
  oh fuck of stupid bootlicker
  if its anything like the cigarette vending machines you had to swipe a national id
  fuck the vending machines i wish we had their 7elevens        
  ive only visited japan a few times but their 7/11s are so much better than anything id ever imagined i always brought back a bag of dessicated sea creature or some other bizarre food for my friends
  theres some id checking mechanism if you are a gaijin/forgot id theres a button that calls to a remote attendant that checks you or your passport from the camera installed in the vending machine
  when i bought smokes from a machine the front desk clerk at the hotel just swiped her id for me so i didnt experience it first hand but i got the idea
  japanology
    japanology   based
  when i was a little kid we had those in the states theyre was no id checking there some sjw cunts got offended and those kind of machines got removed a friend and i when kids used one of those machines once it was at some hotel in florida and we were like lets try out some smokes   we pooled our money and got a pack smoked them in about an hour and never used the machine again it was something to do during a boring summer
  i remember those days when i started smoking it was 125 a pack and the machines where you had to put 5 quarters in the tray and pull the plunger out were everywhere then we moved to the ones where some person had to check your id and flip a switch to turn it on now you can buy all sorts of pot and chop your dick off but god help you if you have a smoke
  yeah now that you mention it im remembering those quarter trays and the plungers that was hilarious

  japan has turned their culture into a sideshow attraction instead of the main focus
  nonid vending machines are very rare nowadays there still was one in some remote village in germany i go to visit each year but it has now been converted too that shit never works in my own countries let alone abroad the scanning mechanism never works they used to have an intermediate step here in the netherlands with a socalled age coin because every modern government policy here in nl needs an english name just because you have to get at the bar where in theory the bartender would check your id but everyone just put a small bowl of those coins on top of the machine defeating the purpose so its now being phased out         reminds me of one of those vending machines in the village center which didnt have a change system so the owners wife hand taped a nickle to each pack of cigarettes so people could insert whole guilders         made me kek out loud too

there are people on this board who dont think golden oreos are superior to original oreos in every way
  golden oreos more like golden showers golden showers of peeright in your mouth
  are you sure /ck/ is a very sophisticated type of anons since they changed the channel  they need to make these into a breakfast cereal too
regular oreos are garbage since having golden i cant go back its opposite of that saying love those things and love you op
  oreos are terrible because they crowd out more obscure cookies on supermarket shelves
  i just buy the minis and pour milk into a bowl put 5 or so minis in the bowl and eat with spoon way better than a cereal would be
mother only buys oreo thins now  kill me
oreos arent original

who has the kfc original recipe recipe  only post it if youve tried it and its the real deal
nobody even kfc itself doesnt know they just use a lot of msg and rely on the fact that people who remember the original are either dead or devoid of tastebuds
sure here it is  flour  salt    the end please dont tell anyone the real secret is just cooking it in a pressure fryer though
  99x from marionkay  its hard to duplicate the coating due to kfc using pressurecooker frying but the flavor is 100 original recipe
  based      bluepilled
  stophatingboomers
  i worked in a kfc as a kid the secret ingredient is salt im serious for every on bag of seasoning we added another similiar sized bag of salt if you forget to put in the seasoning you ended up with off color tasteless but still well fried chicken if you forgot to put the salt the chicken would fuck up massively and be inedible you can put any herbs you fuckin want in fried chicken but you need a tonne of fucking salt
  thank god ive never eaten at kfc
  the secret ingredient is salt  secret  salt is an obvious ingredient that everyone knows is in it and whose exact content can be easily tested  kfc shills out in full damage control  no no goy its not the trade secret herbs and spices that are secret  its the salt trust me
  the real secret is kosher salt
4 cups flour 5 tsp salt and 2 tbls 99x
  you can add whatever herbs you want in and make it taste better than kfc kfc chicken is way too fucking mild for anything but the most white of palates but if you skip the salt its fucked people seriously have no idea how much salt goes into kfcs chicken when i was learning to make fried chicken in cooking class we never used that much salt and i never see anyone use so much salt in online videos or the like  but i guess the pressure cookers they use also factor in
  the secret is those industrial machines they use its basically an unholy hybrid of a deep fat fryer and a pressure cooker  you cant really get the same result without it sorry
    this is actually very true the saddest thing about colonel sanders life is that towards the end he watched his legacy die as he sold his recipe over to corporate folk who made the company grow too fast and employees were too poorly trained to recreate the original recipe he spent the end of his days traveling to various locations and cursing them out walking into kitchens and dumping their food out for now following his recipe properly ive definitely heard stories of old timers saying how early kfc chicken was god tier compared to the slop they serve today
  not following
  you can add whatever herbs you want in and make it taste better than kfc  op is asking specifically about kfc original recipe you colossal offtopic faggot  no idea how much salt  nacl content is trivial to measure and the proportions are by weight  flour 85  salt 10  herbsspices 5
  im trying to improve ops life by encouraging him to make better flavor choices  and being trivial to measure doesnt mean everyones measured how much salt is in those disgusting greasy buckets i mean its trivial to make your own fried chicken that tastes good but people still keep going back to kfc
  i worked at kfc years ago too we didnt add extra salt     the secret seasoning came in its own brown bag you would mix it with flour in a big bin then you dunk the chicken in water toss around in the flour then put in cages to be fried in a pressure cooker
  quality control at kfc went to shit years ago which is why many people want to know how to recreate the flavor when its done right at home
  iirc i have an alleged list of it sans le sekrit hidden ingredient probably msg on my laptop ill be able to get to it in about 15 minutes to check
  secret is suppose to be white pepper  
  noone actually likes original though   make their hot n spicy recipe instead
  crack  sip  ahh  yep they dont make mommies like this anymore

for me its the beyond meat burger only available at your local aw go try one right now unironically tastes good
for me its saying fuck off to shills and saging my replies to their shitty threads
  its a 4channel world now buddy
i honestly dont care if something is meat or some sort of substitute as long as it tastes good im down for it
based thread
  if only they didnt charge extra to switch the burger patty to this
  the most egregious of shilling going on here nothing subtle about this
  i have no sense of taste  the thread
it wasnt too bad its for sure not meat and doesnt taste like it at all but it was still alright    the veganfags telling you that their meat substitute tastes exactly like meat are lying to you and themselves
  im not vegan and it tasted like meat to me i enjoyed it more than their actual meat burgers
im down for a veggie burger once in a while but id rather not eat fake meat bullshit bean burgers or vegetable burgers are tastier not even a vegetarian btw
  beet burgers do not taste like meat burgers at all youre a complete liar if you claim it tastes anything like meat they have the texture of meat but thats it they are good though
  holy frck  vegans btfo
  i dont care if it tastes the same it really hits that fast food itch though like no other vegan food ive had
  i dunno maybe its the flavoring they did with it
  pickles and onion on the bottom    what the fuck is beyond meat burgers problem
plant tumor burger  ill just gnaw on my oaks gnarls if its all the same to you chaps
  theyre not made of beets
  for me its –±y—Çep–±po–¥  
meat is objectively healthier for you though its no wonder so many soylents have carnitine deficiencies these days
  carnitine deficiency     lol must be next to heart attack deficiencies
  cooked on the same grill used to cook meat for the last 30 years
i got one of these and a regualr teen burger to do a side by side comparison     you can definitly taste a difference but i didnt necessarily prefer one over the other  the were bother flavourful real beef was obviously meatier and had more umami but the beyond beef burger was almost more complex with vegetal notes and spices  also if you gave me the beyond beef without saying anything i wouldnt have guessed it wasnt meat    a good burg
im offended by people not eating meat the thread
  holy crap the root beer brand owns a burger chain
  yeah thats my understanding of the beyond burger as well everybody who works at wf with me says its good and they probably wouldnt be able to tell a difference issue is that they cant ramp up production fast enough so its always sold out here id never spend my money on it though but i wouldnt turn my nose up at it    smells heinous when cooked though vegan foods always do but this one smells extra bad i certainly dont work at a big store but i work on the other side and could smell it through the entire fucking store when they cooked some up for samples
  for me its 99sapi9sj394jjrr420
so whats the difference between a honing steel and sharpening stone why should you use one instead of the other is sharpening stone another nip meme
one is for honing the other for sharpening
  you could have just used google to search this retard are you not capable of educating yourself
  how do i do that
enters thread  flexes  leaves thread
  same thing  also  it really is worth it to learn to use a sharpening steel for your knives  recommended techniques are often contradictory with some professionals saying you must swipe the blade towards the steel and others saying you must swipe it away from the steel  given that steeling the knife really only realigns the blade as opposed to sharpening filing off bits of metal the swipe away technique makes more sense and is the one i use
  sharpening stone  sorry misread that as sharpening steel here because you pic shows only steels  
  you know they say that all men are created equal but you look at me and you look at samoa joe and you can see that statement is not true see normally if you go one on one with another wrestler you got a 50/50 chance of winning but im a genetic freak and im not normal so you got a 25 at best at beat me then you add kurt angle to the mix your chances of winning drastic go down see the 3 way at sacrifice you got a 33 1/3 chance of winning but i i got a 66 and 2/3 chance of winning because kurt angle knows he cant beat me and hes not even gonna try  so samoa joe you take your 33 1/3 chance minus my 25 chance and you got an 8 1/3 chance of winning at sacrifice but then you take my 75 chance of winning if we was to go one on one and then add 66 2/3 per cents i got 141 2/3 chance of winning at sacrifice see joe the numbers dont lie and they spell disaster for you at sacrifice
  the swipe away technique makes more sense  yes i too like to swing the sharp tip of a knife near my wrist at every stroke
  honing steel just shapes back the edge tip after it deforms a bit from normal use you cant fix chips and other big problems youd use one regularly with your knife    a sharpening stone removes metal in a big area at once you grind your knife a new edge basically if you really wanted to you could start from a blunt rod and finish with a sharp blade
there are different types of steels professional smooth or microgrooved steels f dick for instance just realign and straighten an already sharp edge that has gotten bent from heavy use the ordinary grooved steels you can buy in shops or that come with knife sets work more like files they tear off tiny bits of the bent edge and create something that looks more like a saw than an edge under a microscope over time they will also fuck up the profile of you knife over time so use a smooth or microgrooved steel when those dont work satisfactorily anymore it is tme for a session on the stones if you cant afford those grind the grooves of your cheap steel smooth with fine sandpaper
  all the oval rods are diamond sharpening rods a pure honing rod is uncoated stainless steel    sharpening rods do work but just like stones its hard to keep your angle consistent also they clog faster than a stone
honing steels arent good for most higher end kitchen knives now    old fashioned kitchen knives used to have soft edges which would literally roll and could be unrolled by honing todays kitchen knives dont roll but chip and require resharpening to restore
  that is the exact opposite of the swipe away technique
  based big poppa pump
as long as you kniife has an edge that is only lightlyy rolled and/or lightly dulled the unglazed rim on the underside of a ceramic plate works pretty well for restoring an edge too
  knife fag who cant cook here  a sharpening steel is meant to maintain an edge thats already there you do it after you use the knife to keep it from going dull if your knife is already dull you need to use a stone to get the edge back honing steels hone the edge sharpening stones sharpen it there are sharpening rods also but desu its better just to use a stone or if you hate sharpening an actual system
  sharpening steel  meant honing steel

a study on highschool italian males finds increased exposure to pfoa and pfos in water also found in nonstick pans caused subjects to have a smaller penis and a decrease in total and viable sperm  in particular subjects from the exposed group showed significantly lower mean testicular  volume and shorter penile length and agd malformed sperm disease also crowntopubis and pubistofloor distances differed   
  pfoa and pfos  those are industrial flame retardants you retard
highschoolers  wtf europe literal penis inspection days
most fluoride and chloride chemistry was a mistake
  genx is probably going to cause a lot of similar problems and that is the replacement for producing teflon pans the molecule breaks apart relatively quickly in your blood and then the fragments disappear ie accumulate in your tissue recent evidence points to genx being worse than pfoa so thats nice        imo its looking like we will have to make a huge dollar change in how we perform chemistry world wide and everyone is dragging their feet this is cfc ban scale shit

  mostly too late to make major changes after birth hell need testosterone and/or gonadotrophin injections during infancy unfortunately the only way you get doctors to shoot your kid up with hormones without medical necessity is if you want to turn him into a fucked up tranny not to give him a porn star dick    that said if you do want to do it with diet anything which increases testosterone and which increases his adult height  so raw onions and milk
  good shit anon i do have access to testosterone but i dont know about the drawbacks i would assume that you get it from an outsider source your body will get lazy about producing it ill shove some onions in that fucker though

  those chips look so golden and crunchy  why are chips in real life never like these
  those chips are rubbish mate
  trolling or seething  id kill for those fries
  wheres the beer lads
  beer not needed if visiting family in water orton
  coca cola  needs irn bru
  looks the dogs nackers that
    avoid any place that offers triple cooked chips or other such nonsense chip shop chips should be squidgy and soft a few crispy ones is good but on the whole they should be soft    i also enjoy a battered sausage and saveloy with my fish and chips get those    and of course dont forget some pickled onions
  i agree they look too dry
  you having any curry sauce lad
fish and chips near the seaside  godlike    fish and chips elsewhere  its ok i guess
  fish and chips is the most awful dish in english cooking  why would you ruin a good fishs by overcooking it and covering it up in batter oil and malt vinegar
  jap walk on
  isnt your entire country near the seaside
i had fish and chips last night a lovely filletofish from mcdonalds it was pretty tasty would recommend
with fish  chips does it really matter if its fresh water or from the ocean
dont forget to ask for scraps lad
  make sure you get the right vinegar for your meal not the vinegar from crude oil underground
  the indian and pakistani version of fish and chips mostly for muslim consumers are very often made from fish from freshwater areas
    curry sauce thats sacrilege needs mushy peas gravy and swimming in vinegar
  why not just deep fry it in vinegar
    if your going to a uk chippy most will offer cod or haddock or even plaice in some posher shops those are the go to fish really but i seen some indian places trying to use basa instead
i have one thing to say about fish and chips every time ive gone to a fish and chips shop that had a long menu with many different types of fish and ordered the cheapest fish they have it was always shit it didnt matter what the fish was it was always terrible on the other hand when i ordered a fish that was a few dollars more expensive it was always great    theres a place in my home town that only has 3 types of fish on their menu cod halibut and salmon and theyre all amazing its really pricy though and the line ups are hell
    whats the typical price there for fish and chips a typical every day chippy in the uk can cost about 280 for a fish about 120 for chips these are like the real chippies people use in typical towns and not gimmick chippies in tourist hot spots charging like 15 for fish     some chippies can ask 57 for fish though if they are award winning this is fish and chips from one of my local chippies/restaurants which charges 950 for chips peas and jumbo cod comes with tartar sauce and a lemon wedge they won chippy of year award few years back went from being a little shop which was barely more than a serving hatch to a full blown restaurant in about 10 years raking in big money
  it looks good but seems small  do they offer portions for men
fish and chips shop near the sea  so you get that gish from the sea right guys  nah its frozen from country on the other side of the globe /i dunno bro  every time
    theres a place near me that offers 10 for all you can eat fish and chips pollock is it worth it
    sounds great id just keep getting the fish and have a few chips for variety eat your fill    speaking of pollock they had a weird campaign in one of the uk supermarkets several years ago for pollock as its a very unpopular fish and no one asks for it their reckoning was that the name sounds silly and rude making it unpopular so for like a year  instead of calling it pollock they called it colin
  here in canada i havent really seen real chippies like i did in the uk and australia/nz although i havent been to the east coast of canada which is more british influenced i believe and might by more likely to have those    we have a lot of sit down fish and chip places and food trucks though you can see a typical menu here   
  oi lads me gonna getty some fishy and some chippies oy love me deep froyed fishy wishy and chippy whippies     eat real food you fat retarded anglo animals you eat even worse than american and canadians
  mushy peas is better
  you should have some other vegetables greens at the very least but a variety would be better
  vancouver pls go
  only 280 for fish  found the northerner
  i though that battered sausages would be awful but theyre pretty damn good  prefer hp with them rather than curry sauce though
    battered sausage is awesome so long as its fresh and the batter is still nice and crispy also recommend a spam fritter
  who the hell eats fish and chips with a knife and fork
  avoid any place that offers triple cooked chips or other such nonsense chip shop chips should be squidgy and soft  this a couple of belgian fries places have popped up in my town and the chips are so crispy and overdone that they are practically hollow in the middle terrible  my town has two or three award winning chippies though so its all good
  youre never more than an hour from coast by car thats true but near the seaside means you know actually on the beach
  youre hopeless
    jesus im paying 450 for a fish in a noname midlands town unless i go for a shitty minifish    fish and chips in a sit down restaurant are always smaller in my experience from a proper take away youd be looking at more than double that amount of chips with a standard portion
  cole slaw is a thousand times better and the only reason the ukes even serve mashed peas still is because of tradition
  theyre not mashed peas are you really mashing peas and wondering what the fuss is about
  literally everyone its not finger food like tenders
  american here not him but then what the fuck is it
  the chippies round here are lazy fucks they only open for lunch and tea shut up shop at 8pm
  what the fuck is this a pommie thing
    vast majority would only use a fork since chippies only supply a fork its food on the go no need for a knife plus one hand holding one for the fork eliminates the knife if you was having fish and chips in a cafe you may use a knife and fork i guess
    not the guy you were asking but this video explains it pretty well and quickly      the result is a bit more runny than is normal but more or less right
literally zero good places to get fish and chips anymore since all the shops are owned by slants
  looks good probably gonna go to long john silvers tonight
buy a ziplock bag full of pistachios and a 6 pack of beer at the supermarket  having a good time eating nuts and getting shitfaced while watching dumb youtube videos  get to a single pistachio which i pry open but there is no nut inside    how do i go about taking legal action against my local supermarket
huh
  the nut fell to the bottom of the bag
  sure thats what they want you to believe
  was there a nut at the bottom of the bag
  i havent reached the bottom yet its a really big bag
  ive read that certain items like rice and grains cant be 100 cleaned so you might get some rocks when purchasing grain from bagged or bulk bin so you are kind of paying for dead weight either rotten grain or accidental rocks
  let me know when you do they always taste the best imo because theyve been coated in the salt that falls down there too
    you cannot as any supermarket has the option to take unsatisfactory merchadise back for review take it back deal with the looks of dismay at your retardation and enjoy your nut you nut
  by the time i do ill probably be too slammed to post these are are 8 beers
  pussy
  a bowl of pistachios has like 1100 calories enjoy your new gut
  are you responding to the wrong person or are you assuming that because i happen to know that some nuts fall out of their shells and down to the bottom of the bag that i consume a full bowl every time i snack on pistachios why cant op just fish around the bottom of the bag and retrieve that bare nut without having to eat every other nut in the bag   whats with the projecting eating disorder hmm
  did you pay per piece or per weight in the latter scenario you dont have any base to argue
  they are hellishly expensive where i live but i do love them the chile flavored onces were actually worth the gamble tasty
  gets drunk off supermarket 6 pack beer  youre a fucking loser
that one fucking rotten pistachio in every pack
  hes not an alcoholic  yeah what a fucking fag amirite
  eat all the nuts put half of the shells back in the bag and return for a refund saying those were all empty large supermarket chains will refund no questions asked since the customer svc clerks are robotic automatons profit
  dumbass
  for you
like crack but way more expensive
i just made this  grilled eggplants and cheese with garlic and red peppers     watcha ya think
  slop
fookin terrible m8
im gonna make some sloppy joes using pic related because i like it but i was wondering if there are any crazy alternatives or things to add you guys would recommend    thanks
first post
  just 50/50 bbq for a weak knight dinner
    ass is like a sloppy joe
blocks your path
what the fuck is wrong with americans my bros
  flies over it
  bros  that word is inherently american must be a brit if you have no culture of your own to draw from
  chili served cinnci style is fine  what is wrong with you
  obsessed
  lmao
  americans  only 1 state does this
i think all the people who meme about cincinnati chili have either never had are insecure coasties or both its unironically really good
  dunno if you consider this thread meming but i live in cincinnati and yeah its great
  hides your shitty thread
  thanks for the bump
dabs on your faggy imitation
  not parmesan cheese
sister in law from cincinnati  went up to help her and my brother with some shit  went to skyline  got the chili covered wiener  it was sort of runny chilli and i dont like hot dogs  it wasnt bad but 8 dont know how it achieved national meme status  went home  got some nashville hot chicken
  using parmesan on skyline chile has never been doneto my knowledgebut may be good
  
  howd you get it to be green people make fun of me if i try they dont turn green   is this green
  woah neat
  chili cheese fries with cinci chili is amazing
  this isnt from a fly over you fuck its a west coast thing
  cincinnati is in the midwest retard
  kek
  whats with all the shredded carrot
  thats shredded cheddar cheese
  youve never been to a steak and shake this is chili mac on their menu
  nah cheddar is pale yellow not orange
im traveling to cincinnati and nashville for conferences within the next months are skyline chili and hot chicken memes or are they tasty shit    how about the canned skyline chili is it the same shit
  fuck you stay away you faggot californian
  canned isnt as good buying seasoning packets is a better bet but no skyline is not a meme its actually really good shut
  i think anon is implying that its so shitty that its automatically east coast holy shit ive never seen so many canned vegetables dumped into recipes as i did in new england
  then its some secret bullshit cheese
  looks way better than memphis bbq sauce spaghetti
  im in nashville and only recently even heard of nashville hot chicken hattie bs and princes are good tourist choices
the greek pasta dish skyline chili is a riff on is actually good the fact that at skyline the pasta is uniformly overcooked and its served with a mountain of bullshit tier cheese and sometimes other crap on top is what makes it disgusting
  objectively untrue
  then its some secret bullshit cheese
  sure i could fake this but why would i
  devours it
  calls gallatan nashville  cringe    t lived in madison for years
  i used to work in madison very high homeless rate and shit human rate
  that word is inherently american must be a brit if you have no culture of your own to draw from    you typed that in english mate think about it
  its washingtongue asshole english is oi oi m9 alahu ackbar mosque mosque acid stick loicense
  whoa this is how you  imply implications    edit holy shit bump for clarity
  top notch memeing mate you sure showed me lol dont forget tea lol we love tea
  what kind of pasta is this supposed to be
  overcooked spaghetti a greek guy in ohio a century ago came up with his take on a classic greek meat sauce and called it chili because at the time there was a chili craze people liked it and accepted it as chili i dont know when the ridiculous pile of crap tier cheese on top became a thing but it is now
   ive had the pasta 5 way and the coneys but told them to go easy on the cheese i got some dirty looks but it was still good
just looking at this image made me shart
americans are fat
  only way to get the coneys is light cheese extra mustard the 3way is garbage
    5 drinks 47 hotdogs wtf is going on in this pic i have seen it so many times but i cant imagine ordering that much at once
where my nky boys at
  europeons are ugly
  not so bad if you eat chili cheese fries you can eat the cincinnati chili but chili cheese fries are tastier with all the grease fats and salt added
  mate  why are you talking about tea
  top right  someones lactose intolerant
  i bet its a nigger
  that cheese looks like crap but honestly good chilli on noodles with good cheddar sounds pretty good
  im sorry my friend chili belongs over brown rice with parmesan on top
  the only place to get them
i live in new england where we dont eat much cheese why is there a huge pile of it
  i live in the northeast too and i always overdo it with the shredded cheese
  noodles  you dont even know what pasta is you have no right to speak
  arent noodles pasta but pasta isnt necessarily a noodle
  see     its literally just in one city inside of one state only cincinnati serves that and yes its as fucking pathetically disgusting as it looks its taco bell tier shredded cheese on top of midgrade chili ohio fucking sucks
  we dont eat much cheese in new england  where the fuck do you live people eat plenty of cheese here in new england anon pls go
  what are you gonna do about it i already got the flight and hotel paid for    also im from seattle close though
  where in new england i live on the south coast and never see cheese like that i dont see how you would put a bunch of cheese on fish lobster clams etc
  i think its the other way around pasta is noodles but in order to be pasta noodles have to be made with durum wheat
  ohio fucking sucks  kill yourself michigan faggot
  hie toiped thawt een uhmericon moite
  kek
sup /ck/ im buying a gift for my grandmother and she loves jam whats a highquality jam i can purchase to show her my love
make her some jam
  elasun orange marmalade is by far the best ive ever had i think you can mail order it from la tienda
    is this it anon im guessing yes but want to be sure    
  yes
    thanks boo
marmelade with chunky quince  orange with nuts
inna jam is bretty good too desu lots of different flavors so you can get her what she likes
whats /ck/s favorite cereal   ive been skipping breakfast a lot lately because ive been too lazy i think i might get some food in me if i have something easy to eat
  boil some eggs fuck eating all those carbs
  good ol cheerios for me sometimes i mix it up with some variety of kashi
i have a bunch of green beans  what should i make with them  i planned on making pad prik king but its pouring down rain and theres a tornado warning for my area so i cant make it to the grocery store for the rest of the ingredients
i always like to just blanche and saut√©e in bacon fat and garlic
why dont zoomers just eat them raw
make a noncampbells green bean casserole
  get a small bone in ham simmer with quartered potatoes and a little garlic black pepper add beans till tender makes a very simple soup
just heat them in a pan with butter and sprinkle some lawrys on them not for too long you want them to still be crunchy
  they figured out that nouvelle cuisine chefs are shit at cooking beans
  not for too long you want them to still be crunchy  crunchy  what the fuck is wrong with you
  boil and then toss with lemon garlic butter or olive oil or both and herbs of your choice
  make tournados then famiry
  crunchy is exactly what julia means when she says still retain their texture
  no she said tender   crunchy and tender are mutually exclusive   also another example
  well roughly whatother ingredients do you have at hand    simple simple  1 if you storm boil them for 4 minutes add beans when water has reached peak boil in reasonably salted water and drain them leave in collander/siv/whatevs    2 roast some garlic slices on low heat in a pan add a generous tablespoon of salted butter once butter has melted add a click of refrigeratortemeratured sambal badjak stir and turn off the stove leave under a lid for 23 minutes    3 put the beans in the pan and stir it all up together    4 serve with whatever rice you like and maybe add an egg if you want
  op here  i made it to publix for curry paste and chicken breast  i tried to make pad prik king and it came out terrible    2 tablespoons of curry paste and still couldnt taste it a damn bit
  theres a tornado warning for my area so i cant make it to the grocery store for the rest of the ingredients  american dream lads
  parboil them and freeze them for later
tfw 12 hours into keto diet and craving carbs
eat like a normal person
and people say refined carbs arent comparable to drugs  silly people
  21 hours into prison and feeling kind of sleepy but your roomate is a strong black man
  stupid anime poster
  this until you try going off carbs you wont ever truly realize how utterly addictive they are when having been consumed in abundance  its about a year ago since i was on keto for a longer period and its been a challenge to get myself to start again
  the worst part is that once you do keto once long term youre aware how you dont crave carbs at all after a week or so but its still near impossible to get past that first week of cravings
  i am 3 days in and the cravings are not that bad keep yourself preoccupied with anything except food my cravings are slowly withering away and its not too noticeable just keep yourself motivated i am already feeling its effects and i feel alot better
  yup the first week is hell then it doesnt become such a problem other than during social gatherings which was where i fell from grace into carblimbo
you have a habit to break youre probably not even in ketosis yet its quicker to just fast one day then you get to be surprised at how much better everything tastes
keto is the most retarded meme diet ever
  tfatty
  i have defined abs tho only desperate fatties are into keto they are the only ones who need it
  go full keto  loose 28 kg in 23 year  not really hungry anymore for sugar carbsmeat or even vegetables    i basicly have to forcefeed myself any meal and cant event see fastfood  still beat being fat hough      not a meme but its not for everyone
keto is just a rebranded atkins diet which was already a meme except even clownier keeping those qualities in mind they should just call it the rowan atkins diet
  damn dude youre so right im gonna go right now and put back on those 60 lbs i lost on it cant lose weight even if it works if some random dickhead thinks its clowny what was i thinking
ketards are getting very obnoxious  it doesnt help that like 95 of you fuckers are/were obese  i dont dispute that you might be able to lose weight by eating like that  thing is you blame grains and starches for being fat fucks when its your absolute lack of self control and discipline that brought you there  just do your fucking meme diet or whatever else help you avoid exercising and let normal people eat whatever they want please read fat fuck / normal
  you blame grains and starches for being fat  no i blame my poor self control and voracious appetite keto completely curbs both of those stop generalizing and being so triggered both are gay
  glad you found a diet that works for you and helped you lose weight but you can eat junk food and still lose weight as long as your calorie intake is lowered     i dont really think theres any issue with unrefined grains fruit beans milk etc but refined grains are high in calories without being satiating which is the problem not all carbs
  why do people lose weight on keto but not on a balanced diet of whatever  those just eat carbs like a normal person lol cico it diet recommendations led to west being something like 50 obese
  too stupid to realize that a high protein diet is not the same as a low protein diet  too stupid to realise were not laughing with him were laughing at him
  let normal people eat whatever they want please  youre claiming ketards are now forcing people to eat bacon and pass on the donuts or are you just feeling pissy because their preferred diet is some sort of patriarchal microaggression against your transgendered vegan lifestyle
  lose weight on keto but not on a balanced diet  because theyre too fucking stupid to lose weight on a health sustainable environmentally friendly vegan diet like a normal rightthinking person
   12 hours into keto diet and craving carbs  they say that its bad for 3 days then phew it ends  just make sure youre fully hydrated so thirst isnt mistaken for hunger  then just tell yourself that yay its working whenever you have a diet craving sign this means youre burning your calories oh yea high five enjoy the pain of success
  there is definitely an anime qt314 with a face to describe this feeling
i cant stop making big spaghetti portions and eating all of it in one sitting directly out of the pot
  breaking pasta
  only way to fit it in the pot
  literally just hold it there for 5 seconds and it will soften up then you dip the rest you mongoloid
i was able to quit soda cold turkey    would carbs be harder
  quitting soda is like quitting smoking   quitting carbs is like quitting heroin
not living on lentils  cucks
  so its easier
  about as easy as yo momma
    how to eat spaghetti while on keto    replace the pasta with sprouts
cant eat oats  cant eat yogurt  cant eat cottage cheese  healthy  legitimately cant stand keto  not even at the level of its merits at a diet but just how its tricked an entire generation people into thinking they know fuck all about health and nutrition because a diet tricked them into not shoveling donuts soda spaghetti macaroni and cake into their mouths
  of all the foods you couldve listed you listed two that are perfectly fine on keto way to fuck that up i eat yogurt daily while doing it and cottage cheese is nasty but if you like it its fine to have every day on keto
i tried atkins once and felt like crap if and counting calories is way better
  youre probably not even in ketosis yet  the body will go into ketosis overnight as it sleeps its after the keto flu period that your body will become fully fatadapted and the cravings go away i dont like fasting unless im already lowcarb/keto im physically active so fasting destroys my energy if im not already relying on ketosis
  refined carbs / all carbs
  i had 3 donuts for omad
  two that are perfectly fine on keto  not in the quantities in which they would actually be useful to eat its what 25g of either that puts you over your daily limit for staying in your super saiyan mode    besides losing oats is easily the biggest loss of those three the prime example of why following diets with simple rules isnt a substitute for just flat out knowing what to and what not to eat
  more like 200g
why is there a dedicated defence force to screech how bad keto is every time its mentioned the arguments never change  not all carbs are bad  just cico fatty  you can lose weight on cake and soda  muh rebranded atkins even though its literally not  just a meme diet  enjoy your cardiovascular diseases  i tried it and it totally didnt work for me everyone get off it now  whats so horrible about a diet that you have to vehemently attack everyone that even mentions it on a zambian anonymous shit huffing forum
  control yourself fatty
  ur the salty one
  ive stopped replying to them at this point because its pointless  why cant you jsut do x like everyone else  why do you give a fuck there are multiple ways to do anything theyre the same people that bitch all day about fat people then whine about fat people that actually lose weight not doing it their approved way absolute mongoloids
ur giving the most fucks rn
    why the samefagging thats all i want to know why are you so obsessed   me
  why do people lose weight on keto but not on a balanced diet of whatever  overweight people underestimate how many calories theyre actually taking in just like skeletons saying they eat so much but cant gain weight overestimate people are bad at judging without actually taking the time to figure it out properly but the ones who do it properly can lose weight without doing keto    people also overestimate how many calories are actually burned through exercise they think they can burn off all the extra food theyre eating if they just do the treadmill for 15 minutes
ive lost 460 pounds on keto
ur the most obsessed bro
  just fyi this is an industry talking point its not actually realistic it helps place a healthy amount of cocacola into your diet
  why havent you killed yourself yet
  nah just talking about eating a healthy amount of whole grains beans drinking milk etc which keto dieters avoid because they think theyre all bad because theyre higher in carbs soda is considered refined carbs which should be avoided which is what i meant to say when i said unrefined grains but its true that you can eat nothing but cookies and drink soda and still lose weight youll be incredibly unhealthy but you dont have to do the keto diet to lose weight really counting calories so you know what youre consuming instead of just guessing and only eating what you need to maintain a healthy weight isnt unrealistic
do people really need to eat carbs every 12 hours thats literally needing to eat carbs every dinner and breakfast every single day i sometimes go days without eating carbs because i just dont make any of them
  t seething ketobrap
  25g  it varies by person 20g is low enough to eventually put the biggest lardass into ketosis for everybody else the limit tends to be higher my limit is about 80g/day my wifes limit is considerably higher
  vegans all bitchy that theres another meme diet in town
  keto is already dead all about carnivore diet now until those lemmings move onto breatharian urine fasting
newest ba vid is making instant ramen  claire says noodles might be difficult  she checks up online  is still mostly baffled  spends most of vid fucking up noodles  video ends  i search for other instant ramen vids for bantz  how instant ramen is made inside factory visit  posted by bon appetite 5 years ago    wait wtf did skunkgirl not think of checking her own fucking channel on how the noodles were made before she started
  great another absolute shit thread to hide thanks
  thanks for the bump ba shill
im mostly curious about what happened to the indian lady it has been over a month since she posted her first video now claire has posted two videos since she supposedly left something strange has happened
  its a sweet and sour thread it appeals to others like me but not others like you if you dont like it just send a closing argument and sage       instant noodles is just curled noodles made from flour and a solution of heat treated baking soda mixed with water that is then dried and having its flavor packet filled with salt msg sometimes soy and finally bullion then you have asian instant noodles like naemyeong or those overrated fire noodles
  being so asshurt by videos of mommy that you need to dedicate an entire thread to it  o b s e s s e d 
newest ba vid is making instant ramen    newest vid is brad cooking pheasant
oh look its the daily late night ba shill waifu thread
  posted 13 hours ago  wait that long ago holy fuck i procrastinated prolly 10 hours more than i realised        i really dont give much of a fuck about the channel theres probably 1 interesting topic in the catalogue atm you cunts are hardly contribootin here are you
  i ddont really care about claire  and thats why youve made this thread because you dont care
  she looks like an ex gf totally confused with a marketing degree
french guys ramen autism was better
  the ramen was more interesting desu      yeah would love to try the ramen from these two side by side to see who did better legit i cant choose from watching claires stock looked nicer but simple alex went full autismo in a pretty fun way
  wow you really know those hollywood names have you considered that you suck
  reeeeeee i hate claire  shes so dumb  she cant even into ramen noods  throws piss bottle    anon why are you so obsessed    ii just want to talk about the ramen this has always been about the ramen
    it took momofuku ando months of trial and error cooking at home in order to make his original recipe for chikin ramen making shelfstable precooked dry noodles is a surprisingly hard process
  its more like i have gastritis atm cant really move from bed cos pain bored enough to have binged food channels n shit for past 3/4 days with probably 20 minutes as my longest sleep session because my ribs/back bones feel like theyre being torn out and now i can barely think anymore
  true it was a good while ago though youd think theyd have made the process much simpler and openly documented nowadays
  its almost like the videos are made for entertainment purposes and looking up exactly how to do it so its just a straightforward process of following established instructions instead of a trialanderror struggle of experimentation and ingenuity would defeat the purpose
  sage goes in all fields
  its a fictional tv show claire is a character  the real claire saffitz would just google an exact recipe to make the dried noodles but that wouldnt be very entertaining
  bon appetit has an unironic reputation for racis and inequality in their offices its likely that brad canned her after she wouldnt suck him off
  bon appetit has an unironic reputation for racis and inequality in their offices   i heard the exact opposite
  skunkgirl  youre a rude faggot
  i guess gourmet versions of skittles and other candy makes sense but gourmet instant ramen isnt the gourmet equivalent to instant ramen just actual ramen
  no
anons from /ck/ so terrified cookingalone that she took down all of her videos and placed a copyright infringement claim on her image that was posted frequently here    pic related  i feel bad for her
  how do i get a jewish gf _
/ourguy/ did it though  
ba is garbage
  become a doctor
  speaks english like a retard  hes definitely not /ourguy/
i enjoy ba content
  well yeah youre gay so of course you do
  yes
  racism and inequality  2 bullshit words in modern day everything is racist and the only equality people care about in current year is equality of outcome which is equally bullshit
  i thought she only made ramen noodles to make true ramen shed have to boil pork bones for 16 hours and such unless i missed that part
  every person in the world who speaks english speaks it like a retard tho muricans speak it like retards the actual english speak it like retards queen elizabeths actual proper english now just sounds like shes a larping retard
mollyjpg
  how do you know english
  dont bully my wife
  is it just me or does she have a thing for brad
does anyone know what she is drinking
  looks like canada dry m8
  oh just sparkling water
  except each video has a scene where she does online research into how the various foods are made one time she even watched an ep of good eats
  to make true ramen shed have to boil pork bones for 16 hours and such unless i missed that part  one whole day of the vid was dedicated to making super delicious chicken stock with msg dehydrating and grinding it into powder
the white hair streak is pretentious as fuck
  its not her fault magneto was trying to turn the president into a gooop
someone explain the appeal of this woman    she looks like your run of the mill 25 year old jewish woman except a bit more roughed up
  25 year old  try 45
  lonely zoomers watch youtube and imagine the characters as their real life friends they try to pick out which female they could most easily score with obviously a dumpy busted looking one would be the most plausible fantasy to someone with low self esteem
jesus christ once again with the ohh i havent had this in years
  projecting much
  god i wish that were me
  strawman
when that guy taste tested her stock seasoning shit and said he didnt like it and she never brought it back to him and got his approval    was he in the wrong
  but theyre all jews
  did the zoomer trigger you or are you genuinely saying hes wrong
  what the can
  yes
  that broth is oily
actually my wife
  seems like a compliment to me since it references her sexy choice of hairstyle
    how do you fuck up noodles
  as it should be
  french guy alex i think his videos are comfy but he is a little bit of an obessive sorry like the shopping bag thing you know he is going to shill when its perfected
  ive literally seen you people talk about these characters as though they were your personal friends dont even try to pretend
  probably not she is pretty notoriously bad at cooking one time she fucked up tempering chocolate like 4 times despite being a trained pastry chef
  its ginger ale you mong
  in the japanese style of ramen they throw a knob of pork fat in the broth since the long cooking process breaks down the fat cells enough in the broth with everything else that they add richness to the broth without feeling oily on the tounge
  i like him but his narcissism is becoming anoying
  i thought there was a hole in the bowl where the seaweed shit is    thought that for an embarrassingly long time
  its clearly blue you colorblind dong
ramen isnt a pastry
  how instant ramen is made inside factory visit  no recipe  no information on preservation  expensive industrial noodlemaking machinery imported from japan    no wonder she didnt watch that video its fucking useless
  i want to sniff that bowl
i think claire is okay i made her maplebourbon pumpkin pie recipe and thought it was decent enough granted i didnt brulee it that being said i made the turkey shown in this video here    and it tasted great everyone in my house fucking loved it   cheers to you andy you talented queer bastard
  true it looked like legit restaurant ramen in instant form i wish hed give up the whole honhon je suis un crazy frenchman schtick
/ourgirl abandoned us so we have to move on cu/cksthere is only one now
i would like the cooking person in the video to be crying with lots of mascara running down their face thank you
this shit tastes like childrens cough medicine who drinks this willingly do people buy this to suppress autism or something
im very sorry you are a genetically inferior tastelet who cannot enjoy this or cilantro maybe one day medical science can cure you
  drink dr pepper is the weeaboo equivalent of asking for szechuan sauce at mcdonalds you autists just like this stuff because some science man in a cartoon said its good
  yep which is why historically nobody bought dr pepper for the 100 years it was around and sales jumped 1000000 after ricky and morty
i dont get it either have never liked dr pepper
my boomer mom likes diet dr pepper more than diet coke how do i apply for a new mom
  this ill admit szechuan sauce was alright but in all honesty its no different than the shit you can get pretty much anytime at your local chinese takeout restaurant      anything is generally much better than diet coke but she should really consider choosing pepsi max instead
its the only soft drink i particularly like but even then i rarely if ever drink them
  it actually taste pretty good only downside is that it makes you poop  if you dont like the taste that is actually pathetic you must be one picky eater
dr pepper is good but it needs to be  ice cold  fresh syrup    this is why its best ordered from a restaurant if youre drinking it out of a lukewarm 2 liter just kys
it tastes like carbonated kompot
  im going to redpill youll on what the overriding and actual flavor of dr pepper really is are you ready its amaretto simple as in fact if you drop a shot glass of disaronno into a pale lager a la car bomb style and chug it it will taste almost exactly like a regular dr pepper the 23 flavors is an advertising meme to throw competition off of the flavoring profile and make people think its special whether or not youre a fan of amaretto is subjective
  because some science man in a cartoon said its good  what
  baste and tastepilled
dr pepper reduces your sperm count    seriously
  good i dont want my gf to get pregnant yet
        t tastelets and brainlets
  put some jaeger in it
  weebshit  great you fucking ruined it

  gooks are koreans  youre thinking of nips
  yup
  gooks are vietnamese  youre thinking of kimchis
  but this time the cartoon science man was right
  kill yourself
  tastes like marzipan to me but nobody seems to agree
  no gook can mean any kind of far easterner and its associated with koreans because it got popular during the korean war
  only for redditors such as you dumb newfag die
  i love it even started ordering the stuff with bourbon when i just cant give a fuck
  steinsgate reference

have you ever eaten seitan  its delicious healthy vegan and cheap  you should probably go make some right now
  yeah i have no problem giving up chicken because of it the texture is exactly the same
    fuck off it like fake crab meat absolute garbage
  youve never had it if you think it tastes like crab meat it tastes how ever you season it you can make it delicious if you arent a fucking moron
  yeah its p good
  it tastes how ever you season it  you can make it delicious  sounds like i should just eat diluted seasoning    seitan is gross tempeh is alright normal tofu is gross no matter what you do to it
  it sounds like you are new to cooking finding a certain texture to be gross is fine but i cant imagine hating a high protein texture  you must be a fucking vegan faggot to not like the texture of meat
  this
  doesnt it literally kill you seitanism is evil
  healthy  idk about that but i do find it enjoyable in its own way
  im rootin for gluten
  hail seitan
  how do you prepare it ive had it in stir fries before and it was pretty good but what else not sure how it would work as the main ingredient or in larger chunks

doesnt eat his steak chicago style
  chicago style  itt things that dont exist
  go doesnt care about the rest of ca so ca doesnt care about go
what the hell is chicago style
  you may know it as pittsburgh style the urban myth being that the steel workers would bring raw steak to work for their lunch and cooked it by throwing it at the steel vats
  pittsburgh style  no such thing its fucking steak
  flyovers trying to carve out some sort of culinary identity chicago is particularly bad for this  ignore them its a fucking steak at the end of the day
  chicago style steak is oiled outside the pan while the steak is warming to room temperature heavily seasoned then seared beyond the normal level most steaks are to the point of charring chicago style steak are typically medium rare to medium in the middle but have crunchy crust on the outside caused by the charred blanket of seasoning
  it is im a line cook rn while i get my bachelors and its when people want their steak like charred on the outside but rare on the inside
ive heard of it before by the name chicago blue specifically  basically burnt on the outside but really rare on the inside
  chicago style only describes the charred outside the inside can be any consistency chicago blue is blue rare on the inside obviously but you can have chicago style rare medium rare and medium although its more difficult and chicago blue is the quintessential for reference op pic is chicago medium rare
  its almost like steak au poivre isnt it
  chicago style is defined by the char au poivre you shouldnt be charring it just has very coarse seasoning
  chicago style steak  its been blacked  figures
  chicago style  it means that you get shot at by some niggers
  is it really as bad there as people say  i mean compared to st louis or baltimore
  kek
    its basically a small scale somalia  they have a curfew for good reason
  please post one restaurant menu which features this
  not as bad as those no
  i can imagine  baltimore is a war zone
  no especially since its all gang violence miles away from where any white people live
  not that guy but ive been to a place that offers this  the saltlick in banff canada if it matters
  why do people from chicago try so fucking hard to label things that seem unique to their city and create imaginary regional dishes its not an attractive city and nobody likes it stop trying to peddle your exclusive regional shitty foods like chicago pizza fucking disgusting obese tier pizza or making shit up like chicago style steak now brooklyn pizza thats a real fucking thing you faggot your city is shit the only thing its good for is blackonblack violence you should start acting exclusive and regional about your crime rates oh man haha youll never have chicago style murder look its so cool and exclusive were better than other cities please kys
  you can disregard any american dish that uses a country or a place name in its title  detroit style  italian style  new york style  french style  none of it is original  tiresome
  its just an obvious fucking ploy to seem unique and attract food tourists
  seems based imo
  not a single line of text  point beautifully made and conveyed  enough said
  no its a completely segregated city the white parts of chicago are lovely
  parts of chiraq are lovely  anon
  he doesnt eat all of his food carnival style   i shiggy diggy
    i like it golden and brown on the outside and cool in the middle with coarse salt and fresh ground pepper to season topped by a pan cheese sauce with rosemary thyme and deglazed with local petite syrah i cant even remember the last time i bothered ordering steak at a restaurant
  i can do anything
  ur tellin me there is a go teak
  yes the white parts do you not understand the concept of segregation
  woag    das fuggin cool bruh
  so how do you do it 1850 broiler from frozen
  i typically use my chicago style steak leftovers in my deep dish casserole
  baltimore is nice well the county is at least fuck the city
  want their steak like charred on the outside but rare on the inside  thats what rare is thats how all steaks should be
  i shiggy diggy    fuck thats cool    im not gonna buy one but im gonna think about buying one
ghost peppers i bought from taobao what do
  crush into a paste and smear onto ballsack
  this
  i own a vitamix because im not poor blend into a mash and ferment
  squeeze the juice out of the peppers and use them as eyedrops
  too poor to buy specialty hot peppers and a vitamix    just loling at you right now just loling
  bought  from taobao  food
  i live in china    even though i live in harbin and these peppers are grown in deep yunnan province these things arrive in a few days as fresh as the pic i showed you
  huh
  throw them in the bin for still using that indian ghost pepper meme if you want hot ones that dont taste like indian chemicals try out carolina reapers or at least trinidad scorpians  its like people are watching tv shows from 15 years ago and still pushing that ghost pepper chemical tasting crap
  poor nigger fag i have a vitamix for a reason
  do you also do dealameal
    brings up money despite it being irrelevant  wow youre insecure as fuck
  i cant get reapers or scorpions fresh here sw china is close enough to india that theyre grown fresh here
  thats not how meme arrows work you stupid chink
  implying im a chink    nys you faggot im white
  theyre better in the usa trust me when i say that i can get them fresh at farmers markets
  nys too broome
  maybe when i go back home next summer ill get some reapers and hopefully ferment and make a sauce before having to come back here
  its a short sliding window for them generally the season starts in middle to late october and goes for a month or so   the actual start varies with the the weather from when the peppers were planted and how they grow
  the best ive seen are from pa and nj usually pa
hot peppers need love
    i might be fucked then i know my uncle in buttfuck southern illinois enjoys growing them but i teach in china and my vacations are limited to certain months of the year
these are some weird orange chinese peppers im fermenting right now its been 3 weeks
  yeah thats different doing that for yourself can be done anytime but the yield isnt what can be done for selling them at farmers markets that takes a much larger yield on the crop
  i can get seeds here but i live in an apartment im not sure how possible it is to grow good peppers in this setting
  im no pro at fermentation but shouldnt that have a valve on it to prevent it from exploding
  if you burp them daily its not a problem
  fair enough cheers on some good peppers
  not that anon but im actually also fermenting some peppers 
    take pictures and document it over time this thread will age out but come back and show results when theyre done
  i see push the button for a burp
  lol i should have started taking pictures a couple weeks ago but im sure ill do it again and ill document it 
i like buying them by the bushel if i find a good batch i throw them in freezer bags and chuck them in a freezer so theyre available until next season ive learned to not wash them before freezing them they store better frozen from fresh
  tis cool its never too late to start
  i just cant wait to taste the sauce thatll come from it im kinda nervous to see if itll be good or not theyre these little yellow peppers called lemon drops so the sauce is gonna be venemously bright yellow
  i made some excellent salsa with some chocolate habaneros in a blender cleaned it out three times but i guess it wasnt enough i made a milkshake in it for my gf and i and we both looked at eachother and dumped it she liked the salsa but that milkshake with leftover habanero taste in it had to go  point being if using a blender maybe have two one for the chiles another for other stuff
  lol  quit fucking writing it like that it isnt a word dont capitalize it that way    tis  kill yourself
  i dont think i need to do shit the cross thing on the left just lets shit out
  stop being a negative fucking faggot   lol
  if you dont conform to my notion of proper posting style my panties get fluster rumpled
  eat some and cry
  suck me off just got back from eating hot pot fucking chinks always doubt me when i say i want the hottest shit they have shake my head to be quite honest senpai
  fpbp
  its phone posting its not a word and bot correct to capitalize it but its all not worth the time and trouble to constantly fix it
  blend and dilute into a sauce   then enema  its good for you

  explain yourself
  blend them strain it wipe every public toilet seat with death oil   or drink it
  these are good too if looking for yellow  golden cayenne theres a hawaiian one too thats a habanero varient those things taste great but are bloody hard to find on the east coast
  plant them so u can grow more
  i planted some seed in your mum if you know what i mean
  nah doesnt work like this
  isnt capsaicin good at pain relief  op could unironically make a muscle soothing salve  ghost pepper might be risky if you rub your face a lot tho
  who gives a shit thats a chinese internal issue its simply not my problem i dont want them to care about internal american issues and i dont care about theirs
  i dont have muscle aches so dont know personally but yeah from what ive read capsaicin is really good for muscle aches just dont rub it on your balls or get it in your eyes or nose worse finger a girlfriend after chopping peppers and not washing your hands properly
  so what im not the worlds policeman why should i give a flying fuck about falun gong or tiananmen deal with your own problems before expecting the usa to deal with them for you
  op didnt say he/she had muscle aches where did you get that from
  i get that crap from thai restraurants that dont know me once i become an established customer i just say thai style and itll get hot they do that because they dont want assholes returning food thats too spicy/hot for them i find that funny because chile peppers are native to the americas but whatever
  ok
what is bento box
shitty nip version of a lunch box typically contains cold slimy rice cuts of fish that have been rotting in a metal container all day by the time you get to it and other shit like seaweed and eggs
  sstop laughing at me rice
  just google this shit anon dont start another damn thread
i had a heavy weeb phase years ago and made me and my husband bento boxes every morning for lunch sadly he always complained that they were never enough food for him even when i made the larger boxes    the idea is to stuff as much variety and colors into every nook and cranny so that all the space is taken up either by edible food or decor food  like lettuce leaves and shit rice is sort of the main stomachfiller but around that rice its common to pack a variety of meats or veggies cooked in a variety of different ways     i finally stopped when i realized that i was getting up extra early and doing all this work for a jerk who didnt even really care if i hand made an elaborate lunch or just tossed a frozen dinner in his lunch bag     i still on occasion enjoy playing around with making bento for myself its fun to cook and i like knowing that i can make nice things that are aesthetically nice to look at as well as good tasting     there are tons of videos on line of course theres this one guy who makes bento for his whole family every day and i like to see his variety of ideas that he comes up with 
  your husband sounds like a dick
  my motherinlaw made this for my wife everyday for work until she moved out at age 26
  there are shittier threads than this one being bumped
  he was ended up cheating on me after 10 years together fuck him got a new life in a new state with a new guy who appreciates what i do
  haha and you would treat her right yes
  you first nirgin
  are you still married
  my wife bought me a bento box for work lunches it is way too small to hold an adequate amount of food except when im on keto and then i pack it with nuts and meat and stuff and it is literally perfect sized because im used to eating less if it was full of vegetables and rice and stuff id be upset too
  
    probably because he didnt want to be married to a weeb
  im a homosexual
  i suppose however there are may varieties that dont involve rice its just a common filler there are larger bento boxes with multiple tiers that you can get too so i guess it all matters on ones personal food needs
  thatd be odd considering she was a dgrade cosplayer who writes fanfic smut talk about of the pan and into the fire 
  did you just refer to yourself in third person
  sorry didnt finish reading the thread before i posted i really shouldnt do that
  your reading comprehension level will improve with practice dont give up
  dont ask food related questions on a cooking and food board anon
  thinking /ck/ is for food
  fuck you
  do you enjoy getting blacked
  the poor reader lashes out at his intellectual betters
  see i told you good job       considering the guy i have now treats me like a queen i guess it was worth the pain shes welcome to my sloppy seconds
  inferior in every way to the tiffin
  the indian version of bento
  why would you want to be treated like a queen sounds unhealthy
  i pray you never find yourself in a relationship where you feel neglected and lonely despite the effort you put into it may you be with someone who genuinely likes being in your company and tells you how wonderful you are and treats you with all the love and respect you deserve i sincerely wish this for you and every other person in this thread
  right after you sure
  ppl think this is a woman
can housewifechan please share what she put in her bentos
  any guy with half a brain would marry you simply based off that pic
  yeah youd have to be missing half a brain to marry a weeb
  specifics are vague as this was years ago leftovers from whatever i made for dinner were a norm sometimes it was whatever he liked best he liked steak and meatheavy dishes so it was usually a combo of those things with what little veggies he would actually eat he was a big pasta fan so sometimes id make a pastabased bento with assorted things to go around it i was a fan of salad and sandwichbased bentos your imagination and creativity are the limits to what can be done with the ingredients that youve got     i still make them for myself sometimes its fun and its a way to flex my creativity with leftovers or things that need to get ate quickly like fruit my coworkers seem to enjoy finding out what i brought every day so theres that
  to clarify this isnt my picture its just as good of a representation as to what a normal large bento would be for our lunch
  danke
    thats not even his you retarded mongrel
  this place really never changes
cancer is supposed to be the silent killer right it sure is loud in this thread

  nah hes right this isnt your recipe blog
  tfw no qt314 weeb waifu to make you bento boxes each morning because she just loves you that much  tfw i dont have a face
  k
  heh
aaaaand thats a wrap gnight
  how lower level tier human do you need to be to fall for obvious bait  your mom and dad are clearly very patient people you are lucky you have them
  the fact that somebody thought this was a smart post makes me angry
  the idea is to stuff as much variety and colors into every nook and cranny so that all the space is taken up  i thought everyone did this  since when is this a trend
watchh the first episode of season 2 of shokugeki no soma and youll understand
bento lunch boxes in tokyo  
i would not mind if some cute little nip made me one but if your typical 300 pound american female made me one it would go straight in the landfill
  itt blogposting roasties and whiteknights  steady but surely on the way to becoming reddit 20

  get some sleep buddy
this is fish right cause otherwise its a great st8k b8 thread
  i love rare steaks but there is literally no cooking or char on the outside its like someone just made the outside layer brown what kind of trash is this
fillet migon    worst steak cut you can buy
  could be sous vide without searing the outside
how come whenever i try to sear a steak on my stovetop the outside gets all shredded looking always bug me never seems to get a nice even sear like this   either just grey with brown patches
  i want it  i want any rare or rarerthanrare steak
  lube pan get it really really really hot
  yeah anon very good
  based and flyoverpilled
  dont listen to him  get pan really hot 78 out of 9 setting on my stove  add in a blended olive oil or neutral oil like canola  place steak in and move skillet around to make sure oil touches all of it  its ready to be flipped after 90 seconds
  was a sous vide steak with a 40 second sear on each side
  imagine being this poor
  op that shit looks like you microwaved it for 30 seconds and then left in the freezer for a month
  how
  raw fat in the middle  i love my meat blue as fuck but thats a big no no there buddy
  what do you mean shredded looking
  like little tears all over the surface open up
  arugula eaters need to be holocausted
  hrm thats odd are you just doing a pan sear what cut and how thick is the steak you are working with
  yeah was searing in a cast iron just left it on the burner for 45 minutes on the highest setting and tossed the steak on top didnt measure thickness but maybe like 1 1/2 or so ribeye
  hrm dunno maybe its the quality of the meat try purchasing from another butcher or grocery store
  you shut the fuck up bitchboy
  arugula is the best lettuce grate some lemon zest onto a bed of arugula and put a sizzling steak on top to wilt it a bit a fried egg on top of all that and you got yourself a classy ensamble
    yeah fuck off back to ribeyeddit
  whats wrong with ribeye
  det √§r det mest √∂verskattade k√∂ttet av k√∂tt bredvid filet mignon och min flickv√§n har sex med svarta killar

    holy shit how does it even get that bad    steak looks alright
  safflower oil smokes at 500 degrees clarified butter comes really close heat that bitch stupid hot
    done right its okay granted  i wouldnt cook it every day i do it for my gf on her birthday
so people what the hell do i order ribeye or tbone
  quality stake
he cooks his steaks mediumrare
  is that flat beer in a wine glass or just a full pour of wine
  would hate to see your worst
what does it mean when the temperature light stays on blue after setting temperature i usually just turn the thing off/on back again to turn it back to red but i dont understand
    i mean its kind of hard to tell with the lighting but idk if its actually even that rare when you sous vide a steak it cooks evenly throughout and having the entire steak stay a light reddish color like that is common usually youd get a bit more of a gradient after you sear it but it seems like he didnt sear it very much so not much of a gradient was formed really but it looks like that could just be a perfectly good medium rare besides the fact its lacking some browning
  shut up faggot
  _
  thaaaaats a little bit of a full pour
  what exactly is wrong with a full pour
ask person how they want their steak cooked  medium rare  cook steak to perfect medium rare  they complain that it is undercooked because there is still red in the middle  say they like their steak so there is just a tiny bit of pink  have to explain to them that those words have actual meaning and they really want medium well    you have to wonder how many people out there actually know what steak doneness is and arent just saying medium rare because that is what is most popular
  to be fair if youre cooking them like in those pictures then id complain too the steak should be cooked evenly throughout and rare/well should indicate level of doneness not how much is overcooked vs how much is raw which looks about half on that medium rare right there
i actually dont like steak very much but i can handle it well done with a good ketchup on it uncooked meat just grosses me out and we need to break the stigma against ketchup
  kek
  do you guys ever have your steak pittsburg/chicago style
  awbloobloo enjerd
im an autistic caveman so i like super tough cuts of beef i get them cut really thick and sear them in cast iron i like it really rare
  ketchup  not even once
  this made me laugh harder than i have in months thank you so much
real talk is it posssible/adviseable to grill a steak in a waffle iron
  the fuc were you even trying to do tho
  he made a pretty decent ribeye anon
  rare is pretty gross and stringy    medium and up is just grey and tough    steak needs to be cooked one way high temperature with continual movement over an open flame    steak will cook itself just waiting to be served you need to pull it just before its ready but you need the right amount of char without greying the flesh  does that make any sense

  a steak with an omelette thrown on top because who cares
  its raw
i got myself some grass fed beef today because it was on sale  id like to know what the heck all the hype is about    it had a very metallic bloody flavor which is fine but why am i going to pay 10 a pound for that when i can get the same flavor from offal for like 50 cents a pound    the meat was very soft so that was a good quality but taste wise if im having a steak i definitely prefer grain fed beef
  ty
  so that means cook as hot and fast as possible 
    how could you possibly think that a steak that raw tastes good
  my god damn sides
  hang it on a clothespin outside but put it up high so bears dont get it
  goddamn i laughed way too hard at this
i like to put my steaks in the blender after cooking to get a more even consistency
  i think he was trying to quote the op and then put a you infront of it notice how it has all the numbers two parentheses and a y o and u in it
should i make a shark steak
  thats the most disgusting looking medium rare ive ever seen were these steaks cooked from frozen or something what the fuck is going on here
the rib cap is the king of steaks   it cannot be beaten
  have you ever tried it before ive seen shark in my grocery store before but never picked it up always wanted to try it though
  we dont have those in the us i wonder why
  what yes we do its just usually kept on the steak
  reverse sear without the sear
  the salad looks great
  an omelette thrown on top  no yellow just brown and white
  why the fuck did you leave your steak laying on the table
  capturing the hipster aesthetic
dry age ribeye  nigger puts mayo a bunch of shit on it and eats it on a sandwich  
  i get them at costco
  whyd you leave the steak up on the table  i wanted to
pad see ew and a couple bottles of singha beer at your local thai joint finish it off with a khao tom mud if theyve got it
  getting angry at how others enjoy their food  how severely are you on the spectrum dear
  kek underrated
  bruh this is exactly what my parents do     i have cooked steak sous vide to a particular temperature asked them in advance how they wanted it cooked showed them a sous vide chart with temps/pics etc they still said it was underdone jesus if you want something medium well just ask me it would be a whole lot easier than cooking to to medium rare and having you complain
  stop being so dramatic
  too bad you didnt get a decent sear
  not that guy but i also have trouble with this part i always think my cast iron is hot enough but i guess i never wait long enough
  comparing an entire continent to china and india    fuck you
  calm your tits
  what are you doing to the steak before you put them in the pan
  nothin really
  what kind of oil are you using butter more than one steak at a time also try patting your steak dry before you throw it in the pan makes a big difference
  i just tossed a pat of butter in a bit after the steak
      yes dry the steak very thoroughly use lots of oil in the pan fuck anyone who tells you different
  i always thought this was a meme especially when taking them out of a marinade i tried it once and now i do it every time
  i should oil the pan before preheating    i always thought i should oil the steak instead since the oil will smoke if left in the pan
  what oil are you using and yes oil in the pan before preheating
  you have to get the oil just to the point of smoking if you want to sear hard and fast you can preheat the pan without oil if you want but i personally just start with oil in and wait til i can tell its just about to smoke a lot of people say just oil the steak but i really dont think its enough oil to conduct heat to the uneven surface of the meat
  what kind of sauce you got there anon
  english mustard mixed with the resting juices
  nice looks good ill have to try that sometime
  dipping sauce for steak  what the fuck kind of shit taste that steak must have
  be sure and use colemans english mustard if you can get it   a good quality horseradish is decent too   the resting juices just add so much flavour   bernaise sauce is also good if youre looking for new stuff to try
    maybe youre not using enough fat if youre doing it in a pan you need a good layer not a tiny drizzle
    this diagram is awful you shouldnt see such obvious layers of doneness through the steak theyve been cooked too quickly and not rested properly
  this one is a little better
    the guy knows way more about food than you ever will you greasy cracker fuckstain
  cringe and nigpilled
  i always worry ill leave it too long and set my house ablaze though also my smoke detector is too sensitive and family members always look at me like an idiot whenever i set it off even though theres nothing i can do about it and its not like any of them can cook worth a damn so get off my back already
  well done is the best way to enjoy steak
  with ketchup of course
  i dont like the way he eats steak therefore his steak must taste like shit  go eat your tendies timmy
  its broiled and crispy as fuk go back to rachel ray you turd burgler
    looks like shit  you must live in one of those cookiecutter apartments the soulless dorm room ones that feel so generic so barren   these wretched abodes always have the coil stoves meant to cook some soup up with maybe a 30 minute wait for a kettle if youve got the time but certainly not hot enough to cook a steak people who purchase these should sent to a concentration camp for crimes against humanity
  why would you ever go for blue rare  you might as well just eat it raw at that point  that sear literally does nothing to the meat  blue rare is still raw its not a cooked product
  love the table decorations
  this looks pretty delicious
  fuck off faggot a steak covered in a1 doesnt even taste like a steak just a1
sous vide
  like the rock you know shredded
idk /ck/s opinions on london broils relation to steak but i made this one time
  rib cap  youre right i live for rib cap
  arent you supposed to sear it after sous vide
  eh i guess i just browned it a bit as long as it doesnt look like a grey blob ill eat it
  i always ask for rare do blue rare myself at home though
  enjoy death and shitty steak

  yea or a flat beer
  no sear  wow what a waste of three hours if youre working on an electric stovetop like that youll really need to preheat the cast iron to get a good sear  your you depending on the heat capacity of the cast iron to make up for the limited effective wattage of the burner dry the steak off before searing to make sure it gets nice contact all across the surface
  also you should probably make a sauce out of the reserved drippings from the sous vide bag i usually find that you cant use the drippings from searing the steak when you sous vide since you are doing the sear so hot and fast they burn
  bit uneven
  lol fuck off jack you will get another stroke with that you imbecile
is searing a steak inside a ziploc bag advisable
  i mean i guess if you want dat kino plastic cover
  i always cranked those up to 11 and did sear then used the oven broiler  worked great but im glad i dont have to anymore
i love how everyone is comparing dick size with how raw they can eat their beef without it being still attached to the cow
  that looks fantastic
  ghee or duck fat works really well  high smoke points
  underrated post
i like eating steaks hot right off the grill/pan  resting time is a meme why the fuck would i want room temperature steak
  thicker pieces of meat benefit more from resting meat juices are easier to squeeze out of meat when theyre hotter youre not supposed to let it cool to actual room temperature but i agree with you that i rather like a hot gushy steak right off the grill/pan
what do locals eat in sicily
food
spaghetti and pizza
    these flags are so beautiful if i had a coat of arms itd have 3 legs on it as well
  a lot of fried shit fritti and pasta mainly
is the street food just a meme
  imagine being this retarded
    what is the meaning of this three legged thing
idk i never visited because i was told that if i went there the mob would whack me  as far as i could tell italians generally eat a lot of pasta meat cooked with a lot of butter and sushi
  no its glorious albait all south and center italy does it great    most common   arancini   bread with calf spleen    pane e panelle   stigghiolaintestine   horse meatballs   cannoli   granita
bread with fried chickpeas bread
  a lot of fish and seafood a lot of pasta a lot of fruits citrus fruits in particular antipasto is a common starter of a restaurant meal    well known silician dishes are  spaghetti ai ricci  spaghetti with sea urchin garlic chili and olive oil  pasta alla norma  macaroni with fried aubergines tomatoes basil and cheese  pasta con le sarde  pasta with chopped onions sardines and anchovies  maccu di fave  soup made of fava beans and fennel  arancini  deep fried stuffed rice balls usually stuffed with mince meat / mozarella / vegetables
  some real deep illuminati shit
   the mob would whack me   who told you that maybe maybe that could happen in naples in any case the mob doesnt care about you     pasta generally in south italy although in recent years all italy eat a lot of pasta    meat is not really a italian specialty with maybe few exceptions but meat culture is something we lack of  dont know what you mean about sushi its not traditionally italian but the south eat a lot of raw fish especially apulia
  also pani c√¢ meusa veallungand spleen
  you sound like you know what youre talking about im a sandwoch guy the calf spleen is normally eaten that way no any other sandwiches to keep my eye out for
  how is the seafood normally ordered is there anything like a ceviche or is it judt a platter type situation i loke shellfish
  someone who actually knows something about italy  fuck off wop this board is for memes
  meat is not really a italian specialty  the fuck italy has one of the great dry/fermented sausage and cured ham cultures in the entire world
  heh
  as a manxbro apparently our godthing manann√°n mac lir would stand on our mountain and envelope the island in mist to stop viking shits from discovering it    if that failed he turned into the three legs and rolled down the mountain kicking the invaders to death although some other manx person told me that second bit is bullshit and i guess it is just some common celt imagery    people get a bit uppity if you orientate the legs the wrong way toes always down never kneel for anyone
  i guess it is just some common celt imagery  this is really interesting celts never made it as far south as sicily as far as i know they barely made it into italy how did the sicilian flag take a symbol from celtic culture
  celts never made a couple months of walking  yeah thats probably true
  the greeks also had the triskelion symbol so it really might just be a more common idea than we think
  this has an interesting bit on the manx flag and a sicilian connection 
im half sicilian and the best thing to eat on the entire island are the sausages soft and tender as fuck and it even makes fennel work which is usually disgusting pane e panelle is dry as hell never understood why people eat that shit i dont even like ketchup/mayo that much but need to drench it in that to not die of dehydration while i eat it arancini are great avoid the ones with butter and cheese as biting into a big clump of half plastic cheese is gag inducing    if you go to restaurants you should have both a traditional meat and fish fixed menu for meat go to some more mountainous area my moms village near agrigento has great restaurants in some of the mountain parks for instance the best fish restaurants for my money are in sciacca the pizza is also good but it has been dropping in quality a lot recently for fast food avoid san francesco its gotten very big in recent years with franchises so itll likely be recommended used to be good now its shit just get your intestines from the greasy dude wearing a baseball cap and white apron and screaming/singing while he cuts meat
  any specific dishes you recommend particularly seafood dishes
  well the reason i recommend the fixed menu you dont chose the dishes its already set is because there is a great variety of stuff of course you can order individually but if you want to try as much as possible thats the best option for specific dishes man thats tough pasta with vongole is great squid in pasta is also good risotto with shell fish cozze alla marinara i also have a soft spot for the thinly sliced swordfish they also do this with sardines  that is cooked by the acidity of a lemon/olive oil/parsley mixture
  oh and make sure you try octopus you can even find some locals/a guide to go spear fishing for it yourself the difference in texture between an octopus you caught and killed 5 hours ago and a frozen one is crazy i didnt even eat octopus before that im sure the restaurants get it very fresh as well
  the souls of their dead enemies
  so its like a ceviche do you live in sicily
  huh thats neat i would have guessed that sicilians learned of the triskelion from trade with celtic spain but it looks like sicily has it first thanks for the factoids anon
  oh yeah it is didnt think about that you dont get any vegetables though just a few slices of fish in the liquid on a plate they sell the sardine version in jars could go through an entire one in a single sitting     no i dont live there but i spent 2 months of each year there for a decade
  just jumping into this but its clearly a more ancient symbol a spinning spike of indoneuropean origin apparent in many symbols of the language group
  but its true your the retard here pizza and spaghetti are italian
    arancine    fixed for you if you get this wrong can cost your life
  ohh theres a small town near where i live in portugal called apulia too near the sea
  meat is not really a italian specialty with maybe few exceptions but meat culture is something we lack of  i think we could sit here and list your few exceptions for hours
  forgetting sfincione
  everyones a manx bro on man as your family fuckers
  your family fuckers  doesnt make you a bad person
  pussy sicilians are all into the muff bunch of fenooks
  arent the french also celtic
polentoni
yeet
  that depends on the city palermo is insistent in using the female form
the best kind of pesto
gabbbaagoooooool
  meat is not really a italian specialty  ma che cazzo dici
  ma vai a fare in culo va
  dont know what you mean about sushi    never been in milano i guess
any cu/ck/s live in sicily
when pickpocketing tourists en masse i guess licking their finger with some bread their momma made
bumping for more guinea foods
  we eat a lot of chef boyardee
   fuck my bad it was the first one in my head but got lost
  non lo √® se vai glnegli usa c√® una cultura della carne 10 volte e mezza avanti rispetto allitalia non rompere il cazzo con il tuo nazionalismo abbiamo in generale il miglior cibo del mondo ma se pensi che litalia abbia una cultura della carne evoluta dimostri solo di non conoscere un cazzo del mondo
  yeah we just recently understood how to maillard but go on on how we are superior in meat culture there are cut that are unknown even to butcher here italian are at best not great with meat if you deny that aside from cured meat you just show how much ignorant are you about foreign cuisine
  id luv to understand this rant its entirely possible i could learn something if it were in english but fuck italians and their pretentiousness with weird languages and such like that
  it happens that italians speak italian   in that post theres nothing constructive
  maggot cheese
south italy food  fucking disgusting  lombardo checking in
  italians speak italian  you pretentious faggots get with the program and stop that
  just get your intestines from the greasy dude wearing a baseball cap and white apron and screaming/singing while he cuts meat  generallly this goes for any street food in italy
  do not break your cock with your nationalism
  it is not if you go to the usa there is a culture of meat 10 and a half times ahead of italy do not break your cock with your nationalism we generally have the best food in the world but if you think that italy has an evolved meat culture it only proves that you do not know a shit about the world    which is generally true italy has some really really great land and some of its provinces are the most fertile and good farmland in the world campagna destroyer of armies through fatness but for sheer scale its just impossible to match the us which is a huge country taking up the majority of a continent as opposed to italia which is a peninsula and some islands which is right in the middle of a temperate band and a good 2/3rds the country are devoted to farming hence the term fly over    moreover beef along with wine lol stay mad france is one of the few things america actually does well not just in bulk with american cattle and american beef being highly prized beaten out only by niche breeds or ultra luxury cattle like the japs and their meme beef they autismd into existence in much a similar way to their stupid swords which became famous because of their shitty iron since their cattle are actually just garbage work cows but they autism power that shitty base cow into something globally famous    there is a reason italian cuisine once transplanted to america underwent such a drastic and enormous change as to be unrecognizable back home in america meat was cheap and common while in italy and the provinces it was a luxury item so meat was more of an element than the base component of a dish which would be bread or pasta or vegetable or seafood when you could get it in america the meat is the center point and everything else is secondary
  based and reconcilepilled
  everything else american is shit though especially the cheese
  second post best post
  who cares
  tuscany has a decent meat culture tho
is it true i cant get prescription amphetamines in italy trying to refill my prescription
based question
literally everyone in my family both north near torino and in sicily eat meat 34 times per week is that not meat culture there arent as many refined meat dishes as french food i suppose
  not as intense of one as in america where meat is daily for many people
  tturkey is that you
  nice
  america  good at beef  only texas makes decent beef
  turkey heh
  kys
dark soy
  based and delicious
  soy is bad  t
ive handled and cooked these blue crabs a few times in my life but ive always been extremely careful not to get pinched but ive seen the workers handling them and theyre just grabbing them barehanded without giving a fuck maybe theyre just good at not getting pinched or maybe crab claws arent as fearsome as they look how much does it hurt to actually get got
  anon you grab the end of the claw and hold it tight pinching it and blocking it from pinching not put your hands in the pincers
  i just use tongs
  workers handling them  what workers
  im going to take a wild guess and say seafood processors
  this snibs the snab
  porn video production assistants
  thats a pretty crab
they only nip beta males the alpha crabmen never get nipped because the crabs know they are tough guys
  anon they put the crabs on ice before they get handled by workers it puts them in a sort of comatose state still alive but not exactly conscious anymore ive been pinched before as a kid catching them with chicken necks and string and it hurts quite a bit and they dont let go easily either
longhorn
  not bad little more pricey than other causal dining restaurants
  my go to for dates with your mom before anal have to plug her up with a baked potato beforehand or else the juices are too much wadded in my pubes
i thought these went of business ages ago
  i took a tranny to one once
  thats more information than i needed to know
  based
  literally never heard of it
waited tables there for 3 years so many nigger customers trying to get free food for a chain the food wasnt bad for fat ass mode get parmesan topping on everything
  is that the one that grossly over salts food i think im thinking of somewhere else that offered like 6 dinners with steak or something but their food was almost inedible i cant remember what one that is though
yes
  did you get some boipucci afterward
  good bread decent steaks
  it is a smaller chain but this and outback are my favorite steakhouses on the east coast steakhouses arent much of a thing so there arent a lot of choices
  if you want to get fat put cheese on things  wow who could possibly have known
  pussy  pucci isnt pronounced pussy  youre saying boy poochy
  cringe and redpilled
  are you retarded
  i and my meme suburban shitty american family used to go to these all the time in the late 90s and early 00s  now im 30 and havent seen one in 10 years and my family is broken  feels like the world i grew up in is gone
  knowing that cheese makes you fat must mean youre retarded  dig that hole a little deeper
  duly noted
  yep retarded
better than other chains but still not very impressive
  so have i
  unironically a decent place to eat ive worked in restaurants for a decade and longhorn steakhouse is one of the only places i would gladly eat at after having worked there they have really great quality control and take their business seriously everyone is expected to follow strict rules regarding food safety and regarding menu knowledge which is rare in casual restaurants these days    i only worked there about 15 months but i liked it a lot       the only time i ever had a dine and dash table was at longhorn steakhouse and it was 4 drunk niglets on st patricks day i love getting to call the cops on a bunch of niglets because  surprise nog  we had parking lot cameras  parm topping on mashed potatoes was my staple food when i worked there because   muh 2 free sides a day  fuck i never ate so much broccoli and potatoes
  isnt all the food just sysco garbage like every other sit down chain though
  so they finally named a restaurant after me
  so did you or not
  this      maybe thinking of texas roadhouse
  the longhorn steak is my favorite steak of all time secret seasoning blend
  you can buy it at the store i have a bottle i like that their steaks are fresh not frozen probably the best chain restaurant primarily because they do just one thing really outback steaks are totally not worth the money i have no idea how they are in business still
  hell yeah mash and broccoli daily i remember when my mp allowed half orders of the parm fried asparagus as one of the free sides thank god i was lifting at that time
just bought a bag of these so i can make my own mcchickens at home anyone have any good mcchicken sauce recipes either way share your chicken patty / mcchicken secrets itt
isnt it just mayo op
  he doesnt know
  how can one be so illinformed about mcchickens go eat some more mcchickens to enlighten yourself fren
  you are actually sick
  what the fuck anon

/ck/ i am addicted to this red40 mexican trash food but it fucks with my stomach does anyone have a recommendation to fulfill my craving for chili and lime snacks
  chips and salsa
  yeah i like to eat restaurant style tortilla chips with salsa guac and a squirt of lime sometimes
  i know your pain bro i crack open a bag of these and i have to finish it in one sitting its like crack id recommend just buying a small baggie every now and then when you have the urge
  msg  because without that ingredient you would find takis absolutely repulsive
  this is a meme
  whats a meme monosodium glutamate an ingredient that is twice if not more times effective at flavor enhancing than salt
  people got hysterical about it in the 90s apparently its bad for you according to housewives 20 years ago with too much time on their hands
  its not bad for you inherently but makes food more addictive because its a flavor enhancer
  i agree but there was a hysteria about it way back when that makes the current gluten thing look tame by comparison
  msg being evil and addictive is a meme its a good seasoning thats it to imply that foods that use it would become inedible is dumb if msg was really an evil make literally anything taste good chemical like people say then literally everybody would enjoy say takis or kfc or whatever
  would become inedible without it
  its all retardation enjoy this hysteria from 1991  
  inedbile  theyre only rendered inedible because youre so used to the enhancement of msg  just think of how tasteless food would be without salt
  put chili powder and lime on a tortilla chip  eat  wow this is pretty tasty
  god takis are amazing they make up for the fact that i cant get flaming hot limon cheetos in the state i moved to    have you tried using something like metamucil what kind of fucking up are we talking about
  also i highly recommend getting some twang not laden with food coloring and makes regular chips and salsa fucking incredible i mix the mango chili and the lemon lime just talking about it is making me salivate
  dude this literally happened to me today i ate a giant bag and my insides died
    mexifag here try salsa valentina especially the black one your stomach will hate you
  valentina is icky
fukk me too its so damn yum
just made this baby for me and my peeps did i like it
wooooooooow a sandwich
  who the fuck says peeps kill yourself you stupid nigger
  stay upset
  eggslut sandwich  gods what a stupid name
  lets see your take on the classic egg slut recipe faggot
spoiler alert i did
do you even drink water
no i am a skeleton
  i am fasting so basically water is the only thing i can have today
about 2l per day i dont drink soda or alcohol
  youre going to live a long and boring life inb4 nerd rage
  if you say so anon i used to drink daily 10 years ago and when i finally got out of it i realized how much  i was spending on it what you dont spend on the ethanol jew you can spend on other things
  any good recipes
i mean aside from coffee and fruit juice/smoothies its all i drink i dont know what kind of cunt decided itd be the norm to only drink water on condition that it had been filled with sugar and poison first i for one pay a whole entire 340 per month for 17p/2l bottles of spring water so not only do i not drink cans of sugary peasant aids but the illuminati taps cant get me either i am demonstrably the best most enlightened and most knowledgeable person in this thread and you should all feel humiliated
  kek that something what a weakling would ask true men absorb moisture from air
  not nearly as much as i should i mostly drink tea which is not that great but still counts towards hydration
  tea ist mostly water anyway so you should be alright plus all the benefits of drinking tea
  thank you water
what the fuck is it with kale man  why is there so much arguing online over whether its safe to eat it raw or boiled  and how did it catch on despite tasting like shit
  huh
it caught on because its healthy but there is other food that is just as healthy that isnt gross so just eat that
  kale like every other bitter green tastes decent enough when covered in acid and salt and a little fat
    its amazing in soup any other use for it is objectively wrong caldo verde is the goat soup
i put it raw in smoothies all the time and im not dead so i dont know
  when its young and tender its a nice addition to salads elephant kale is tender even when mature
  a little cider vinegar and some bacon fat or olive oil and its good
i cook mine southern style simmer for at least an hour with a lot of chicken stock onions and maybe some ham hocks its good and good as the vegetable in a steak dinner
  what about heat anon you missed the one from that book i can cook guise
  its fine cooked or raw there are tastier greens though worse ones too
steam it til muy tender put in bowl with salt pepper and red wine vinegar optional fresh tomato slices
kale is just fine raw cooked fried baked or whatever its a fine vegetal and your body likes it the stalk is very tough and fibrous so if you want a quick easy and delicious kale steam the fuck out of it
kale chips are fucking delicious and its really good in smoothies so thats all i have to say eat my asshole my guy
  why is there so much arguing online over whether its safe to eat it raw or boiled  oxalates and salmonella i avoid it raw for both reasons  and how did it catch on despite tasting like shit  for me its one of the tastier crucifiers i would say  brussels sprouts  kale  bok choi  cauliflower  other asian crucifers  broccoli  i eat it simmered in a little water until tender same for cauliflower and broccoli there is a different technique for asian vegetables
  is there something inherent to the kale farming process that introduces salmonella i mean how does a plant have salmonella
how do i eat like a hobbit but not become morbidly obese im always hungry and i enjoy food
  high metabolism
  hobbits eat little but often it keeps the metabolism working 24/7 plus middle earth doesnt have processed shit
  dont be a sack of shit and exercise a little
just dont eat a lot in one sitting unless youre actually having dinner or something    also excersise but i always advise to try and do some excersise that you actually enjoy rather than walking or running for a certain amount of time just motivates the body a bit better if you are actually enjoying the walk rather than forcing it
  excercise you dont have to be a gym rat just go walking or jogging and get a couple of 10lb free weights and do some workouts a few times a week also dont eat a whole bunch in one sitting and instead snack on things like fruits and veg a lot and you will stay full
  eat several smallish meals a day of home cooked wholesome food  plough fields for all the time in between  be amish irl
  hit the gym  there is a reason why the hodge twins always say eat whatever the fuck you wanna eat    
  be a preindustrial farmer who walks everywhere
hobbits walk farm and smoke a lot of weed just enjoy that cozy hobbit hole lifestyle and find yourself a chubby little misses
  restrict the amount you allow yourself to shit your body will adjust your metabolism to fit your demands
  this  you can eat pretty much what you like when you arent a lazy modernworlddwelling pleb
  le high metabolism meme
  just kill yourself dude
  whats your problem  whats the point of posting nothing of value in an otherwise comfy thread just to make yourself look like an asshole

  why are you capitalizing the first letter of every word
    local 4channel man questions journalist and why thats a yikes from me
itt substitutes that make the recipe better only  kefir instead of buttermilk  natural high fat yogurt instead of sour cream
soy milk instead of milk
  butter instead of vegetable oil
  skyr is practically identical to sour cream makes a loaded baked potato not a death trap
  use la vache qui rit and mayo to substitute butter on sandwiches
  natural high fat yogurt instead of sour cream  those dont have the same texture though
didnt you just do this thread
oil instead of water
  they dont have the same flavor either  yogurt tastes better and has a better texture
i sub yogurt for sour cream all the time im about to do it right now making fajitas where ill use yogurt in place of sour cream
  taste is subjective plus varies by brand and often the thickness of the sour cream is better than more liquidy yogurt
  greek and balkan yogurt are thicker than sour cream
  what sour cream though because that also varies by brand and i can imagine by country too where i live sour cream is usually thicker than plain yogurt the texture of the yogurt is more closer to kefir
now you fucking millenials are ruining tuna     
zero reason not to have pull tabs on every can
dont even own can openers  the same autists who cling to trends like self canning their own food
american company whining about having to adapt    what else is new
  full of mercury  little to no nutrients from farmed fish    good riddance      costco has canned wild pacific salmon thats bomb though
sign in or subscribe to read full article  yeah im sure thatll get millennial readers
  pull tabs cost more  also they sometimes fail which is where a can opener is useful
  paywall
  the audience for articles about millennials is boomers guffawing at those stupid millennials
  you dont need a can opener for a jar moron
have never seen a tuna can without pull tab
  you know that you dont need a can opener for self canning right you do it in mason jars    what point are you trying to make
  tuna is nasty garbage fish canned tuna even more so
  enjoy chinas waste
they need to adapt to the deenz generation
  nice haul my dude
  that is absolutely disgusting clean your room
  fresh tuna is fucking godly
being more expensive than frozen salmon is killing canned tuna
cans on suicide watch
  also tasting and smelling like shit
  these piss me off they dont stack up as satisfactorily as cans in my pantry
  canned tuna ruined itself by being grossly over cooked and packed in water
  ok mom
  is it just me or has canned tuna gotten more expensive in the last few years even the garbage storebrand cans are over a dollar  and im not paying that much for fish thats only good to be mixed in with mayonnaise
    idiots    
  i would assume he means we dont have a can opener either as we can things instead
    butt blasted selfcanning autists detected
  retarded to have them on tuna cans because you cant use the lid to squeeze out the water
yep crack sips takes out ol trusty p38 spend 2 mins opening can nice fucken millennials
whats a god can opener that doesnt cost a fortune my last apartment had a really nice electric mounted one but after i moved i havent really had much luck the walmart ones are somehow worse than the dollarama ones max budget for a can opener that actually opens cans is 10
  a bad can opener is fucking torture i made do for years with this shitty betty crocker crap  i upgraded to a master chef which i think is the canadian tire store brand and its been a joy
who eats food from cans just buy fresh food
paywall  now you fucking newspapers are ruining digital newspapers
article about canned tuna and muh millennials  now you fucking newspapers are ruining news
  you could get an oxo for like 12 bucks i got mine 8 years ago and its still working fine even after the dogs got ahold of it one time they make good peelers too
    can someone explain to me why canning is under fire my chili is way better than hormel my chicken noodle soup is way better than campbels
  its called shitposting
  pull the pull tab up puncturing the lid but dont peel  drain the water out  now peel and open the can  zoomers 1 boomers 0
  you cant compress it though you get soggy tuna that way
  this is hilarious am millennial and have had personal struggles with can openers in the past bought a cheap one at my grocery store one day and the thing is a piece of shit it is so inadequate it cannot open cans i stopped fucking buying bush beans and bought the goya jew beans instead cause it has a peel off top hilarious
  just spend 1015 on one that youll own for the rest of your life    i dont know how people get by without ever owning a can opener canned tomatoes and beans are just so much more convenient
  canned tuna is for retarded overgrown children that cant cook for themselves    i own a can opener only because i still buy canned tomato sauce and coconut milk
  have four    increased cost  tab can break off  seal more likely to fail  risk of cuts from sharp edges
  tuna casserole is a great goto when youre too tired to actually cook
  do pull tabs cost more than having nobody buy your product because nobody opens a can opener   if some chink cant afford an extra 03 cents per can do they really deserve the business
   of cuts from sharp edges  not much of an argument since can openers leave super sharp edges too
  i remember liking tuna as a little kid 34 then my hippie mom boycotted it until they started putting dolphin safe on the cans so the whole time we didnt eat tuna i really wanted some and was excited as fuck when we finally were allowed to eat it again funny thing is it didnt taste as good as i remembered i dont know if it was because i only love what i cant have definitely or because dolphins are tasty motherfuckers
not opening your cans with a p39
  can openers dont require the type of forceful pull that a tab does i open both traditional and tab style cans on a regular basis in my kitchen and on the rare occasion i cut myself its always a tabbed can
  food tastes so much stronger the younger you are its why vegetables tasted so awful but as an adult theyre tasty   it continues to happen as you age too its why teens hate beer straight whisky etc its why old people love hot sauce   eventually nothing tastes like much its why old people food is just slop not like they can taste a difference
  i take it back actually pretty based
maybe they should die and decrease the surplus population
  forcepull  nigga what pussy ass limp wristed soy cuck are you
im a millennial and i have an original usa made nasa swingaway can opener
  nice hiss
  i have 2 can openers and 5 cans of tuna
  wow its almost as if millennials and every other generational cohort are so heterogenous that any statement can apply to them if you want
  why would anyone sell a can without an opening tab on it its not the 80s
  ok now that is based
  5 cans of tuna  pathetic i have an entire shelf dedicated to canned tuna in my storage room 3/4 flake 1/4 chunk
  give me two hours i will literally film myself draining smoked oysters with a pull tab tin
  p39  39
buy can opener  it breaks  buy can opener  it breaks  buy can opener  it breaks  buy can opener  it breaks  buy expensive can opener out of frustration  it breaks    fuck this shit can openers are a conspiracy they know every cunt has to have one and collude to design them to have a limited lifespan
  thinks draining water out is the same as squeezing it out  zoomers really are retarded
  struggles with can openers  everyone after gen x is completely retarded
  buy a decent one you retard jfc
    this  you fucking cunts    buy a 1015 dollar decadent can opener   oh wow it suddenly works  you cunts have been using plastic handled bullshit till now
  another zoomer too retarded to realize draining is not the same as sqeezing the water out
    i spent 40 dollars on a can opener and it broke in 5 days    this is a racket
        i have an idea how about we as a species stop fucking buying/using can openers lets just pretend they dont exist since theyre all complete shit its fucking 2018 we shouldnt fucking need them anyways
  while he might be retarded i think what hes trying to say is cheap can openers these days are so awful theyre not worth using    hes fucktarded for changing products though he should be buying a better/older can opener instead
  opposite faggot  we should use can openers   it puts the onus on us  we put the effort in   we get to eat the food made better by less effort made in the canneries
  yes lets stop using all tools while were at it
    fuck you faggots im boycotting can openers for the rest of my life ea and can openers no longer exist for me
  people trying to eat healthy  a bad thing    i am a millenial and i own a can opener some canned ingredients are worth it for sure i keep going through them though i fucking hate it the best can opener only lasts a few months     is there a single good can opener that actually lasts
how much does a can of tuna cost where you are it cant possibly be so expensive that its unaffordable even to the most braindead woman    in northern ontario a midbrand can of tuna averages less than 080 cad thats hardly breaking the bank
post your tuna salad/mayo recipes does celery belong there capers or pickles
  sriracha   fuckoff
  sriracha  oh snap its the memeing millennial weve just been memed
  nigger are you saying that just pure maynonnaise and canned tuna is better
  the only two options for tuna are boomer sauce or meme sauce
  its fucking water soaked nigger fish  what the fuck are you gong to do except tuna fish salad    there is nothing but shite you can make from a can  i cant believe americans actually have hierarchies about garbage
  hes so uncreative in his cooking that he cant fathom canned food tasting anything other than canned  moving away from the faggotry that is your mind you can do a lot with canned tuna and other foods besides making a mayo sandwich or a mayo salad  mix it with some rice or potatoes and veggies add it as a compliment to some pasta make a casserole spice it up and make a nice sauce to go with crackers for a snack  the fact that you cant imagine doing anything with it because dude its in a can speaks worlds to your skills in the kitchen
  what the hell ive been using the same can opener for like 10 years       i always keep the ingredients for this dish on hand for when i dont have them time/energy/desire to cook its simple but actually really delicious         also totally writing off tinned ingredients is completely retarded
  haha wow sounds like youll have nothing at all to eat when the nwo actuates their final solution
  nigger what my mom probably opened half a dozen cans a week when i was growing up and that rusted indestructible piece of shit still works just fine now that i own it ive never even heard of a can opener breaking
can openers which cut from inside the rim and are a slight nuisance to get started or can openers which cut below the rim on the side and are way easier to start but leave a sharper edge on the can i like the latter
  perfect  im opening a cannery and would love to sell you a rock to open my food like products with
  wow its almost as if people are paying attention to how much mercury goes into their body now
  so i guess theyre not getting vaccinated then
    i eat enough canned tuna that im probably suffering heavy metals poisoning and have since i moved out of home at 19 25 now    its a cheap and easy source of protein for anyone without much money/students that you can just stack your shelf with at least in aus
using tools that will fail  not going back to basics  not opening cans like our stone age ancestors intended  not getting a more natural experience when opening a can of tuna    rocks are also gmofree
  holy fuck what a non complaint this thread makes you guys sound like the fragile children
  what is this dude doing grindint the can to create friction is he heating the can up to loosen the seal or something anyways that just will put metal fragments in your food
  grinding away the metal until it is thin enough to simply open the can
  proof that only man children eat tuna
  hows that even possible  thats like claiming not owning a bottlecap opener when theyre literally built into everything imaginable
  this
  slides messily around your cubbord
  i have a knife you know ive been using a knife to open cans since i was a kid in soviet union and im not stopping now
hey ck is this a grapefruit   how do i eat it 
eat leaf stick and peel discard the rest
  looks like a grapefruit to me  maybe a little underripe  yellow ones are more bitter than pink you can cut the skin off chop it into segments and sprinkle a little white sugar on
  this dont be fooled by the attached yellow sack its poisonous and its designed to trick animals into eating it
  sounds good thank you
  pomelo    it has like an inch of pith
  well find out when i cut it
    take grapefruit  put hole in it  cum in grapefruit  eat everything
    ended up eating with a spoon  its quite bitter and citrusy  not very sour
  thats how i eat it cut it in half cover with sugar eat with a spoon
        looks like a pomelo
  could be for what i know  some old man gave it to me at the market as a gift because i bought lots of stuff from him  had very cheap prices   could barely underatand him thought
good morning anon would you like a pomelo 3
are they bitter
  ive never had one so yes would at least try it are they great like a mix between orange and grapefruit what should i expect
  i had it yesterday pretty fucking good the peeling is pain in the ass tho    also post more pictures of sexy pomelo
  sure as long as get a taste of you later 3
its sweeter than a grapefruit but still on the tart side they can be tough to chew if you dont take the skin off properly so please be thorough when you peel them 3            
  slightly bitter slightly sour and slightly sweet the taste is very well balanced imho its also very juicy but you have to peel it completely since the inner peel/skin is too hard to chew
pain to peel
  peel to pain
  love the texture of these you can peel apart each individual juice vescicle they are so big
  looks like krang
  id like to pamelyo ass fag
pomelo is the patrician choice of citrus and the best thing about them is the aroma oils in the skin if i had the money id just buy that concentrated oil and paint my walls with it its so nice
if its morning im eating bacon and eggs not whole fruit
  everyday whats your bmi mister lard lord
i have a ton of pomelo lying around the house as my mum loves them any ideas on how to use them aside from eating them plain maybe some usage on cocktails or saving the essential oils in the skin or candied even
  ive read that people make jams using the skin so id look into that anon
im only eating pomelos to tide me over until tangelos come back in season
  i would very much  guys these are delicious a must try
  oh i would thank you    would yoh like a cinnamon roll
  n o i c e
  ill try but ive been let down more times than you can imagine by exotic fruit
  flirting with anonymous  xhe could be a girl for all you know fucking faggot
  i would thank you i love you
        itt pomelo shills noone is going to buy your pml bags
  are you a cute chink girl 
  no
  and  go back to your bigot board
live with parents learn to cook rice properly years ago  gas stove teflon pot  rice is always perfect  move to college  glass ceramic stove no more teflon pots  no matter what i try rice always ends up crap totally overcooked and soggy    please help me i dont know what to do
  live with parents  cringe
    pay attention when you cook taste your rice regularly dont blame your pot
  yes children usually live with their parents at first you would know this if you didnt grow up in an orphanage
  damn
  you didnt live with your parents before you were 18 were you tossed to the wolves at age 7 and learned to live off wild berries and ducks or what      i am paying attention to clear things up i think im quite skilled at cooking but ever since ive been forced to use the glass ceramic stove im having problems with every single dish im trying to make so im not blaming the pot but the stove which is an absolute nightmare the heat is very hard to regulate  switching from actually seeing the flame and regulating its size to heat being represented by abstract values is very unintuitive and annoying
  measure properly boil water add rice stir turn off cover leave for 40 mins or so    unless youre making biryani or something then add uncooked rice to soupy mess and bake until rice
  at some point i imagine you lived with parents as well or are you some based orphan who was raised by wolves or something
  interesting method never heard of doing it that way will try it    ive been taught dad finished some culinary school to first gently sear the dry and uncooked of course rice with just a little drop of oil then cover with one and a half as much water salt and cook for 10 minutes on the lowest heat then leave for 5 extra minutes   when i did it on the gas stove it always came out perfect
  was pic related the school
  it takes some time to get used to a new set up    i grew up in the us wiht gas burners but when i moved abroad i had everything from communist era hot plates to an induction stove which i have now    play with it gas tops are more responsive and quicker to change heat so quickly dropping temperature becomes difficult on other sets anticipate this a little maybe take the pot off the heat when you bring it down to simmer or adjust when you lower the heat or do so incrementally    when i was a youngin i thought i was a pretty good cook but then every year that passes i learn more about it till i realize i dont know shit at all     also teflon
  thanks   i dont think im a good cook by pro standards but im definitely light years better than anyone my age i know
  do the 10min on medium high uncovered or until rice is almost dry then 10min covered on low
i bring it to a boil then i steam it for about 20 mins on a low heat i have a glass lid so i can see when its ready    all pots and stoves are different so you have to find what works best for you for example many methods tell you to turn the heat off at some point but my pot is so thin that it loses all heat immediately
  rinsing your rice several times is important otherwise it will be total garbage uncle bens rice that mommy buys does this for you vs the great value bag you have in your new shitbox no shame in draining the excess water off like its pasta either until you can dial it in
what are some good cook books to buy people as christmas gifts
  what age of people and what country do you live in
  i live in slovenia but people im around are interested in nouvelle cuisine not traditional cuisine
  i am also interested quick healthy food for an american in the midwest
  kys yourself you flyover inbred fuck
  slovenia  by sales of your products in the states they would like hand taps and hazelnut creme wafers
  those arent cookbooks you dipshit  you are a disgrace get out
  check out west jeebusville for profit self righteous republishers i saw they had a cookbook published for gay conversion concentration camp staff
i want back to the good old days where /ck/ was a lot more people talking sincerely about actual cooking and a lot less faggots trying to be an edgelord with bait replies  i know /b/ and /r9k/ are a place for the hopelessly pathetic but can we please keep /ck/ on track  dont get me wrong a banter is fine and i enjoy many people here but those who just want to rip on others or correct others with overly harsh or offencive statements well youve gotta go  also food rate thread only say something constructive edition
  faggots trying to be an edgelord with bait replies  /ck/ has never not been this
  are you kidding it used to be waaaay less than it is now and those people at least knew something about what they were talking about  now its just edgy teens who cant get a reply on /b/ so jump over here to troll threads
  i remember back in the days there was actual food competitions that were hosted here people actually came here to talk about cooking and made threads on foods they were making nowadays its a fast food/foodie youtuber board
  another case in point   i still like /ck/ for the cooking threads but jesus theres a lot of shilling now
    that wasnt even back in the day it was like two years ago  the quality of this board dropped quickly and severely
  shilling happens on all the boards at least the ones i browse/lurk i think the more you understand a hobby the more you can see the real threads from the shills      it felt like so much longer
  i know i figured it was longer ago until i thought about it for a minute  /ck/ is still the best board on the site for me but it used to be a lot better
  wow feels like five are you cereal
  karate chop cereal guy      yea /ck/ is makes top 3 for me
  i know its technically the recess puff meme but people blew that one out and said the table looked like the guys legs
  i dislike the bait asshats too but no escaping them    your sandwich could use slightly more condiments filling to bread ratio    also rate my dinner
        i used to upload some oc crab stuffed shrimp/fish bbq some burgers some gumbo and soups and breakfast stuff some breads a lot of things really i dont any more im gonna let the mods destroy this place just like they have every other board that they allow this shit on its clearly been infiltrated by sjw weirdos who want to push their brand of fascism on someone so they can say they smashed the fash or some faggoty shit  i scan threads for green text recipes and stuff occasionally and look at image/webm focused threads while im doing something that gives me periodic and limited downtime but also keeps me pretty well tethered to the screen here  fuck the losers let them destroy it then wallow in their own stinking shit like the fucking useless bastards they are their lack of impartiality and sense of righteousness is evident every day and im glad their shitty methods are plainly visible ill be glad when these niggers shit the bed and cant blame anyone else for the quality of content and their lack of anything to moderate
  years ago 4chan was not a site exclusively for shitposting particularly on boards like this
getting this mad that your tajikistani road paving forums have changed  get with the times you old farts     just fuckin with yall i havent been a /ck/fag for long but this place has really changed since when i first came here when was that you might ask this fucking year in january  hot sauce threads every single day muh vark deenz here and there shitposts about dole dippers or whatever the current meme was it was bad but its definitely become worse now
  i feel you man  the new mods here have a god complex and every decision ive seen them make has been to the detriment of this board  it has been a very slippery slide too  mohammad you know im talking about you  you are the worst thing to happen to this board since its conception
  does anyone else have a better forum /mu/ fell off long time ago then /ck/ and /ic/ followed and /lit/ is halfway fucking hate it this was one of the few places to have actual discussion without needing moderation and strict rules seriously we have been part of something memorable that got ruined by exposure
  yea still have text docs with green text recipes its the spreading of normies sjws and /pol/ alike
  thats exactly what ive been doing i dont even bother screen cap and cropping i just copy and paste gotten some useful info over the years actually and some recipes that are in permanent rotation because of their ease nutrition taste and final yield i cook for others almost daily
  please post permanent ones  i have two young sons growing way to fast so i need more options if you could be so kind
  well you could always filter out posts with certain meme words     /tv/ gets 100x better when you know what threads to hide
  but then you end up with four threads visible
  kek pretty much      wtf even is this   i see chicken but something looks wrong or unfinished
      sounds like you guys just got old
  im 32 so getting well on my way
  wrong actual oldfag here there was way less fastfood shit back in the day and a lot more cooking tips that werent bait
op is a cocksucking homosex
buddy i think youre wrong there was a lot more edgy posting before all the redditors came here and ruined it i yearn for those days
  nah they were almost all pretty good bantz or two people having a legit shouting match over some small neuance within the industry  most of the real chefs have gone since the new mods  its sad to see this place go to shit
  this board and /x/ qent thru the same thing
  do tell  is there some kind of silver lining
are the conspiracyfags bait  like the government chemicals in the water cunts     i think americans ruin this board
  id post some but then id be contributing  fuck this shithole im just here to watch it fall apart now its like sitting in nevada watching ca fall into the ocean and spitting in their direction or throwing rocks
pikachu donut
  i blame that newfag mohammad mod mostly  he has a massive agenda and none of it is for the betterment of this board
  amen i used to post cooking and home brewing shit all the time but theres only so many jiro/bangs/cooking with semen threads allowed by the mods and jans before actual cooks give up
  so close and yet so far
  i am hoping that has fresh bread i mean wtf going to produce that and not even an offering of butter
it makes me furious to see people try to take advantage of others by abusing goodwill they did this on halloween too
what do you do with lebanese flatbread  i bought some cause it was the cheapest available at the time and i had a train to catch
first post
  fuck off i wanted first post    second post
  id probably make a tuna melt with tomatoes obviously
  lol gotta be quicker to get that sweet first post
  eat with a huge amount of hummus and mix cool shit into it like jalape√±os or paprika or something
  im not lebanese but i use it in the morning for breakfast    smear some tahini  honey  add some dried dates  roll into a wrap    or    add feta cheese  add cucumbers  add herbs usually mint parsley whatever  add walnuts  add tomatoes i usually dont  roll into a wrap
  warm it in a non stick with real olive oil spreads etc spinach artichoke bruschetta hommus bhaba ganoush
  get the big one and use it as a blanket
lebs use pita bread for shawarma basically just dump some lettuce onions and some meat in there like ground beef and roll it its very good i also melt some creamy cheese like havarti in pita for a quick snack
syrianon living in lebanon here just get some good hummus and eat it with the bread also works for arabic eggplant based dips and dont try homemade shawarma it will just taste medeocre since you probably wont have the proper tools/recipe for it     also the only proper way to eat this stuff with any kind of dip is tearing a piece of bread off rolling it into a little cone and using it to scoop up some dip     another alternative is taking beef without any fat on it adding it to a food processor with a bit of olive oil salt pepper onions whatever herbs you like i think my grandmother made these with either coriander or parsley and add in a pita or two as well tear them up obviously you then cut a pita into four triangular pieces and spread the mix in each you can either grill these or cook em in the oven
  cut a white and red onion in half and save the 2nd half of each then slice each where you get shoestring semicircles place them into a ice water for a few hours changing the water every hour dry onions place into bowl and dress with olive oil sumac pepper salt garlic and turmeric toss to coat steam the flatbread and serve with yogurt/humus with the dressed onions
    oh this anon is right turmeric works well with hummus and/or beef recipe i suggested with a lot lebanese dishes really
wipe your lebanese ass
  i prefer chicken sliced into thin tenders/strings and marinade them for a couple hours in a similar one to the onions i just add onion powder and basil i then grill /panfry them and serve with the onions and bread
  i forgot i add cayenne to it as well and its yogurt not oil
  throw it into a garbage bin with all the rest of those useless terrorists
  hahahaha holy heck great one op do you mind if i save this image
  do you like hurting other people
  lol no by all means its all yours comprade

  isnt people using smaller carts more a statement of how people dont shop all at one place anymore
  stay outta my shed
    its actually a statement on how thanks to shareholders and corporate greed regular people cant afford to fill a trolley anymore    10 years ago i made 50k a year and 100 filled a big trolley now i make 52k a year and 100 barely fills a smaller trolley    meanwhile companies have gone from making 10s of millions to 100s of millions of not billions and are unironically saying due to the economy they cant pay bigger wages or avoid automation of staff    meanwhile they pay the already rich large dividends after paying their corporate level staff a million a year plus stock options and 510 million a year plus stock options where historically they made 100k and 13 million     so where we regular staff if we managed to keep our jobs have had less than 5 wage growth and can barely afford the cost of living rich shareholders have passive income out the ass from shares or owning the properties we pay exorbitant rent on ceos and corporate staff have had 3001000 increases in wage and had generous stock options added and to ensure the poor citizens stay poor the corrupt new corporate government make it impossible to get ahead from your current station so rich foreign investors can legitimize and launder their blood money from countries such as china russia and iran and keep the poor down    not to forget the tens of thousands of jobs that have gone offshore to manila and india so the companies can reduce staffing costs to ensure their profits are high enough that they can afford their 10 luxury cars 5 holiday homes and 50 investment rental properties while we cant even afford to buy anymore     globalization is the reason the trolleys have gotten smaller
    and ceos 13 million a year now 510
  interesting    yesterday i did a quick grocery shop using a basket i just grabbed some fruit bread some homebrew supplies and a few other impulse items and it added up to 60  i actually had to read through the receipt to figure out how the fuck i spent 60
    if not more    plus where groceries used to come from smaller companies that were privately owned or family owned and so didnt need to make that extra 100 profit to continue to be lucrative to shareholders so groceries were cheaper     when our parents warned us lack of support for smaller companies would be bad for us we should have listened they saw what the other baby boomers were doing to strip us of the security they counted on growing up strong unions our grandparents fought tooth and nail for penalty wages free or cheap college education options etc    made in china and made in mexico were warnings that we ignored to our detriment now we pay 10x more for electrical goods and instead of our brothers and sisters having good jobs and some form of security for the future chinese slaves make 1 an hour and try throw themselves from buildings and rich shareholders watch the dollars roll in    the measure of success for a company used to be how well they treated their customer and how many staff they had available to service that customer    now you go to a bank that makes billions and wait an hour to see 1 of 2 available tellers after avoiding the 4 sales people ready to take your money but not serve you once they have it    then you go to the grocery and use the self serve checkout to serve yourself meanwhile the savings on staff dont get passed to you as the consumer but go towards profits which go towards justifying corporate bonuses and shareholder dividends    and people wonder why our generation is perpetually depressed there is no community no sense of individual identity and no opportunity
    idk how old you are but do you remember that 10 years ago things like cooking at home and home brew saved you money you could buy a pizza for 10 or make one at home for 5 or buy a 6 pack for 15 bucks or brew 24 bottles for the same price    now because groceries are aimed at corporate chains feeding shareholders cooking and homebrew is comparable in cost if not cost matched with buying from other companies     as said the same companies not providing opportunities for the communities that support them
    so fucking true i made chicken wings the other day and after buying the ingredients it ended up costing me more than if i bought them from kfc confused the fuck out of me how they can make and sell chicken wings for less than i make them myself wtf
person asks for coffee  ask them if they want regular or decaff  they say regular  start pouring their coffee  ya know regular coffee is a lot like a pregnant cow  finish pouring  look them straight in the eye  it still has the caff in it    that is my bad coffee joke that i tell from time to time
  if your wings werent substantially cheaper than kfc you were doing something very wrong either in your cooking or in your math
    or could be a different country to yours
  i doubt theyre paying grocery store prices for their ingredients
    well after i bought a 12 wings a bag of all purpose flour the spices and herbs i didnt have from the recipe like garlic and onion powders or powdered sage and oil for deep frying yes it was significantly more expensive than kfc you didnt do a retard thing like only consider the cost of the chicken vs kfc small wing packs did you
    yep retard comfirmed the guy im replying to is talking about how fucked it is that cooking is on par with buying premade stuff i was agreeing with an example or are you that fucking retarded you feel its ok that grocery stores charge as much of a markup on groceries thaty you must pay to prepare yourself vs a company that pays rent staff costs bills taxes etc
  no you are just an idiot is all you dont price how much it cost you to buy all that shit in the first place you only price for what you used you dont have to pay for a 50lb sack of flour every time you use a cup
    this is why i support things like dollar shave club    why should i pay 50 for shaving shit from big brands through big shopping chains when i can save big i hope more shit like that pops up    farmers markets are great too you save a fortune on fruit and veg wish there was one for meat too
    no youre a retard
  faggot
    better to be gay than a retard lol
  sorry bro but you are just wrong saying you have to pay for the entire bag of flour to use a bit is the same thing as saying it doesnt cost you anything if you already have the ingredients    i can cook an entire turkey dinner for free right now complete with huckleberry pie for dessert
  retarded faggot
    definitely a soft brain kfc use their bulk buying power to get ingredients cheaper than everyday people grocery chains used to use that same power to make home cooking cheaper than eating out     now it uses it to buy cheap and sell at a bigger profit meaning that you pay more than kfc to make wings how can you be so dense
    outvoted bye retard
    see    
  love this one
  you pay more than kfc to make wings    do you seriously think this is what the argument is about of course kfc can make them cheaper than you can that doesnt mean you cant make them cheaper than they sell them for i am looking at the menu right now and its 229 canadabux for 3 wings that rounds to 75 cents each if you cant make a chicken wing for under 75 cents then you have major problems
    youre a retard too but youre canadian so its expected lol
    also thats exactly what the argument is about you stupid cuck further evidence of your retardation clearly you only glanced over recent comments
  so you are saying you cannot make wings for cheaper than kfc sells them for    bbut we are talking about who can make them for less    no we arent faglord   i made chicken wings the other day and after buying the ingredients it ended up costing me more than if i bought them from kfc  than if i bought them from kfc
  
    leaving conversation as retarded mong be retarded asf
  cant refute the point  try and get the last word in and leave    heh

  fucking kek
      this fucking sucks ass youre digesting jokes crafted by a marketing team
  youre a fucking idiot
  consumerist swine
    see in a place not overtaken by communism we get to look at pictures of food and eat food
  what the fuck does that have to do with old out of touch marketing execs making shitty memes in an attempt to make money off tards
  consumerist swine is something a dumb communist would say commie
  im no commie you can be a capitalist and still be critical of brainless idiots blindly buying into jewish marketing tactics
  oh no i laughed at something not written by a room of new york city liberals forgive me
      based
  youre digesting jokes crafted by a marketing team    you seem to be implying that humor and anything else for that matter can only be genuine when created with zero intent to create a profit that isnt actually what you mean is it    those were shitty memes sure but a good joke is a good joke regardless of who comes up with it

    eggs are my favorite food but never have i had a pickled egg i cant imagine what it tastes like
  tangy
  disgusting
  howdy pupper     want some eggs
  tangy vinegary spicy you can obviously control what you add to them in terms of spices and herbs i like some peppers in there red beets are a popular addition as well will only add a faint earthy flavour to the egg but will impart a lot of lovely colour  i like the pickled eggs on bread with a little mayo and fresh chives or with a basic bechamel sauce with some fresh strong mustard and potatoes pic related  with a little practice you can peel and pickled softboiled ones which i prefer but you have to be more gentle with those when you put them in the jar dont want them coming open
  smart
its a scam dont fall for it my dad once bought 30 dozen eggs and when he got home they were all filled with glitter
  reminds me of a story  15 years ago  dad was a forklift mechanic  goes to the cadbury factory to fix a forklift  he gets it done and is about to leave when the manager comes up to him  gives him 2 giant sacks full of chocolate chips  says they fell off the forklift so they cant be used  had about 4050kg 100 lbs of choc chips for the next few months    that was a great time right up until summer hit and what was left sorta melted into a giant chocolate brick
  you could have made chocolate chunk cookies
  the only way to make them good is with red beets then theyre great
  find a woman and make her eat all of them
  they wanted something for free i had to ditch the loads on the side of a highway twice its not even racist you cant even wrap your head around that
  recreate that webm
  i would have blended and vacuum sealed every one of those for the church
  fucking nog  what luck
this is my favorite way to eet egg s
  howdy boy
  that just means you have more eggs per box you still only have 5x10ft pallets of eggs
  make mayonez and hollandaise sauce
break the omelette world record
  op will have hands like shovels after kneading such an unholy amount of pasta dough or carpal tunnel syndrome      buy one of pic related  buy a fuckload of onion bacon dices tomatoes and white bread   wa la a makeshift scrambled egg business
  keked and checked well memed
  based jas fucking nailed the pickled egg i do this recipe without the coloring whenever i buy too many eggs dont forget the mace   
  how did they get out
  my dad had a friend who owned a farm and he would constantly bring us cartons of eggs  i feel you anon   farmer got busted for growing weed
  build a fort of eggs and sell egg sandwiches from it
    howdy
what does /ck/ think about edible crickets  my friend brought some back from the mariners game and they were actually pretty good and protein packed  almost tasted like shrimp
you can find chapulines pic at some mexican shops or trucks  also locusts allegedly taste like shrimp
  i listened to a spot on npr where a food scientist talked about how they fermented grasshoppers in the same manner as they make shrimp sauce apparently in a blind taste test people preferred it to shrimp sauce and its healthier too   apparently if you are allergic to shrimp you are also allergic to crickets and grasshoppers  i wouldnt eat it if it looked like a bug in any way though
bump
  id eat locusts but not crickets
  dont worry i got you covered  the only problem is that cricket flour is expensive as fuck bc the demographics of users are mostly hipsters at the moment
food you wifey made you also known as keep yo mans food ante up lads im all in with flanken ribs topped with black garlic  a ring of pasta ala velveet√° al dental

  bitch why the fuck you feeding me fibery precut carrots from the store learn how to use a fucking knife    sorry bro looks pretty wifeymaterial to me

sauce on recipe for carrot jerky
  this  and where is the seasoning
   spent 15 minutes cutting up a zucchini someone got screwed in the deal
  ive never seen one that big irl  those are probably portabello caps how have you been on ck and never seen a portabello
nooooooooo
op here i snuck out the house after the 3yo and wife went to sleep went to chipotle what the fuck man     any of you have women who are hot af but cant cook for shit how do you deal
whats a good affordable whiskey im a college student who usually drinks jack but im bored and wanna get drunk off something different
just pure gran spirits or maybe cheap wines once i have the occasion i drink a bottle of wine from aldi the store brand wine is like 299 a bottle and i think they have boxed version thats even cheaper
  evan williams its like jack but for poorer people
  old crow
  fireball bitches love that shit and it does go down easy will give hangovers to people who havent had hangovers for years due to sugar amount and how much they drink  or mix up some jungle juice with everclear
  why drink whiskey when you can get two delicious 40 oz bottles of king cobra premium malt liquor for just 5 bucks
start drinking gin while its still fashionable
jim beam evan williams or johnny walker red
  buffalo trace is affordable depending on how much of an alcohol you are
wild turkey 101 is cheap and a huge step up from jack four roses small batch is under 30 i think and its pretty good im not very knowledgeable about bourbons but thats probably your best option for cheap whiskey      red label is nasty if you really want a cheap blended scotch then famous grouse is way better its a little harder to find but it should cost the same
  based poster take note
hit yourself up with this op i know you said whiskey but youre drinking to get drunk at a party anyway youre not some fucking connoisseur
  jim bean grants or bells are my go to for mixers    gin is fashionable its a grannys drink to most people    stop shilling this overpriced sugar water get pussers if youre going to get nice rum
four roses
  at least post a good rum    im not a whiskey guy but im a big fan of jameson
  faggot
excellent whiskeys/bourbons  monkey shoulder  probably my all time favorite should be cheap in the us   buffalo trace  very good bourbon and really cheap same goes for wild turkey  dalwhinnie 15 yo  bit more expensive around 45 in europe but excellent if you wanna treat yourself
  getting drunk in 2018    go buy some psylocibin shrooms fag
  laphroaig or ardbeg to swing your medicineloving hipster dick around    fuck off
  jim beam be where it be
  maybe wherever the fuck you are its very much in vogue rn in the uks big cities and im sure this holds elsewhere because the uk aint exactly the main influencer of fashion
  fireball bitches love that shit and it does go down easy  why are you such an asshole
  youre right about the pussers though although i heard they changed the recipe    i just get woods from morrisons because student
  not just poor people but cheap people as well evan williams actually tastes better than jack ive tasted both blind so this is a case of the better product being cheaper and buying jack is really just paying for whatever prestige you associate with the name
  gin is a grannys drink  lol not if you live somewhere with a hot ass fuckin summer and nothing to do but day drink gin and tonic with lemon and lime wedge is the absolute best day rager drink money can buy especially since the quality and price of the mid shelf stuff like new amsterdam is easily some of the best of all liquors
  bushmills
another vote for jim beam
water it down if its too hot for you
  jack has negative prestige though  thats the point of drinking it
  bet you like your beer refreshing too
  what does malt liquor taste like
  like beer but sorta sweet and aromatic
  this or dickel rye
799899 in the pnw    drink of choice for both james bond and don draper     genuinely not bad by any standard just not top shelf    but seriously a fifth of decent whiskey for under 10 beats 20 jd any day of the week
  never buy cheap liquor if you can help it i know how tempting it is but that shit is a oneway ticket to hangover city
  old granddad is the best sub 20 whiskey out there  wish the place i moved to kept it in stock
  gin aint in at the moment and for that reason it is dirt cheap and my main spirit at the moment 22 usd for a 175 of tanqueray
  tangeray is good with a lot
  tanquery is shit though  only americans like it
  why yes i do enjoy hamms
  where are you from
  honestly canadian club is solid af ive never understood why it doesnt have a higher standing
  check out whiskey vault on youtube they have a cheap whiskey suggestions  i would suggest drinking less but something good
  tonic is expensive is the problem
  youuuoouur as smooth  ber nernerner ner  as teeneessee whiiskaaayyyy  ber ner ner    imagine being op  lmao
  this or pic related if you want bourbon
  i would suggest drinking less but something good  this  drink less but better    buy a drink that normies hate eg laphroaig because it smells like tcp and offer it around to everybody when youre at pre drinks etc nobody will accept any but youll be able to have as much of theirs as you please get hammered on smirnoff
  jack daniels is a tennessee whiskey evan williams is a bourbon but yes it is better than jack
  bulleit
  four roses or buffalo trace
    this its also a bit more syrupy if that makes any sense
crown royal green apple
  based hamms bro
  jameson or johnny walker red johnny walker black if you want to spend 40 bucks    jim beam and evan williams are huge steps down from jack dont believe the memes
  since when does the bottle look like that
  1792
  reddit the rum
  reddit dislikes spiced rum in general though  they have a whole paragraph shitting on it in their subreddit wiki page
  just when i thought i could not hate them any more
  laphroaig or ardbeg  not really something youd drink just to get drunk
  my local store had these bad boys on sale for 125 each once i dunno if it was a error or not but that was a cheap and wild weekend
  this what ive been drinking lately it was the well at my old bar and for 16 for a handle of it is hard to beat gotta cut back on the drinking though god damn i cant go back down that road      this also not a four roses fan myself but wild turkey is always solid i have a handle of the 101 for when i have guests over and dont want to serve them something out of a plastic bottle like with old crow jim beam is always solid too was raised on that shit      trace and turkey are not really cheap
  those two are some of my favorite whiskys but i really cant see myself drinking more than one glass of either    i also definitely cant imagine college kids sitting around a dorm room pregaming for a football game taking shots out of a 50 bottle of ardbeg
  maybe i just drink less than other people because thats what i do then again i have the epic tactic espoused in  which saves money and alcohol
  jim beam faggot
  old grandads dickels evan williams old crow four roses as cheap or cheaper than jack and way better
  wild turkey 101 if thats too expensive not sure how since its cheap as fuck for a 101 proof bourbon do evan williams bottled in bond or buffalo trace        go back to al/ck/    gin is fashionable among people who dont drink and put a teaspoon into some tonic water    ive had a lot of entry level rum and kraken is by far the nastiest at least drink pussers gunpowder proof if you want to get fucked up but have something that tastes good and not like rancid puke    i wish i could get ogd114 proof again that shit was fantastic    cc is fucking trash like burning garbage and lipstick    and for that reason it is dirt cheap  then why are so many bullshit craft gins for 40 popping up in the us and the uk    youtube ecelebs  not even once just use whiskyfun if you want to actually explore different shit
  jamesons
  mellow corn or dickel rye
  i wish i could get ogd114 proof again that shit was fantastic  why cant you
  where do you get your shrooms
  t dea agent badge ze83441973
  spbp evan  jack 17 handles here
  theres also 17 handles of dewars at costco if you want scotch thats the cheapest scotch youll find that tastes good you dont need a membership to buy booze at costco in certain states
  woods old navy is probably the better choice than pussers what with it being half the price and in every supermarket
  legacy its a canadian whiskey and a lot of small shops have it now runs about 25
  old granddad bourbon 100 proof
if you like bourbon look for ezra brooks its pretty cheap you might want to give brandy a shot too since a bottle can be had for like 9 without being some kind of rubbing alcohol/paint thinner concoction like a lot of cheap whiskey is
4 roses yellow label is my favorite cheap whiskey by far
  because im in canada and we only get the 80 proof
wojjpg
  wtf buffalo trace is 1990 a bottle that is hella cheap
its not actually whiskey but christian brothers is solid and tastes very much like bourbon
  get drunk off life
i was lied to i was told this shit was awesome its good but its certainly not four roses single barrel
  define affordable  kessler is like 20 for a half gallon  jack jim and all your other standards liquors are 2530 for a fifth
  when you say bottle i think you mean 750 ml or a 1/5 i generally gauge things by 15 l or handles my handle of old crow was 1799 before tax tonight    also location means so much on availability and pricing
mooooooooods     they are talking about alcohol again
  i work at a plant that makes a variety of different of drinks and the black spice rum is one of the worst in terms of the shit ingredients that goes into it only things that are worse are the cream based drinks
just dont drink while youre poor so you can focus on not being poor
recommend me a cheap but sweet mead
  angels envy is a meme they also made a whiskey line for bob dylan and it turned out to be overpriced shit
  varg is a drinker though
  malt liquor tastes like terrible beer mixed with road tar and crippling depression
tullamore dew is decent for the price
  oh im not from the us so i have no idea about those
ive never owned a pocket pussy am i missing out
wrong board
  no rinchan likes to cook so its /ck/ related
great thread buddy
  its a nice thing to have when you really want a good fap session but cleaning it up is a chore especially if you get addicted to using it
actually id prefer to sink my cock into ohgakikun
looks like im not the only one
  desu not really its not a lot like the real deal had one in college and only used it on special occasions but like  said its a bitch to clean up just rather whack my shit around in the shower and be done with it
  truth
  /ck/ needs more threads like this
i have several but most of the time i just use my optional hand grip tbh theyre a different experience not necessarily a better one the brand in your image is tamatoys but i tend to not like theirs as much as other manufacturers magic eyes is much more to my tastes
i like 4channel a lot more than 4chan
  i dont know ive never used one
  my first and only onahole was from magic eyes and it was pretty good one day i dont know what came over me but i decided to rip out the inner layer and throw out the entire thing in the trash now i miss it so bad
instead of onahole get a nice vibrator its a lot easier to insert as the girl
    take your girl pills sweetie
sometimes the clean up takes longer than the fap session
  why waste money on something like this when you can just pick up a frog and pry its mouth open
  where the fuck do you live that there are frogs big enough to put your dick in
  i visited a porn store in japan    they had a pocket pussy section    the big advertisements were ones that 3d scanned the vaginal cavity of pornstars    so you get a pocket pussy that supposedly is accurate to a pornstars pussy     they had a few of them cut open so you can run your finger along the insides    they were absolutely filthy from other people touching them but wow it did remind me of the insides of a pussy when youre scraping your girls walls     reminded me so much that i instachubbed     still didnt buy it because dignity
  frogs are bigger and more pliable than you think
theyre pretty good anon

  chives arent salty
        throwing shade on the big sipp  getting up constantly to refill a glass like a cuck    you faggots are the worst
  t doesnt know who paul newman is
  all not for profit organizations are like that in a for profit company everything is bottom line you are paid as little as they can pay you and funded as little as hey can fund you in a not for profit its the opposite theyre trying to spend as much as their money as possible and everyone has a cushy chair and gets nice raises kind of ironic
  chovies  chives
  im not understanding the whole manchild comment i just drink a lot of water
  silly looking cup  coaster on a non wood surface  not enough ice  this just screams i live with mummy
  its not that amusing though
  it really feels like youre projecting
  shshut up
  well im not really going to go take photographs of the rest of my apartment to prove that i dont live with mummy
  coaster on a non wood surface  do you enjoy having condensation just running all over your table
  dont be a drama queen there might be a few beads of condensation no reason for a coaster
  you must be joking have you never been anywhere where the relative humidity can get over 60
    paul made plenty of money from actin and a successful racing career  he made no money from his food venturebut his employees were paid  inb4 durr his employees are payeded  million per hour  you fags want 15/hr to take orders at fast food dives  fuck you all  he is a good man doing great things you conspiracy minded poor fags
  his coaster is a tiny pizza
  its ok anon we already know you still live with mummy no pictures needed    youre a good boy anon and mummy loves you

  because everyone is a crook and everyone lies right
  damn that looks really nice im eating the 800 walmart family size supreme pizza right now and while its pretty good the dough isnt the best
  probably the best tasting frozen pizza out there expensive though
  well paul newman sure as hell was
  been on sale at king soopers kroger for 549 for weeks
  thats still a little pricy for how small it is ill have to check my kroger though because id definitely get a couple at that price

  brightly colored plastic cups are considered childish thus if an adult has one its considered autistic a more normiefriendly choice would be a clear or neutralcolored plastic cup or a glass
  you seem like the one who is still living with mummy why wouldnt op use a coaster with a cup on the same table as electronics i dont get your pint about the ice and who gives a fuck if its a plastic cup maybe it was the only clean one he had that day
  brightly colored plastic cups are considered childish thus if an adult has one its considered autistic  by who
  paul newman is dead retard
  i can feel the texture of that cheap plastic brings me back to memories of being with my poor friends with unclean dishes some of the plastic was starting to flake at the edges    bad vibes op
    you are correct since paul died the foundation is scummy
  sorry i dont have any poor friends or unclean dishes

  nearly perfect even distribution of pepperoni on a frozen pizza
i remember when i got a tombstone like that after seeing it my brain immediately thought something was wrong and it took me a few seconds to realzie what was out of the ordinary
    100 profits to charity    they expect us to believe this shit they wouldnt be able to stay afloat
 sound like a fag
  profits are the money made after accounting for expenses not total money made    stay in school kid
  imagine being this dumb
  the charity is to papa newman himself
  why do you think middle class white women all want to start their own nonprofits once they get federally recognized they throw parties to raise awareness and fundraise the next party it could be something nebulous like mental health or gay rights whatever they think they can bullshit about then they can give themselves a salary for partying in the name of a good cause its straight up tax payer funded hedonism
  even hitler recognized some jews were okay newman was a edeljude if there ever was one
  red baron  any other frozen pizza
  best for the price i would say though tonys is a bit cheaper and pretty near in quality if you spend more you can definitely find better ones though
  i remember a story were someone sent paul newman a letter saying that he heard he was an actor and that if his acting was half as good as his lemonade that his movies should be pretty good

drink beverage with caffeine  get more tired  anyone else that has this problem i just want some energy
  caffeine has no caloric content so any feeling of energy it gives you comes at a net loss if caffeine doesnt affect you then your tolerance has built up and you need to take a break for a few days
fuck i love turkish coffee
  have you tried caffeine pills
  nigga you got add
try adding ltheanine to see if that helps also if you have a shit diet or poor sleep changing that would be important
  its time to make the switch to methamphetamine
never need caffeine to wake up in the morning  am i blessed
  no youre just so lazy that you never wear yourself out
  if caffeine doesnt affect you then your tolerance has built up  i rarely drink anything with caffeine anymore but the few times i do im never affected      yes i tried them when they were still being sold in my country energy pills coffee black tea energy drinks etc neither have had any effect on me      poor sleep  thats probably the issue then i usually get between 3 and 4 hours of sleep using sleeping pills
coffee and energy drinks make me tired as well too much coffee makes me sweat and shake like theres no tomorrow   i also wake up with no problems at 56am i never seem to wake up later than 8am   fuck me i guess
  i used to have poor sleep and caffeine had a fatigue effect on me but getting good sleep gave me energy throughout most of the day and caffeine enhances it for me now  a good way to get good sleep is to sleep early go to bed at 810 pm or when the sun sets and dont use any devices with bright lights like lcd screens an hour before sleep
  have you tried speed
you might be experiencing adrenal fatigue depending on your coffee intake
thinking coffeine or any other retarded energy supplement actually provides you with more awake energy    it doesnt matter how much coffee you drink if you are tired you will feel tired
  no but my doctor suggested modiodal      im starting to accept this as a fact no matter how much i change my diet or exercise i dont feel any difference
  its nothing but a lowkey addiction
  no caffeine prompts your body to bypass tiredness thats how it works it doesnt replace sleep obviously youll have to catch up later because if you need to stay awake you need to go to sleep but it can be handy in many circumstances
  no you get enough sleep and youre not caffeinedependent like officedwelling goblins
  if you want max energy i recommend good food water and sleep     that being said i switched out my morning coffee with 2 scoops of this preworkout stuff my friend gave me  less caffeine but other energy giving stuff that keeps me perky  i also listen to hype music on my commute that gets me ready to start the day
i have had problems like that before  drink/eat/take something with caffeine in it in an attempt to make myself more alert and awake  get tired and take a nap  wake up feeling extremely jittery and anxious   at times its gotten so bad the tremors are basically spasms still enjoy a cup of black tea though
  did someone shut in that coffee
  its definitely poor sleep lately ive been suffering from insomnia and caffeine feels like shit now
  i usually get between 3 and 4 hours of sleep using sleeping pills   gotten two hours of sleep within 48 hours dont use sleeping pills out of fear that ill overdose on them during an autistic suicidal fit or something
  how do i make turkish coffee with that much foam
  drink more water/noncaf drinks overall sometimes that kind of stuff is a result of mild dehydration after caffeine kick your kidneys into high gear      chemical energy  being alert  go drink a jug of olive oil then it may stop you from talking out of your ass
yeah coffee also makes me tired only if it has milk in it though probably just the milk
  sounds like you have lactose intolerance
  caffeine isnt that great for that  try getting some exercise and fresh air try eating lighter meals avoid alcohol   get out of bed when you wake up and dont use your bed for anything other than sleep or sex no reading or phonefigging or taking the laptop to bed with you that shit makes you subconsciously associate the bed with activity instead of rest and ruins the sleep you get it in it      i know its not easy but you need to get off the pills try getting more naturally tired with exercise it doesnt have to be running or lifting either go for a long walk take some snapshots of stuff or listen to an audiobook while youre out
i think i heard somewhere before that with people who are psychologically manic coffee makes them tired im not sure if its true or not
i know a guy who had to quit coffee it made him pass out an hour or two after intake something with his kidneys adrenal fatigue like mentioned above
  drink a tablespoon on cayenne pepper in water every morning  works better than the caffeine meme
  youre tired because you dont get enough sleep  you are low energy because you dont do anything or you dont exercise
  caffeine does not give you energy it just fucks with your brain chemistry and stops it from producing the chemicals that make you feel tired
  exactly
me too op i dont get any boost of energy just more tired and it turns into going to sleep caffeine pills too alcohol keeps me up guess im just backwards
caffeine is a meme it doesnt matter if i have any or not it never has an effect on me either way i have literally drank an entire pot of coffee and fallen soundly asleep for 8 hours like an hour later even if i go no caffeine for an entire month come back and have coffee it does absolutely nothing   i think everyone in the world is just hoodwinking me about this shit   sugar now i have one candybar and ill be outside doing jumping jacks on the sidewalk
drink whiskey and get mad instead
  do you have sleep apnea or depression
  had a similar problem when i was younger  you need to eat something with your coffee or all itll do is make you feel weak but unable to sleep  dehydration also plays a role so down some water before or after your cuppa
  it means youre dehydrated drink more water
  boil it over only once dont stir and pour the froth over gently into the cup first so you dont break it apart
  wow people metabolize substances differently fuck me
glad im not the only one when i get caffeine im still tired the only thing that changes is that my heart rate goes well into the 170s and i feel even more miserable
  take cold showers meditate do cardio a few times a week stop masturbating      psuedoscience coffee wouldnt cause enough of a calorie deficit to cause lethargy
  stop masturbating  le no fap meme
  youre projecting im speaking from personal experience excessive masturbation makes me lethargic
coffee makes me tired even if i was not tired at all before
  i think its supposed to be calming more than tiring although once the caffeine starts to wear off it can make you feel more tired
  when the caffeine wears off you get a rush of adenosine which makes you tired
  masturbation is an energyintensive activity that incurs dopamine release limited and at the moment of orgasm prolactin is released which remains significantly elevated for 16 hours where it exerts antagonistic effects on dopamine transmission sure the refractory period only lasts 10 minutes but the effects of prolactin elsewhere in your brain linger and make you fatigued tired and temporarily lobotomized you know whats even more of a meme than nofap the people who deny that sexual activity incurs a physiological cost like every other fucking action in the body as a result the cost of it should be weighed before indulging   its funny how modern insights into neuroscience and human physiology are vindicating really old medical opinions on the issue this idea that masturbation is a free lunch that can be done with impunity is only from the 1960s and was devised by social theoreticians rather than physicians
must be a demigod do you have dyslexia by any chance  at least thats what percy jackson and the olympians taught me
  im speaking from personal experience  anecdotal evidence in other words  and i notice you went from saying stop masturbating to talking about not doing it in excess  nothing is good in excess retard
  do you have add or adhd those typically react differently on stimulants which is why they are given those to calm down
  why are you so salty if you agree masturbation can cause lethargy youre arguing pedantics
  caffeine does not give you more energy all it does is block acetylcholine receptors to prevent you from feeling tired if you didnt have good sleep in the first place caffeine will just make you even more tired once it wears off and all the ach that has been building up hits you at once
  you said something completely different two times dumbass     pedantics  retard
  you do realize someone online saying masturbation is bad has no effect on your life whatsoever were not advocating for the government to execute masturbators calm down aspie
  say something contradictory   someone points this out    stop being an aspie this is myyyyyy echo chamber
  youve made me change my mind anon masturbation is actually good make sure to watch porn and masturbate daily and also make sure to inject heroin in moderation it relieves stress with no negative effects on the brain
  so now youre just strawmanning because you were too stupid to even keep a coherent argument for your own points cute
  your reaction is pretty funny your reaction is exactly the same as a weed addicts response when someone says chronic weed use is associated with lower cognitive performance masturbate in moderation but you look like an insecure addict when someone gives op multiple tidbits of advice and you sperg out when someone even suggests masturbation might be related to lethargy keep going anon
  i never said anything about whether im pro or anti masturbation this is you strawmanning because you again were too retarded to maintaining a consistent coherent point
  you seem pretty insecure about your no wanking crusade
  why else would you be sperging out if you werent an insecure masturbator each suggestion i gave was only 2 words each im not going to say maybe stop masturbating in my opinion from my experience to tiptoe around your feelings this advice was for op not you he can take the advice or not his decision doesnt affect either of us
well i always figure you could be doing black tar herion so not to bad
  why else would you be sperging out if you werent an insecure masturbator  lol i literally explained this you braindead retard
  masturbation is more difficult to quit than opiates dont believe me try stopping
  youre quite thick in the head mate you have an unhealthy obsession with people wanking
  hes just trying to help people  im tired all the time  suggests cutting out masturbation to help  reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
  
  
  and were trying to help you help people by pointing out where you are being confusing youre taking this far more personally and being unnecessarily recalcitrant at any legitimate criticism
  you have a picture of someone rambling about wanking on 4chan saved on your phone not doing yourself any favors
  no relation to my reply youre like a child upset that someone pointed out that you shouldnt eat the whole jar of cookies and are just throwing a tantrum now pointing out an adverse effect from wanking  an obsession with other people wanking     im a different guy i see you arguing with someone advocating that quitting masturbation could be beneficial to tiredness a premise that i agree with    my posts in this thread are this current one and  and  and 
  beneficial to tiredness  relieving tirendess
  no relation to my reply  lol you really are braindead youve been sperging out for an hour merely because someone pointed out how retardedly incoherent your argument is you took this as some personal insult and are now projecting your own anger and dick obsession unto others because you have no actual argument     you look like a fucking schizo
mommy he said i had a bad argument
  or he just has a proper diet and consistent sleep schedule so he doesnt require extra druginduced stimulation to get out of bed in the morning im a long distance runner and usually work out 56 times a week on top of a pretty stressful military job and i dont need coffee just to function
  different poster
  doesnt make a difference youre arguing on behalf of his original point which im guessing you didnt even fully read through considering your inability to grasp these incredibly basic bareboned points
  well if youre doing destroy dick december and wanking off like 5 times a day then duh it could make you feel pretty worn out jerking it a few times a week is perfectly fine
  dude youre just projecting like youre so fucking like stop come on
  no i didnt read most of what is going on i quickly skimmed i normally dont even browse /ck/ let alone post here i just figured youre upset with this bloke on account of his suggesting nofap as a remedy
  no i didnt read most of what is going on    fucking retard
  huh

itt we post overpriced zoomer foods ill start
cricket flour  its healthy and great but 40 a pound
  zoomer af
avocado toast w/ egg 9    piece of bread 15  half an avocado 75  an egg 25  total cost 115
  damn bro sorry about your cost of living for me thatd be  piece of bread 005  half an avocado 040  an egg 008  total cost 053  probably even cheaper for the store since they probably buy those things in bulk though
  this
  yeah so they wouldnt serve it at all sorry about your lack of avocado toast
  avocado toast is millenial food my dudes       zoomer food is like homemade skittles or some youtube shit
  worlds giantest gummy dude
  american sushi where they put cream cheese avocado and fried shit in it while slathering it in mayo
   people really do get too obscene with some of the ideas they come up with despite the memes i think nigiri sushi is just completely superior
  lettuce jammed through a slice of bread
  you made me smile with this article
  not trying to defend the price but for a dish to be feasible in a restaurant youd have to account for rent service etc a simple formula is 3x ingredient costs  still paying 9 for a 345 dish
  holy shit is that what you pay f  piece of bread 0005  half an avocado 0040  an egg 0008  total cost 0053    i hope you arent starving senpai
  zoomer  anything homemade  good joke
  based gloria
  kek
  avocado toast    how fucking original of you
  how is any of that zoomer
  huh
     sunday sport    the article about the guy spunking in carvery potatoes was better
  huh
i needs it bruhs _
  so quit posting and go make some
  how do i get octopuss in the midwest
  in the market ya goofus
  huh
      tough one

huh      a bullet      oriental  woah no need for that racist bs
  get out of my thread you rude idiot
  he thinks the word oriental is racist  i cant imagine being that retarded
what can i do with egg whites except for just making desertfood    i love making spaghetti carbonara and its way better if you only use the yolk but ive been just throwing away the whites for a while and it feels like such a waste any good suggestions
you could boil it in some sort of plastic container and use it to add to your stir fry or when you just want to add some protein to your dish
  fug      really is that what those are bags of thought it was rice at first    but well ill keep that in mind but im kinda thinking of some specific meal  a lot of people are saying i should just make omelettes and replace the yolk with a bunch of vegetables but that doesnt sound great either    i know its used in spring rolls and i found this recipe which sounds kinda appealing    
holy fk i realized i can make chocolate mousse with fucking just egg whites dark chocolate which is healthy sugar and some butter    lol ill start doing that
save that shit and use it to make a souffle omelette for breakfast the next day    take 2 eggs and seperate the yolks from the whites and add your extra white beat the yolks and add a little salt and pepper beat the shit out of the whites until you get hard peaks fold in the yolks and anything you want to add like cheese or chopped veggies you can either season it and toss it in something you can souffle in the oven or just use it the same way you would standard egg for omellette
  the only way dark chocolate healthy is because it doesnt contain as much sugar and milk as your usual chocolate
  im fairly certain dark chocolate is healthy in some respect or maybe not healthy but has nutritional value and like isnt terrible to eat    regardless thats what im gonna try to make with my next batch of egg whites mousse     seems to be literally just chocolate some sugar yea its not healthy but gotta get used to dealing with egg whites egg whites  some butter
chef zissou here when i have an excess of egg whites i like to put them to use in a saucy egg white and bell pepper reduction youll need a few whites fresh green capsicum thats the culinary term for bell peppers a blender and a loaded spice rack   first blend your egg whites and peppers until theyre reduced to a puree this may take longer on cheaper blenders then you simply pan fry until the blend is reduced to a flaky colorrich pool resembling the inside of a green tomato season to taste and voila a healthy nutrient loaded treat suited to any time of day i found that this is of course best served fresh but it will keep in your fridge for 4 to 8 hours good luck and happy cooking   chef zissou
  brush it on breadsticks before you put them in the oven  make angel food cake  bread your tendies
  i dont know who or what chef zissou is if youre just making that shit up but it has given you credibility nevertheless    blend egg whites  bell peppers to a puree and then fry in pan alright    i will 100 try this thanks for the suggestion
  whiskey sour
  hah alright ill definitively keep that in mind        some protein in my bourbon seems sweet
  drink it raw
  meringue cookies
  would this diet work for keeping and gaining muscle
  came here to post this
use them to make whiskey sours just make sure to make your own lemon/simple sweet  sour and dry shake before adding ice for a full abcscount shake to develop a good foam
egg white enema
  lots of cocktails use egg whites my personal favorite is the whisky sour but definitely look into all of the potential options

there should be a new rule where you get to kill anyone who tries talking to you before youve had your cup of joe
  forgive the dirt but i dont want to wash the used ones just for this from the left the first one i hardly ever use because its too small to my liking but i really like the old fashioned coloring on it the one next to that is pretty alright got it as a prize on gamepedia its large and the colors are nice too but it chipped so i dont use it as much as before next to that is my coffee mug i got it for cheap at walmart but it ended up being my favorite the last one is my tea mug i like the comfy winter theme it got and it has a singleserving infuser so its pretty useful hate how tea stains the shit out of it though its a pain to clean

  i have that walmart mug its extremely based perfect size and super heavy and thick
  man your nails are triggering me so hard first instinct is to say youre a guy wanting trannydom since no self respecting girl would grow them out straight with absolutely no finish or care for them like that even strippers would at least paint them or use transparent polish to protect them or buff them at the very least and your fingers are so thin too it looks horrible unless youre shirley maclaine in the 1950s if youre an actual biological girl do yourself a favor a clip thrm at half that length polish and coat evenly and if youre a man please snap out of it even a tranny wouldnt grow out nails like those if she wanted to pass untreated like that it just looks like the unhygienic product of autism
  p sure its a nasty ass guy

what is the best method to make coffee im torn between french press aeropress and chemex
  you might enjoy these books  the smoking scare debunked    smoking is good for you  
  which kind do you like more french tastes a lot different than chemex  cant speak for aeropress though although it is the most compact system so im considering it for when im innawoods
  heres the thing about smoking it will fuck up the person who smokes a pack a day but if you smoke something like a cigar or pipe since you dont breathe the stuff in and dont smoke several times a day youre not at an increased risk of cancer
  is that a benzene cookie
  do i even have to say it
  i win
    this picture doesnt really convey quite how fucking huge that bloody mug is
lets dispel once and for all with this fiction that giada de laurentiis doesnt know what shes doing she knows exactly what shes doing
  would love to lick her braphole
  whoever said she wasnt intentionally showing her tits theres no fiction to dispel
those are some grade a cans
  i want your low standards and shit taste
  lets dispel once and for all with this fiction that giada de laurentiis doesnt know what shes doing she knows exactly what shes doing  she once worked for wolfgang puck so worked her ass off catering likely the reason she seems to be inept is because of how she uses her hands she looks and acts like someone who cant lift a mixing bowl into the air and use a spoon to scoop something out of it she has very weak hands reflexes and nothing looks natural or experienced in how she handles items she looks like an actress trying to cook she is the granddaughter of an actress im going to bet before she went to culinary school she had a maid and nanny she doesnt seem like someone that has done much housework or manual labor in the maintanence of a house car let alone kitchen   shes lovely and probably as lovely a person as she appears but she has something funny going on with her face to give people pause and that is that she has a fixed cleft palate as fixed as they can come with  she has a whole row of dentures there hence the bigger than julia roberts smile and almost zero space under her nose to the top lip and so it catches your eye as something phony in the smile or just something being off which it is but its not for the reason you think its just very well done surgical repair giada donates time and effort with other celebrities to help the charity that fixes cleft palates overseas for the poor and needy operation smile
  she is what happens when a girl is molestered as a child comes out all skanky and dick crazy but is also successful and famous interesting contrasts
  she had a corrected cleft pallet  oooooohhhhh yeah that explains the vague somethings afoot vibe her face inspires
  hai guise does anyone want to fawn and mew over this base bitch with me  quit being a fawning little bitch the sooner you stop letting bitches lead you around by the dick the sooner they might actually find you attractive    take this cancerous betaorbiter shit to /s/ where it belongs
  stop making threads i dont like  its not me who has the problem bucko
  like shes cute but shes got a big fucking mouth
  the whole head is enormous she looks like something out of a disney cartoon  but yeah id fuck the absolute piss out of her
  id fuck the absolute piss out of her  lel same i dont exactly know why either theres just something about her
    cuz she a irl 3d animu waifu
  explain this  
  hey giada its art listen buddy hack hack im not going to be able to make a homemade white sauce today sorry
shit meant explain this  
  hello sweet potato 
  limp dick  the post
oh my
  that seething tranny in the back
  milkiesgib
quads for 4 titties please
  she knows exactly what shes doing  flaunting boobs for extra sales ie being a whore
  i bet shes a screamer
educating perverts about cooking a gift to the world
  milk delivery now
  would not say no
  in my experience its the really shy demure ones who are the demons in bed if you ever get the chance to bed an evangelical christian preachers daughter youll see what i mean the slutty ones like giada are generally boring af
  holy shit this actually explains everything
  when you have no talent show them titties
  how is she even slutty you dont know her incel
  shes a dirty little tramp no doubt im sure her hot holes stay quite damp in constant anticipation of a big boy such as myself to give her a good gut spelunking
  tities are a talent chestlet
  lucy and giada  thats one hell of a threesome
  evangelical christian preachers daughter  she was probably molested growing up
  i want more posts or books written by you i like you
  you bozos know shes been bangin bobby flay the past 3 or 4 years now thats why he got divorced from stephanie march pic related
  probably molested growing up  there have been rumors that her grandpa film producer/director dino de laurentiis had his way with her as she was growing up
shes got a huge head i bet it swings like a pendulum when she sucks dick
  mommy
  this bitch is dumb as a brick
  false bobby was likely cheating on her with all kinds of side whores including giada but the whore spelled out in the divorce gossip was some completely mediocre 27yo hostess at one of his restaurants it would appear bobby hitnquit giada which teases out shes an extremely boring lay
  no it indicates that bobby is one of those insecure guys who needs to be at the top of a power dynamic
  giada would be hotter if she had a cock and really low hanging balls
  shes too thin for me im a pretty strong guy naturally id break her spine if we banged
  i want her to shit in my asshole
  imagine feeding her a huge kfc bucket of chicken several laxatives a roofie and some viagra then sealing your mouth over her balloon knot and playing the cheeky waiting game
  id pay to see that
  laurentiis  laurentitties
  she looks like shes really ticklish i wanna give her the big gigs
  spoilerreminder that she was molested by her dad and she loved it/spoiler    read her book
  based revealing the truth behind giada uncanny valley delaurentis
  its well known on the food television scene that giada is the blowjob queen
  and some viagra  lad where are you going with this
  bobby flays daughter is pretty cute shes 23 just graduated from usc shes got a pretty big following on insta
  she has a nose like a pelican with dwarfism
  kek
  itt virgin betaorbiters fawning over some random old hag on a cooking board because they were raised by some whore of a single mother to be a submissive mewing eunuch that all women will detest manipulate and exploit
  8th grade  the post
  tfw have bigger tits and am a better cook  feels good man
  prove it
  idk that sounds like fan fiction bs to me    the reason why she looks a little weird is because she has a lollipop head in other words her head is disproportionately larger than her body
  hardly anyone is saying she perfect you sperg seems like its a good mix of opinions on her if youd care to read the thread also its mewling
  i hate how she pronounces certain words how they are supposed to be even if its proper it comes off as arrogant and i have always hated her for doing it both my grandmother and grandfather are from italy so it sounds natural when they do it but when she does it she sounds like a cunt
  its like that fresh tortillas bitch
i once worked with a girl who said giada was her favorite tv chef she was even dumber than celebrity chef giada
  what do you expect shes just an attention whoring slag and they always attempt to talk with some kind of affected accent to garner even more attention
  your post number is four doubles good job
the recipes from her first show are good
i heard about people using oil in a fondue pot to poach meat and veggies   have you guys ever tried it is it good
using oil to poach  also known as frying
  i dont think fondues can get high enough temp to actually fry anything
  so look at that photo dumbass
  thats a pot on a burner
  implying anyone who pays to eat out knows how to fry things in oil
  of course you use oil what else would you use that is actually a fairly common thing in my family southern germany we eat fondue  ie small cubes of meat fried in oil in a fondue pot on every new years eve it is an old tradition
  no it isnt you liar
is there such thing as hot pot but instead of broth theres hot oil
  btw yes it is good although of course you cant season the meat before dipping it into the communal pot so you experiment with a lot of different sauces and pickled stuff and condiments after you have cooked the meat
  if it isnt a common thing then why can you buy dedicated fondue pots with lids and ethanol burners and long slender fondue forks in every well sorted household goods supply store retard
  its actually a french thing of course
  american
  being this naive
  and its clearly boiling not frying
its called fondue chinoise you poach usually frozen small pieces of pork or beef in a fonduepot thats filled with broth
  we call it fondue bourguignonne in france we poach several kind of meats such as chicken or beef by putting it on metal sticks and in the oil usually we have some kind of dipping sauce to go along with it
  if its oil its not poaching its frying     yes they can but honestly its better to make a seasoned broth than it is to use oil     fondue usually comes down to dipping sauces though its more of a sit back and enjoy a meal over an hour or so     when my wife and i do fondue nights we start out with a cheese fondue and do cubes of a baguette and apples then we move over to a mojostyle broth and cook pieces of chicken shrimp beef filet mushrooms potatoes and broccoli when weve had our fill of that we move to a chocolate fondue and serve with bits of pound cake brownie and strawberries     fondue is fucking awesome but its a huge mess to clean up afterward
  also doing the same thing living in east germany
  this is fondue bourguignonne only used to fry little pieces of beef and then dip them in various sauces
  yeah its pretty good they have it as a course at this fondue place in my town
  its quite popular around here and yeah its freaking good you are supposed to eat that shit with a mixture of sauces though like bourguignonne pepper tartare or bearnaise and often potato chips as well and wine a lot of wine
  for literally other than hot fucking oil
  the bourguignonne variant at least in france is certainly far more common than the cheese fondue
  also those bourguignons are dumb calling it fondue fondue means melted you melt cheese not meat quelle bande de blaireaux
  et alors tappelle √ßa comment tout le monde dit fondue en france et en suisse fils de pute
  jappelle √ßa fondue parce que je suis comme tout le monde r√©sign√© au fait que les bourguignons nont aucune putain dimagination quand il sagit de nommer un plat et quils se sont dit ah bah √ßa ressemble √† la fondue savoyarde on na qu√† lappeler pareil gn√©√©√©√© sauf que ya rien qui fond bande de cr√©tins
  blah blah blah  but theres nothing melted you fgts  tabernac
  thanks i was too lazy to translate
    techniquement lhuile est liquide donc a pu fondre selon son mode de conservation et son point de fusion  toujours estil que cest le nom du plat et quil ny a pas de quoi p√©ter un cable tu vas pas chier une pendule √† chaque fois quon appelle la patate pommedeterre bordel    blah blah blah  anon is unnecessarily angry and aggressive
poaching in oil is definitely a thing but most people call it confit you cant fry at temperatures below the boiling point of water you dumbasses
      omelette du fromage
  is fondue just a cringe wypipo hotpot or something
  no its not google is your friend
which is anons favorite fondue bourguignonne or raclette
    neither    ive never tried fondue any variety and ive only had raclette under less than optimal conditions
    raclette and fondue are not the same thing and fondue bourguignonne is yet another one as stated by the agressive french speaking anon a fondue are diverse mountain cheeses melted in a pot with white wine and garlic in which you dip bread pieces a raclette is what is in your picture slices of cheese you melt and then pour on some potatoes gherkins and pork meats  my personal favorite is the fondue
  is there any indication in that post that he didnt know what you just told him
  i think  didnt understand because  was to retarded to use punctuation
what are some tasty olive oils to drizzle as a finishing touch on dishes
im gay btw not sure if it matters

fat is the filler food and what causes cancer not starch starch is the nectar of the gods health wise its rapidly converted into glucose and used by nearly every cell in the body  fat is a toxic sludge by comparison
  redpilled
  ketofags btfo
  bluepilled
filler food    compulsive eater concept    stop being a fat fuck
nothing tastes good any more fuck my life    not even spicy foods have any actual taste theres like a constant gross taste on my mouth and its making me want to unironically kms  what the fuck is the point of living if you cant enjoy food
ive got good news you are probably going to die soon  but being serious describe the taste
  its like a perpetual nasty egg flavor stuck to my tongue no matter how much i brush my teeth rinse or whatever    it goes away sometimes but i noticed that i havent actually been able to taste several different flavors for a long time now    i think parts of my tongue are permanently damaged or something i cant taste things that are normally supposed to be sweet sour or tangy its fucking pissing me off
  you got thrush or something nigga clean your mouth hole every now and then
  i brush my teeth every day
clean your tongue jesus  if your tongue is anything other than pink its covered in a layer of shit  you fucking americans with your hygiene practices god
  stop smoking
  go see a doctor you idiot also get a tongue scraper its amazing
i never knew that you needed to brush your tongue as well my momma never taught me that
      duuuugh brush your tongue lol    listen kids i know you may think that tongue brushing is some kind of chinese secret no one but you guys no about but im about to blow your minds right now    what if i told you roughly the vast majority of people that brush their teeth also brush their tongues shocking i know but stay with me now what if i said i happen to brush my tongue daily despite having this strange condition
  shut up nigger
  maybe something from the stomach im not a doctor but kinda sounds like some kind of baterial stomach thing     or you know how when you go into ketosis if you have ever done that you get that strange taste all the time its like something is outgassing
  brushing your tongue with a tooth brush is subpar at best gotta get a tongue scraper
  maybe tonsil stones or you are indeed dying and your insides are slowly rotting away there just isnt another explanation
  no  okay
  enjoy grills being repulsed by your kisses then
  did you eat chinese pine nuts recently
  go to the doctor man what if is some kind of tumor in the brain that affects your taste i dont want to scare you but man seek help
  so you claim to clean your tongue but dont  if your tongue is anything other than pink then its filthy  also stop smokin
  i knew a girl from high school that lost her sense of taste completely she got an mri and stuff but no one could find anything wrong with her i think it may have come back eventually but i forget you should go to a doctor faggot what if you have a tumor or something
  i dont smoke and nothing in that post implied i didnt clean my tongue despite saying it several times in the thread already that i do  stop being an illiterate jackass
  get a tongue scraper and stop smoking  its guaranteed to be caused by something you do but you are probably just seeking a miracle cure like the guys who ask for diet plans and programs on fit
  i had a head injury about a year or two ago changed the way a bunch of stuff tasted for the longest time pizza finally started to not taste disgusting to me a few months ago i was worried it would never come back    so yeah brains stuff can affect your sense of taste
  get a tongue scraper  why  its just an overpriced piece of plastic that doesnt do anything a toothbrush cant   if you enjoy getting ripped off then by all means
brains stuff can affect your sense of taste  fucking who knew
  he doesnt have a toothbursh with an integrated tongue scraper on the back  im lmaoing at ur life right now  a proper scraper will do the job a million times better than a brush
  theyre like 2 and metal
  you have a decaying tooth go to the dentist
post a picture of mouth
  i think i spent 3 dollars for a pack of 3 which last a year and compared to my old toothbrush does a much better job just get you one after that first scrape take a look at whats coming off your tongue and youll wish you had started sooner even helps me feel a little less congested sometimes
      you guys are starting to scare me  i would go to the doctor to find out wtf is wrong with me but i dont have any insurance which is why im asking a food board of all places  lol
    anosmia  phantosmia  sinusitis/congestion  might be caused by acid reflux/heartburn
  u dyin senpai
  go to one of the poor clinics
  have you eaten pine nuts or anything with pine nuts in them like pesto lately if so this might be your problem    
  poor clinic  those exist to treat communicable diseases not cancer diabetes heart disease etc theyll laugh at him and tell him hes lucky he doesnt want to eat since hes too poor to buy food
everything is shit  its called being a cynical asshole
thats what you get for being a frogposter
  who are you stan marsh shut the fuck up frogposting nigger
  have you gone through long periods of time without brushing your teeth it could be some kind of tongue fungus if not im not too sure sounds a bit weird i know manic depression can cancel out the enjoyment in food
  that is a side effect of some medications so if you started a new drug recently that could be it though really you should see a doctor about this
  did you go to a doctor yet
  not even spicy foods have any actual taste    probably burned out your tastebuds op this is why you should use hot sauce and such very infrequent
  most toothbrushes i see for sale have tongue scrapers built into the other side of the brush
  unironically you should see an ent or a dentist asap  you might be suffering from rotting of the jaw while it sounds nasty but fairly tame it isnt a rotting jaw can kill you    get checked asap it is fairly easily treatable as long as it hasnt spread too much it is always treatable though    good luck
  this is good advice if it applies smoking actually made me less of a picky eater by dulling my massively overactive taste buds but it fucks your taste up is the point
  probably acid reflux gerd it isnt always accompanied by heart burn
  also a good answer  op have you take cold prevention medicine like coldeeze or zicam im not a doctor or lawyer
  if youre starving in the us you are fucking up us also has amongst the highest heart attack survival rates in the world as well  my grandma had a heart attack on a plane plane landed air lifted to hospital quadruple bypass  she didnt pay dick basically maybe a couple grand she lived in a doublewide in the desert they were like fuck it cant get blood from a stone she lived like 10 more years  you cant be refused treatment for life threatening conditions  healthcare here mostly sucks for the middle class and aca only made it worse
  and by plane i mean a 747 jumbo jet full of passengers
  yeah coldeez nutz
  anon you have the cancer specifically butt cancer
  bullshit if that were true literally no one would buy insurance idiot ers are required to stabilize you w/o requiring payment not treat the disease   aca makes it worse  yeah they cant refuse you insurance if you have a preexisting condition or terminate your insurance if you get sick like before aca the horror the horror
go to taco bell  friend orders some soft tacos  my turn to order  well now that the children are done ordering i will have 6 fresh crispy crunchy taco supremes sub with shredded chicken and add onions for a little spice  cashier smiles and nods you got it man      why are soft tacos allowed to be ordered by anyone over 18 seriously crunchy taco shells let you know its fresh and pleasing when it gives a good fresh crunch
  news flash  your friend is the adult here
  nope soft tacos should not be had by anyone who has their adult set of teeth in
  well mr taco bell marketing shill that copy replete with over the top ingredient marketing is about as fresh as your stock taco photo
  onions for spice   do white people really do this
  yes  and they also think hard shell tacos are real tacos
  spicy yet not overpowering in flavor    cant understand why people wouldnt anon truly a mystery         closer to authentic mexican tacos than soft flour stuff
  if you want nachos just order nachos nobody cares except the person who made this thread  try hard taco  shell shatters  never again if i wanted nachos i would have ordered them
  shell shattering makes eating fun though makes it a bit more challenging since you have to think though to a brainlet like you it could be too much to handle
  yeah nice satisfying crunch but tomatoes lettuce cheese etc falls out  maybe youre a pig and it doesnt bother you
  not getting soft tacos al fresca
  there is only one god tier taco bell order and it is as follows  chalupa supreme  sub beef for chicken  sub sour cream for spicy ranch  add chipotle sauce  add pico
go to taco bell  see your friend on his iphone google searching taco bell vegan menu
  goes to taco bell  orders the cheapest item  now that the poor folk have ordered ill have 2 wet burritos extra red sauce 2 crunchwraps w/steak extra steak 2 gordita steak combos extra steak  1 starburst drink
  cheapest item  219 per taco  50c more to swap out with shredded chicken  269 per taco  cheapest item    wrong anon
  whaaat you dont like crunchy food raping your mouth  yeah suprise i dont faggot
  go to taco bell    damn you guys are lucky my nearest one is 15 miles away still go there for special events though
  this is why you order a cheesy gordita crunch
  adult  thinks onions are spicy
  congrats youre king of the white trash
  my nearest one is 15 miles away  consider yourself lucky   this is the view out my apartment window  you dont even want to know how much taco bell i eat per week
  americas job is to take foods from lesser cultures and fix the flaws we have done the same with the cuisine of every other culture with tremendous success  a crunchy shell is simply better than a floppy tortilla its really that simple  any asshole who clings to tradition should not be allowed to own or use any object invented less than 100 years ago its not authentic
  post a pic of your fat ass w/ time stamp
  nno
  post feet at least
go to taco bell  order cheesy gordita crunch  all the black brothers in the store give me a woop and a holler  cashier also black tips his cap and smirks you aight white boi  turn to take my seat  a luscious milk chocolate babe with hips wider than my shoulders grabs me and smothers my face with her breasts  get my gordita early along with my money back  its on the house my man
  trips of truth ironically enough i was going to make my own post about crunchy tacos being shit whichever texmex idiot created crunchy tacos needs to fuck themselves props to whoever invented the gordita crunch because they made crunchy tacos edible that way
  some franchises upcharge by quite a bit too my closest store upcharges 12 dollars on every nonvalue menu item
    forgot op was ordering supreme and mot regular in which case the price you mentioned is probably accurate for all stores
  having posted more taco bell than probably anyone else here in at least the past couple of months i can confidently say that your opinion is shit and your thread can hardly be considered bait but im drunk so heres your you
real talk here     crunch tacos are good man but to be honest they fill them with fifty percent less meat than they do soft tacos because they will break leak sog crack melt etc    if you order soft you get fifty percent more meat filling its economical to do so
  e  stopped reading there
  comfy view is this philadelphia
  people shouldnt like things that i dont like wahhhhhhhhhh    kys yourself faggot
  ill take six greasy cheap meat carb sandwiches and a got dam drink thats flavored like a flavored sugar cube  somehow i feel like im better for it
  cashier smiles and nods you got it man  gives jerkoff hand signal to nearby taco artist  op gets free dayold semen on his tacos
  eating  fun  guess whos the child here
tfw there actually is a taco bell in my country  tfw live on the other side of the country so i cant go there

    pretty much standard cereal in the uk thankfully any shop has it they do a big 1kg box of it for about 4
    not as good as this       you sir have it correct
  my morning ritual  pour big bowl of cornflakes  throw in 2 sliced strawberries and half a banana also sliced up  dash of sugar  finish other half of banana as i leave for work
  but who eats the cornflakes
  my goldfish i just eat half the banana

  patrician taste here
what i like about grape nuts is that there are no gimmicks theres no cartoon bird prancing about on the box cover theres no commercial with barney and fred getting in fist fights over a bowl of grape nuts you get a box full of cereal and thats it its not even a big box filled with air and prizes its just a pound of wheat and barley with a picture on the front   what i have here is living proof that grape nuts is truly life changing a four pound box of grape nuts in all its glory any other box of cereal this size would weigh half as much which makes them half as good theres something to be said about a cereal with the same density as sand  just holding the box gives you a sense of power like holding a baseball bat or a meat cleaver there is some serious loft to this cereal i could kill a man if i had to with this and im not even joking  another thing i like about grape nuts is that it sinks right to the bottom of the bowl theres nothing glamorous about it no lame ass snaps or crackles no different colors no marshmallows just a pile of food sitting at the bottom of a bowl of milk  eating the food is an adventure within itself bite too soft and you arent gonna break a one bite too hard and you might chip a tooth it really is a wild mans cereal  im not even going to talk about the taste of grape nuts because there isnt any if there wasnt milk you would swear that you were eating gravel the only different being that gravel might soften up a bit  the very best part of grape nuts is after the whole eating experience if youve ever accidentally swallowed a rock you know what its like to eat a bowl of grape nuts the feeling of it sitting in the bottom of your stomach is a reminder for the rest of the day that you actually ate the stuff rewarding you long long after you take the last bite
  how could you ironically do that
  jhonen vasquez likes grape nuts so i hate them
    about 150 for the 500g box or 3 for the 1kg box when on offer rrp is ridiculous on branded cereal
  i eat this dry and wash it down with some black coffee
after reading articles about foods that improve blood circulation i see nuts mentioned all the time  but none of them is specific enough  is any nut ok  which nut is healthy  my favorite nut is cashew nut  will it do
  deez
  activated almonds
  improve blood circulation  spinach and beets contain nitrates which dilate the blood vessels
fish oil and viagra
dont forget garlic
  which nut to improve blood circulation    if you want to improve blood circulation stop eating and get on an exercise bike and pedal for at least 20 minutes a day  i pedal for 1 hr a day

  literally everyone who has made chili con carne has added coffee at one time or another not to mention redeye gravy has coffee as the primary flavoring maybe its just a southern thing but you yankees are really out of touch

for me its the mcchicken the best fast food sandwich
mayo is gross put bbq sauce on
  for you its womens skin tight denim
wendys just came out with a maple syrup bbq sandwich
  skinny jeans  faux workers boots  apparently the cock is fo you too       mcchicken sauce isnt mayo
i wish they were bigger i usually end up ordering at least 5
my local mcdonalds raised the price of the mcchicken to 219 im fucking furious
  kek its still a single dollar in places that arent cucked like yours
  for me its the junior chicken the best fast food sandwich    like the mcchicken but with a perfect spice blend
  bbq sauce is disgusting
i always ask for the mcchicken without the bun and ask for the mayo on the side then apply it yourself that way you can get two and cut down on the calories
  try bbq  mayo
for me its churchs 1 spicy chicken sandwich the best fast food sandwich
  i dont understand your math how do you end up with two mcchickens do you order 2 without the buns
  yeah sometimes i just meant i feel better about eating two if i skip the buns
  good choice anon
  now i dont mean to insult your tastes but you are wrong i was a devout chicken man for at least a decade when it came to fast food but the current superior deal when it comes to fast food is the 1 for 10 nuggets and 126 for a rodeo burger rope in the flavor just the frustration in the asian managers voice when he says would you like cheese no how about a drink with that no the look of disgust is well worth the price
  it was ok 2 decades before they tried to make it from chicken leftovers and three day old buns were fine to serve  stop shilling  they are now overpriced shit

why does no one think that being charged the weight of flour/candy/packaging raising your misdemeanor to a felony as an issue
  what do you want police to do chemically separate all the thc and weigh it by itself thats retarded play stupid games win stupid prizes
  this dude literally had a few cookies and gummy bears and now his life is completely ruined he cant own a gun or vote or get a professional job because of some cookies

  i dunno maybe we should ask the guy who stole a pizza from some kids and got a life time sentence without parole because of the three strikes and youre out law
  because of some cookies  no dickhead its because of the illegal drugs in them
  tyranny only effects the common man

if one gram of weed touches a million pounds of corn you have 1 million pounds of drugs
  i would guess 1 of the us population even knows thats how it works its fucked up
  imagine your friend in school bakes you a tray of weed brownies then you get busted with it and charged with having 22 pounds of marijuana on record and sent to jail it hurts my soul
  bakes you a tray of weed brownies  then you deserve jail and i dont give a fuck about how you want to nitpick it stop breaking the law  bbbut i should be able to break the law if i dont agree with it  no fuck off
  my first reaction to seeing this thread in the catalog was why would you be a chef or otherwise care about food if you were a drug dealer whos probably shooting up or tweaking out all the time with zero appetite but then i clicked into it and saw its marijuana rather than drugs
      which have you broke faggot
  i should be able to break a widely recognized and current law because youre not aware of the hundreds of archaic forgotten ones xd  kill yourself underage retarded faggot
  bake pot brownies  give them to someone you want to fuck over  report them to the cops
  sure bro disregard what you said and ramp up the bootlicking larp
  as long as it isnt on based mel
    because youre not aware of the hundreds of archaic forgotten ones  its even worse than that since theres only 20 laws at that link they mostly involve very specific and obscure situations you wouldnt be in anyway and theyre all limited to different state jurisdictions meaning im pretty sure nobody here has broken any of those laws
  
  more of the same  why do you think anyone here both lives in one of those states and participated in the bizarre set of circumstances the respective law for the state in question covers come up with a better argument you absolute retard
  being this btfo and lying this hard to keep up a shitty larp because the cool kids smoked grass in middle school while you sucked dick at your uncles house instead so now youre asspained and want people to go to prison over plants
  im not even the guy you were arguing with about drugs i dont disagree with you about drugs i disagree with how you keep on being a retard with shit arguments come up with a better argument you absolute retard
  yeah i bet you arent
    this is your brain on drugs  yikes
  i replied to the guy you were arguing with you just dont understand how to read here try again    
  this dude literally had a few cookies and gummy bears  he had illegal narcotics  now his life is completely ruined  no hell probably be sentenced to a couple months in county jail then serve an 11/29 probation  he cant own a gun  hes a cook he doesnt give a fuck  or vote  he smokes weed he doesnt give a fuck  or get a professional job  hes a cook he doesnt give a fuck  because of some cookies  illegal narcotic cookies  also fuck off

    though apothecary 330 doesnt require a password 250 handselected taste makers throughout fort lauderdale will be given a gold elite membership coin which will allow them to attend exclusive tastings and events taste makers typically are frequent customers or others in the food services industry for anyone else whod like to become one he or she may ask management    kurzawinski says the membership coin is for anybody thats going to come in and actually appreciate the different fine spirits that they have though he adds  were walking people through the building every single day so its not like its completely exclusive its just an extra privilege for some of our valued customers    sounds like people vetted as drug users honestly to think he wasnt dealing naming his place apothecary and having a drug scale suspicious    the whole thing could have been part of the laced gummi bear investigation nationwide because children in polk county left their middle school in ambulances after having shared them and daycare workers gave them to children in chicago
you know i actually feel really bad for this guy he was on the current season of hells kitchen and talks about how both of his parents died recently and within a week of each other i dont want to speculate but its possible that the second parent killed themselves out of grief otherwise it would be quite the coincidence they died within days of each other
  goodbye 99 of chefs then
why do you keep all that old dried up bread just throw it away what are you even going to do with that
why would you buy bread at all are you poor
  better question is why arent you baking your own bread
  ruins your chex mix
  because grains arent good for you and overall are something you should eat less if any at all  its not like we as first worlders cant use availability or affordability as an excuse anymore so why not finally return to eating what were supposed to
  because grains arent good for you    found the ketolard
  unfermented grains arent good for you    sourdough starter basically transforms wheat into a completely different food my man
  garlic soup
  list of cool things to do with old bread  make breadcrumbs to use in other recipes  make breadcrumb fritters serve with honey or syrup old spanish recipe in celebration of easter  make white gazpacho  make kvass extremely easy  make strata  shit the other day i used some of my homemade sourdough breadcrumps as a filler in some protein bars i was making because i was out of oats tastes great its like little crunchy toastflavored bits very tasty    gotta use ur heads frens dont be wasteful
what are these mushrooms called my girlfriend absolutely loves them

  theyre great i love to batter them in tempura and fry them up as a snack
anyone else not sure about uber eats the 5 fee doesnt seem worth it compared to just getting the food yourself
yeah no shit only lazy people use it
why cant you buy your food by yourself
  thats the price of convenience
  i have a car with very small doors and its difficult to get in and out of it its certainly worth the 5 to get my evening mcdonalds delivered
  theyre either drunk cant drive on drugs elderly sick lazy and/or live in a populated area where its easier to have shit delivered and worth the fee
in barcelona we have that but glovo is much better they only charge 190 and deliver anything not just food
  i work with a guy in his mid 30s he was shocked to learn he needs to be on blood pressure medication since he started uber eats has brought him burger king kfc mcdonalds etc on a daily basis im a fat fuck but i love my bourbon  beer  my wife is a great cook i might eat the shit he eats once or twice a month
  lost thank you for this post
  ill never use it  the restaurants get like 40 what theyd usually make  good quality will plummet bc fat lazy cunts   ill forever have to cook now and cheat nights will now be less frequent where we must eat out at finer dining places  well at least ill learn faster and faster to be a killer dad cook in da house    but seriously uber eats is a disease
  ive never had food delivered to me i wouldnt know how to interact with the delivery person
itt neets  if your time is worth anything hell yeah its worth it
  the only time i use uber eats/doordash/grubhub etc is when im at work ordering with coworkers because we cant leave work to get food and so we can all split the fees      if youve paid and tipped on your card on the app 99 of the time they hand you your food and leave without a single word usually its some dirty somalian or some fuck that doesnt speak english anyway
i order two meals it still isnt economic but i make a lot of money
  i know people who have worked for uber eats and people who have used the service neither have had anything good to say about it
  tfw theres no delivery fee for uber eats in my country
ubereats already takes 30 of the bill from the restaurant the 5 delivery fee is just jewish
  every one posts like they live alone and never have company  5 isnt much when you have a party guests over for an event or simply gaming with a few friends great time to have food delivered instead of missing out on fun times while working in the kitchen
  if you hesitate to spend 5 in any context you shouldnt be using uber eats you should be on the streets practicing your panhandling
  
  actually uber takes a smaller cut than that the olacwi work for uses it
i mean when youre working in the office and you want to get some actual work done then it would make sense to not have to take the time to go all the way down to the street and walk or drive to the place wait in line to order then wait for your food then reverse that trip     its called efficiency and productivity especially if what youre craving is unreasonably far away
either make food at home or go sit in a restaurant  food delivery is the worst of both worlds
paying extra for slightly warm and soggy food  no thanks everything ends up gross sitting in the back some dudes corolla for longer than it should
  literally paying extra to have a guy go get food that doesnt travel well in the first place and have it sit in his backseat for 20 minutes rotting away in a foil container  get off your fucking ass and go eat it fresh
  if it costs an extra 5 then no no no
i do it once or twice a month  im not a poorfag not rich either 90k/yr  if youre busy on projects sick have unexpected company over or just would rather start a camp fire instead of driving all over the place and have 5 bucks to spare go for it    just use it in moderation
  what did you just reiterate what the poster above you said
my job is uber eats i deliver you your food i actually make decent money
  define decent money
    how about friday for example i did 5 deliveries and made 60 bucks the time it took me was 3 hours and the deliveries werent back to back there was about a 1020 minutes wait between each one
  20 an hour is good money  how much gas did you go through you need to subtract that
     20 bucks an hour is good to me i have no degree and like 2 years of community college as far as gas i didnt use much really maybe a gallon i also drive a honda civic so i make great gas mileage
  sounds like its a good deal then power to you i patronize uber quite often so i appreciate there are people who do it
  hurr im le superior because i wageslave  if you dont have a passive income your time value off the clock is exactly the same as the neets you constantly shit on
  underrated
just tried mcdonalds sweet potato fries yuck never again
  sweet potatoes suck anyway

i dont give a crap if youre vegan just dont tell me you enjoy eating whole wheat/whole grain bread it tastes like sawdust you eat it because you see it as the only healthy option you have bread stockholm syndrome
  if you dont like the taste and mouthfeel of a dutch style hearty loaf of whole grain bread with some seasalt butter you are unequivocally a massive faggot
  huh
bread  healthy
  whole wheat is vegan  what
  grow up kid
does op have psychosis is he having a stroke
  vegan  wholewheat  what did he mean by that
i only add 50g of whole wheat flour to my bread thats all you need whole wheat flour is a rip off anyway

tea  coffeedrugsenergy drinks  what is your favorite /ck/ mine is pic related
  gunpowder or matcha i like strong green tea
  drinking this right now used to buy 2 lb of pinhead gunpowder from coffee bean direct though they have since split off their tea distribution to another brand this stuff is better anyway
puer
  whats a good place to buy tea from also how should i brew tea
  whats a good place to buy tea from   buying tea
  oh well sorry ming but not everyone has a fucking tea garden
  i buy the temple of heaven stuff at a local asian food market its considerably less expensive there than online    as far as brewing i do it completely wrong
  i know that this is not my place to say this with me being even more of a novice than you and all but niggar what the fuck is that
  its gunpowder green tea brewed in a reusable kcup with a paper filter thats the second or third extract of those leaves
i love tea and coffee but youve got to be retarded to put them above hard stims  inb4 le degenerate xddd  ok no one cares about your sheltered underage opinion
  hard stims  if im going to be addicted to stimulants id like them to not ruin my life and be widely available thanks tea and coffee for me
  you dont have to be addicted to hard stims to use them yknow  but if you have an addictive personality and have to be addicted to something thats stimulant i absolutely agree with you
  
  ive never had problem with addiction of anything up to and including nicotine so it probably wouldnt be most of the coke and methheads i have known all had problems though the one or two that didnt were just really shitty managers and terrible human beings
im not saying that hard stims arent addictive because they definitely can be to some people but i think that tweakers stand out so much that they make all stim users look bad     ive been using all kinds of stimulants amphetamine coke cathinones etc for over 5 years and i can use for a couple of days and just forget about it for months until i get the opportunity to use again were out there its just harder to spot us because we dont look like speedfreaks
      
  speed fucked my heart not touching that shit again its fun the first few times and useful as a shortterm adhd solution but you dont really want to go down that path meanwhile tea is just the comfiest
what is a good tea that will get me really mellow
  mix some cannabis in with your loose leaf
  cannabis  im not a retard
  hey i totally understand that man for me the pros far outweigh the cons but nonetheless props on you for understanding that and not fucking up your life for a high
  you asked for tea that would make you mellow
  can i unironically make cannabis tea
  im pretty sure thc doesnt dissolve well in water but is very fatsoluble so keep that in mind
    it wont be very strong but you can infuse it with fat so butter and milk and cream i believe
      tfw they dont know that thc isnt water soluble it has to bind with fats
  fat like u
i havent had tea before so my friend gave me a few packages of tea to try which order of tea flavors should i try for the best experience  pure chamomile  earl grey  english breakfast  green tea  pure peppermint
  earl grey is good
  well for starters two of those are not tea they come from the wrong plants  mint and chamomile are nice and all and honestly i would take a bagged version of either over just about any bagged real tea  twinings english breakfast is definitely the best of the remaining three try it with milk and sugar i guess
  for me its tieguanyin i grew up with gongfu cha on special occasions now i drink coffee but i sometimes think about buying some good tea
everyday drinking jasmine pearl is my go to although monkey picked oolong is my favorite
  im crazy about roasted oolongs at the moment especially wuyi oolongs expecting a shipment of some lapsang souchong and gunpowder green tea soon though going to make moroccan mint tea with the gunpowder for my family this christmas
  gunpowder is a garbage green tea              brewing asian market tea in a kurig  this is worse than drinking bagged tea      what the fuck happened to the tea general im leaving this god forsaken thread forever
  tea tisane it really doesnt matter anon its all hot plant juice
i really love eastfrisian black tea nicely made with some brown sugar and cream     here is where i bought my last one btw
  hemp flower tea is a thing
  juice juice  you really dont care at all first calling a tisane tea and now juice if anything at all it would be a soup
  dragon well
can someone identify this tea its from an anime i want t brew the same
friendly reminder if you use teabags you are drinking the tea version of folgers instant crystals  you can get good tea cheap as fuck anyway if you are poor 510cents per gram    who knows weeb its a cup of green juice probably a heavily steamed sencha since it is dark and cloudy
  how do i make heavily steamed sencha tea
  nibba you need to google it because i cant type all the details of sencha   sencha is steamed in the processing theres varying levels of steaming fukamushi is usually the most common deep steamed i guess there could be even deeper though if you google fukamushi sencha you can find a billion stores selling varities of it
  some sort of gyokuro maybe  pic related
reminder that if youre drinking tea with sugar or milk you arent drinking tea
  lapsang souchong is the king of teas at least if you like smokey flavors
  fucking autistic brits
  ive only ever had one that was good the rest have been vile acrid putrid shit
  smoked lapsang is a western meme and a bastardization of perfectly fine chinese black tea tea
  theres a good chance smoked tea started because some farmer fucked up and ruined his tea and got some idiot foreigner to think its a delecacy
  indeed good way to cover up low quality tea
    didnt we have a brazilian a few days ago asking this shit with yuru yuri screencaps aswell or is it still the same guy
  and someone from australia asking the same thing two weeks ago with the same anime
  my absolute nigger
why cant anyone make a proper fucking /tea/ thread  ill make a new one when this dies
i just watched tyson fury get robbed which tea will help me through this turmoil
genmaicha matcha iri is peak comfy
  i love tea and coffee but youve got to be retarded to put them above hard stims  i dont drink tea to get energy boost i drink tea because i like the taste and the gongfu ritual from my point of view you are comparing two entirely different things not just apples and oranges but apples and microwave ovens      tea as in true tea camellia sinensis isnt exactly mellowing some people say white teas are somewhat mellowing or at least not so stimulating but i wouldnt really put much faith in that    you probably want to check some tisanes / herbal teas i cant really help you with those my apologies      going to make moroccan mint tea with the gunpowder for my family this christmas  very nice of you out of curiosity where do you get your mint
  from what i gathered the lapsang meme started when tea manufacture had delay and had to process the leaves real quick in order to get it to market the problem was tea leaves need to dry which takes time in order to speed the process they dried the leaves over the fire  which of course smoked the leaves the smoked flavor had success on martekt though so they kept doing that    at least thats the story i read somewhere whether it is truth or fiction i cannot say
i used to drink chocolate milk  then it became coffee chocolate milk  then coffee with milk and sugar  then coffee with milk no sugar  then black coffee  then black tea  then green tea  and nowadays a cup of boiled water is my preferred drink  thinking of switching to deboiled
  deboiled water is fucking great and really underappreciated desu    i still enjoy tea now and then though
who here cook with used tea leaves  i havent done it myself but a person i lived with used to cook with the tea hed used the day before and it was pretty good very versatile since he put it in basically all his cooking and it worked with every dish
  someone recommended me eating used sencha leaves with soy sauce as kind of salad but i am not sure i trust the guy that much he has reputation of doing things differently    i would be interested in the topic as well though
  product of the peoples republic of china
  i will spoonfeed you weebkun this is a japanese tea shop from the /tea/ pastebin  
  thats very expensive
     honestly reminds me of the sencha/genmaicha blend that they serve at the japanese restaurant i go to really nice stuff good for cold weather
just had white tea for the first time my god it is amazing i cant believe how many different flavour profiles can be developed out of one simple plant
  who me i get it from the supermarket generally i find some mint leaves in a little package and add those thanks for the compliment
if you dont grow your own tea leaves under a grow light and then crush/brew them when you want a cup or two youre really missing out
  this stuff
  don mei recommended this with gyokuro i assume it would be fine with sencha too
  20 for 100 grams  very expensive  wew lad
ctrl  f earl grey  2 results  i am disappoint  green tea is nice and all but when did it become such a massive meme ffs
  bad ka  drink darjeling
  i like gunpowder too its very cheap and im a massive poorfag that cant afford high quality kinds
  sister drinks exclusevily earl grey been drinking no other tea for at least 15 years  whenever shes offered any other option she adamantly sticks to earl grey  it bothers me more than it perhaps should
  drinks flavored tea  calls other teas meme
  maybe r/tea is more your speed bucko
today i had horny goat weed tea  it felt nice but this shit is not wearing off
  true but the twinings tastes like tea with artificial bergamot flavoring for grocery store earl grey id just go with bigelow
  shrooms  matcha  coffee  other teas  stims  energy drinks  soda
  bigelow over twinnings   what bigelow tastes awful in comparison   then again i use their loose leaf stuff which is pretty decent on a budget
  ok degenerate
  based
  hallucinogenic mushrooms are a type of stimulants you gay junkie
  stims not being reserved for uppers like coke while pyschedelics and downers are their own categories
whats your favourite obscure ice cream brand /ck/ mine is pic related
were it up to me id change that o to an i
  not posting based zapp
  maxibon 360
  i dont get it
is it okay to buy nogger when the cashier is black
  nostalgia hit right there
  i dont understand its just an ice cream brand
  replace o with i and you get nigger the racial epithet we like using it on this white nationalist website as we are of the belief than blacks are inferior to us  we often congratulate each other on calling black people niggers by saying based and redpilled or something equivalent
  oh wow that is radical i just want to enjoy my nogger
  mate thats a paddle pop    korean stuff is pretty great i like the twist bars pic and the watermelon one
    literally super common wtf    nogger is king tho
  had this with some colleagues some time ago and just spurted out lmao sounds like nigger they were not amused
  youre a liar your colleagues did not say lmao
  i like nogger sandwiches
  correct they did not say it but the propability that i sometimes happen to use this word in a pure coincidental fashion is near 100
  they make due with what they have i guess but you didnt make this thread to talk about food so who gives a shit
  fpbp
i gave my gf caterpillar surprise once she did not like it
ive heard somali cuisine is good but i never tried it myself im curious about food in morocco and algiers but never seen anyone mentioning anything worthwhile from there does anyone know what is a regular meal like in those countries i mentioned     im seriously tired of all the stupid /pol/ posters
  they make due with what they have i guess  they could have a lot more if they put some effort into existing
  i for one would not like to eat these armored penishead caterpillars but respect them for doing so
injera is hecking tasty
  this guy knows this shit is amazing
  hundreds of insects die eachto day to keep one aids spreading sambo alive let that sink in
implying eating bugs isnt based  redpilled
  im pretty sure they do theyre shitty culture traditions and the fact that most of africa is a fucking wasteland has prevented them from advancing unfortunately
southern african food is mostly really bland the amount of doughy corn meal shit they can pack down in a sitting is insane    ethiopian food can be really tasty though
gored gored is one of my favorites of all time
  make my bread look like tripe please
  if their cuisine was great they woudnt starve instead
  maghrebi food is mostly about dat tagine basically a slowcooked stew made in an earthernware pot with a clay lid you can get them allveggie with fish with mutton/goat with sausage with meatballs etc served with a side of either rice or couscous
  pic related is sambusa which is filled with beef green peppers onions and more its breddy good  t somali
  lived there fr two years with peace corps the smoked tilapia with ground nut sauce and matoke was good the free range   pork was godtier
  the first ethiopian restaurant in my area opened during a time when ethiopia was experiencing famine i thought ethiopian cuisine was a joke
  moroccan food is nice lots of mediterranean and arab influences they like to use things like olives and dried fruits in their dishes
  unironically africa was better off under colonialism  but muh slavery  african tribes were attacking each other and taking slaves long before they were shipped off to the us or even colonized
  did you get those inside un food packets courtesy of china  meanwhile inreality
  africa was better off under colonialism    a continent with notoriously unreliable weather due to no mountains where most places can have multiple year long droughts that previously had a mostly nomadic population got better when people drew some arbitrary lines that stopped people moving away from drought zones
  they had access to education healthcare and actual food under european rule you know the things that would prevent them from growing up in mud huts and eating maybe six bugs over the course of a year like their ancestors did
  imagine never having to invent anything because other countries did it for you then those other countries came over and literally gave you those things and still failing
  the entire congo region lost a third of its population in the span of ten years thanks to epic colonialism
  dope and sincerepilled
  and nothing of value was lost
i live in kenya ama about the food here i guess
  wtf how are you on a computer
  are you black
  you make it sound like colonialism was a socialist paradise all these black people that for the most part were destitute by the standards of the europeans were just given large scale access to food education and healthcare    are you sure it wasnt that the colonies wanted as little to do with the natives as possible unless they could be used for menial labor
  theyre called samosas actually they can be filled with chicken beef lamb or cheese i actually just had some at a dinner event here in nairobi absolutely delicious especially when theres a nice sauce to dip them in
  well as long as youre not dirt poor most people have one bud i have a kinda dated gaming pc and a imac but im on my phone atm
  im from ny just living here but yes im also black
party rice seems pretty comfy    
  africa has had pcs the internet and cellphones for a while sweetie
  any notable spices that you dont see all that often in the states      any colorful slanders you have heard i know there is something africans call black people from the us that is akin to an oreo
  ayo where the white women at in kenya
  somali people call them sambusa the name depends where you are/from samosa sambuus etc but yeah theyre really good 3
  i havent noticed many unique spices in my experience i guess the way they use them is what makes the food so different there is however a lot of influence from arabic as well as indian dishes due to the surprisingly large amount of indian kenyans    ive been called muzungu a ton of times when they figure out im from the us or cant speak swahili it basically means foreigner or white person in a slightly derogatory way even though im black myself
  the modern use of muzungu how are you is white/foreigner but the literal translation is those who go and come back its based on the colonial explorers who landed on the swahili coast marched into the interior of africa and came back a couple of years later with have their party dead and the rest of them pretty fucking sick
  what was the best meal youve had out there anon
  this best thing ive ever ate
    wish i had some pics of my own but this is close to it    chapatti with pilau rice and beef stew is one of my top favorites for sure i tend to enjoy a beef samosa with some sweet and sour sauce dip as a snack with most meals or on its own
  this    go back op this is a food discussion board not a lol guyz look how gross niggers are based and redpilled maga praise kek board
  theres like a billion different ways to call them all the countries that border the mediterranean have their own variant
  that looks like 5 indians shat on a plate    who the fuck would eat that
  how easy is it find a cute kenyan wife male if youre a young european lawyer asking for a friend
  /thread
  also one of the tastiest meals ive had albeit strange imo was some camel meat with pilau rice in eastleigh a somalian community inside nairobi last christmas camel meat has become one of my top meats because of this although i havent tried preparing it myself yet    btw crocodile is alright and tastes a lot like chicken
  oh man that looks good
  somali food is pretty good they make this type of sourdough bread that goes perfect with their shit
  
  someone who has matured past the age of 5 maybe
  i dont think you understand nor care to understand colonialism it was never about improving the life of the natives but believe whatever based and redpilled talkshow host tells you is the truth
  this board was never this shit thanks for reminding me we always had shitposting but at least it was cooking related shitposting like ramen recipes all day now its just the same lol look how racist i am shitposting that has taken over every board yes 4chan was always racist but at least we used to be able to talk about some cooking related things now every thread just dwindles down into le niggers and jews and trump    also  you literal redditor
  nature is amazing to think that all of the sand on the beach has been filtered through hungry africans who live off the microscopic plant and mineral deposits on each grain
  dont even bother with them
  wahhh why cant i be an offtopic eugenicist asshole everywhere wahhhhh  stay in your containment board
  so stuffed sopapillas psh
    ive been told kenyan women have a bad tendency to be gold diggers that only like men who are foreign and/or flash lots of money around you might be able to find a diamond in the rough tho ive only dated one kenyan woman so far the rest being indian/ white/ west african and she was a sweet girl who was not very materialistic there are also lots of stereotypes depending on tribe so thats a factor as well    plus they have some of the biggest fucking foreheads i have seen in my life
  i hate niggers but when i come to a food board i want to at least talk a little bit about food instead of every thread being a nigger hate thread go back to r/4chan if you wanna read the most le epic and funny threads instead of trying to turn every board into repeats of the same fucking threads
  its all so tiresome
  by reposting stale content over and over again at least come up with some new material crossboarding has stagnated this site boards used to have their own memes now its all just the same /pol/related shitposting that gets spread across the entire site
    tasty  faggot use big boy words you child
  waaahhhh my main board dictates everything i can post on every board
  do you believe its a womens right to choose do you support planned parenthood in their pursuits just a yes or no will suffice
  you do know you are allowed to hate niggers and not turn every board on this site into /pol/ right we are allowed to actually discuss food on /ck/
  post your own threads then kid
  what an irrelevant quest /pol/ gets more and more retarded every day i swear after 2016 i was done with that place
    probably in a cyber cafe scamming old people on the internet
  jesus you are one entitled cunt
  entitled how because i called out your retarded attempt at some gotcha question
  who do you think you are talking to im not   i realize that being in a place that doesnt have usernames might be confusing but youll get it eventually redditor
  hey guys i came from t_d  the post
  yep youve been getting used to it for almost 2 years
  i havent even uttered a word against blacks im a different anon thing is if you dont engage with those who piss you off no yous then they wont keep going fucking dolt
    ive had camel before bought it from an african market were i live i bought ground and also some smaller chunks they had used the cuts in a stir fry and made burgers out of the ground the burgers didnt hold together at all i tried using egg for one burger and bread crumbs in the other one but neither worked the stir fry wasnt good too the meat was way too chewy i feel if i had tried a more traditional way of preparing it it would have been better but i was really disappointed
    nnno youre reddit
  also there are people contributing to the thread but youre here making a fuss instead of being fucking quiet making bump limits happen faster than would have jesus youre dense
  then explain what was entitled about my post the fact that i called out a /b/ 20 board for being shit
  the issue is these people will still shit up this entire site even if they dont get replys so they can become that epic guy they saw the screenshot of on reddit so might as well try to convince them that they are the reason why this website is absolute shit now
  the only people positively responding to ape food are either redditspacing or are describing food as tastylike a woman/child
  yes or no would have sufficed but apparently youre a fuckibg idiot as well you brought up eugenics yet im sure you do support pp guess what america started eugenics first riding the whole evolution thing which was also about the superiority of certain races margaret sanger was a hardcore eugenist faggot
  you seem to have an intimate knowledge of reddit
  dont forget pretty much everyone other country in the world shitting on them for centuries
  youre supposed to either mix it with pork muffled haram screams in the background if you want to make it into patties or slow cook the fuck out of it with veggies and a lot of liquid it doesnt lend too well to quick cooking methods very similar to horse meat in this respect
  im curious about food in morocco and algiers  went to morocco a few years ago and generally found the food good but not as good as at moroccan restaurants ive been to in the us in many cases it seemed the deliciousness of the meals i had there was inversely proportional to the price when i spent the money going out to a nice place it was expensive and it seemed like those places were more about status display than amazing food the best food i had was at modest little places in the souks markets and near mosques the food wasnt like the moroccan food i was used to from us restaurants couscous and tagines with lamb everywhere it was a lot of spiced vegetable stews grilled/fried vegetables fried fish shakshuka with both eggs and meatballs fucking delicious and various little kebab and sausage kind of things there was one guy in the souk in fez who had a little stand that sold nopthing but steamed veal or mutton head sandwiches adorned with nothing but a little chili and cumin salt but the two standout dishes i had were in fez at a place called chez thami one was a fish tagine that may have had some coconut milk in it and the other was a simple plate of alubias white beans in a spicy tomato sauce     the baked goods are very much like middle eastern breads and desserts overall its a lot like middle eastern food with a few spanish and french influence overall its good stuff probably slightly overrated because the french approve of it
  fpbp
  lol christ you love giving nigger every excuse to be worthless huh
  what i know is what ive learned from actually using 4chan and figuring out the type of people it has from what ive learned its all the people who bring identity politics into everything here and share screenshots of it i know there is r/thedonald and r/4chan am i wrong about that
  this sounds good clay pot cooking is always based    im a fool about food like this thank you based somalianon
  souks markets  you could have just said fucking markets but instead you had to type like a fucking moron
  based this based that  you know how i can tell you are from here based is used on 4chan in a completely jokingly manner ironic if you will you arent doing that
  and what exactly is your point here planned parenthood now is completely different than when it started
  they still kill more nigger babies than any other race
  on the face of it maybe theyre still doing a lot of good work killing black babies
    thats an issue for the black community to address not planned parenthood
    imagine having so little going on in life that you get worked up about that
  you sound like ken sama dude youre embarrassing yourself
  youre demented and incurable kys
    wait are you guys admitting to a form of systematic racism
i had ethiopian food once it was pretty fucking bomb
biltong is great
  not at all nobody is making black women have abortions   i just dont hate it when it happens i think it should be legal but not paid for with taxes same as everything else that is within the nap      i keep hearing this really need to try some
  bugz  dirt no thx m8
im a pussy is african food really spicy
  how the fuck are you supposed to eat that
  in b4 mosquito patty
  cringe and racistpilled
  the nap
  doesnt planned parenthood do more medical treatments like tests and check ups than abortions
  of course they do there are several such treatments involved in an abortion and they all count as a separate procedure  if you go in to have an abortion they might do 5 procedures on you but only one of them actually involves terminating the pregnancy
  their graph says that only 3 is actual abortion related things everything else is just std treatments contraceptives and cancer screenings
  shhhh they dont like the truth
  dont waste your time these people dont accept statistics that dont fit there narrative
  stop that doesnt fit their stupid narrative
    look man im not against pp at all i just dont think taxes should fund it  im sure they do hand out more condoms than they do abortions and you can bet they count every single rubber in that statistic as a a procedure of its own  why should i pay for it though why should i buy someone else a condom so they can get laid why should i pay to fix their fuckup when they couldnt be bothered wearing the fucking thing
  i agree but the education system doesnt teach kids jack shit for responsibility in almost any aspect of life so until that changes im just fine with throwing money at pp
  id rather pay for abortions and condoms now than pay more for when they are rotting in jail   at the very least dont make that shit illegal  also this
  im not fine throwing money at the educational system either though  especially since it seems to be more about indoctrination than teaching facts and critical thought   i guess there will always be fuckups no matter what id just prefer to only have to pay for my own
  thats just the price you pay for being part of a society brah were all in this shit together unfortunately   also yeah the entire american education system needs to be revamped its embarrassing
  cuz if you aint paying for rubbers or abortions youre paying for jail welfare queens and other assorted shit   rubbers and abortions are cheaper in the long run
  look like samosa
subsaharan african food is literal shit tier
  but god says that condoms are evil
  ethiopian food is disgusting
    have you ever read anything written in or about a country that isnt the usa
  theres a place called eastleigh in kenya    theres a shitty little town called eastleigh inbetween where im from portsmouth and southampton in the uk
  i dont support paying for jails welfare and other assorted shit either      let god feed them then
    why do you even post when you contribute nothing disgusting lardasses
  ethiopian cuisine has a reputation for being really good not that i know anything about it
  this is a picture from haiti not africa   jeez how lazy can you be
  why would anyone want to
  you sound like a basement dweller
  then you need to exit society and go live on your own in the mountains
          based    i wish /pol/ would stay in its containment board
    thinking nigger hate is spawned only from /pol/  its pretty much been the essence of every board on 4chan and subsequently 4channel obviously since this gay little site started
indian middle eastern and african food is all the same they just use different spice mixes
    ive tasted foods from all over but if i had to only eat one food for the rest of my life it would be kitfo
i like reunionese food since my father was born there ive always been eating it and its actually pretty good at least for the most popular thing but since its just a mix of african indian chinese and french im not sure its that unique   carry is super good but its a local version of curry but id say its better than curry   also bonbon piment chili candy are cool its some kind of really spiced pastries  bouchon are delicious they are similar to chinese shaomai  rougail saucisse is not my thing since im not a fan of the smoked sausage they use its smoked the old way like buccaneer woud do so its called boucan√© but its a classic sausagetomato dry stew mixed with rougail some sauce made of diced tomato ginger onion and chili pepper often piment oiseau crushed together that you put by small touch in your fork with rice and meat   theres still a lot of thing but im not a pro about this and i dont go to the reunion island often since its fucking far away
  fuck off middle schooler
  ethiopian and moroccan are the only good native african food
is a good ol steak better served on a normal plate or one of these hot cast iron ones i heard people dont like them because it continues cooking the steak but i dont know if thats actually true i always thought its just keeping it warm
  whats with the raw onions
  looks like a japanese meal they dont understand what sauteing is
  wait so the cast iron plate is hot dont you burn your wrist on it
  use a regular plate just make sure its not cold
  because the doneness of steak is so particular based on a range of temps yes its quite easy for one of these to cook your steak over what you ordered a good chef or cook can account for this and basically under cook your steak in the kitchen so that by the time it arrives to your table its cooked as ordered and the presentation remains intact beef is very temp sensitive tho you can add thin strips of raw beef to a hot sauce or stir fry removed from heat and it will cook them to rare/medium rare depending on the thickness of cut and temp of dish
  of course its hot thats why they stick them in wooden slabs and restaurants warn you about how hot the plate is when they serve it its the entire point of using the iron it retains heat vastly longer and higher than porcelain or china making certain dishes possible
  well thats stupid i dont want my food on a plate that can hurt me if i touch it while cutting the meat
  i dont want my food on a plate that can hurt me if i touch it while cutting the meat  you literally would never even touch the plate with your hands or wrists unless you were either a manlet sitting at a high table or a child who never listened to their mom telling them to keep the elbows off the table
  meat literally sizzling in front of op    questions if its continuing to cook      in france they want to see your hands on the table otherwise they assume youre playing with your cock
  kek based perverted frenchies
  i dont want my food on a plate that can hurt me if i touch it while cutting the meat  why do you expect to touch the hot plate  do you have some kind of disability    do you also avoid doors because you might hit yourself in the head with one when you open it or might catch your fingers in it when you close it
  youve never so much as grazed the plate with your hands when your hands are 1 inch away cutting meat with your utensils you must look like a fuckin goon with your elbows cocked out to the sides like a bird nope ill take a normal plate thanks like a normal human and not like a retard who needs a special snowflake cast iron plate to feel superior
  getting mad that other people can properly eat at a table using silverware
  staring down at the pathetic plebeians from your ivory tower because you eat off anything but a normal plate  imagine being this much of an elitist this is the kind of person who thinks soylent is an amazing invention
  youve never so much as grazed the plate with your hands when your hands are 1 inch away cutting meat with your utensils  no because if you actually had any manners youd keep your elbows off the damn table while eating even a normal plate wouldnt be touched by anything other than spoon fork or knife unless you had finger food like a burger or chicken nuggets which is probably more your speed anyways
          shutup and go outside you fucking retards
  sure ive grazed a hot plate once or twice there was minor discomfort hardly worth mentioning and the chance of it happening at all is minsicule im not going to let an incredibly rare occurance of minor discomfort stop me from eating off one again      you misunderstand its got nothing to do with elitism rather its confusion you seem fearful of something that is a total nonissue to most functioning adults
  steak looks ok but wtf is up with those sides    fucking corn cernels and raw onion
  well a good ol steak should have a proper rest time and the temp of the stone/iron can be controlled so it shouldnt cook the steak further
  the onions are functional not a side their job is to prevent the steak from resting directly on the sizzle platter and thereby overcooking while its in the pass and coming out to your table    the corn is a side corn goes well with steak whats the problem
  corn goes well with steak  try again
    corn does go well with steak though there are better options like seared tomatoes or even steamed white rice
  what the fuck are you even on about neither of the three go well with steak try asparagus and potato and brocollini
  i dont think steak is the thing for you anon
    t white people
  t shit taste people

  what is he eating what is an advent calendar
  if i made something like this and showed my grandma she would shoot me
  an advent calendar is a common christmas item for children it has twenty five doors each containing a piece of chocolate the idea is a you get to open one each day of december as a countdown towards christmas
  greasy tortillas  thanks for reminding me that i live above a mexican restaurant but am too poor at the moment to actually buy anything from there
  gross
  low standards
  holy shit everything here looks fucking bland as fuck
  and maple syrup
    looks jewish
  uh then what is so impressive about what hes doing
      imagine kevin gagging and vomiting on your dick haha
  the foods themselves im sure are all good minus germany the fuck is that but the guy prepping it either fucked up the recipes or just slapped the lowest quality prepackaged shit he could find together i guess its kinda trying to hit that youre drunk and dont give a fuck so might be something youll throw together at home after getting back from the bar but not sure
  i meant the way they made the foods themselves i know that if i went to the country or to a restaurant that made them it would look nice but what ever clickbait site made that video cant cook for shit
  he holds the world record for fasting time for completing it think he beat the previous record for doing so its with guinness they have ridiculous rules like he can only eat one piece at a time must swallow it and show the judge and he cant rip the doors off try doing it yourself faggot bet youll do better
  gottcha yeah i was kinda surprised at that german abomination thought theyd have a little more tact since they are well known for their sausages but ketchup brat and mayo fries as a national dish sounds horrible and im american
  no the germans do eat that stop putting europeans on a pedestal everyone eats junk food
  whole peppercorns  shouldve used balsamic vinegar pearls instead of creating a mouthrape for the sake of presentation dish but seems like he doesnt know how to cook and is really just trying to put on a show
  im not putting anyone in a pedestal im simply saying for a country that is known for its sausages i wouldnt expect them to dump ketchup and mayo all over the entire plate i have no qualms with junkfood but that sounds disgusting and for a country that prides itself in sausages didnt think they would ruin them that terribly
  this is the stupidest shit ive ever seen
  first day here weve been calling that for weeks dumbass newfag
  i think its the guy who came up with it going around telling people to name it that so he can be proud of his shitty name
  this is the only webum that really grinds my gears for some reason
  how does he get out

why is dominos so popular when its so fucking shit    i never had it growing up cos it was too expensive for me so i always assumed it was amazing and people who ordered it were so lucky to eat delicious food   but now i can buy it myself its just fucking garbage why
  if i dont like something no one should like it  stick to /b/ and /r9k/ you retard

anyone have an infinity whiskey bottle    basically when youre almost finished with a bottle of whiskey any kind you pour the last 12 shots into a separate bottle over time this bottle will have a different blend of whiskeys you like and will develop its own unique flavor profile     ive been making mine the past few months and just tried a glass well its surprisingly complex and very good
that sounds terrible i did something like this when i was 13 stealing liquor from my dad wasnt good
  if anything its a way to let the last remnants of a bottle not go to waste and its fun tasting the way the blend changes after adding a new whiskey
are you jewish by any chance op
  lmfao what kind of retard drinks at age 13
  i need to get a bottle to start mine     my collection at the moment is   glendronach 15  glendronach 21  dalwhinnie 15   glenmorangie 10  glenmorangie la santa  glenmorangie quinta ruban  tamnavulin tempranillo cask    i have other bottles too but im not sure if i would put them in gentleman jack jd single barrel buffalo trace bulleit rye laphroaig quarter cask ardbeg uigeadail i doubt id add anything peated as i think that might take over the whole bottle but im on the fence about the bourbons
  if anything its a way to let the last remnants of a bottle not go to waste  why not drink it dumbass
  to be honest im not sure id use any whiskey over 60 in an infinity bottle i feel like after that youd get diminishing returns
  because this is more fun
  the fun kind
  this has actually been a common practive for hundreds of years to elevate cheap alcohol the original idea was that you pour a little amount of premium/expensive alcohol into a high amount of meh one  aka the original blend next time you suckle on a premium johny walker remember this has nothing to do with being a filthy kike
  if its all good whiskey going in then it should hopefully be still good once its mixed and if its only 25ml out of a 700ml bottle its not too bad     i dont plan on buying too many more bottles for a while though a lot of the ones i have are at least 50 full so perhaps i should wait until they are almost gone and i have more bottles to add to an infinity bottle
  if its all good whiskey going in then it should hopefully be still good once its mixed  thats not how it fucking works anon what makes a whisky good is the balance of flavors mix different whiskeys together and you throw off that balance  that being said im sure your experiment is actually kind of fun and interesting and the result is likely palatable
  i did have one but it tasted like shit the baileys in it didnt work at all with the red wine and different lends of scotch
  the worst youll end up with is a slightly out of balance whiskey then its still going to be drinkable some people will try to mix it in such a way that it stays balanced others just put some of everything in there     personally i dont mind losing a shot from every bottle i buy its not a big deal and you get something interesting from it
  my parents had that sort of stuff really fancy things i dont see a need for it myself i prefer it in the original bottles  never forget the angels share
itt alcoholics pretend this is a hobby while pretending they dont have a drinking problem
  this only would work if you mixed whiskys of a similar flavour profile eg different scotches vs rye mixing glenviet and jim beam would be disgusting
  i almost wretched thinking of that combination and had to down a couple shots of vodka to settle my stomach
no but i used to do those with weed until one day i ran out and smoked the mind blowing super sack
while i like the idea in general i tend to alternate between bourbon rye and scotch i cant even imagine the swill that would produce
  what kind of loser doesnt
  yikes
  whenever i see this im like  wtf  just finish it  this is 100 reddit faggot tree
  fucking lol
  you probably buy sub 40 bottles and finish them within a week right
  dude
  this it works fantastic with kief but with liquors youre asking for trouble
  where do you live if you didnt that was prime party age
    i fucking hate you
  its likely because you didnt add any beer remnants from open 3 day old and room temperature cans
i only buy cheap 13 euro 35 cl bottles one for each weekend i just like being buzzed   do you people who have fine whiskys at home only have one drink occasionally
  trips of truth
  oh man mixing a couple heady and body strains was fun af i really need to pick up again
i do this with unpeated scotch right now the average age is about 8 years old and the proof is just over 100 pf  the blend so far i got is  tomatin rum cask  glenlivet nadurra first fill  aberfeldy 18  glen garioch sherry single cask  glenburgie 18 douglas laing  edradour 10 sherry signatory cs  deanston bordeaux cask  so far its turned out how id imagine a solid house whisky to put out for guests that theyd never try anywhere else    did you just leave the amish town anon 13 is common for kids trying alcohol for the first time heck in east europe its even younger    id say stick to similar grains do an infinity bottle for barley spirit one for rye and one for a blend of everything but make sure they work together and wont clash with off notes    i only ever the last dram in a good bottle in one anyhow so its a bit easier that way plus a bad whisky with a strong single note could make a blends character even more enhanced and complex if you look at it that way
  in the week i might have one or two drinks if i have guests im normally happy to offer them a nice whiskey too as long as i know they will appreciate it     if i plan on going to a party or host a party where there will be heavy drinking i just buy a bottle of something cheap to mix or make cocktails with
  i dont think id ever have enough different bourbons/ryes/anything else to make an infinity bottle with     i am a curious how mixing rum and whiskey would turn out ive got 5 or 6 rums i might make a small measure perhaps 10ml of each drink and see what happens
in the week i might have one or two drinks   i just like being buzzed   personally i dont mind losing a shot from every bottle i buy  i dont have a problem the posts
  do you people who have fine whiskys at home only have one drink occasionally  yes i have better bottles anywhere from 60 to 300 which i drink a few times a month to a few times a year but most of the basic good stuff like 12 yos i drink a few times a week
  buy infinity whiskey  its not infinite
  dumbass brits its the main reason why their brains are fried
  i drink quite a bit more than id like to so yes  750ml lasts about 2 days usually  eagle rare and elijah craig are the two brands i buy the most  right around 30 each  i do buy better quality liquor about once a week but it doesnt really last any longer  aberlour 16 18 if i can find it springbank 15 are two favorites  sorry reddit

  and its december third not third december yet you would format it as 1/12 instead of 12/1
  yeah me too the americans
  no its fucking not you dumb amerilard didnt you listen daymonthyear pure logic dollar twenty shit again  do you tell the time 156 if its fifteen past six
    what kind of file name format is that because you definitely didnt get those images from here tourist
  nobody says third december
  not telling you
    also you say six fifteen which is why its written as 615
  today is third of december 2018
  third of december do you mean december third maybe youll get better at english one day sweetie until then maybe you should avoid trying to communicate in it

  i mostly have spiced rum i really like abelforths rumbullion and rumbullion navy strength very sweet though tastes more like a liqueur than a rum for the standard bottle     nonspiced i have ron zacapa 23 solera and mount gay xo both are good
  gay xo was pretty good but short of spectacular anons here hyped the shit out of it and i was disappointed
  were fine without you  one of the most corrupted countries in the world  illiterates as much as in somalia  pollution rates like in china  50 of population are bums living under a bridge  shit everywhere  chigago  hillary clinton   you really need someone better than me to help you guys
    yeah i havent tried any expensive rums but the zacapa was 40 euros for a litre in duty free which was a great price and for that price its good normally more like 60 for 700ml in which case not great value the xoi thought it was nice but not life changing     plantation xo gets good reviews for a reasonable price so if i was to get another it would be that
  infinity whiskey bottle  how is it in any way or form infinite
  if i never saw another foreignerpost on here again it would be too soon
   are you autistic not everything has to be literal
  in the context of food and beverage infinite generally means it doesnt run out so an infinity stew would be one that you add more liquid and ingredients to as you serve it never letting the pot empty or the infinite wine glass i used to carry around all day making sure to refill it before i drank all of it this is more akin to a suicide mix like you did with soda fountains as a kid
  yes the point is you pour some in when you get a new whisky and you pour some out when you want to drink some     not a difficult concept
  who is going to have leftover alcohol in the house and not drink it i dont care what kind of reddit dedication you say you have once you start getting the shakes you arent going to care that you drank your all infinity whiskey before the bottle was even a quarter full
  people who have a whiskey collection arent typically alcoholics
  if you arent an acthelix get the fuck off this board
talisker 10 or tullamore dew which one to buy as my first whiskey
  why are these the only 2 options
which of these two ardbegs do you anons prefer uigeadail or corryvreckan
  small selection where i live and they are available in small enough bottles that it wont be a huge regret if i dont like them
  personnaly i could pick the talisker  its a really interesting whisky for his taste  personally i love the tskye
  id get the talisker then       only tried uigeadail and its really good however from what ive read they are both excellent and which one is better comes down to personal taste doesnt appear to be a definitive answer out there one way or the other
      thanks guys ended up grabbing a lagavulin a laphroaig and a glenmorangie and i have an uigeadail coming in the mail its gonna be a good holiday season
  yeah get a quality dark rum goslings is sippable get some heavy and dark
are there any good online services in the us im interested in a bottle of lagavulin distillers edition but none of my local stores have it so ill order online instead
  drizlys got a promo going on through google shopping where google shopping gives you promo codes for drizly booze you find there the promo code google15 got me 15 bucks off a drizly order earlier today
  thanks anon
  sounds like a ghetto blended whiskey to me akin to somebody going to a soda fountain and mixing the different ones available into the same cup
is caol ila good local liquor store just got a shipment and im curious
  yes its good not as peaty as the other islay whiskies its very nicely balanced
my infinity bottle is like the conerstone of my whisky collection the better something is the more i pour in this massive 1/2 gallon tincup bottle i just topped it off with a pint of little book chapter 2 usually i try to do more of more sweet whisky like bourbon and sherry cask scotch as the base and less of ryes and peated scotch to balance it out blending high quality whsiky well can produce amazing results
    infinity bottle  its a fucking pinecone you nonces and put every kind of fifth in it not just whiskey tequila rum whiskey gin vodka but it doesnt do much everything
  if el dorado is sold where you live track that down and try it the entire decadeold range is amazing appleton estate and havana club are also solid distillers as well
  no but i have an infinity cum jar
  tfw started drinking wine at 6
why does royal or as they call it in america quarter pounder with cheese takes so long to prepare it is one of my favourites but i have to wait 20 minutes to get one
  huh
each employee has to spit on it and 3 out of 4 humans working at mcnignog have a cotton mouth
  i noticed that royal takes much longer to get than other burgers
  im pretty sure the local burger flippers just dont like you    or maybe theyre lonely and dont want you to leave    because it would require a lot of effort to be that bad at making a mcburger
  i always use touchscreen displays to order they dont know who i am
  because its really a 1/3 pounder but they have to call it a 1/4 pounder because murricans thought 1/3  1/4 and they were getting ripped off
  because lately they made it a selling point that will royals are made fresh on order at least thats what i have seen in florida
  20 minutes  thats nothing my favorite is a double royal and it takes 40 minutes to make
  tfw waiting one and a half hours for your quadruple royal  suffering
  honestly the quarter pounders were way better before the new fresh change  the bottom bun is always loaded with grease  they never put seasoning on any of the quarter pounders that ive had since the change  i do like that they are hotter  but the spice thing really pisses me off i know the flavor of a mcds burger and its not very good without the seasoning
  its a bigger thicker burger meaning it takes longer to cook its also vastly overshadowed by the big mac so its not as popular so they dont tend to keep as many around
  honestly the quarter pounders were way better before the new fresh change  the bottom bun is always loaded with grease  this but with double cheeseburgers they dont have enough time for the cheese to melt when theyre fresh theyre weirdly best given an hour or so in the heat to melt
  now that you bring that up its even worse than the two i mentioned when i worked there in the late 90s all the sandwiches went in the microwave for a bit just to melt the cheese and it sucks that they dont do that anymore who in the fuck wants an almost warm sandwich but its made to order it blows my mind  i wish i could go back there and make my own burgers
  i never waited longer than 10 minutes for anything at mcd wtf is wrong with your fast food
feels like an arbys night
i used to love arbys about a decade ago mom used to bring home a bunch of those beefandcheddars that shed get with coupons 5 for 5 it used to be affordable now its like one of those sandwiches in a meal for more than 5 what in the actual fuck    i never go to arbys anymore that place used to be my childhood
  arbys could be so much better but they constantly fuck it up
  its pretty sad that arbys makes a better brisket than the actual bbq restaurant across the street from it in my town
hopesolojpg
  _ 
arbys is objectively the best fast food restaurant
  had pic related tonight it was disappointing
  id rather have hopesolo than arbys
someone say arbys
  fucking this   went to arbys for the first time in years and a number 1 medium was over 10
their italians sub is delicious
    sign up for the arbys internet member thing they have just got two coupons that seem to be able to be printed a few times if you choose  one was just for signing up and the other was birthday treat  i think im going to check out the brisket for free with a drink purchase
  creamy dressing does not belong on an italian sub vinegar and oil or bust
french fries and mozzarella sticks thats all i get from them
    a good italian sub needs ov and mayo
  thats fucking retarded mayonnaise is already oil and vinegar with egg yolk pick one or the otherbut mayo is the wrong choice on that particular sandwich
    my parents do this all the time still coupons still exist
  babe
  those and jalapeno poppers are the best potato cakes if its breakfast too their sides are the only thing worth going there for well those and maybe a sausage egg and cheese croissandwich
just get a fuckton of mozzarella sticks
theyll never bring back onion pellets
mexicans are so stupid they dont know how to toast their own bread so they buy it pretoasted they sell it here because of illegals

  so cute
  hnnnnnnnnnnnnggggggg biiiiiiiiiiiiimbooooooooooobssssssss

  actually is because a lot of mexicans cant afford a toaster alternatively they toast bread on a skillet
why do teenagers like these so much
  because theyre teenagers and theyre not used to drinking liquor or beer and that just tastes like lemonade
  this  also all teenagers are homos
  no one drinks that shit all the cool kids ice each other these days or drink twisted teas
  literally admitting that the only reason you drink beer is because you got used to the taste  l mao fucking beerfags enjoy your piss water
  the only reason i drink beer is to get drunk
  they havent suffered enough to enjoy/endure the taste of real liquor they dont deserve alcohol until then
  give up the poison piss water has already infected them
  because i buy it for them
  do you not eat or drink anything now that you didnt like as a kid  never mind im probably talking to a 15 year old
  my first drink every was everclear my dad had me try when i turned 20  i can say from experience as being the guy who kills 6 fourloko golds by the time everyone finishes four beers that teenagers cannot hang
  finally   i tell people this is why folks drink cold ones but they seem to tell themselves and others that its actually tasty  its not  twisted tea gets me just as drunk with out all the bubbles in my belly and it tastes almost good
  gas yourself you fucking beta
  found the fat ass
  i do actually think that beer is tasty especially stouts but i realize that i did condition my brain to think that
  i fell victim to this too when i was young  fucking sugar bomb i think this stuff has over 200 calories a bottle  its really just an easy choice for freshmen to get their stupid girlfriends drunk enough to put out you know the stupid bimbos who would go ewww to any real drink
  my teenage gf said this reply was pretty much on the mark    /thread this piece of shit
  18 here we like whatever we can get our hands on only boomers care about super fancy beers and drinks
  6 fourlokos yeah not a chance if theyre the 12 kind
  one person is immensely upset that people like something he doesnt    did a craft chad fuck your wife or what
  this shit is instant heartburn
young inexperienced guy here beer tastes like shit wine and liquor too strong for my sensitive palate when i was younger i could tolerate them but i seem to have gotten more sensitive to alcohol for some strange reason mikes goes down easy
  alcohol is cringe avoid
first day i ever smoked weed i stole a 6pack of mikes hard lemonade and drank it w my buds good memories i miss being 14 15 and my only care in the world are videogames and weed     never drank that shit again though thats how fags get drunk
  based
  double trips i gotta call my mom holy fuck
  based mom checking those digits with me rn
  fuck off ron youre not my dad
  teenagers    fuck you the mango flavor is refreshing as anything after coming home from work on the rare occasion that i have any around its usually my first drink of the night before i switch to straight vodka
  if its just a soda to you i dont think you are who we are calling a fag but if you drink 6 of these to get drunk you are definitely a homo
i unironically like the taste of budweiser i hate bud light though  but i drink to get drunk mainly i never have just one drink with a meal either im either drinking until im too drunk to stand or im not drinking
  why do teenagers like these so much  alcohol is an acquired taste it takes time wine coolers and other flavored things like this have just the right amount of carbonation sugar tart intense flavor in a balance with low alcohol content to get people buzzed with minimal effort they travel well to parties sealed and therefore dont break any travel laws that would lead to dui unlike partial bottles and mixers people could take to parties or picnics instead people with active social lives like the convenience not just young people
low alcohol content and easy to drink although it seems like teens are switching to vodka/gin lately my underage cousins all drink smirnoff mixed with juice at parties and there is a lot of tall boys in place of smifnoff
its lemonade with alcohol
  the difference is that a childs palate is intentionally stunted they are hypersensitive to certain flavor profiles that would indicate dangerous poisons in a prehistoric diet    intentionally forcing yourself to enjoy shitty pisswater when good beer exists is just being a fag
i can drink more poison than u
sometimes this kind of thin and crispy peetzer is good too
  thin crust  best crust  dont fucking you me either you bloated carb monkeys
  why is it cut like that
  im going to go ahead and call reddit here
  they used to cut it in triangluars trends in the pizza business are interesting
  because op is a child
      party cut  its so theres more pieces to share with more people like at a party
why the hell would you order it from jets though jets is all about that thicc detroit style
  thin  yes for most everyday pizza  crispy  wrong chewy is best
  say it with me folks  it doesnt have crust it isnt pizza its tomato and cheese flatbread
    jets is probably the most underrated chain pizza in existence fucking delicious you lose points for not getting the deep dish though reprobate
this is the ideal crust for any self respecting za enthusiast
  i agree typically but i only order from jets ok i get lil cs if im feeding company i dont particularly care for/dont plan on eating myself or just happen to be broke but 9 times out of 10 i order jets regardless of what i order    they were my go to place for subs too but they stopped selling them now they just sell those pizza crust sandwiches and deli boats which the latter arent bad and i like their boneless wings
  614 nigga
  because its thin crust so you need smaller pieces to make them manageable
  go to bed cadance
  you ruined the entire pizza by cutting it like that what the fug into the trash it all goes
  the only good thin crust from a pizza place is donatos
  greasy wop detected
  maybe youd prefer some bomb ass tea
somebody cut it wrong take it back
  peetzer  thread hidden
      thin crust is traditionally cut into squares you dingdongs
  that is some real nice looking cheese
  i got thin crust for the first time in more than a decade the other day jalapeno and pepperoni it was great i will start getting a medium just for myself i ate it for dinner and had a piece around 10pm before i threw the boxes out i love it
is this steamed kale sitting on a plate of milk
  probably a coconut milk sauce or something
  egg white maybe
prolly cum hawhawhawhaw
  fucking kek
    using the magic of the internet i tracked it down it is    spicy roasted shrimp with braising greens and ajo blanco sauce    
  ah ajo blanco sauce base    which is     ajoblanco is a popular spanish cold soup typical from granada and m√°laga it is also a common dish in extremadura this dish is made of bread crushed almonds garlic water olive oil salt and sometimes vinegar
what can i do with peppermint oil some kind of drink is it a good spice for stuff
  you can meme yourself into thinking that it does something for you
  it smells really nice though
  not food or cooking
  we use this in my dental clinic when someone has like trench mouth or something awful smelling going on in their mouth like an abcess smear a little on the inside of your mask and its all good
  give me money senpai im starving
  he thinks nonboomer dentists are rich  dude every single millennial in dental school rn is graduating half a mil in debt with a 68 interest rate its one of the most fucked up class of people because a lot of them went into this trying to get rich quick and ended up getting shafted hard by the long arm of federally subsidized student loan debt     i used the military to pay for mine so i escaped this but new dentists in general are poor as fuck even though they larp as richfags
  thanks for the explanation and it is saddening glad you made it out brother have yourself a nice day     eats his once daily instant ramen pack
    peppermint bonbons
  for a real answer to your question though make your own lip balm 75c worth of beeswax a few cents of olive or coconut oil and a few drops of this heated together in a double boiler and youll have the equivalent of like 20 worth of burts bees products
  my family uses peppermint oil in water for nausea and vomiting but there are no culinary uses because its too strong and mint is already readily available
god damn brits how the fuck doesnt we have this in the state
  15 of shitty fried food that costs 3 to make   how the fuck doesnt we have this in the state  we have standards
  american standards  pls
that looks like a lot of carbs and not a lot of substance
oh my god do brits really do this  what the fuck is wrong with brits  only in britian am i right  jesus christ brits  hahahaha brits omg hahahahahahaha  just fuck britian up
  standards  deep fried butter is part of your standards
opening a 10pm4am munchie box delivery service next year in the states soon brother
  what flavor is that soda
  carbs half of it is meat haha
  and fish
brits eat too much brown
  a lot of brits are used to too much brown
  im american and eat nice things simple healthy things and complete garbage pretty much equally but these always looked terrible to me
  i need it
  you are going to be rich beyond your wildest dreams    urine and sperm    we have standards  no we fucking dont youve been to applebees before right
  looks like something i would get if i was really fucking drunk
  irn bru is hard to explain i find it to be a generally fruity flavor with a touch of vanilla
  it just looks so bland and dry and yet soggy which is to be expected steaming in a fucking box while you bring it home/wait for it to be delivered those scot chips look even fatter and mealy than the regular bong kind i dont care how drunk i was id start feeling sick and lose interest after a few bites
thats like 5 peoples worth of food
  yeah but im the kinda person who eats entire pizzas while drunk so id probably be fine but i doubt theyd do well in the us i dont think the general public likes the idea of everything in your meal being fried
  we have standards    no you dont
  a pizza is still good when it gets cold though a box full of soggy fried shit just gets worse and worse
  no we dont
  ive never had a garbage plate before but its honestly sad how much better the slop o shit looks compared to the three sides
  you dont have butter dogs
  this looks good when youre hungry but i bet you feel like a dirty whore after youve finished
  deep fried butter is a festival thing its not something we eat all the time    and its fucking delicious
  yeah no doubt this is ultimate shit tier fried uk takeaway food its sort of a gimmick anyway that takeaways started doing on facebook to promote their brand  just posting ridiculously large pizza box deals to get shared     this looks like a shit fish and chip shop note the battered burgers  if you go to a decent fish and chip shop in the uk this is what you can expect maybe without the garnish
  the mushy peas make it classy
  no the lemon makes it classy 
  honestly youre not missing out on much its literal trash that can only be consumed if youre shitfaced or have tastebuds of pic related   tscot
  no gorditas no huarache  no chilaquiles  no huitlacoche    2/10 you tried
  chilaquiles  now youre fucking talking
tfw munchie boxes failed in australia  customers didnt buy them because they were too unhealthy  stupid melbourne yuppie hipster cunts
  munchie boxes shouldnt be an official thing theyre just a good way to get rid of food you would be throwing away anyway im sure if you asked a takeaway place at 2am theyd throw you together a munchie box for a fair price
  based haha poster
      munchie boxes are shit tier there are better unhealthier and tastyer fried foods
  i can feel my heart rate slowing down from just looking at this picture 0/10 would not eat
  a munchie box isnt a predetermined thing you spaz its just a bunch of leftover old food thrown into a box for a good price
  good choice on the guacamole with fish classic pairing
  obsessed
  jesus i thought he was joking
  its not guacamole its mushy peas
  op is a brit larping as a freedom loving red blooded testosterone fueled american male
  wtf is mushy peas and why would they serve it with fish and fries
  irn bru theyre really is no comparison to compare it to when they cut the sugar down the british government the english had to declare martial law in scotland
  ive never really thought of it having vanilla its got a bit of a spice to it though like maybe ginger or something
  a lot of places have started putting munchie boxes on their menues always seems to be the shit people font normally order on its own eith maybe one popular thing thrown in
      irn bru tastes like orange tic tacs mixed with red cream soda
  thats an england shirt you tard
  the other half of it is breading though literally flour and beer
    theyre actually really nice to mop up with the chips  in the south they like to put a slice of lemon on their fish and chips up in the north they like gravy curry sauce or mushy peas
  i bet you feel like a dirty whore after youve finished  that would be one way to work off all those calories i suppose
    this but with a smidge of cough syrup undertones went to scotland bought one because lol scotland threw it away after drinking about half a bottle and then drunkenly and loudly ranted about it to a bunch of dudes in a pub called scotsman lounge because there was a violin duo or something playing that night so i had to make sure they heard me because it was important    thank you for reading
  looks like something i would get if i was really fucking drunk  which is why its a popular item in scotland
  technically its marketed as a family box
  its cream soda
its not a munchie box but     a glasgow salad
  its just a bunch of leftover    kek
me prefer a deep fried mars    t gordon from arbroath
  your point
  your point    think harder boi
  theres too much brown brits
  slop  l  o  p
  theres too much brown brits    pardon me
  ive been saying the same thing for years plus we cant even get real irnbru anymore due to fda
  it looks gross in the picture but at least it probably tastes ok rright
  tried this for memes and even as a terrible sweet tooth i dont know how scots can enjoy it
  take that back
  cause its all carbs who the fuck wants that
   noooo never curry sauce/gravy with the fish with chips occasionally but thats a different event to fish and chips which is strictly mushy pea side and a slice of lemon
  true itll be beer batter though onion rings are probably frozen and deep fried and the rest of the batter will be standard mix only get beer batter in the upmarket places
  jesus id like you to post haute cuisine from your country
  based
  the english are to blame for this kek
  we have standards
  if youve never got curry /gravy with your fish you absolutely havent lived
  is nothing like it at all
  take your facebook memes back to redit you fucker
  its the epitome of the average bloke though so i used it
  are you saying deep fried butter is haute cuisine because you took something you melt in a pan to fry things and fried it in batter thats like sprinkling rock salt on your table salt
  no the twig makes it classy 
craft soda  is this a thing now i thought it was just a meme
  jones has been around for as i can remember green river moxie and cheerwine are also regional craft sodas
bawls has been around for a long time
    but they call it craft soda now
  i guess your kroger does
  looks like krogerts calls it that to differentiate it and name brands like conke and bepis
  nothing distributed by pepsi is craft
bawls is an energy drink
for me its jones crushed melon
    this stuff is great particularly if youre not into corn syrup based drinks
  is this your first time shopping for yourself in 5 years donny is that you
that fucking jones peanut butter and jelly flavour
  op here my mom shops for me
  fentmans is absolutely fucking amazing if you can find it mostly weird world food stores carry it  boylans birch beer is also very good
okay anons whats going to be your lunch today    mine is a sandwich of grey bread a fried egg cheese bacon and caramelized onion
a couple of steaks and a nice little soup made of celery onions pickles bacon broth cream and cheddar cheese
anyone else here absolutely love eating a handful of these on their own
im pretty sure thats why people buy the small size sheets as a snack on its own
those little snack packs need to come with like 400 sheets
  korean peeble eat them with rice actually
  that sounds yum
i wonder if anybody harvests the themselves are they all edible how to recognize the good ones i wanna know
  they grow on farms
  nori not sure but i harvest seaweed all the time since there are no toxic seaweed in north america 10 pounds is the limit and you must use scissors leaving the hold fast that is attached to the rock that way the seaweed grows back
  its like i wanted to kill my meat and you told me they did it for me
  here are no toxic seaweed in north america  where are they what would i have to be careful about
  what else can i put in
  i dont really know i live in the usa and when i decided to try harvesting seaweed every book i read simply said there are no known toxic seaweed around north america so try what you find
  i found them for 1/10th of the price online at a local asian store
  oh i will say dont harvest near a bay because of pollution if you really want fresh seaweed get it out of the open sea
i have a lot of trouble eating seaweed and i dont know why maybe its the smell or after taste but i cant eat it for whatever reason i really want to get over this aversion so i can enjoy more dishes like handrolls for example but i have no idea how any tips
  yup ill open a pack just to have one or two but just now right through them
occasionally folks need to be reminded how delicious a simple fried egg and cheese sandwich is
  a man of taste
you havent done a good job reminding me
  yeah if mine looked like that id need a reminder too
  uncooked whites   pretty gross desu
  whats that red shit
  jamie take that down
  looks like food for manlets
  thats enough out of you winnie
  how does he get out
  he just breaks all the eggs eggs are really cheap in his country so its not a significant cost factor
    i see what you did there
  that bread has just ruined it for me i hope its super fresh
bite into sandwich  yolk runs all over your shirt
that much hots on a breakfast sandwich    lay off the the drugs alcohol and tobacco
  imagine the smell of his shit after eating that      he has a chicken coop so he has a lot of eggs
    looks like diced jalapenos  op confirmed for spic
    wholemeal bread some kind of chilli spread fucked up eggs adds cheese    never attempt to make an egg sandwich again good eggs dont need cheese why do you want to mask the taste of the yolk why do you hate chickens answer me
  i dont think youre supposed to pour all the oil onto the plate
if you had told me 20 years ago to try mixing ketchup and milk id assume you were fucking with me
  peanut butter and onion peanut butter and onion sandwiches are boss    also blue cheese and dark chocolate just smear a little on like a cracker
  id rather pour semen on my salad french dressing is the dumbest shittiest crap even below thousand island its gross    whats wrong with just drizzling a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar on your salad     only fatasses like this shit it allows them to only have salad for a meal so they can feel like that they exerted so much willpower did something healthy while still maintaining their exorbitant caloric surplus and justify that third slice of coffee cake because i was good and had a salad for lunch  all while lording their supposed moral superiority over their skinny friends who made the unhealthy choice of ordering a burger completely ignoring the fact that they live active lifestyles    fucking fatass sauce for tastelet fatasses
  only fatasses like this shit  retarded and wrong im in my 30s and have never weighed more than 145 lb at 6 ft tall youre probably the fatass since only a fat person would try to blame a salad dressing for their weight problems  whats wrong with just drizzling a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar on your salad   1 people use dressing as a general condiment not just for salads and 2 thats a completely different flavor you idiot you might as well ask a steakhouse whats wrong with just serving pizza nothings wrong with it its a completely different thing that makes no sense to bring up
tabasco sauce and vanilla ice cream tastes like strawberry ice cream
  people use dressing as a general condiment   what do they put it on salad dressing is for salads
  i could see the vinegar based ones being used as a light dip for breads similar to olive oil thicker thousand islands are fine for fries and of course  ranch
  tendies newfag
  salad dressing is for salads  are you just pretending to be retarded does baking soda not belong in seltzer water because youre not baking it how underage are you
mac and cheese and barbeque sauce
sweet chili thai and anything besides chicken
  delicious burnt wings and nasty artificial sauce
thousald island dressin on a macdonalds burger    hoooooo daddy that some seeeriouss sheeeittttt
  pretty good on some sandwiches
  youre an unimaginative idiot
peppermint ice cream and blue cheese    i once had blue cheese ate it and ate ice cream before i had swallowed it whole tried another bite with the two and its pretty good
  ok now im curious  will report back in a couple minutes
regular chips  cream cheese  the greatest snack
  holy fucking cringe
food at the center is burnt  food at the rim is raw  its a meme right
  your an meme
  i wish
  its a meme right  yep anybody with a brain has taken the copperpill much better heat distribution and control
but for me but for my money though its the rock baybee
  based and stonepilled
  white pans  were reaching aesthetic levels that shouldnt be possible
  its a meme right  nope its user error
  prone to user error more than any other equipment and has some of the highest required maintenance for no distinct advantage that justifies the drawbacks  so yes it is a meme
  o b s e s s e d 
  man literally too dumb to stir updates at 11
  cope
how do i rescue my sister and her husband from this meme they are both already poor cooks but the cast iron makes it even worse
  not an argument
  get her one of these  
  aluminum is more conductive than copper though
  this stainless steel with an aluminum core is the best for quick cooking on the stove and an enamaled cast iron dutch oven is best for oven braises and stews that start on the stove
  rockpill me /ck/ are they a gimmick or are they a genuine innovative improvement over standard teflon
  theres literally no need to ever use a nonstick pan
   to user error more than any other equipment  how so matching your pan size to the size of the hob applies to any kind of cookware    and has some of the highest required maintenance   cast iron has no different maintenance than any other pan you just season it once when you buy it thats the only difference it doesnt require any special care     no distinct advantage that justifies the drawbacks  heat retention and emissivity are both excellent distinct advantages    nonstick stainless and ci skillets are fundamental tools in the kitchen unless you are some kind of ascetic minimalist theres no reason not to use all 3 on a regular basis
  i dont eat fried or scrambled eggs what else would i use a nonstick for
  theres no reason to use non stick ever using non stick is the easiest pleb filter in cooking you can make every recipe known to man with ci and copper and if you cant it means you suck at cooking
    they think copper pans are solid copper
  theyre copper cored dipshit usually either tinned or covered in stainless steel aluminum is a better core than copper
  fish scallops bacon      just because you can do it doesnt mean it makes sense to do it    a tool box nossirree i dont need no stinkin tool box to fix no car i just need muh hammer and muh jumper cables if you cant fix it wit dose then your a shit mechanic
  i can and have easily cooked all 3 in stainless pans
  he doesnt know
  i can and have easily cooked all 3 in stainless pans    thats nice im just curious what the motivation for that was why were you making things more difficult for yourself you didnt have room for more pans you were trying to show off
  ones that are worth a damn are indeed solid copper with a thin layer of stainless or tin on the interior    copper pans which arent solid copper in the center have a different name garbage
  if your eggs stick that means you dont know how to cook eggs do you think diners use teflon griddles to churn out 100s of perfectly cooked eggs a day you sure are smug about your inadequacies you probably show off your wifes bull too
  he cooks bacon in a nonstick pan  ayyy lmao
  it wasnt difficult at all because i know how to cook bacon is especially easy in stainless since its like 50 fat why are you so bad at cooking that you need crutches
  doesnt preheat his cast iron to take advantage of it being dense and even heating when used correctly  pebkac
  if you cant make good food in cast iron no memepan will help you
  this if they learn how to use it they actually might become decent cooks
  do you think diners use teflon griddles to churn out 100s of perfectly cooked eggs a day  nope  but since i dont have to worry about cooking that kind of volume ill choose to use the easier tool      i never claimed it was difficult in an absoloute sense i said it was more difficult    even if one is stupidly easy while the other is merely very easy why wouldnt you choose the easier option what advantage do you think that using stainless gives in your case     why are you so bad at cooking that you need crutches  im excellent at cooking part of that is choosing the right tool for the job
  why own two tools when one does both jobs just as well
  because one doesnt do them just as well its a compromise    nonstick for delicate foods which tend to stick easily  iron for oven use searing and other uses of extreme high heat  stainless for when you want to generate a fond for later deglazing  copper for delicate emulsified sauces candy and jam
  because one doesnt do them just as well  maybe you have more difficulty using pans made for adults but most people dont
  why wouldnt you buy something you dont need to do a task you can already do half awake hungover with one eye barely open because your coffee isnt even done brewing yet  gee i dont know probably because im not a mindless consumer throwing my money down the drain towards shit i dont need how about i spend my money on another kitchen tool that doesnt already do what i find no difficulty in doing so you really not understand the law of diminishing returns the pan returns nothing to me therefore any expenditure is a 100 sunk cost and then i have to buy a separate set of utensils so now im guilty of falling victim to the law of diminishing returns and the sunk cost fallacy
   materials dont have different physical properties     most people dont  really most people can magically preheat an iron or stainless pan in the same time as it takes to heat an aluminum one tell me these secrets that most people use to ignore the laws of physics
  all stainless pans worth owning are aluminum or copper cored only an absolute mongoloid would use a 100 stainless pan you know nothing
  gee i dont know  you dont have to be an ass about it you can simply say that youd rather not buy different pans      all stainless pans worth owning are aluminum or copper cored  indeed they still heat slower than plain aluminum pan because the stainless cladding has lousy thermal conductivity  now that difference may not matter to you in which case you can just say that the difference in performance isnt worth the difference in price but to pretend a difference doesnt exist is idiotic
  doubling down on the fact that he wastes his money on things he doesnt need  lmao die in a fire retard
  you asked why and i figured i had to spell it out for you explicitly because youre clearly obtusely retarded
  ill bet you buy plenty of dumb shit that you dont need everybody does we just have different definitions of what that is    im just wondering whats so hard about saying i only want to buy one pan if youd have said that from the getgo we wouldnt have even had this discussion
  somehow its my fault that you either cant or wont explain yourself clearly    you could have posted i dont want to buy multiple pans 20 posts ago why didnt you
  i have a large high sided saut√© pan a large skillet a small skillet a small sauce pan a medium sauce pan a large sauce pan and a bain marie all stainlessonaluminum i also have an aluminum stockpot a large enamaled dutch oven and a small enamaled dutch oven my nigger roommate has a teflon pan for eggs but i never use it because i dont eat fried eggs
  kek i think the plastics in your brain lad
cast iron is for trannies
   do you think diners use teflon griddles to churn out 100s of perfectly cooked eggs a day   they generally dont use ci/stainless either carbon steel or tinned copper if they are traditionalist    using stainless for cooking eggs is just being silly seasoning which disappears when you wash the pan need to take it all the way up to leidenfrost if its not seasoned  no fucking point
  they use cast iron flat tops dumbass have you never seen a diner kitchen before
  seasoning which disappears when you wash the pan  if that happens it wasnt seasoned right
  not that idiot but flat top/plancha/teppanyaki grills arent cast iron theyre usually stainless steel
  you forgot to answer the questions bro
  hes talking about stainless bro stainless cannot be seasoned in the true sense of the word    i think were dealing with that idiot who has previously talked about quick seasoning stainless he doesnt know what seasoning actually is ive found it best to treat him like other idiots and just ignore whatever he says
  a traditional diner doesnt use a pan at all most use something like this but bigger with a stainless steel top    only thing youd use a pan for is omlets but that has more to do with the form of the pan being a mold for the omlets
  if you let your dish slave wash a stainless pan they will remove the seasoning it doesnt adhere worth shit anything more than waving hot water at it and wiping it off with a paper towel and its gone
  it doesnt adhere worth shit  thats because its not actually seasoned its just oily    seasoning involves a chemical reaction with the iron in the pan that cant happen to a stainless pan because its stainless theres no such thing as seasoning a stainless pan
  put it in the microwave and it will all even out
turn down your heat you fucking idiot its not our fault that you suck at cooking
  how is turning down the heat supposed to fix the fact that op put a large pan on a small hob
  did he specifically state that he did that  would still make him an idiot tho
  the heat can spread and be distributed more evenly throughout the pan
  seasoning stainless  are you retarded by definition its a pan that easily sheds the kind of buildup that you have on cast or carbon steel called seasoning
  did he specifically state that he did that  sure it says the food in the center is burnt and the food at the rim is raw the only way that could happen would be if the hob were smaller than the overall size of the pan        the heat can spread and be distributed more evenly throughout the pan  if that were the case ops problem would never have happened at all
  oh shit youre right i read it in reverse i guess food in center raw outside burnt my bad
  the only way that could happen would be if the hob were smaller than the overall size of the pan  with cast iron youd still need to have basically put it into a cold pan which is fucking stupid regardless of what pan you use
  seems like you have a shit stove
  are you making this up i always only put food in my cast iron once my oil or butter has heated up
  learn to read
  with cast iron youd still need to have basically put it into a cold pan which is fucking stupid regardless of what pan you use    what does that have to do with anything preheating is standard practice and youd be stupid not to do it but it has nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that op used a large pan on a small hob even if you have a superthick solid copper pan you still need to put large pans on large hobs    if you dont understand check out the section on pans in modernist cuisine matching your pan to the hob is far more important than what material your pan is made from when it comes to cooking evenly
  jesus christ what is wrong with me today
  cast iron is the meme king of transferring heat  turns out its all up to the stove  you can be dismissed now cast iron fags pan doesnt make a difference this fuck just ruined it for all of you
  im a carbon steel fag tho
  cast iron retains heat well but you need it to heat up in the first place which is never going to happen if your flame is too small
  well you can chuck it in the oven for a while
  yes that is another solution for ops retardation
  this cook might actually be serving food to people
  in what world does stainless steel retain seasoning thats the whole point of stainless
  ive never seen an industrial cast iron flat top my guess is that you havent either
  ill be charitable and assume he means this thing which shows up in a lot of cooking shows especially competitive ones like chopped
use nonstick pan  meat gets perfect sear  fish doesnt break  sauces cook nicely without a mess  stir frying is braindead  takes 10 seconds to clean afterward    use cast iron  food sticks  stuck food burns  stains require steel sponge  cant even clean like everything else  have to oil up before putting away  eventually rusts and needs a scrub oiling and putting in the oven for an hour  it also stinks
  can anyone else here cook with a variety of tools and utensils without fucking it up and without bitching
  treat a stainless steel pan right and it will be as nonstick as any teflon pan     how to quickseason a stainless steel pan to keep your food from sticking    1 heat the clean empty pan on your stovetop  2 pour in a quarter tsp of water when the pan is hot  3 if the water sizzles and boils off the pan is not hot enough yet keep heating  4 if the water doesnt evaporate but floats and rolls around the bottom like a puddle of quicksilver leidenfrost effect the pan is hot enough  5 now wipe the pan completely dry with a dish towel pour in some hightemperature cooking oil eg canola and coat the pan thoroughly by spreading it with a kitchen tissue or a spatula  6 keep heating the pan until the oil just barely begins to smoke keep it at that temperature for a minute  7 pour out the excess cooking oil and let the pan cool down to the desired temperature    wa la you now have a perfectly nonstick stainless steel pan the seasoning will last through all frying until you strip it off with dish soap or acidic stuff
  oh god it is the superautist who insists on the 100 correct use of the word seasoning in the mechanical engineereing or chemical sense because he is some kind of engineer i have just posted my ss quick seasoning guide again just for you you stupid asshole
  cast iron will distribute heat evenly you have to have your heat set at where you want it and let your pan equalize the heat
  stainless steel  season  this is bait right
deep frying is impossible on a cast iron they dont distribute heat evenly only practical use is baking
  cold oil in a hot pan and nothing will stick to your clean stainless steel pan dont waste your time coating your pan in burnt canola oil     if you really insist on seasoning anything use flaxseed oil or some other drying oil as those are the ones that polymerize and create the nonstick coat
  jesus chist not again people on a cooking forum associate seasoning a pan with creating a nonstick surface so that is why i use the term even for a staiinless steel pan and it s not seasoning in the traditional sense of the word ok
  if you are actually deep frying then the food will not even touch the metal because it will be swimming in oil retard
  oil in a hot pan  that is exactly what the seasoning guide is about
  canola oil  burning  used to cook food  you cant be serious
  who says anything about burning you just barely touch the smoking point as you would do with searing any steak oil doesnt burn from that
2018   not eating fast food    are you bullied mentally handicapped or both    bbut it kills you    and is life a contest about who lives the longest    its addicting    its not as long as youre not underaged and you can eat it in moderation    itsits expensive    what are you poor who forces you to buy mcds every day anyway fucking peatgavel
your meme justifications seem like pretty valid reasons    i dont eat fast food because i can make better food at home though i would if i was away from my kitchen for an extended period of time so you do you
i love cooking and i love knowing what is going into the food i make    i am not concerned with living long but i know that eating junk tends to lead to a bad mood    id rather fuel my body with food it can actually get proper nutrition from than what fast food restaurants have to offer
  yeah pretty much this i just dont eat fast food in n out is like a once a month exception but they use fresh ingredients so its quality is closer to an actual restaurant tbh i make the best burgers at home turns out eddie murphy was right all along
expensive for what you get  bad nutritionally  tastes like shit compared to home made  the high school kid/loser probably stepped on your lettuce
  i didnt know it was first posted here but the file name makes it seem like it wasnt the original poster guess it was a repost    i wish exif data never started getting stripped out
i only enjoy fast food if its past midnight and ive just finished drinking or working    all other times it just tastes like shit
  are you a gremlin
  this mostly fast food is only good when youre drunk
  it is fucking expensive in europe a big mac menu cost 10 euros where i live
its amazing and wonderful how resilient /ck/ is to shitposters
it hurts my tummy and gives a terrible aftertaste seriously even chick fil a hash browns make my mouth taste repulsive
  that was the weirdest part of visiting mcdonalds in europe    they seem to have just replaced currency signs without actually converting anything its overpriced and tastes even worse
  its 750 where i live move to a better country
suomi
  correction poorer
  i go to mcdonalds to show i am a wealthy successful walmart cashier  has the economy gotten this bad in flyover states
it tastes like garbage its not worth what you pay and its horrible for you    how the fuck tries to act smug about eating fast food what is this
  bad nutritionally  but it isnt a big mac contains both protein carbohydrate and vitamins the calorific content is about right for a main meal
  perkele
  no pekka
  2018  shilling for fast food  you sound fat as fuck kys already you cancerous piece of human garbage
  how much were you paid to post that
  plus 5000 times the rda of sugar enjoy your beetus lardy
  unlike you sad sacks of shit i actually enjoy life and dont think cutting 10 years off my lifespan is worth it for some shitty food
  anyone else notice alot of fast food places are being redesigned with minimalist/cubist architecture    not a big deal but just something i only recently noticed
  tastes like shit  i wish ive been dragged to mcd after several years of no fast food the sandwich tasted like blankflavored fucking nothing  not even grease or salt
  i would probably get it once a week if i didnt leave in the middle of nowhere so never get it last time was probably 8 months ago
    people cant even define what fast food is is it the food i bet you i could find the same food in a sit down restaurant does that make it no longer fast food
  its the only way they can change things up  oh the mcrib is back oh the signature artisan chicken sandwich is back ive had those thousands of times in my life already its not fucking new
  the votes of these people count more than yours
  1 us dollars has been deposited into your account  the value is terrible it doesnt event taste that good its fattening and loaded with sugar ill get it when im travelling but thats about it and i hate long distance travel and avoid it when i can
  i live in france you 
  its even weirder because my country baguettistan has the biggest number of macdonalds of the world after the us of a but it seems they dont give a fuck
an unhealthy body will lead to an unhealthy mind
and is life a contest about who lives the longest  no  its about being 70 years old and be healthy enough to keep enjoying life pleasures and not spend the last 5 years ill and having to eat flavorless mashed potatoes because shit food habits
  what is a peatgavel
  the fuck you talking about     i want to assfuck you and your mother alternating between her ass and your mouth then i want to piss in her asshole and kick you in the shin oh sorry so sorry that was the fast food talking
  i stopped eating fast food because it doesnt taste good and i dont like the way it makes me feel after eating it i like the idea of fast food  that for a couple bucks you can just grab something tasty on the go but the reality of it was consistently disappointing so i dont bother with it anymore
  i would start eating at macronalds again if they wide released that veggie burger mmm with the now tallowless fries too
  yeah but it includes tax and tip so actually it costs the same
  alright dude
  average taste at best  unhealthy   inconsistent  lowhygiene  expensive  addictive for the weak     why would you even fast food

randomly decide to see how much i can go without eating gigantic piles of food  eat small portions chewing slowly never snacking always sit down for meals  keep it up for 2 weeks  check scale  lost 16 fucking pounds    holy shit it was literally that easy
  stop eating so much fatty isnt just meme advice
  you now realize that intermitent fast actually works    t former fatso
  eating normal sized meals and not snacking is considered fasting by fatty fats
  no intermittent fasting is like going 20 hours without food and then eating a meal during the other 4 it does work and its really easy once you get your body into that cycle
  always sit down for meals  huh and here i always thought the problem was that i never got up that and all the vodka
  you ever tried not eating when you were raised to clean your plate raised to be my big boy gotta eat type    fucking hard man
  op said nothing about stupid fad diets retard take your clickbait garbage to reddit
  nope as the other anon mentioned above with intermitent fasting you can go for 20 hours or even more without eating
    op didnt do that though you dumb lardasses he just ate normal sized meals and didnt snack going 20 hours without eating is pointless when you can just not over eat at your regular meals
  did the same thing and made sure to get 30 minutes minimum exercise every day and l lost 80lbs no fasting no meme diets just eating like a normal human and staying active
i have turkey stock and a lot of cooked turkey breast and thigh meat that i no longer want to eat can i use cooked meat in the raft for consomme im worried it wont still float

i have some cabbage  i want to make some salad  what do i use as a dressing 
  i like homemade honey mustard dressing on cabbage really accentuates the sweet flavor of cabbage
  do you want to make salad or coleslaw
  shred it finely  add ramen season packet  crushed ramen noodles  sliced almonds  salt   pepper  vinegar  wa la stinky salad
  ranch
turn it into chips instead
  this honestly doesnt sound too bad  would mix the ramen packet salt pepper vinegar together first with a small squeeze of mayo to make a dressing  toss cabbage shreds with almonds and noodles  toss with dressing
  put some mandarin orange wedges in too its the classic grocery store deli asian salad
  ginger/carrot/sesame oil dressing is nice
  mayonnaise cider vinegar and black pepper
  soup
nothing eat it plain and raw
  add some celery seeds too they are great on cabbage
  and juniper berries

rate my glazed duck ravioli i made the raviolis myself as well    the duck was a little chewier than i prefer but its my first time cooking it so its not a big deal
  what are the raviolis stuffed with what kind of sauce is on the duck and raviolis
decent for a first attempt     whats in the ravioli
  for me you went a little heavy on the glaze i like to roast my duck in a cast iron pan so i get that beautiful rendered cracklin skin on top i would just lewdly drizzle glaze all across the dish so that i could get the interplay between the texture of pasta and crunchy duck skin with just a taste of the sauce i like the pairing though im gonna steal it and fry butternut squash raviolis in the rendered duck fat with a balsamic reduction glaze thanks for your inspiration friend
more like glazed cuck ravioli
  not bad ravioli is fun to make
  there are 4 ravioli
  how did you make the ravioli dough
  both ravioli and duck look oversauced plating needs work whats the veg on the top left ravioli and why is it there when the rest of it is under the duck

whenever i buy ground beef season with salt and pepper and form it into hamburgers it always tastes like shit when lots of restaurants claim thats all they use and it tastes great ive tried buying all different kinds from different places    what am i missing
  mayo ketchup and mustard if you do it right you shouldnt taste the meat at all
  youre doing something wrong protein salt pepper and maillard reaction  flavor
/ck/ chimps out if my steak isnt seasoned  /ck/ chimps out if my burgers are seasoned
  but nobody in this thread complained about burgers being seasoned what are you talking about
  what am i missing  a high temperature flat top and a grill press
you dont season before you form the patty season when its in the pan flip and season again thats the way i do it
  msg
are you slathering it in butter
  a flat top not a grill
  sear the fuck out of it thin patty cooked fast use a cast iron if you have a shit stove like an electric use the oven to get pan hot as shit like put that bitch at 500 if it will let you
form patty season liberally with salt and pepper let it rest 1520 minutes cook on medium high heat
  this i made a big mac sauce and slathered it on everyones burger at a recent gathering they all said it was the best burger they ever had
    here are some good tips    i think touching the ground meat as little as possible  only seasoning the outside right before you cook are the main things youre probably getting wrong
  buy a pound of ground beef v8 onion soup mix garlic powder worshteshire sp then make patties to die for
  if you want a mcdonalds type burger the main beef ingredients need to be offal  liver kidneys heart lung and other organ meat  the liver is what gives mcds burgers their particular taste and density  try making a homebrew hamburger as thin and see if it holds together  try a 50/50 mix of ground sirloin and liver  its still beef since it came from a cow no rule about where on the cow the beef came from
  restaurants secret is they use lots of butter and sugar
  i hope you made real mac sauce which is mustard/mayo combo and not just generic thousand island which is of course ketchup/mustard which many mistake mac sauce to be even though the yellow and not pink color should give it away
  add the salt well ahead of time and salt the exterior of each let formed patties rest wrapped in cling film in the fridge 15 hours at least taste the raw mince dont do this if you live in the us as it probably isnt safe for seasoning to make sure you have enough salt
    whats the point ofa burger if you cant taste the burger just have a mayo sandwich
  wtf are you going on about
  its not really more or less safe anywhere in the first world im a burger and my dad eats it raw all the time while prepping stop being so obsessed
  tasteless burger has a lot more protein than a mayo sandwich
  i find when i fry my patties in a pan greased with tallow they come out tasting way better i dont think restaurants do this but it makes the burger taste great with salt and pepper as seasoning also most restaurants use patties that have higher fat  than normal the place i used to work at used patties that were 70 lean 30 fat
  most likely youre not getting a good enough sear trying to do burgers in a pan can be tricky because the juices stay near the burger which stops it from browning if you make thicker burgers reverse searing actually works pretty well since any juices will come out before doing the sear and wont hinder it
difference is youre buying preground meat from a grocery store and a good restaurant will grind their own and use quality meat
  salt pepper garlic and onion powder   youre welcome
this may be obvious but make sure to wash your minced meat thoroughly before forming the patties otherwise the flavor wont develop
  thats why you suck
  nothing else to think about in australia
  yeah i worked at mcdonalds and we would always fresh grind dry aged carcasses from the local artisan butchers
  this is some woke level bullshit
  sauce im intrigued by the whole organ meat mix pretty cool if true
  you dont know how to cook them properly
  season with msg too
  add some tofu to it if you masturbate to proteins
should i mix my ground beef with an egg
seasoning something youre searing    yikes hope you like burned pepper
  restaurant patties usually have some fat in them really adds to the flavor as it cooks
  fry it in alot of butter  put a few teaspoons of cognac or worcestershire if you dont have any at home in the mix
try a little bit of this shit or god forbid liquid smoke  also smash the patties down right into a good bit of butter
  black pepper is already burnt
  its to keep it together doesnt do much for taste though
lots of salt   a lot more than youre putting on it  more salt   no anon more than that   more

what am i missing  onion powder mostly then a touch of garlic powder look it up if you dont believe me thats what gives the burger its classic taste
  mutts washing their unsafe meat fuck off
  4chan is for digital chimpouts because were too weak and civilized to do it in public blacks/muslims can chimpout in public with little to no consequence just let us have our one place to shitpost and fuck off if you dont like it
  washing meat is stupid and does nothing but spread more potential bacteria in the sink but its something people are attached to doing cooking food over heat already cleans it
  people complain when food isnt seasoned  yeah because it tastes like shit if it isnt
  thousand island is ketchup and mayo not mustard you big ugly buffoon
  holy fuck you are gay as shit
  faggot
       thousand island   is a little less than regulated but is generally ketchup mayo and relish that said it often does contain mustard and might not contain ketchup depending on the recipe most inhouse made at burger joints will be some combination of ketchup mustard mayo and relish occasionally with pickle hot pepper fresh onion etc   russian dressing   is primarily ketchup and mayo with some horseradish occasionally capers pimento chives and/or pickled beet/juice   french and catalina   may be ketchup and mayo based light on the mayo or simply based around ketchup blended with oil and an emulsifier other than egg because that would essentially be back to mayonnaise a little sugar some paprika usually often a bit of vinegar to thin it out and some garlic if memory serves it cant be mayobased in the us but ive never worked a kitchen or foodmanufacturing job in the us so i wouldnt know    the original question  seasoning salt at least as close to grill time as possible and a good sear make all the difference a good fat content 20 at the absolute least a moderately tough cut of meat if possible youre beating the hell out of it anyway tough muscle and even connective tissue help bind and add flavour and a reasonable grind/chop youre not making meat paste help    obviously things vary but i usually use chuck with a decent fat content  id rather cut some out for use in something else than have it be too lean and run it through a coarse grind twice i barely form it into cohesive meatballs slap them muthas down on a hot seasoned steel plate over the grill salt allow a good edgetoedge sear then use a sharpened spatula to flip them over to the grill then season the improvised flattop helps the first sear and helps keep the patties from shrinking the flame allows the fat to render and gives a bit of smoke to it
  if your burger isnt thicker then your pinkie its a bad burger  five guys  burger king  in and out  all shit because their patties are literally thinner then my fucking fingernail yet people will buy it despite not even being able to taste the meat
  probably cooking it worse than jack
shallots in the meat make it nice
  mate goto maccys breakfast and get 4 patties in a breakfast mcmuffin  the pork tastes good cant say the same for their beef
     fat     you are missing fat in the burger
    depends where you get your ground beef supermarkets generally just use shitty meat with fillers and preservatives but not the same ones as fast food    ground chuck or round steak will get you a gkod burger meat but dont ever expect it to taste like fast food     if the patty hasnt been super processed flavoured artificially to taste like beef after the antibiotics have been washed out and parcooked then snap frozen and stored for months and reheated on an unclean grill that has cooked 100 patties before it it just isnt going to have that maccy ds taste
  is this really true people actually wash their meat i mean the heat is kill anything dangerous that lurks on the surface if something isnt killed on the inside its still too deep to wash off it sounds like all youd be doing is washing flavor away ive never heard of this practice it sounds completely illogical and counterproductive      then again i dont wash my fruits and vegetables either if im the only eating them so whatever but i at least understand the logic behind that
  if i cook you a shit do you eat it because the heat kill anything dangerous bro
  nah dude they use a bunch of shit usually butter
  whenever i buy ground beef  dont buy a cut you like and have it ground for burgers you want something fatty like shoulder and neck cuts you need plenty of fat in there or it will be awful in fact if the meat youre using is too lean you can buy some suet and add that to the meat when you grind it    season it a day in advance use beef tallow for frying
  use msg
  love
  this op also your meat is probably too lean
  use 80/20 salt and pepper patty should be about as thick as your fingers thicker if youre a girly man
  no they dont
  that doesnt even make sense washing meat is based on the assumption that your harmful elements from the outside when the most dangerous part of meat is all throughout and running water over it wont touch the inside thats why we disinfect everything raw meat touches not just what the skin touches     fruits and vegetables are known to be sprayed during the growth season theyre rinsed during packaging but theres no reason to rinse them again once theyre in your kitchen since the danger is factually there on the surface it the pesticides were injected inside the apple no one would cut it open to rinse off the inside they just wouldnt eat it so why is meat treated differently when the very low risk is 100 contained inside the meat
   omg becky this salt contains sodium chloride   i read somewhere it like gives you cancer and hypertension and stuff   i only use chemicalfree organic salt
  get fatter beef
  add breadcrumbs and an egg perfect every time
  enjoy your early onset bowel and stomach cancer
  im not going to read this cluster fuck of a thread but if op or anyone else is interested im making burgers tonight for dinner and ill show you what the fuck is up with a dank ass burger in about 2 hours when im off work see there bitches
  youre buying low quality beef any decent restaurant is grinding their own hamburger from higherquality cuts of meat also meat to fat ratio is important youre not gonna get a restaurant quality burger just buying hamburger from the grocery store
  this cant be stated enough  get some chuck and sirloin maybe add some beef trimmings and grind away
  msg doesnt cause cancer you retard its immediately broken down into glutamate and sodium which your body already contains and uses constantly for basic biological functions the closest thing to a known stomach cancer risk is for heavy consumption of certain specific preserved foods that have high salt content not for salt itself and definitely not for msg
    idk my grocery store has pretty high quality beef they grind in house and sell in the little butcher trays along with the other cuts they custom chop im not op btw
  your grocery store isnt grinding the high quality meat then stupid  even high quality beef trimmings arent going to taste amazing    do you see what they grind or do you just trust that they obviously grind up the better tasting cuts so you can make burgers
  they all said it was the best burger they ever had  or they just said that to be polite
  russian dressing usually has eshies in it too
  learn how supermarket meat grinders work
  well they only have decent cuts in store they arent handling whole or half carcasses theyre buying like big primal portions and going from there its a combo of the odds and ends off of those pieces so essentially the same thing you guys do at home just on a bigger grinder and yes ive seen them do it and i talk shop with the staff in there regularly theyre chill people taught me how to clean crabs based winco is where it be my man also we really dont need to name call over burgers do we seems unnecessary
  the only good answer in the thread    jesus christ bongs have no fucking clue how to make burgers
  why would anybody do that to higherquality cuts of meat what a ridiculous idea fucking hell
  its illegal to sell lung for consumption in the united states i doubt mcds would try to get away with it
  literally all i use and i get a nice tasty burger what  ground beef are you using are you fucking with then while cooking them
  i get this because i used to try to make mcdonalds style burgers and they never came out right i think there are two factors first you need to press the meat really thin since it will shrink when cooked second i suspect most fast food users 30 fat instead of 1020 fat you buy retail
  dont season the mince you retard season patties right before grilling
use garlic
high temperature flat top grill smashed flat patties to maximize surface a shit load of oil and butter some combination fake big mac like sauce where you combine ketchup mayo pickle relish etc ahead of time
  breadcrumbs onion powder pepper salt paprika garlic powder
  op used garbage tier meat then wondered why his burger tasted like garbage  if op is serious about his burger game he going need to grind his own meat
  chuck roast is the best for grinding burger debate me
  i dont know would you wash it first
  im too ignorant of the subject to engage in a debate
  onion powder garlic powder and salt is what i use and its always good
  wtf why not just use onion and garlic
  if i wash you a shit would you eat it
  chucks good as a standard but for special occasions i like short rib better seems to have a richer flavor though it could be psychological
  youre missing a shitload of butter pepper and salt
  its aleays weird to me when people say this my patties never fall apart what the fuck are people doing wrong where they need an egg to keep it together
    if anything the charring on the beef does worse than msg
  buying food
here you go op
  make sure you dont leave it raw or cook it to a cinder          unironically this
the simplest way to the juiciest burger is olive oil add 1 tbsp per pound of ground meat add alot of fresh cracked black pepper but do not put salt on your beef whether it is a hamburger patty to a porterhouse off the grilldo not add salt until resting meat adding salt before or during cooking will dry out the beef salt after cooking
throw in some bread crumbs in itll absorb the meat juice and make the burgs less dry  crack an egg into it for good measure also shape the burgers before you season  dont season the batter it will just overpower the beef and taste like peppery shit  dont push down on the burgers once theyre in the pan to try to make them thinner  thatll just push the juice out and make them swell even easier
      newfags that havent been around long enough to see people complain its a burger not meatloaf
  cut part of your salt with msg  make thinner patties thin like the ones in your picture and cook them hot so they get nice and cruspy  get a grill press if you dont already have one  browning  flavor    past that if you still dont think your burgs are good then you need to step up your topping and condiment game
  cringe get a passport jamal
  its illegal to sell lung for consumption in the united states  is that why nobody does haggis here
  thats usually a response to people putting breadcrumbs in them
  yeah
how do i season chicken so it tastes like the one from medieval times bros
  old bay old bay was brought back crusaders after they sacked constantinople
  never been lmao corn and potatoes at medieval times it gets me every time if you want a real medieval chicken recipe that would be fun start with a coc au vin recipe maybe modify it a bit and youll be pretty close
medieval times dinner and tournament
  ok you pretentious faggot
  btfo by based sperg
    waaah someone gave me legitimate advice but they insulted my picture
  reddit
get a non zogfarmed free range chicken and add salt
there were no utensils in medieval times hence there are no utensils at medieval times would you like a refill on that pepsi
  neither of them were me i just pulled the pic off google the coc au vin sounds nice but im not looking for a gravy based thing just what herbs and spices would give roast chicken that good flavour
  use the plague
  medieval times  corn  dropped my plate and walked right out at that moment
  medieval people didnt eat chicken they ate rotten food
  why would they let the food rot it makes more sense to eat it fresh
  medieval lords ate chicken as a sign of wealth   look at me i can eat my egglayers because im so rich   but they usually boiled it
chicken at medieval times  when i was a kid they had dragon
  2nd post guy again i avoided the shitpost fest too in medieval europe they would have flavored chicken with local herbs which are actually what we use today too so rosemary sage parsley fennel garlic and onion etc types of fish sauces related to roman garum may have also been used its possible that wealthier people especially in italy and southern france could have afforded expensive imported spices like peppercorn cinnamon and cloves    sides would be roasted roots like turnips beets carrots more onion various types of mushrooms and morels all roasted alongside the chicken in either a dutch oven or directly in a stone oven you could just roast everything together in a large cast iron pan and get similar results types of offal sausages or black puddings may have also been an accompianant for a great feast also crusty hearty bread always crusty hearty bread and it was uses like a utensil of sorts similarly how naan or tortillas are traditionally used in their cultures     diners at medieval feasts would be expected to bring their own personal spoon and knife to use as necessary
  thanks anon i will try those spices out i have a ceramic dutch oven and a cast iron pan so ill try each method on different occasions good post
  nah rotisseries would be loaded with rows of chickens and operated over an open flame by servents in the kitchen typically the rotisserie operators in the plantagenets kitchens were allowed an unlimited ale ration due to the terrific thirst and probably arm soreness lol this job caused
  glad you enjoyed it history and cooking are two if my great passions i wish someone would just pay me to larp as a cook from different eras but i fear my historical pedantry would get in the way of real profits
  it would make for a great cooking show on youtube or twitch id watch the fuck outta that
  nah rotisseries would be loaded with rows of chickens  they didnt eat that much chicken in that time
  medieval times  potatoes  corn    what the fuck im actually mad fine i can let potatoes go but fucking corn even imbeciles know corn was a new world crop how hard is it to serve bread and root vegetables instead
  use this stuff op it works wonders on chicken and will get you laid
  so are all capsicums hot peppers bell peppers the goes on
  dont forget tomatoes
  all gourds as well like pumpkins squash etc
  buboniced
  true the lords would have had a variety of fowls on their rotisserie i was just working under the presumption that if a lord were to throw a chicken feast for some reason rotisseries would be the tool of choice older cocks and old layers past their prime would have also been eaten and boiled but likely in a sauce or broth of some invention and over a lower heat what we would be more apt to call in todays cooking parlance a simmer or slow cook that would create a rich gravy like coc au vin or a flavorful strong broth the kind that in and of itself would provide a good amount of nutrients
  are you sourcing this or just pulling it out of your ass   they do have medieval cookbooks ya know
  yeah ive read a few of em ive also read relevant historical texts from the period by more rigorous academics and they also talk about diet and methodology barbra tuchman in particular has some beautiful passages that include fully translated courses from a particular feast i just tried to find a digital copy of it without a paywall but i couldnt maybe ill look it up and post a pic later
  in my research lords would go hunting that was their entertainment for the feast hunting chickens doesnt sound very sporting so most meats would come from game animals like deer
  ditch the vegetables and meat and stick with old bread and water you peasant only us royalty can afford spices and food
  that was mostly symbolic feasts would be for hundreds of people provisions would be procured from a number of traditional channels maybe the head table would get the hunt of the day but largesse was the name of the game and a feast would include whole banners of knights and often their squires especially if they were young nobles idk what you read and im not trying to insult your intelligence or anything but feeding an entire feast with the fruits of a mostly social outting among noble men to talk banter and take the piss out of each other is simply not feasible
  filtered
  youd have to get permission from the king for pheasants if on his property
      found one of the passages about feasts capons are chickens and they werent beneath the king of france stuntin on the hre
  goddamn sideways format randomly pops up
  add seasoning onto it while you overcook it also tons and tons of salt
you faggots arent eating the crunchy tasty treat of ortolan
  well said
  nor are you but its very impressive that youve heard of it nonetheless
chicken  fuck that get yourself a capon
  because it was a precursor to aging meat they thought the longer you left meat to age the more tender it got also they fooled themselves into thinking that spices would mask the rotten taste of the food
  pretentious what pretending to have the most basic awareness of world history wow
  aging meat is a lot older than the medieval period
  isnt that illegal
  no they didnt they knew the difference between salted/smoked/dried/aged and rotten in fact most places in medieval europe had laws against selling rotten meat or meat that was starting to turn
  and    food timeline  org will source a lot of those recipes as they first appear in historical texts fried chicken goes back to the 1st century they show if you want actual medieval period food this site will link you to a well known source godecookery which is a good link of links related to chaucers cantebury tales time period        i havent been to medieval times since a child but good rubbed roast chicken can be anything you like try a premade spice blend like herbes du provence sage and savory based poultry seasoning blends with paprika old timey cooks often added dessertlike spices to meat which can be unusual for modern palates which i doubt theyd do actual traditionally at a tourist place lest people sent it back all the time for being off think ginger mace allspice nutmeg cinnamon and such on the meat at the same time as savory flavors
  toss it in the dirt first
salt garlic and/or onion powder paprika sage

anyone got a good recipe for chicken livers
  pan fry chicken livers and set to one side  in a frying pan add butter or oil and soften some diced shallots and garlic  add madeira wine and reduce by half  add cream and gently cook until thickened   add a few halved grapes    to serve   toast some bread preferably brown/wholegrain/granary  toast on the plate  chicken livers on top  spoon over the sauce  scatter a spponful of pine nuts over the top     to make it more basic scrap the grapes madeira and pine nuts instead add some sliced muchrooms when you are cooking the shallots and garlic
  put it on a fish hook then cook the fish
  you could make pat√©
  marinate in buttermilk and your fave chicken seasoning dip in flour or cornmeal or both then deep fry
i personally prefer chicken hearts used to buy them in bulk during college years because they cost like a buck per kilo   fry hears in butter  remove from heat  in the same pan fry diced onions and carrot  add a bit of tomato puree tablespoon of curry paprika and a little kayenne  add chicken stock or watercube  add hearts back  add a can of crushed tomatos  serve with rice or rice noodles cheap and easy
  i usually just coat them in olive oil salt and pepper and broil on high for a few minutes until a slight char forms but theyre still medium in the center    i prefer gizzards and those i like to brine in buttermilk and hotsauce for 24 hours salt and pepper dredge in seasoned flour and fry in cast iron serve slathered in hot sauce
fry in olive oil med high heat and turn until slightly browned add butter in temp down add garlic majorjam and other herbs you want like rosemary fry for a couple mins splash of wine deglaze temp up add shredded tomato pepper and some kind of paprika if you want and let simmer for like 15 mins maybe or less livers really shouldnt be overcooked add salt near the end
  good  chicken  livers  pick two
  they are a luxury in japan
pate  jewish kind
  heat some butter in a frying pan add chicken liver heat until cooked
canonically on toothpicks with bacon and water chestnuts
  possessing palate  you  pick one
  okay  i choose possessing palate    chicken livers bad
  whats it like not being you oh wait you insisted on remaining you by retaining your received wisdom too bad
i know that dairy has a lot of estrogen so ive been looking at alternatives to dairy ice cream is almond ice cream a better alternative
  ive always thought your mums cream was a great alternative
  implying you banged ops mom is pretty based but you also imply that you gave her oral which is beta as fuck so i dont know semibased and pinkpilled i guess
if a weeny bit of estrogen affects you then you are already low test
  kekked  a real hero would just suck the brown cream straight from ops moms prolapsed asshole
  fuck off back to /pol/eddit
  if youre eating enough ice cream for the estrogen to be a problem youve got other issues at that point
  dairy cows are pumped full of estrogen while they lactate as they have recently given birth its a massive dose of estrogen
  and you know it doesnt stay in your blood right
  shut up faggot   i sucked my own dick after banging the bejeezus out of her pussy
  based and unisexual then
  if youre this desperate about having more estrogen in your body youd be better off taking some estradiol already anon
if you eat ice cream youre already a fag
  i cant imagine not being able to read how do you function in society
  sounds like youre coping
i know that dairy has a lot of estrogen  fragile  weak  insecure  beta  manlet  cuck
  people have been drinking milk for hundreds of years without an issue so the problem is in your head
  grug see joke  what joke huh grug not understand durrrrr
dont get soy milk based ice cream that has more estrogen the regular milk
  seething
  i know that dairy has a lot of estrogen    clearly you dont know shit then
  imagine the level of education of this post
  its a massive dose of estrogen  who cares  oral hormones are not effective your liver breaks them down well before they have a chance to do anything hormones are not effective unless your body is receiving a 24/7 supply of them
  so soy milk is safe too the amount of backpeddling carnists do is retarded
  you sound like a complete faggot so i dont see why you should be concerned about estrogen in dairy
  carnists  people are omnivores not carnists moron    this is why we make fun of you
 soy milk is safe too  your reading comprehension is abysmal its the frequency of consumption which matters not the food itself soy milk or even a bottle of pure estrogen is fine so long as you dont consume them frequently    as for soy milk sure its safe unless youre drinking it constantly all day long it tastes pretty bad and it has questionable additives in it so i wouldnt go around singing its praises
    imagine being so damaged from veganism you cant differentiate fact from fiction
  does it mess with your transformation
  is almond ice cream a better alternative  no its an afront to the ice cream god
            t big dairy
  t giant faggot
  i bet faggot op also belives in homeopathy
cashew ice cream is the best ive had even thicker and creamier than dairy      animal and plant estrogen are fully separate things in terms of functions in an animal body plant estrogens bind the same receptors but without giving estrogenic effects like animal estrogen does the only effect they have even in high amounts is stopping other estrogen from working estrogen is still a stupid reason to be worried about ice cream but in terms of actual effect its the second highest food on the list after steak
gone but not forgotten
  i only drink fruit punch recovery and orange pure zero the watermelon is also acceptable
  fruit punch recovery is ok orange recovery makes me want to kill myself i remember i first saw it and didnt read the label think i was drunk or something just assumed it was orange boom brought back i was very disappointed
  i thought the orange recovery tasted like a melted popsicle
how true is this
  meme pizzas are gay
  just like op
  only if its a combo
  the top pizza is actually amazing much better than the cardboard with leftovet cheese swept off the factory floor
    i ate about 5 of these over the course of 2 days and even the smell of them makes me puke now these pizzas are fucking nasty but since all frozen pizzas are at least buy the ones that advertise being good
  that old style before they changed  i came where do you get those original styles before they went cheap with the rectangles
  maybe if youre a faggot who lives their life based on what the populous of a taiwanese cat wrestling forum thinks  a functional person realizes that both options are shit and then makes his own pizza
  he doesnt eat the supreme flavor
  yea because making the dough letting it proof and kneading it is really practical try killing yourself you retarded faggot
tostinos microwave pizza is better than digiornos red baron hell even dominos and pizza hut
  how do you live with yourself
  so make something more practical or if you insist on pizza then either put forth the effort and make it or just order at a decent pizza joint or restaurant
  telling someone to kill themself for telling people to cook on a cooking board   god help us  go to any pizza place and ask for a dough ball then add your own ingredients it will be a thousand times better than your frozen garbage and its a million times more respectable than forcing yourself to eat the literal bottom of the barrel frozen trash because your scared that your anonymous internet club will call you reddit for eating something else fucking prick
  do all frozen pizzas come out greasy and shitty i tried the first pizza in the op pic and it was okay at best
  basically the only one i think is decent are those detroit ones
  at that point might as well get carryout from a chain itll be cheaper and better than frozen shit
shilling iit for top pizza ive had it a couple times and theyre bland
  i like tostinos pizzas only if im super drunk of course i really preferred them back in the day nowadays the crust just tastes like flaky cardboard ive never had a screaming sicilian pizza but i do like those dr oetker pizzas
  this
  shit facebook meme  get the fuck out
all frozen pizza is trash
  the rectangles are shit they dont even have the mustaches
the garlic parmesan pizza sauce is absolute kino
  my nigga good post op
  i prefer the mango habenero saus desu
yes goy keep getting used to eating pizza
  i wish i could order half and half tomato and garlic online i dont like talking on the phone
  would you like it delivered to you too
    what the fuck is this even supposed to mean you triple faggot
  it means (((they))) are putting (((soy))) in the pizza to promote (((miscegenation))) its all on qanoncom
    put on a trip so i can filter you
  its pretty obvious that the jews are trying to get the lower classes accustomed to food of inferior quality containing among others soy msg and aluminium with no regard for the consumers health its all to cut costs in the long run until they are the only people left eating real food while you enjoy your pizzastyle product like a cuck
    you too shitstain
  how did he even get in there
do you even know what kino means you fucking idiot
  their sausage marina pasta is fucking delicious
  i personally prefer the sauce they put on the bread
  based tastelet
whats your favorite butter stick dipping sauce if you do dip them for me its sweet baby rays honey barbecue
  miracle whip
  check em and shmeck em

  i like to add candied orange peel to my blondies are they still blondies though
  flan  all desserts
    no theyre orangies
  why are women so ugly now   take me back
  dont you mean gingers to keep with the hair colour theme
  gingers sounds too much like gingersnaps
  who the fuck even likes brownies they taste like an overlyrich chocolate cake that someone fucked up in the oven
  women have always been ugly generally most people are ugly only a select few are beautiful
  dang
  maybe youre just gay anon
ahem  brookies
    basically blondies are brownies without cocoa powder

kitchen doesnt accept substitutions  this is how you know they have confidence in their menu only shitty places that know theyre serving bland food will allow substitutions because they know they have to make up for their shit recipes
no substitutions    what if i want my burger without onions or tomato is that ok

what if i want the waitress to slap me
grandpa on a restricted diet because of health  go to a restaurant  order a meal but ask for them to not add salt and no sauce because he cant have them  oh i dont know if we can do that let me ask  the chef refuses the accommodation  tell him its for health reasons  ok let me talk to him  he said he will just add a little bit of salt but he wont leave off the sauce  no he cant have it  ok let me go talk to him again  alright he said he will not add salt but hes sending the sauce on the side  nobody is going to eat your fucking sauce    and thats how you lose customers so not only will we not go there again but we will shit talk the place every time its relevant and word of mouth will spread
  sounds like your grandpa needs to be put out to pasture 2bh
  what kind of sauce was it i would have probably eaten it
  they come out of the freezer like that already
  honestly if the waitress wont slap me and call me a dirty piggy and spit in my food then i am not going back
  why take someone on a restricted diet to a restaurant thats stupid either give grandpa a break for one meal and let him have something with flavor or just keep him in the environment where his restricted diet can be maintained
  everyone should accomodate to a defective old coot
  and thats why we have lcd food service here in murrica that fag grandpa should have been euthanized for the benefit of society
  its his doctors fault he had a kidney disease that destroyed them which the doctor saw the early warning signs of but didnt tell him because he didnt think it would be a big deal  the very same doctor put him on diabetes medication and while he was driving his sugar crashed and he passed out it caused a big accident and a few people had to go to the hospital  when he got examined at the hospital by the doctors there they determined he didnt even have diabetes to begin with    some kind of a tomato cream sauce he couldnt eat tomatoes because of potassium  when the kidneys go you need to keep your electrolytes carefully balanced    its a very simple request just dont put the fucking sauce on the plate
  because resraurants usually do accomodations you imbecile
  thats not a substitution i substitution would be if you asked for mashed potatoes on the side instead of fries
  usually means always  you may have inherited your grandpas retarded genes

  is it ever acceptable to take substitutions i think it is but you have to charge something like a few minutes of the head chefs salary for it you dont cook for charity and every minute of a kitchens time and every ingredient should be accounted for and ultimately up for a price
  if the restaraunt you cook for forces you to honor even one request for a substitution just walk out right there theyre clearly not serious about the art of cooking and theyre probably a shady moneylaundering operation masquerading as a restaurant
  where do i walk out to also where have you worked i hope youre not just a promoted line cook who hates when the owners friend shows up for a substitution and i hope you undestand /biz/
  its called the service industry for a reason anon you are there to serve your guests including substitutions
    plebs of the lowest order i wouldnt allow you within 100 feet of my kitchen
  and i wouldnt eat your meme food with goat cheese
  goat cheese pittuh i spit on your goat cheese goat cheese is one of the biggest frauds perpetrated on the american culinary world
  you dont have a kitchen you work someone elses
  good then substitute blue cheese on to everything you make that involves cheese im the one paying the bill after all
  thatll be an upcharge
  oh believe me i own my kitchen i own it by loving what i do and taking pride in my creations youre probably a ramen eating pleb who doesnt know gruyere from hollandaise     blue cheese  post hidden ip blocked
  i expect that when i ask for substitutions    so you dont actually own your kitchen then do you  blue cheese is goat
  as in you have restaurant
not liking goat cheese  not liking blue cheese
  da comrade i have restaurant
  i like butt cheese
  i own it by loving what i do and taking pride in my creations  do you own it by giving money to a landlord mortgage company or previous owner
cool show me your menu and tell me your income
  being unable to modify a recipe on the fly if needed is a sign of a shitty chef who only knows how to cook from a list of instructions   refusing to give substitutions is a massive red flag that a restaurant is trash and probably has chef mike as head of the kitchen
  you are there to serve your guests including substitutions  this is true but it only goes so far if youre cooking at a place where each dish is painstakingly worked out by the chef substitutions force you to serve a version of the dish that isnt what the chef wanted to serve youre being forced to put less than your best foot forward you can choose to do that for the sake of being accommodating but how far a place is willing to go along those lines definitely varies among establishments if the place is busy it might not be worth fucking up the rhythm on the line to accommodate one or two pickypants or special needs customers each place makes that calculation for themselves    and if its a shithole just microwaving frozen sysco premade shit they really cant do much in the way of accommodation anyways
  do you understand how property ownership works    you are not deserving my genius is unmatched in the culinary world to your simple uncultured eyes it would be like reading a lovecraftian tome
  yes we are kike go back to redddit
  i agree with this i suppose in my mind its substituting one or two ingredients or removing one or two like no sauce cheddar instead of american etc     yes you pay money get a deed or lease and then it is your place is that what you meant if you dont do that then you can be asked to leave at any moment by the person who actually owns the kitchen
for a nice restaurant the menu should have no more than 4 items in each catagory apps soup entree etc
  sysco is better than a lot of smalltime divachef ie 15 year long career kitchen boy bullshit
  its consistent which is much more important than making the best dish that ever existed the same night as you make half raw slop
  its a good thing i actually own my kitchen then why are you under the assumption that im poor i make more in a day than you make in 2 days
  well you posted  i own it by loving what i do and taking pride in my creations  which seemed like an end run around explaining that you dont actually own it what type of cuisine interesting dishes
  cool glad to know i was absolutely right about you
  where do i walk out to    the next restaurant over it is incredibly easy to get a job i am just a random nobody linecook but i wear my chef jacket home from work and i have been offered jobs if i stop in at places
  i assume youre saying you make 2x the amount of a standard kitchen hand
    is this the part when a 4chan thread devolves in to who makes more imaginary money at their imaginary job
  food beyond your wildest dreams or aspirations if a yokel like you took one bite you would have an out of body experience it would be like that scene in the seminal childrens classic ratatouille    you know nothing which is as much as your opinions are worth    at the least but i am no mere kitchen hand i am far beyond such a petty station i am a maverick of the culinary world an artisan simply put i know food
  so imaginary kitchen neat you could have said italian or something and kept the larp going
  its pure unrestrained autism to not be flexible you have tomatoes you have mushrooms give me tomatoes i dont want mushrooms
  disagreeing with standards and expectations isnt the same as being unable to adapt cooking isnt entirely subjective there are some objectively wrong substitutions that remove the point of the dish or inhibit its flavor
  please tell me your rhetoric isnt this gay irl
  sysco is better than a lot of smalltime divachef  no doubt but i dont want to pay to eat that shit nor do i want to eat with the kind of people who do
  donkey sauce most likely
  i dont even know who im talking to anymore    anyone who doesnt make substitutions owns their own restaurant or makes more than the owner thats my point
    go back to cleaning the fryers at mcdonalds both of you
  how much do you pay for a plate when you eat out
  that reaches a level of fine dining far beyond anything im willing to pay for i suppose   truffle oil gold leaf etc    i work at wendys thank you very much also i have a 9 penis and am gay if that matters
  that hard sunday omelette ban  i desperately want to know
  this is probably the biggest truth im tjis entire thread
    the point of a restaurant having a composed dish is so that everything works in tandem you absolute fucking cumstain  chef probably knew it would taste like shit if you ordered the dish all fucked up or maybe the prep for that dish was done with the sauce included so making an exception might have been a pretty big deal  you should have been a normal considerate human being and taken take your grandpa to somewhere he can eat the things they sell or if you need to have it your way im sure you know the directions to the nearest burger king
  shut the fuck up you stupid faggot
  you dont think chef bends over backwards to make things glutenfree or whatever the current allergy trend happens to be
  what kind of question is that i eat at lots of different places some where a plate is a meal others where many plates make up a meal some are expensive but most arent because im not a rich man even so i expect the kitchen to actually be preparing and cooking the food i eat not just heating it up fortunately i live in a place with a lot of options so i dont have to settle very often even if im not feeling spendy
  being so insecure that you wont allow substitutions   not being good enough at what you do that people would be willing to eat whatever you give because they know it will be good even if they dont usually like it  topping it all off with some cracker barrel flyover tier pun    y i k e s
  anon has a mental breakdown and goes into a series of mental gymnastics to justify substituting the alfredo sauce in his fettucine for pure mayonnaise   yikes
  its called free range chicken egg aioli with a parmesan reduction in a locally sourced olive oil pomade anon
  good way to lose business
  probably the good omelette guy doesnt work that day and it is too busy for the other pleb to make omelettes frankly i love making omelettes and wish that is all people would order
  this fuck people who eat ranch
  my local pizza place only charges for ranch when it comes for sauces they have a sign that basically says its because ranch is disgusting
  why take someone on a restricted diet to a restaurant  when youre a little older youll realize having medical problems of some sort affecting what you can eat is pretty common and if everyone with a dietary restriction stopped using restaurants it would kill the industry faster than amazon is killing retail stores    doesnt have to be about taste onions and tomato can fuck you up if you have intestinal problems theyre high residue and both have caused documented cases of intestinal blockage phytobezoar
  protip if eating a few slices of veggie is enough to cause you physical harm you shouldnt be alive
  its honestly true some people cant tolerate certain vegetables or spices because of old age diseases or ailments sorry anon youll statistically get to experience one of these problems someday first hand
  if everyone with a dietary restriction stopped using restaurants it would kill the industry faster than amazon is killing retail stores    no it might cull some of the weaker places and the prices would go up since there is less competition but the good restaurants would survive and the shit ones would shut down restaurant industry will never die as it is something people will always be willing to pay for
  when youre a little older youll realize  im 50 i know what stupid old people diets get like and i know how stupid it is to expect restaurants to accommodate them
  im 50  fuck off boomer
  go back to 4chan you edgy twat of a kid
  if weve got it well cook it
  born in 1968  boomer  retard
    why the fuck is grandpa eating out if he has such strict dietary restrictions
  i know how to get to burger king but do you know how to get to the welfare office because thats where youre headed if you dont accommodate simple requests your customers make
  implying mcdonalds cleans their friers
  if i saw my name on that board i would take a photo and post back on their social media that i left 40 on my table
  pay my bill  need to give you more money than the agreed upon amount just becuase
  and thats how you lose customers  why would they want your type as customers  next thing they know you and everyone in your party comes in with other guests that think its ok to act like your the chef this aint burger king
  trying to big time someone because you go out to eat sometimes  these are the pathetic fags who get off on making a bunch of special requests instead of simply ordering something that fits their dietary restriction
  it says that they dont have confidence in their cooks ability to not fuck up when they go off script
  off script  what kind of pretentious bullshit is this
  ah let me translate to npc they no know how to cook good without instructions
  not a chef so my experience is a bit tangent but at my butcher shop i actively encourage annoying customers who want complicated time consuming shit done to their cheap cuts to go down the street im more than happy for them to waste my competitors precious time instead of mine
  there was this spot that i worked and they would let the customers order old features that we did  it pissed me off so much because i dont have the stuff at the ready in my station so now i have to have 3 pans going just for one dish one pan for the bacondidnt need to prep this today or so i thought another for for the cheese sauce and another for the blackened chicken oh yeah i have a few other dishes im making too  bacon got a little burned maybe next time they will order from the menu or todays feature menu next time  fucking retarded restaurant to afraid to tell the guest no it was run by females two of which tried to get with me at two previous restaurants of course they canned me first chance they got
  to go down the street im more than happy for them to waste my competitors precious time  id pay to see their reactions kudos to you butch
  they paid for their drink but they didnt pay me for opening the bottle  i had to mix two things together
  fotm meme from last month to cover your dumb bullshit  classic
  my dumb bullshit youre the one getting bootyblasted because knowing how scripts work is to highbrow for you
  i get it man its a really good gif but if you keep posting it in situations where it doesnt apply itll lose all impact
can you get a happy ending at a maid cafe
3dpd
no they arent sexual theyre cute and kind of weird i wouldnt recommend it unless youre an otaku salaryman
  you cant but good news is you can get a happy ending for the same price as those over priced cafes just you wont get the coffee
  no but you can do this with your bros    
  its finally happened  ive finally seen the most pleb thing ever posted on 4chan
  what was it
  which maid is cutest tho i feel like the one on the left is more physically attractive and the one on the right has a more outgoing attitude
  can you get a happy ending at a maid cafe  no  but those 4 creatures would gargarise with your semen if asked to
  can you get a happy ending at a maid cafe    op you need to realise that to get a happy ending is to shoot yourself not going to some le maid cafe

i want to get a rice cooker and im leaning toward buying a zojirushi but im a little intimidated by all the different models is it worth getting the 350 model with pressure cooking and induction heating or is the 150 model good enough ill be using it several times / week
  the pressure cook models do produce better tasting rice whether or not thats worth the big price premium is up to you    induction heating doesnt make a significant difference in quality it is slightly more energy efficient but i doubt it saves enough money to pay for itself
  if i got the pressure cooker model could i use it like any other pressure cooker or should i stick to just preparing rice with it
  the main selling point for induction was originally the fine control required to make gaba rice eventually they realized nobody actually cares about gaba so it became a matter of well its more expensive so it must be better    that still didnt work so the prices have been coming down you can get some induction models for almost as cheap as the older models    if youre a real azn youll spend a little extra on one of the most important appliances in your kitchen whteoids should just use a pot
  they do not function the same asa normal pressure cooker you can cook other foods in it than rice but its not a replacement for a normal pressure cooker it does not reach as high a pressure and it has totally different controls
  you can cook cheesecake in the induction but not the pressure ones
  the rice will be super chewy even using shitty rice my parents have them
  nigga cooking rice is easy
  today anon learns what convenience is
  its much more convenient i put water and oatmeal in mine every night and set the timer so it is ready when i wake up then i load it with water and rice for when i get home from work
  la    zy
excellent thread as an expert on nippon japanese culture and a follower of shintoism i have developed an excellent uruchimai rice cooking method first let me say this gohan means cooked rice as a westerner i am embarrassed when i hear a fellow gaijin foreign person refer to any rice as gohan     to buy the best suihanki rice cooker look no further than the zojurushi brand all real nihonjin use them its best to use since most put their gohan into a chawan rice bowl but if you are truly a real fan of japanese culture you will enjoy eating from a bento too
  which slave state
how do rice cookers handle steel cut oats i eat it every day and if theyre well suited then i might pick one up
  fine a little overkill though
  kek
  sure thing jason schlansky
  how do the pressure cook models compare to just cooking rice in an instant pot
  i have no idea ive never tried it    im sure the instant pot can reach the correct pressure/temperature the question is how much the controls matter the instant pot just gets to temp and holds it there the rice cookers logic is optimized to cook rice its heating process is not just as fast as possible how much of a difference that makes i dont know ive never compared the two
rice cookers are only necessary if you plan on making fuckloads of rice on a regular basis otherwise just learn to make it on the stovetop
  stoves are only necessary if you plan on cooking a fuck ton of food on a regular basis otherwise just learn to order pizza
  can cook rice on a stove  cant order rice from pizza place
just get a cheap 10 one from a garage sale
  you can also just fling yourself on the floor so hard you hit your head and then screech and flail your face beet red until mommy comes running with the tendies plate
  tendies  posts wings    you must have some experience with hitting your head
  theres no practical difference between wings and tendies tendies are for energy drink addicted zoomers and wings are for ipaaddicted neckbeards
  but i had a cheap one when i was in school and it was a piece of shit
  still does not discount the fact that you incorrectly labeled the dish in question
  still cooked your rice didnt it
  usually but then id throw out the 1/3rd that was burned and stuck to the bowl
  and is not dealing with a bit of burned rice worth 350
  the label was and remains correct you just cant admit that you literally the same as a screeching autistic demanding tendies from mommy
  i have demanded neither wings nor tendies from mommy frankly i have no idea what you are talking about other than the fact you cannot differentiate wings and tendies
  i cannot differentiate a bachlor from an unmarried man nor a ephebophile from a pedophile with a thesaurus    same deal
  moooommm someone called my tendies post out
  what does that have to do with wings and tendies  there is no practical diffrence  that doesnt mean they are the same or even remotely similar tendies are made from the chicken tenders or ground up breast meat if they are shitor ground up male chicks if they are really shit))) and are always boneless breaded and often served with a dipping sauce accompaniment    wings are made using the wings which are a dark meat and also include the skin of the chicken most often they still have the bones but deboned versions do exist they may be breaded or unbreaded sauced or unsauced and may or may not be served with an accompanying dip    tendies just as similar to fried chicken as they are to wings
  actually the other guy was the one making the tendies post but nice try
  telltale signs of autism  screeching  love of tendies  inability to understand analogies
  i wasnt the one who brought up tendies in the first place so i guess i am exempt
  you know you can just cook rice in a pot
  thats what im trying to figure out i think so      wow thanks i didnt know that
i got an instant pot on black friday and i wont shut up about it call it a meme or whatever but its the best brown rice i ever had its actually creamy i can only imagine what itll do to white rice
  can you cook good rice dishes in it like biriyani or pilaf i assume it is versatile enough for those
  i make takikomi gohan in mine so maybe
  yes there are many recipes for both in the app i found some for risotto too
  i found some for risotto too    i have my doubts about that because proper risotto requires a lot of attention and completely negates the purpose of an instant pot unless it is risotto which is kind of like it but not really but we will just call it risotto anyways
you can get a chinese rice cooker with pressure cooking function for like 40 dollars
  im using a 150 model that i got way back in 2006 it has never let me down ever it is among my best purchases im a fan of induction heating but i cant imagine it mattering much at all for making rice
  correction i got it for 115 at the time    fuck china
    mine wasnt very convenient i was given one as a gift and no less than two asian exgirlfriends told me oooh thats a good rice cooker even with that said the thing took for goddamn ever to cook rice close to an hour compared to less than half an hour of combined time of washing the rice and 17 minutes of simmering the rice covered cleaning the rice cooker bowl was a pain in the ass too since theyre typically huge compared to a 36 cup sauce pot
  i will never buy chinese products      i read that some zoji models are manufactured in china i was originally thinking of buying this model but i suspect its made in china because the made in japan is suspiciously absent in the photo
  is this greentextready
  you can use it to cook food quickly but you cant use it to preserve food thats assuming you know your ass from a hole in the ground
  the chinese have a saying it goes something like you get what you pay for if you pay six cents for a chinese knockoff of a name brand expect six cents worth of performance
  i can fuck up rice in only 17 minutes
i got the induction one like the one in your pic 3 cups for 250  its a good rice cooker and i would definitely recommend it its brown rice function is meh and breaks the grains and just leaves it tasteless i stopped eating brown rice it does play the twinkle twinkle little star song which gets annoying as shit quickly my aunt got the cuckoo korean pressure rice cooker but was 400 around the time i got mine it made amazing brown rice which always left the grains intact that i got to eat all summer when i was with her as a downside it does say random shit in korean
  what in the fuck is this gay ass shit
  whteoids think rice was invented by naruto
  huh
    as long as the rice cooker has neuro fuzzy or fuzzy logic youre set the fuzzy logic makes it so your rice comes out perfect every time and gives you a lot more leeway in messing up your ricewater ratio    i would personally recommend the zojirushi nszcc10 has a nice extended warm function for keeping rice up to 48 hours    induction is nice for gaba brown rice but no one actually eats that so it doesnt really matter
  its not rocket science you fucking weeb its more than possible to make perfectly fluffy rice in about half the time a rice cooker takes
  browses /ck/  cant cook rice without a dedicated appliance
  hi tenda  shouldnt you be on /r/braincels
  needs 150350 appliance to make poor people food
  i have the cheaper model and have used it every day for about 3 years no complaints the rice turns out perfect every time and it can still make steamed cakes/breads even though it has no bread setting
        imagine spending 350 because you cant put some rice on the stove for ten minutes while youre getting ready for the day
  imagine not valuing your time enough to make the small things easier
  while youre getting ready for the day  how much effort does it take to flip the stove to high and at some point after its boiling turn it off rice cookers are the single most unnecessary appliance i can think of their existence is entirely pointless and invalidated by a fucking pot
if you eat rice often honestly just get one zojirushi neuro fuzzy model you will get perfect rice every time and the cooker itself will last ages
  mine makes really nice fluffy brown rice
kimchi is done
first post
  can you mail me a jar
  looks choice  how many days
  enjoy your stomach cancer
  i dont like those teeth in the left jar
do you really have to have the jar in a ziploc so it doesnt stink up the fridge
  i do i put a piece of plastic between the lid and rim the radish variety can destroy your fridge no problem
  ive wanted to try making kimchi whats your recipe
  what is in there
  oh fuck i just saw that thats concerning
  looks delicious please post recipe
  epic thread my fellow reddt brother it would go great on a burger with an egg and some sriracha noms
ive never noticed it but maybe i just like the small of kimchi but in korea they sell fridges with separate compartments just for kimchi
  those trips  those dubs  checked
  yes haha
  yes in korea every home has a fridge just for kimchi i shit you not
  drink it its good
  enjoy your stomach cancer
its going to explode
  yup weve got this cube fridge thats specifically made to store kimchi
   i dated a korean guy for on and off for a year and we went to a lot of asian restaurants but whenever we went to korean places he almost never touched the kimchi i think saw him eat the stuff twice he was such a damn weirdo
  restaurant kimchi is often trash at least here in korea
  based plebbit poster
  do you suction the air out before canning it
kimchi causes stomach cancer that stuff is poison when you eat it daily
  ten people got those trips and dubs fool
  all the stomach cancer stuff is because koreans consume kimchi by the tons and its not the kimchi itself that poses a higher risk of stomach cancer its the sodium intake that comes with it if you eat it in small or moderate portions it actually has anticarcinogenic properties which is good for you
    thats not how it works you stupid fucking cunt
  factory made kimchies are canned uncooked baked beans tier gross turd imagine a pickle made in chinese factory replace vinegar with acid and toilet water thats what you got for kimchi outside the home
  id guess its the spicyness of everything irrating stomachs and causing cancer
  kimchi is disgusting trash and is fucking overrated
  man that looks fucking nasty like some science jars at school
cheaper  better quality   doesnt charge as much for memeshit   no boogie sophist pretense    explain this
  their staff are literally underclass zoomers
   boogie sophist pretense  thats why id guess
    yet somehow the coffee remains drinkable its almost as if you dont need a phd to make coffee    hurrrrrr i only drink patrick ococks cold brew dickwater made by professor plum in between lecturing at harvard because he isnt a fool and it makes the coffee better    you stupid fucking faggot cunt stop drinking coffee and go back to pokemon go you absolute piece of shit
  bizarre post it goes down so many paths
does anyone actually drink at dunkin donuts in america in australia the only people that even go to dunkin donuts are old people with vouchers on the back of supermarket coupons for something to do while they wait to die
  based schizo
  t dunkin donut zoomer
    t starbucks purple hair male feminist shill
their overall quality has been in freefall since the 90s you might as well go to mcdonalds to get a coffee for 1
  the hero /ck/ needs but doesnt deserve
  because mcdonalds coffee is cheap too and actually good
not to sound like a shill or anything but more often than not ill usually take mcdicks coffee over dunkin dont get me wrong i like em both equally but i just think anysize coffee for just a buck is way more enjoyable than paying a dollar or two more for dunkins       a lot of us new englanders do
  the coffee is too thin
fl fagg checking in 352 the npcs here will drink coffee no matter where it comes from as theyre all uni students and intellectual libs    starbucks is obviously more expensive and more professional too here  and probably all across the world  its ran by pinkhaired girls w/ at least three genders and faggots who care about their barista jobs dd the coffee analog of mcds though here is ran by incompetent niggers and highschool dropouts lines to both stores are 16mi long day and night though ill drink either but yea dd is more bang for your buck if you can stand the unprofessionalism of the place
  its to new englanders like tim hortons is to canucks
people should learn to just make their own coffee
  dd is a ne brand and everyone hates ne almost as much as flyover land and much more than the west coast/pne dd is also terrible and nobody in ne likes them
  this starbucks coffee actually has a body to it even though it tastes like black and milds dunkin is coffee flavored water also tastes unusually saccharine
    yes its extremely popular and based
  id never go there if i had a choice in china starbucks is a good latte and theyre the only ones that do soy lattes  also theyre the only place to reliably offer power and wifi which i basically live on since i often work in starbucks and my laptop doesnt go eight hours in work mode
    starbucks generally has a better atmosphere for people who just want something to grab and go dunkin donuts is ok mcdonalds is better if youre just getting coffee though but for people who want to stick around to drink their coffee and maybe linger to do work on their computers or hang out with friends starbucks is best    also if you just get regular coffee starbucks doesnt cost that much more than dunkin its the sugarandcream bombs that cost a lot
      t
  i d dont have a dunkin in my town instead i have about a dozen local donut places that do coffee which is pretty great since they all run specials to compete with each other
  it has on the east coast
i like dd more than starbucks but all the dds around here are staffed almost entirely by dirty pajeets at least starbucks employees are intelligible
  why do people dislike new england is it because were whiter and richer than them
  i dont know that hating on new england is a thing i just dont like it because its terrible compared to the west coast/pnw its obviously still better than flyover land and the south
  a lot of people feel like starbucks makes them sophisticated dd doesnt really do that
  nearly all the dds on the east coast are run by pajeets just like subway if i see it is staffed by poo in the loos i walk right out
  based
  worse at signalling your wealth  doesnt matter  worse at signalling your wealth  worse at signalling your wealth    poor people dont go to coffee shops unless thats their thing they make coffee on the office drip filter machine and rich people dont go to coffee shops to buy coffee they go to coffee shops to buy coffee that shows off their wealth otherwise theyd use the same filter machine in the break room as their secretary
  the one i worked at was run by brazilians
  he signals his wealth    found gen x boomer cuck
  my soy lattes at starbucks for a medium size are 470 the same size for an almond milk latte at dunkin was 267     although the soy latte at starbucks was far better actually was a full bodied beverage i think dd is better fit for iced which costs extra
  people drink coffee to show off
  imagine the smell
  their coffee is worse than starbucks simple as their donuts are wretched too
  i asked myself the same question op  its much cheaper than starbucks by comparison and they have a wider variety of pastries    i guess the name brand simply has more meme value than dunkins
  why havent you learned how to make your coffee at home for the price of a meal at both places you could get a pound of some bitchin high quality coffee beans both of these companies are shit so why bother
  you in boston
  i live in new england dunks outnumbers starcucks like 51 in most cities
why are americans so fuckign retarded when it comes to coffee
  why hasnt lg overtaken apple its a status symbol to have the latter and people desire to appear wealthy as opposed to actually being wealthy its just like the emblem on cars purses and shoes
  starbucks taste like cigarette ash
  they are retarded in everything they excuse everything with muh practicality to die of a stroke after their 30 th year
  there are a lot of poor people in new england
  lived in maine for a year and there was a dunkin donuts every block
  no just a tiny town full of heroin addicts on the border of new hampshire
think wawa has the best coffee out of all the chains i tried
dunkin will forever be a donut shop if you get coffee from there people will assume you also got a bunch of donuts and hogged them down like a fatty    people get starbucks coffee not because it is better in any way but because its cool to do so
  dunkin will forever be a donut shop  lately theyve been trying to distance themselves from donuts to the point of removing it from their name
  dunkin will forever be a donut shop if you get coffee from there people will assume you also got a bunch of donuts and hogged them down like a fatty    the fuck you from kansas almost nobody actually buys donuts from dunkin donuts anymore
  people with iphones are rich
  nah its because the area acts like the crowded and trashy place they lived or were born in makes them special people only move there either because of an overglorification in some hallmark movie or are forced there by some boomer company that they work at people who have moved to my area from there are also largely unpleasant and thoughtless as well
  but dunkins taste like sour piss water id rather have over roasted than that plus dunkins is so watered down i cant even get my fix im comparing black for black btw so this is the objective truth for the coffee i have no info on who has the better additives its quite possible that dunkins type of coffee goes better in the breakfast milk shakes so popular these days plus can you even order traditional espresso drinks like a straight macchiato at dunkins
i tried it once and it was almost unbearably acidic maybe someone actually pissed in my coffee wont be drinking that shit again
  boogie  plz
dd coffee is fucking garbage the only thing that makes it tolerable is the fact that youre mostly drinking cream and sugar try drinking that shit black and youll be thoroughly disgusted
  their coffee tastes like shit and their donuts are garbage
  oh
  better than millenials with a liberal arts degree at starbucks at least dunkin donuts never had an official policy to try to start up conversations about race with their customers
  learn to read you dumb fucking asshole
  probably because youre whiter and richer and then proceed to vote for awful racial and economic policies for everyone else rich white leftists who vote to let in brown hordes because they dont have to feel the effects of it yet are the worst and will be first against the wall
  conspicuous consumption is a wellstudied and understood concept in economics you know that right you insufferable midwit
  no boogie sophist pretense  thats poor people for   its for poor people
  holy shit
  dunkin only has likewhat 1016 types of donuts now thats nothing compared to the hundreds they sold back in the day and those only make up a small margin of their sales over the years theyve shifted more towards advertising their coffee and sandwiches which make up the bulk of their sales in general also explains why theyre now dropping donuts from their name
  no it just means youre not upper middle class faggotry
  your tastebuds are shot starbucks black coffee is objectively fucking terrible and the worst out there dd tastes like a jolly rancher
  is that a store why are they selling pop
  nothing is as shitty as the west coast thanks to the people who live there the region is trying to cleanse itself of you retards with fire
at least dd isnt this cucked
  they are either located in michigan ohio or wisconsin judging by their mutant apperance id say probably michigan why because i used to live there and for whatever reason the public looks like they were concived in toxic waste dumps check out any mi nudes thread and youll see what i mean
  people drink coffee to show off
  the region is trying to cleanse itself of retards with fire  makes sense seeing as how pretty much everyone hit by the camp fire were trump tards
  our thoughts and prayers are with them
dunkins is the same level of quality roast and taste wise as starbucks the only reason you dont notice is because starbucks drinks are loaded with sugar both beans are over roasted and tasteless so just pay two dollars and get dunkins
  watered down coffee

just broke both wrists in splints    recipes
why dont you eat a big sl0p of shit
  i have a recipe for you    step 1 fill a bathtub with tomato sauce  step 2 roll around in the bathtub and yell i am a swedish meatball  step 3   step 4 profit
seiously you dont realize how limited you are when youre down to a couple fingers
something with plenty of protein and calcium to heal quickly
  that movie was sad
cooking alone has some great recipes you could use  too bad you damn dirty trolls shut er down  enjoy your broken wrists bastard
  youre moms sad lmao
  oof
  how do you break both you dont know how to fall you can probably handle throwing a tortilla in the microwave and putting some cheese on it maybe the calcium will help your pussy ass bones    get well soon anon

  swedish meatballs arent served with tomato sauce
i am so fucking sick of cooking these stupid fucking things for people the pub im apprenticing at has a great head chef who uses fresh ingredients found locally and has filled the menu with great modern meals     instead 60 of our customer base only orders chicken parms
chicken parm is delicious fuck you
what else is on the menu
  you cant blame people for ordering the old favourites theyre old favourites for a reason get your waiters servers or whoever writes the menus to push the other dishes
  go to pub  order something you can make the exact same quality of at at home in 20 minutes
  i fail to see the fucking problem chicken parm is delicious go fuck a goat asshole
  fuck off it is objectively trash way too much savory flavor with little to no contrast     better off eating pizza for fucks sake
  trust me we do we had some amazing dishes on the specials menu the other night chicken parms still outsold them
  its a simple albeit fiddly dish to make but it takes longer than 20 minutes
  delicious to someone with the tastebuds of a child maybe
  institute some specials take some of the dishes with the highest profit margin and have a discount day for them for a while which if theyre good should instigate people wanting to try other dishes
  unfortunately that isnt a very cost effective strategy at all
chicken parm you taste so good
maybe you should have got a job in a proper restaurant and not a pub if you didnt want to sling 100 parmis a night
  then just tell customers that order a chicken parm to fuck off you unpleasable twat
  if its 60 the rest of the menu isnt as good as you claim keep in mind people can and do order out things they rarely indulge in at home whether because of effort or because of frying or fat content eating out is a treat not just for eating things healthy or fancy but badforyou shit that hits all your senses of crunchy/salty/sweet/sour/cheesy etc and no people arent three step breading chicken cutlets and frying them up broiling cheese on top and making a half portion of italian tomato sauce and also boiling noodles draining noodles and washing all those prep bowls pots and strainers every night so its not only 20 minutes they can do better at home      trust me we do we had some amazing dishes on the specials menu the other night chicken parms still outsold them  describe the specials

so what was the deal with airline food anyway
  airlines pre early 90s were expensive shit due to gas issues and suppliers not meeting demads that said you would pay maybe 800usddunno like 1100 today to go from nylax and get some shit frozen food that was on par with something that looks like a grocery storm kids meal
  thanks buddy
  sucked ass like if banquet was never good and just got worse but you also had to split it with 5 other people
  that said you would pay maybe 800usddunno like 1100 today to go from nylax   you have literally never flown a day in your life
  imagine being this fucking stupid
from what i understand the atmospheric conditions on board a pressurized aircraft tend to deaden a persons sense of smell and taste which makes food generally taste worse combine that with airlines cheaping out on food its not a great experience
  pre 90s  nigga middle east wars were going on causing some big fuel issues constant fucking strikes on airline pilots planes were way slower and smaller than they are today and tons of other shit the amount of ease computers have brought to shit and investment in local oil has made a shit load of flights a drop in the bucket compared to early 80smid 90s which is the era the joke comes from
  the same thing happens to astronauts on the iss they prefer spicier foods and condiments than they would on earth due to loss of sensation as for what is best to eat in zerog thats a whole different kettle of fish
  you have literally never flown a day in your life  what is adjusting for inflation
  t zoomer clueless about the 1980s
  at least you can drink soda and booze on the plane cant do either in space
  literally one of the first links on google explaining about how prices have fallen rapidly over 30 years
  
  you lose your sense of taste being so high up in the sky

does anybody else have aerosinusitis its when you feel this intense pain in your facial sinuses due to air pressure differences upon descent god damn it hurts like a bitch and idk what to do about it
  its food that you eat while seated inside a thin metal tube with thin metal wings hurtling through the air at hundreds of kilometers per hour
  i like airline food but im not a picky eater i will eat anything its not that bad
  no but i get a weird burning / prickly sensation on my skin throughout the entire flight it feels like my blood is heating up under the skin idk i tried searching for why this might happen after the last time i took a flight but couldnt find anything it doesnt hurt really bad or anythig its just annoying and strange i wonder if its the pressure in the cabin or something nobody else i was with felt the same when i was back on the ground i felt completely normal again
  stop getting mad at shit so often
  i had this for a long time my solution is to blow my nose really hard and the pressure gets better
airplane ride always feel claustrophobic loud and unsteady    ive flown dozens of times but i cant get over my fear of flying my heart is pounding throughout the entire flight
what is up with that you dont know do ya have you ever been on an airplane
  equalize your ear pressure by holding your nose and closing your mouth and gently building up exhalation pressure until your feel your ears pop this applies most when your descending when ascending the best you can do is yawn widely

  tenga egg best male masterbator ever
  better than a hand
  way better than a hand bro first time i used one i came near instantaneously
  ive been thinking about buying something to jerk off into whats your opinion
  anything tenga is worth the money
  really i looked at a fleshlight but it just looked unappealing ill check out tenga
  my favorite thing ive used is the tenga 3d sleeve which is designed to be reversible so its super easy to clean just get an egg first though theyre a few dollars and you can see if you care enough to buy shit like that i dont really recommend the cups never tried another brand just because of price gaps
  i prefer the bd sugar star over the tenga products not as easy to hide or clean but its worth the money
  i was looking at the tenga flex the inside looks dope and taking it apart seems easy 40 for one doesnt seem bad but in think ill take your advice and just get an egg to see what its like im sick of my hand
  im gonna get one too should i get one or 2
  they have a 6 pack thats what im going for worse case scenario i give them to my friends as christmas gifts
  bad dragon products  gross
  last time i got a tenga egg off amazon i got sent a chinkshit knockoff looked oddly cheap and when i opened it it smelled awful threw it right out and got sent a replacement be wary
  lmao did you buy a regular egg
  how does your dick fit in the egg
  as long as you fill it up first
i dont get onaholes  they dont really feel that much better and maybe its just me but jerking off with one takes like 200 more energy and im always exhausted afterwards
  rubber  silicon      you use it with a hand it makes it way better like a bj compared to a handie      the head fits in an egg you wiggle it around its very flexible so you can kinda fuck it the onahole/sleeve things are as long as a dick to be fucked
  silicon    if youre going to correct someone youd think youd at least be able to do it correctly    i think you mean silicone not silicon the former is rubberlike the latter which you wrote is used to make computer chips

  neurotoxins from 100 year old food
  i will choose to believe this
  he has ptsd  hes seen things that a soyboy like you wouldnt understand hes been down digging trenches in the dirt and the mud surrounded by gibbering foreigners waving sticks and pitchforks hes ridden in convoys taking him godknowswhere to whatever hellish job is next hes smelled the melting asphalt as he toils in the sun making your world a better safer place    the life of a landscaper is a tough one
  its another batch of rations without old cigarettes   he hasnt smoked on camera in like a year consarn it
  this is asked in every single thread fucking faggot
  good cigarettes are bad for him and classic longhair steve is better than new shorthair steve
  when is his popularity going to make him insufferable like every other youtuber  i dont want it to happen laddies
  hasnt happened to reviewbrah  doubt it will happen to steve
  john did change though he used to be doing it for his own enjoyment but now he keeps ragging on about donations this and merch that 
has anyone seen reviewbrahs patreon  10000 pledge per month gets you a custom voicemail from him and you can get advertised on his radio show    steve does advertising for ration sellers strictly for the ration itself and does not accept money clearly says on his about page he does not do paid sponsorships    and steve sells shirts on teespring but only makes like 90 cents per shirt or something only two designs and kinda not that great of ones i will admit but only 1518 per shirt  noone else on youtube that sells merch does that  and he hardly advertises it     i dont think he is ever going to change he truly loves what he does and it shows    as for his hair i like it more short he seems happier with it his hands shook more when he had long hair dude was stressed out i read once someone saying he needs to quit drinking and he replied he doesnt drink which i believe so the shaking is likely from working out or potentially stress or a potassium deficiency just my theories
  could just be a normal background tremor i have that too when my blood sugar is low
  that is also a much more viable hypothesis than say neurotoxins from old food or some sort of chemical dependence the ladder is especially frustrating because he clearly looks healthier and dare i say even more youthful than a year or two ago
  he clearly takes care of himself seems very sporty and healthy from what i can see i doubt the tremor is anything malicious
  brain tumor
  nerve gas
i think he shakes because he takes all them gopills from his survival kits probably snorts a few before a video nice

  cake donuts fucking suck whats your problem they dont even taste anything like cake they are dry bready and disgusting

how else are the supposed to make doughnut holes stupid
what in your opinion is the best soup to have with a grilled cheese
onion
  tomato is the only option ive ever heard but tomato soup is fucking boring so my answer is spaghetti os
tomato potato leek if its on a dark bread with white cheeses like emmental on pumpernickel or honey oat
  tomato or french onion other condensed soups are to chunky or to creamy
  chicken noodle aint bad with it i think a nice minestrone would be really good with it
  tomato  ive also had it with cream of asparagus
split pea
  red lentil fight me youll lose
i never had any soup with my grilled cheese or cheese melts for that matter
  nothing beats tomato soup and grilled cheese  crack  sips

  kek remember when 4loko came out back in the day two of those and i was absolutely lit
  or you could just do it like a normal person and keep a water bottle full of vodka with you at all times
  i started drinking eighteen years ago pretty sure i lived overseas when those came out and not even sure if they were distributed in my area of canada to begin with
  im 33 and american and was too old for 4loko whenever they were a thing they just completely went under my radar and i only heard about them when they were in the news because kids were doing crazy shit or whatever and they stopped selling it with the caffeine
  but alcohol and caffeine is a classic combination  thirty three as well kids ruin everything
  based and fuckin redpilled
  he thinks any al/ck/ would be caught dead at a sporting event
  you are pathetic
  based bootwearer
  where do you buy it though
    i had 4loko back before they changed it never figured out the appeal taking a swig out of a regular energy drink and topping it off was significantly better than trying to stomach a 4loko
  shakes ur water bottle  nothing personal kid
  aare you under the impression that vodka is carbonated
  when you shake any strong alcohol the bubbles it creates disappear really fast and a a lot smaller than the bubbles water creates source i used to work on a cruiseliner
  that might work with normies but youll never find the water balloon filled with vodka i shoved up my arse
the best are those japanese cocktail drinks in cans that are like 712 and taste great but look like soft drinks
  ill find it when i beat your faggot ass up in more ways than one causing it to break killing you from alcohol poisoning
  not triple wrapping the balloon with an emergency vent hanging below my anus normies never learn
  im still gonna fuck ur as he cute
  not inserting a pussy pocket after the balloon filled with vodka inside your arse to allow violent rapes to occur without bursting the precious alcohol get on my level normies
  im 34 and now really looking forwards to my cruise ship vacation if the custom inspections are as intense as you describe anon
  that doggo is sad that youre killing yourself with alcohol

  sriracha is over rated    franks and this are the best mainstream sauces
  yes yes sambal oelek well done well done    however
  i dont think thats a sauce is olive oil a sauce
  the extra hot with the black label is better
lao gan ma  a  o    g  a  n    m  a
  okay so sambal isnt a sauce either fuckwit
  if sambal oelek qualifies as a sauce which it does then so does lao gan ma why would you compare it to olive oil when it has so many different ingredients
  chunky sriracha
  sambal oelek qualifies as a sauce  its a paste
  scroll  where is the hot oil bros  see this post  based
  youre a fuckin paste faggot
  you retard sauces and pastes are not mutually exclusive      sambal is a hot sauce or paste      hot sauce also known as chili sauce or pepper sauce is any condiment seasoning or salsa made from chili peppers and other ingredients      from latin salsa meaning salted  the two examples are garum in the west and doubanjiang in the east  doubanjiang is a paste
  being this fucking educated   redpilled but also cringe
  sriracha  sambal is totally different from sriracha you pleb   sriracha is shitty spicy ketchup   sambal is garlic chili paste goodness
  you mean  being a doctoral candidate in philosophy while addicted to amphetamines  which is more cringe than redpilled

legit good  the jalapeno ketchup is pretty good too but the mayonnaise products are clearly the superior choice

  nongmo  cringe
  yeah its pretty cringey if you hate the nongmo project  still tastes good
  so how is chili crisp not a sauce by that logic
  doofus i am arguing for chili crisps inclusion in the sauce hierarchy see 
  fair enough i still think of them both more as ingredients or condiments than as sauces
  yes nigga

  you build up a tolerance to this stuff fairly quickly one little dash in my ramen used to be enough now i feel like i can put a heaping spoon full in there and its still not hot enough    whats the next level when it comes to hot pastes /ck/
  been a favorite of mine for years but the local beans love it too and its seldom on the shelves so i usually end up going with chipotle tobasco or tapatio cholula is good but it doesnt really have any heat
  absolutely love this thing  its spicy enough to fit the category but not spicy enough to burn your mouth like other hot sauces  i ate a pizza slice completely covered with a layer of valentina and barely felt the burn  i swear you can probably drink this shit straight out of the bottle

so i got e coli from romaine lettuce i couldnt resist a ceasar salad last monday and a few days later im dying this is the sickest ive ever been you guys ever get food poisoning i want to kill myself holy fuck
  those maple snow lollies are so fucking good
had food poisoning 3x in thailand all from reputable restaurants one was a fucking pizza man a woodfire pizza for some reason it came with a salad and some ham piled on top of it like a pyramid i ate the salad the salad was kil another time was chicken wings they had clearly microwaved because i went into a 24 hour pub at 5am and ordered wings and the last time was deep fried fish and chips was puking up fish for what seemed like forever    i feel you man  just  slowly get it out i hope for your sake its diahhrea and not puking i hate puking but can shit forever
  its actually not puking this time just shits but my stomach fucking kills i cant even sleep i feel like im in some waking nightmare
  where do you live last i heard it was california romaine but i guess its shipped all over we used this as an opportunity to take caesar off the menu permanently
  go to thailand  eat pizza chicken wings and fish and chips    you had it coming
  ontario i used to work at a grocery store and most of our shit came from their saturday some place refused to serve it to me and by monday i thought it was okay
i like to scratch my buttcrack and smell it i think i am immune to e coli
  but can shit forever  doesnt your anus get raw from wiping  shit hurts like hell after a while
lmao at you immunelets
    dickface i go there every 6 weeks and eat street food all the time the irony is the times i ate at western places i got food poisoning
    he doesnt use the shower head to wash you are right though the wiping would tear your pewper
  you deserved it you disgusting sex tourist
  wash your vegetables you stupid faggot
  was at a restaurant
  of course it is shipped all over you do realize that everything you eat isnt grown in your neighbors back yard most of the produce you probably purchase every day was grown thousands of miles away and shipped up in bulk for pennies
  rinsing a head of lettuce will get rid of all bacteria
  i know that but im in california so a lot of our produce is from here a lot isnt and last time when it came out that the bad lettuce was coming from arizona or wherever we were immediately able to start selling romaine again because it all came from california
        who is the idiot now ramsay grilled to kill bacteria
  pretty sure thats what he was saying though
    yes you arent allowed to eat any other food apart from that countrys food so you in america are not allowed chinese food mexican food or anything else you must solely eat hamburgers with romaine lettuce sometimes you want to try places or differ from the usual local shit of fucking lemongrass chili and fish sauce
  you can do anything you want just dont be surprised if the hamboigah joint catering to drunk retards on khao san road gives you food poisoning because they arent going to have repeat customers either way so why should they worry about hygiene    you seem like the kind of person who would shoot himself in the dick to piss off the cultural marxists
  sure you can go eat shitty american food in thailand if you want to you still had it coming for doing so
  the first time i got food poisoning was years ago as a kid my parents brought me to a 70s style restaurant before we went to watch a movie i took a hot dog there ate it and barely a hour after when the movie just began i puked blood all over    i spent the rest of the night at the hospital and the next week at home
    not even close kid your basic bitch assumptions about westerners in thailand is laughable though i have spent 20 years in asia living and working im sure people like you go to khao san road but i dont as i said before these were all highly reputable places op asked if anyone had got food poisoning and i have from reputable places imagine if i hadnt said thailand what would you do then somehow the restaurant being in thailand means its shit there are infinite great restaurants over there of all sorts     thats a great leap with the cultural marxist reply you can spot the angry 24yo kid a mile away by the references he uses stay relevant son
  im sure the constant shitting would tear your anus before it gets raw from wiping but both are equally painful
  as i said before these were all highly reputable places  chicken wings they had clearly microwaved    just stop
  whats a 70s style restaurant ive contemplated going to the hospital so many times the past few days but the hospital is such a drag i just want something for the stomach pain you guys think its okay to drink alcohol i got my gf to bring home a reefer last night and while it didnt do anything for the pain it made it more bareable
  my whole family all got food poisoning from a red robin and we had to share a single hotel bathroom we also all got food poisoning from a chinese place this is despite all of us ordering very different things on both occasions
  yeah it isnt really like everyone thinks i had salmonella from some frozen sashimi grade raw tuna and yeah there was some initial diarrhea and vomiting but that was the least of it i was extremely debilitated for 5 days every inch of my body ached even to the bones it was agony to move and i burned with a raging fever for several days there was no sleep just fevered images and endless meaningless run on sentences murmuring in my brain truly hell thought i really was dying even after 2 weeks was still only  90  inb4 you were just a weak fuck to begin with  nope i was alternating cardio and weights every other day tip top physical condition
  try opiates get some oxys theyll kill the pain and plug your ass weed doesnt do shit when you actually need something
    this is what i meant highly reputable does not necessarily mean good the reason i went there was because they were highly reputable yet i described what they did serve and how i got food poisoning its not hard to follow you fucking retard    you got anything to input here regarding food poisoning or you just going to vape and try to pick holes in the stories while you finger your boipussy
  when i had food poisioning i was lucky enough to be in an apartment with a flat water bill and just stayed in the shower all day set up a laptop and shit away
  everyone who has ever been to asia is a white sexpat engrish teacher dancing monkey like me    you seem pretty defensive kill yourself dancing monkey    angry 24yo kid    im 44 i spent half my childhood in southeast asia and im just trying to help you understand how not to get sick good luck trying to teach your lbfm from the hinterlands how not to embarrass you in front of your expat friends
    everyone who has experience with asia has lived the same life as me    you absolute idiot you have to be american right only they could be this single minded
  i got food poisoning from this place it opened up down the street from me and i went and got a burrito bowl from them i know they say it can take at least a day for it to hit you but this took only a few hours all the meals i previously had the days before were shared with other people who did not get sick     i essentially had the worst stomach ache of my life all afternoon and through the night i was just lying down on my stomach talking to myself in my head trying to coach myself to not throw up i then took a pepto bismol pill and instantly threw up about 8 times until my stomach was completely empty i spent the rest of the night and next morning waking up every 1530 minutes to pee out of my ass my asshole was completely raw at that point
  you sure do like to act high and mighty despite being the one who got food poisoning three times for eating garbage food
    three times out of 1000000 yes hence responding to the food poisoning thread is this what trolling is these days just trying to pick holes in shit because you have nothing else to say
  holy shit dude this is exactly what im going through its like fever dreams from when yoy were sick as fuck asa kid its next level
  t
  lol thats funny and gross im just so fucking uncomfortable no matter what way i sit or lie down i feel fucked
  couldnt resist a salad   a fucking salad   you deserve death
  well you dont need to put much effort into your tolling when people get mad as easily as you do
    tolling
  i had the worst case of food poisoning about a few months ago i puked once and for almost a week i had endless shits to the point where im just shitting brownish water my ass was leaky even when i was fast asleep i honestly felt like i was going to die as i had zero appetite and was constantly dizzy when not sleeping
  its funny because i literally said to my gf i dont give a fuck if i get sick i need a ceasar salad i love ceasar salad i regret it so much now oh my god
  got em
  but those bottomless fries were worth it tho

  my wife believes the opposite whatever country you come from you must eat that food exclusively
  sounds about how i feel when i take laxatives
    it works for indians when was the last time you saw an indian eat anything other than indian food used to be the same with chinese people but they have branched out to mcdonalds now
  its french dish  de la salade brais√©e au lard braised lettuce with lard it works with chicory too but you have to add suger eventually      only use crisp fresh leaves  the salad bathes into butter/lard and get really flavored you can add tomatoes onions    it completes very well a potaufeu too
  this white people are fucking ridiculous
    muh sickle cell
  sickle cell  asia

  which slave state are you from
  ohhhh yeah thailand you can taste the umm spices
  i couldnt resist a  salad  nintendo_wojakjif
i fucking hate puking and i get anxiety thinking about it how do i deal with this bros
    put your finger in your ass and blow out through your nose with your mouth closed as hard as you can this relaxes the diaphragm and helps regulate your medula oblongata not even joking    t anxiety sufferer for 10 years until i learned how to do this  tip  carry a small tube of lipstick around with you in case you get caught on the hop with no other way to lube your finger
i also got e coli tried keto for the first time last month so i thought all the stomach pain was just adjusting to the new diet passed out from dehydration and spent a night in the hospital i also live in northern california where this all started     painful but nowhere near as bad as the food poisoning and kidney stones ive had in my life
diet is tofu meat eggs burgers frozen udon canned fruit and bananas  never eat fucking lettuce  immune to salad aids crisis  lmao  ur life   also holy shit there really is no lettuce in stores right now at all wtf is trump doing the vegans are going to starve to death
got food poisoning from a steak quesadilla shit in a coffee mug on the way home unreal
  grilled lettuce is tasty desu
  wtf is this shit such ameritrash drivel
  holy shit are you the same guy from that thread because someone made a thread about a week ago asking if romaine was safe yet lmao
tfw never eat lettuce
tfw i ate a whole head of iceberg over the past few days and fit as a cello    romainefags btfo
craving a fucking pleb salad of all things  w o w
  kek
  got food poisoning from the savoy grill fucking amazing food though tasted great both ways worth being knocked out for a day
    how do you make them
  its just syrup thats boiled beyond absolute fuck  t quebecnigger
  yeah i puked a lot  also nausea i didnt understand what people mean when they say the world was literally spinning  but then i felt it first hand had to hug the toilet for like 2 days while the world feels like its literally spinning around me
  there is a health advisory everywhere for romaine    you have to be a fucking retard fat fuck to eat it during this time
  this post makes me think that you blamed the restaurant because its what came to mind but it was most likely something else   i read a while ago that youre actually more likely to food poison yourself as home kitchens are usually less sanitary than a restaurant kitchen where hygiene is a priority  to go along with this the fact that you all got sick despite ordering different things seems more unlikely im willing to bet you got sick from a homecooked meal and didnt see symptoms until after eating at the restaurants    sorry to pick you out i think this post could apply to a lot of the posts in this thread
got food poisoning from a chicken pizza from papa johns   the next day i had the absolute worst stomach pain in my life and had to call off work   i thought that my appendix burst   i knew i had to take a shit so i sat on the toilet but it wasnt coming out  i pushed as hard as i could and my ass shot out all my shit in a nano second like a shotgun blast   i felt a little better but 2 minutes later i had to shit again  this time i was shitting blood and not just a little bit   i ended up going to the hospital and finding out my shit was so violent that i gave myself an internal hemorrhoid   the doctor said i should be fine but prescribed me some antibiotics just in case   i spent the next 23 weeks with this feeling on my rectum like someone was squeezing it in their fist it was really uncomfortable   it ended up healing completely but it was a terrible experience   so to this day i refuse to eat chicken pizza
  they invented a salad for americans
  boil the shit out of maple syrup  pour it on some cold snow  shove a stick in it and role it around the stick
  im very far from being a health freak but goddamn thats just simply too much fucking butter
i had some river crawfish from asia i guess it wasnt over the fire long enough but man i shit 9 times that day i even made the mistake fart dont try the unknown fart enjoyed the rest of the trip tho
  everything is going according to plan
  op what symptoms did you have i got sick a few days ago and have had tons of diarrhea and bleeding out my ass and its very concerning and want to know if its because of the recent outbreaks
  ok
  started with mad stomach cramps then came bloating then came pissing out my ass nausea farting constantly shit myself twice body ache loads of trouble sleeping you can hear my stomach bubble constantly only barfed once though
  i dont know if chronic tacos is/was a chain or not but i used to go there all the time on the way home from work never had any problems are you from vancouver
  baby wipes are your friend
  redpilled wife although i have difficulty finding dutch deep fried food or andive stew abroad so i never leave the country
  actually you have to rinse it then remove the stem
only once ate a bad razor clam kind of sucks because i love razor clams but ever since then ive been a little offput by them
    dutch deep fried food dont even front like you dont just eat cheese and stroopwaffles you fucking windmill watching faggot
  that sucks ive been there make sure to stay hydrated and get plenty of rest     what is the deal with romaine constantly being recalled for ecoli is this a bunch of hondurans shitting in the irrigation systems or something this did not used to be a problem in america outbreaks were rare theyre becoming so common now that i try to keep romaine regularly growing weather permitting
  he doesnt know about frituur  kek i pity your empty existence
    baby wipes are your friend  fuck it if youre constantly on the throne and its liquid why bother wiping
  drink lots of water or gatorade friend keep yourself hydrated
    being proud of disgusting factory produced muck deep fried shit as part of your cuisine    the dutch are worse than the americans no wonder the whole place is full of niggers
  i couldnt resist a ceasar salad last monday    who the fuck cant say no to a salad
  he doesnt know about haute friture  bitch i roll my own kroketten and bitterballen make my own fries etc you wouldnt know quality frituur if the molten ossenwit would hit your face youre nothing but a frying oil nobody shaking your measly fist at the gods of lard enjoy your own niggers frynoob
    listen up boetie ive been simmering soups and sauteeing my dick since before you cunts even discovered spice have you ever even had saffron no your shitty palate is limited to whatever bottom tier spices you could find from the east indies tell us more about your disgusting formed meat and reused cooking oils while i enjoy the finest of all cuisines sans the dutch and their attempt to remain relevant     i make my own fries  so does mcdonalds you absolute fuckwit except it doesnt take them all day and they dont taste like de reuters on toast
you faggots have the shittiest inmune systems i tell you
    thats because you grew up licking ass and are now immune to everything apart from being gay
  t gets salmonella from looking at a mexican
    t literally is sucking dick right now
  bottom tier spicea from the east indies  lmaoing at your life there friendo we fought off the whole world and genocided multiple peoples to get the best of the best people all over the world think rendang is the best dish in the world but you probably never even heard of it
    rendang  i added coconut to a dish and it makes it incredible    loling at your primitive cuisine there old bean coming from a guy from the netherlands anything you say is immediately disregarded by the superior british and even the french your discoveries were less than exemplary and your attempts at deep frying are laughed at the world over have you ever even had fish and chips do you even know what a curry is tell us more about your salted liquorice van lekker and then if you still have the strength left in you from your low calorie meals sail your shitty duyfken over to the isles and experience real food we are generous gods and will share
  fish and chips  ive had kibbeling with ravigotte which is infinitely superior vinegar is not meant as a condiment ffs i know what a curry is it is a cheap bland and  worst of all  british colonial ripoff of rendang and shame on you for choosing van lekker its the plebeians liquorice patricians go to the candy store to buy quality dubbelzoute drop also dutch dishes are notoriously high in calories
    i got crazy food poisoning over the holiday excruciating pain gor like 2 hours but was completely fine 6 hours after it all began
    vinegar is for plebs its all about the fry and the chicken salt on the chips but im not sure the dutch could handle actual flavor rendang is the lowest tier curry imaginable made for people who enjoy farting real curry has depth of flavor and doesnt make your teeth itch with its low quality beef made from skinny emaciated cows this is the gift the british gave the world they gathered cuisines and improved them the dutch are still lying around eating stroop and having to bicycle forever just to get edible liquorice and drink beer that isnt mass produced heineken     notoriously high in calories  do you even full english breakfast hans
  this is the gift the british gave the world  pishposh    even you brits know how god awful your cuisine is to quote one of your own    it has been asserted that english cookery is nationally speaking far from being the best in the world more than this we have been frequently told by brilliant foreign writers half philosphers half chefs that we are the worst cooks on the face of the earth and that the proverb which alludes to the divine origin of food and the precisely opposite origin of its preparers is peculiarly applicable to us islanders    mrs beetons p 49
    mrs beetons  mrs    theres your problem women have no idea about anything the fact they were cooking all those years was out of convenience for the men who did all the work women are tastelets which is why they have no idea what they want to eat because they have no concept of flavor much like mrs beetle there with her pompous assery of a monologue notice how many excellent british chefs there are    ramsay  oliver  harriot    show us some of your world renowned dutch chefs please maam she is clearly speaking from yesteryear when britain was at war with flavor also i am not british but its fun to larp
  but but but woman  mrs beetons is by far the most highly published and regarded of all british cookbooks    notice how many excellent british chefs there are  you mean the ones which were trained in france     us some of your world renowned dutch chefs please maam  i wasnt arguing that dutch was any better i was just laughing at how silly the notion was that the brits were well regarded in the culinary scene
  imagine eating raw vegetables  yeah its grown in dirt with shit for fertilizer but im sure that quick cold water rinse cleaned everything off absolutely squalid
    t joe rogan
  even a broken clock is right twice a day
kuthollanders met hun kutfrituur
eating the inferior uce  the same one thats constantly recalled for ecoli  you brought this upon yourself you dumb bastard
  grilling lettuce  this has to be bait
  you dont want that feeling of liquid shit running down your taint and on to your balls and dick
  hope it was h7o157 so you die
  yeh fuk wy pipo mufugin wy pipo ge da trumb in mufuggin oufec shieet
  he thinks hitting the gym means he has a good immune system  the state of /fit/izens
  as long as you stay hydrated theres no strain of coli on earth that can kill you take some ibuprofen and drink your water youll be fine if you cant drink water iv up only retards and elderly immuno compromised die from food poisoning
  chronic tacos  isnt it owned by one of the jackass dude  i think it was weeman
  all of that stuff is really fucking good but i once stayed in the netherlands for 2 weeks eating deep fried meals about once a day and by the end of it i was sick and tired of that  gained like 5kg too despite biking more than i ever would at home
  the pic in op pretty much tells you how you fucking retard
    what thefuck does cultural marxism have to do with anything are you that obsessed with stupidolitical shitflinging that it even comes up in food discussion
ive had pretty bad food poisoning i remember throwing up and spraying diahhrea at the same time not my lowest moment but definitely up there
  and we had to share a single hotel bathroom  whole fuck this is my worst nightmare one of the biggest reasons i ever fear taking a plane
  i pushed as hard as i could and my ass shot out all my shit in a nano second like a shotgun blast
  he doesnt contaminate parasites following stare downs with minorities
  weak immune system you probably have aids or some yet to be discovered infectious disease   healthy men in their prime are not susceptible to ecoli infections thay or youre some weak soy who lived in a bubble his entire life and ate his foods fully cooked you know what has even more ecoli than romain lettuce steak i ate my stake pittsburgh blue as its called seared outsides and raw on the inside you would not survive in the cave man days i would you are weak and i should be able to take all of your resources and would if we didnt live in our sad civilization which exists only to protect the unintelligent and the weak
  i have gotten sick from lettuce twice in my life i enjoy many veggies but man fuck lettuce
  i go there every 6 weeks  how kind of job do you have where the fuck do i apply
  fuck all that noise im an american with a masters degree in technology could i go work there     i want to live and eat food there
  thats why i microwave my salads
ate some shitty baked potato thing from a chink shop in manchester   felt like death for 3 days  couldnt eat anything couldnt even shit felt feverish  eventually felt the surge incoming barely made it to the toilet in time  lower back hurt horribly for the rest of the day
do you ever smoke meats when its freezing cold out
i dont smoke
  smokin these meats
  in america you smoke meats but in soviet russia meats smoke you
  no but i do bbq neighbors think im mental
  what a country
  living somewhere where its ever freezing cold  snow is for vacations and recreation not living in dum dum
  nothing more comfy than winter bbq
  hey i gotta eat baby  mama dont work mama dont eat
  is he just fucking high as a kite all day or what
ur mom smokes meats
  hes not human
maybe i suck at it but i find temperature an absolute bitch to maintain in the summer somehow its easier for me to regulate in the winter idk why that is
  yup i love smoking jews with a fire of burning niggers
  adderall abuse
  correct hes jewish
/ck/ i feel like shit what are some good nonalcoholic drinks i can enjoy while sick
  cranberry jews
i found that some alcohol free beers arent all that bad
  tonic water with bitters and lime
  mug vodka
  water
  honey  lemon  hot water  dash of apple cider vinegar  delicious and feels great on a sore throat or just as a nice warm drink
teaspoon of this in hot water
real ginger beer  seltzer  orange or cranberry juice
  im afraid to ask what that is
  juice mate
  hot green tea
  mint tea will calm the stomach  cinnamon tea will clear the sinuses
  that chicken looks retarded
this and if its cold where you are its delicious hot too
  that look of regret as soon as its in its mouth  thats how i feel every time i get the craving to try some mcdick
    one cube of beef oxo is better
whats with catfaggots and being disgusting with food
  broth like another anon said will make you feel better the sodium will do you some good while youre sick just make sure to also keep drinking water when im sick or getting over a cold i chug this homemade electrolyte drink and it helps  24 oz water   juice of 1/2 of lemon  pinch of salt  1 tsp honey  shake that bad boy up and youll be feeling better in no time op    oh and if you have a fever chrysanthemum tea supposedly helps your body regulate temperature
    a strong hot ribena is also great for colds
    toxoplasmosis
  oh gross
  this is correct
  half a liter of vodka with some of these as chasers after a while you wont remember you are sick
  i get sick on alcohol a lot  a lot a lot  i had appendecitis once my urine was thick and yellow      drink chicken broth water with lemon water with lime or go crazy and drink all three together which simmered in a pot for a while so its warm
how has no one said ginger ale yet
  because ginger ale is for limp wristed sissy boys
  ginger beer was suggested and is superior to ginger ale
  really nigga
  toxoplasmosis
  thank you for making this thread i am truly grateful
  water oj and curry

start of christmas edition    bought your turkey yet /ck/ or what alternatives are you considering this year    general stories also welcome  sorry for forgetting this thread last week
first post
  my turkey are you confusing christmas with thanksgiving
ducks
  ham
  duck or goose for me depending on price far superior in my opinion    the turkey i used to have at christmas was so fucking dry it was enough to put me off for life
turkey  not christmas lasagna
for me its secret aardvark  the best hot sauce
  bpa plastic
  the biggest irony of people crying about xeno estrogens is they are always the biggest pussies
  unironically pretty good on leftover fried rice
  its because they need something to blame for being weak and pussified themselves
what are some other ways to make decent coffee without having a big expensive machine
cold brew is pretty good and easy as shit so long as you dont mind having to make your coffee a day in advance
boil water in an old soup can
unironically instant coffee
  this is not a way to make decent coffee
  drip or french press although neither will give you that nearexpresso experience    kys
  there are none you must spend thousands of dollars or else you might as well kill yourself for drinking such subpar coffee
  grind the beans and dump it all in a cup of 98f water  stir  drink
aeropress or v60
    the fuck outta here ive had a moka coffee pot for over a year between that and my burr grinder ive never had better coffee in my life
  just because its the best youve had doesnt mean its good
  aeropress only contrarians disagree
  portable espresso devices like the minipresso or handpresso  inb4 bbut its not as good as a real espresso  then why are moka pots popular if they dont make true espresso its a compromise you make for getting something cheaper than a 2000 espresso machine
  use a percurator
  whats the point of these thing coffee just dissolves into hot water when you stir it a fancy way of heating water up is not going to change the outcome are people just too lazy to stir
  sous vide the beans
  coffee grinds dissolve  am i being baited
  just because you dont know how to use a simple contraption for coffee doesnt mean it sucks
hey service workers    i dont tip okay  dont fuck my shit up just because you didnt get a tip    i get it im rich and you want my money   go fuck yourself  i pay more in taxes than you will pay in your whole life    dont fuck up my day because you didnt get a tip
  i hope the next server you encounter pisses in your drink
  here we dont pay taxes and definitely no tipping
service workers should be talking to their employer about getting paid more not extorting their customers
  tipping is not food and cooking related
  i guess youll need to report the thread then
  you tip inside restaurants in which you can find food and cooking
  neither is spreading unmitigated faggotry but that doesnt stop you
  how can we get away from tipping its archaic crap related to corruption and extortion it used to be ok to leave a dime at the coffee joint and now your a dick if it aint a couple of bucks fifteen percent was a good tip and now youre a piece of shit if it aint twenty for mediocre service they think they have to fuck with me and ask me how things are all the time while im trying to eat fuck this shit this aint mexico
  sir this is a gynecology clinic
  how can we get away from tipping  just dont do it why do you need to tip they make money anyway
  i guess but im against the idea of it not against the poor fucker that im not tipping
  your options are to write to your congressional representative become one yourself make an extremely high profile restaurant that doesnt allow tipping or move to a country where tipping isnt a common practice
  i would just strictly tip slightly below average after accounting for service if everyone does this tips will gradually decrease and the market will adjust to pay higher wages right now the opposite is happening and people are overtipping out of guilt creating a cycle of excessive tipping and above market wages    so if you tip 1015 instead of 1518 you will be helping drive down tipping without screwing anyone over
  in japan tipping isnt allowed and is considered offensive because good service should be a mandatory thing
  youre so right
what is the gayest fruit and why is it the strawberry
  banana shills out in full force
  its obviously a banana you fucking shill
  t bananafag
  grapes are fun
youll have a hard time making your boyfriend cum shoving strawberries up his ass  seems like banana might be gayer
  idk because its an aphrodisiac and youre gayv
  strawberries are shaped like perky tits  not gay  bananas are phallic  very gay
  based
  truth
  great now i have to eat strawberries
for me is the chicken pizza
hi friends im gonna show you how to make traditional greek augolemono egglemon which is used to thicken soups and not only and tastes super delicious it is mainly used in chicken soup or soups that have mince in them such as giouvarlakia which i made today  1 squeeze a couple of lemons depends on the quantity of food youre making
2 crack open 2 eggs separating the white from the yolk and put the white into a blender/mixer keep the yolks on the side for now and blend the whites until theyre foamy
  the fuck is your problem cunt
3 add the lemon juice into the egg whites and blend again for a while
4 now add the egg yolks and blend some more
reminds me of mayo
5 take some broth or soup from the chicken soup or whatever youre making leave it on the side for a couple of minutes until the temperature drops some because we dont want it to be piping hot then slowly pour it into the augolemono mix and blend it add some more broth blend again repeat this till your blender is full
hurry tf up
  forgot to say if you add boiling soup/broth to your augolemono mix the eggs are gonna cook and youll have chunks of egg floating around which sucks  6 lower food to low heat and pour the augolemono in stir some and its done
7 end result should look something like this enjoy your awesome soup  
  looks like something i shat out after a weekend bender
he brings me the jar pissing over and the big surprise is the fooking juice is fooking rooooow
  i too enjoy the lemon spike for when pressing too hard give the stigmata like saviour jesus lemon also stinging the wound reminding of pain of the cross lemon extractor necessitates much prejudice and caring to not injure
  what in the actual fuck
  the citrine expression that is creating juice also contains spike the spike of which is to puncture hand as in jesus when his hand was pinned    ok    when pressed to hard causing injury the lemon spike burns and remind of the pain of the cross of jesus
he dips his fries in a sauce
he tips
he doesnt order a glass of mayonnaise to drink
dipping fries in a sauce that theyd never ever be served with conventionally but still tastes good  hollandaise and some extra crispy fries are blessed
  he leaves his house
he identifies as male
he doesnt tip the waiter for buttering his cast iron glass with medium rare mayonnaise
  why is there salt spilled on the side but no salt on the fries
doesnt call them freedoms  get out
  belgium got it right with mayonnaise

gentlemen this is your /deenz/ thread for the week of nov 26 in the year of our lord 2018    cue the theme song
i know you know what it means  you can pepper to taste  you can eat em dudes plain  and the fish is safe cuz they low on the food chain   maybe you gotcha own way  of gettin omega threeeeeeeeeeeeees    but for me    its all about them deenz    baby gimme them deenz
cue the theme song  ok fren  
lunch a couple days ago
  thanks for reminding me to pick up some saltines when i go out on my liquor/taco bell run op
  deenz and canned tuna have been really helpful in my weight loss recently i chop them up and mix em into a bowl of steamed green beans with a smattering of mustard     what other ways do yall make a healthy sardine meal
i would have felt better if the deenz theme guy fucking recut it instead of leaving like 1/3 of the track him and his drummer bantering jazzy fucking fags
  lunch yesterday
  lunch a few days from now
  close
  nice probably my favorite kind
    love these    picked up the ko boneless skinless spanish style online ive never had boneless and skinless but i hear this flavor is superb
brislings or bust    those cheap bug chunks of fish are better left for bait
    tomato sauce    how was it
  thats what i told the pianist and drummer but they said no
  tomato is the most meal ish you can find fishy salty semi sweet sauce with deens good with plain rice bowl since it already has a decent sauce      its still good but is a little annoying and detracts from repeated playing contradicts the whole premise of being all about them deenz when you force the audience to endure mid song conversation
  what other ways do yall make a healthy sardine meal  try nordic inspired with potato topped with plain yogurt some garlic home made pickles and fresh veggies    med inspired grill some tomato chop it up and toss it in a bowl add some olive oil basil oregano chopped onion red pepper flakes sardines lettuce of your choice and jam that fucker in a pita bread
    i like it it adds an element of novel intimacy that balances well with the sardines motif as if youre there in the living room apartment where the setup is concentrated in the corner farthest away from the connected kitchen with the light from the lamp granting enough illumination to make the glimmer of the roommates smile comfortable and reassuring as they stand in the hallway overlooking humoring the impromptu expression of character
  pretty plain not great on crackers no zest as the wrapper promised i liked the jalapenos better
todays lunch
  do you guys even buy fresh ones
you guys really make me wanna try this but i cant get over eating the bonez and headz
    no fresh deenz available in my area chargrilled sounds bretty gud though
    never seen a canned deen with heads on and high quality bristlings are so small that you dont even notice them you are doing yourself a disservice by not trying some high quality of course
i prefer mackerel
  yesm and fresh anchovy
  it sounds like a jam session i have nothing against jam sessions if the players and the material are good
never had sardines or anchovies in my life not because of availability but because im really bad handling strong flavors like black caviar for example which ive tasted but havent particularly enjoyed even though the macros seem pretty fucking great and im always willing to eat stuff i dont appreciate if it helps my nutritional goals     how do they taste like to you fellow anons
  like fish you know when people say this or that fish tastes good because it doesnt taste like fish yeah they dont like deenz and deenz tastes like pure fish they are good paired with something bland like potatoes or bread to spread all that flavor out preserved anchovies tastes like fish  salt pickled anchovies taste a lot better and are really good in caesar salad a bright acidic somewhat ocean like flavor
    high quality brislings just taste like a stronger canned tuna with a good smoky olive oil flavor paired with a cracker and something acidic like mustard or hot sauce it is very nice and balanced try a can of king oscars for your first can
  smoked mackerel packed in oil is delicious the stuff in tomato sauce not so much
  how do they taste like  good but what you want is the smoked variety in spring water those are fucking goattier    if you like tuna fish sandwich then just sub the tuna for the sardines if you think its too fishy just rinse them under cold water and dry them with a paper towel before you put them in anything
  how do they taste like to you fellow anons    with canned seafood price is king it ranges from rancid cat asshole to zomg fucking amazing
  really bad or really good depends on the brand start with expensive ones
          thnx for replies ok will aim for notcheapish im not rich kind either water or oil
  i love me some deenz
    i would suggest king oscar wild caught in olive oil or mediterrainian style for your first can
  scrambalam eggs my guy
i mash a tin with a bit deli mustard and soy sauce on crackers
for me its the portuguese sardine the best sardine not too small not too mushy packed in lemon olive oil god damn
im convinced the shinier the healthier
deenz fucking suck
  hnnnng
god i love me some deenz    im always worried that im going to just get a can full of mush king oscar has always been good but my favorite have been trader joes brand deenz if youve got a trader joes nearby also the smoked mackerel is unbelievable
  my favorite way to eat deens    pour off oil into frying pan  fry omelette in oil  put deenz inside omelette  put on plate  salt and pepper  toast if im feeling fancy
  thanks for this pairing looks promising as a solution to my disinterest to canned fish which i find dry and papery
so today i had 1 can of deenz w/ soya oil and 1 w/ spring water this is because i cant find the tomato sauce ones they were okay but nowhere near as good as the tomato sauce is there any other types worth trying
  this that shiny pinkish sometimes rainbow color that is on the scaled sardines are always the first to be eaten
  im in thailand atm teaching until january and im really starting to miss deenze although the street food here is so cheap and yummy there is something about deenze and rice that made me so happy would eat the deenze here but its pacific caught and i dont fancy a can of fukashima fish
  just waiting in this comfy food place for my spicy rice pork and two eggs
deenz  sardines are great but why do you idiots have to use a stupid grade school tier meme word all the time just use sardines like normal people and quit acting like a bunch of 12 year old faggots
  you seem angry anything you want to share
  you didnt answer the question anon    and while i cant speak for the other guy nobody is angry were puzzled as to why adults would choose to behave like infants
  seemed angry to me by his choice of words idiots stupid grade school tier meme faggots  and as for the question how the hell would i know maybe some people enjoy the feeling of belonging that comes forward through the use of a shared slang maybe they are just playfull maybe maybe maybe etc     it seemed weird to me to get all fuzzed up about some words so i wondered if that was really anons issue
  seemed angry to me by his choice of words idiots stupid grade school tier meme faggots  thats just normal 4chanspeak bro     seemed weird to me to get all fuzzed up about some words  i think your confusion is because you think anon is all fuzzed up when in reality he just asked a simple question
  you seem to be 12 years old you shouldnt be here
  sounds great
  this    no need to talk like children or force stupid memes here
  its just like saying go za and cha  its to rile you up and it worked  wa la
  its just like saying go za and cha  exactly grade school tier you faggots need to step up your game  its to rile you up and it worked  so did my post now grow the fuck up    were done here skippy
how do you lads like to eat your deenz    i usually eat them by themselves out of the can but doing so makes me feel like such an asshole for some reason what are some good ways to elevate it i kinda like how the op pic looks is that mustard
  based
  agreed brislings are so tender and oily god i love them
  i know its kind of memed here but seriously get a tin of king oscar brislings theyre not dry nor papery theyre really soft and fatty
what brands do you guys prefer just realized these latvian deenz i enjoyed are in hydrogenated oil nopenopenope so need a replacement
tfw bjs replaced king oscar with these and theyre not as good
bump
for me its deenz and tinez     a nice tiny brisling on top of a saltine with a dollop of yellow mustard or splash of tapatio people at work think im lying when i tell them that i went home and had sardines for lunch they have such a bad stigma around them like the only people that eat them are old fisherman hermits
how do you know how many calories/whatever youre eating when you read the sardine label when the sardines are in oil does the label include the oil all of it or just some of it i usually drain them a little before i eat them and im definitely not eating all the oil but im certainly eating some ive never been able to get a decent answer for this
  im a deenz and squits man myself
anyone else like pan frying some /deenz/ in some motor oil on an old hubcap over a garbage can fire
had the boneless and skinless variety today wasnt a fan the appearance was offputting to me
bump
  honestly why would you take a picture of this  im being 100 serious right now
are we allowed to talk about fried whitebait here
  thats just normal 4chanspeak bro  so is deenz bro what kind of 12 year old faggot gets upset about meme words on the channel
  meme words  who were you calling a 12 year old faggot again
      gentlemen lets remain civil in our deenz conversation
    our lady the queen of deenz
  fuck i miss bellas piri piri deenz ive been in bongland for uni and cant find them here  on the bright side these cheap ass deenz are better than anything you can get in the states for 1
  made mistake of eating chicken of the sea deenz  see a post here about how garbage they are  try king oscars as per recommendation   mfw
do you eat them with the bones   arent they supposedly super salty  ive never had a sardine
  cringe
  imagine being this butthurt over a word
had deenz for the first time in my life and i gotta say  theyre just okay
i enjoy some sardines in tomato sauce on a cracker with a dab of tapatio and a little lime   hnnnnnng
  i want you to know that i hide your absolutely shit tier thread and your eternally look down upon your shit taste in food please neck yourself
  whats wrong with whitebait
got this at my local supermarket  how did i do
  soya
  soy
  a
  back to pol friend
good morning folks god a nice setup here this morning im going plain today with no crackers or anything but i got a colorful spread of mustard deens hot deens and two tins of smoked oysters add a nice dewdriver and ive got a nice chill day of no classes or work to do fuck all cheers
  pirri pirri deenz  check portuguese deenz on amazon    here you go fren    
ive never had them    i like all variety of fish i like pickles and i generally like canned things spicy is my personal preference but what kind do you recommend
  i wonder if we can get the theme song used by some large deenz company i know its 4chan but this is probably the most wholesome thread on this board itd be cool if the guy got some royalties but even if he didnt it would be some kind of small victory
    i love a good can of smoked oysters it only feels right if i shake some hot sauce on them and eat them right out of the can with a toothpick it sad that so few young americans know the joy of tinned fish and oysters
    the deenz community is a pretty chill and mature lot i enjoy the company
    quality is key i always recommend a newbie try a tin of king oscar wild caught brislings with some crackers ko are widely available and top quality if you cant find them focus on brisling these are the smallest fish and are a lot better than the large cut chunks found in cheaper tins also steer away from cheap oils like soy and sunflower evoo is king followed by mustard and hot sauce try some
rate my deenz haul boys  5 cans of chicken of the sea sardines  5 packs of brunswick kippered snacks  13 bucks
  hey i made that last year    /deenz/ forever bros
    it is pretty spot on     well done sir
    hopefully you enjoy them but i had to throw an entire tin of that exact chicken of the sea away the texture was mushy and the oil had a very offputting bitter smoke flavor to it unfortunately the quality was just not up to my specific tastes
  oh man this doesnt bode well thanks for the heads up my brother though they were only 94 cents a can so its not a big loss if i end up hating them
can i get a quick rundown on /deenz/ do you just eat the bones and all whats the best pairing
  yeah you eat the bones theyre kinda chalky but soft enough to chew up theyre good on a cracker with cream cheese and there are a lot of recipes out there but seasoned deenz veterans will likely eat them straight out the can
love deenz but never eat them    should i start slipping them into my diet
  good small fish have such tiny soft bones that you literally dont notice them in the slightest best pairing in a hurry is deen on a saltin cracker with the mustard of your liking vinegary hot sauces cut the taste very nicely as well
    for me its a fast and healthy lunch when i come home from the office the smell and stigma keeps me from eating them at work
  tastelets deserve to suffer anon eat the deenz
  just nom on some onions and parsley afterwards
  well thats not nice
  i love smoked oysters but i can only stomach one tin for like a week i dont know why but after a tin i dont feel like eating them again for awhile
    thanks lads next time im at the store gonna see what they have to offer
  theyre usually shipped headless and the bones are so tiny and soft you literally dont even notice them theres no crunch or extra chewiness or anything
  do you ever get guts or intestines in your deenz
    never in a tin of high quality there have been tales of guts egg sacks worms scales and other things in cheap cans
  i got some questions  do yall just eat whole sardines/whatever other tiny fish in a can  do you eat the fins n shit scales n all  doesnt that bother any of you  do fish have assholes are you eating the assholes   genuinely wanna know how you guys eat this stuff i cant stomach it but i keep trying
  fish is good whole fish mmmmm you wouldnt butcher a clam mussel or oyster would you i eat intestine offal and pig skin nothing wrong with any of it
boy do i like them deenz i think deenz with garlicy tomato sauce are just the best spread em on a piece of bread and its fucking heaven i swear
  based crackers n deenz poster
  i unironically say zza
    never seen this flavor
  /deenz/ threads are the comfiest place on this godforsaken website  love you deenzbros
  to share in these based threads
  yeah whatever you say boss 
what do yall know about other types of canned sea creature    a while ago i saw my local walmart has what appears to be canned squid kind of want to try i remember i couldnt read the label couldnt remember if it was in arabic or spanish will it kill me
    try sardines first they arent as strong as anchovies if you like fish you will probably like sardines
trying to decide between these for breakfast
  i fucking love the brunswick herring in louisiana hot sauce maybe my favourite zero prep meal
  sure youre not thinking of canned octopus ive bought these from walmart theyre from spain and were good if theyre from spain it wouldnt hurt to try i mean its not like chink poison
  you just eat out of the can / on crackers
  yeah with hotsauce pretty much my goto on all the /deenz/ style products i feel thats the best way for me to cleanly evaluate each one
    smoked oysters are superb  smoked clams are also good  kippered herring is good depending on quality  anchovies by themselves are disgusting but ok in recipes in tiny amounts  cant speak on any tentacle pals
  riga sprats are fucking amazing literally prefer them over sardines everytime
buy 8 packs of deenz  open 1  pop deen in mouth  this dont taste right  look at label  sourced from china  mfw
order 2 jars of these from wally world  package arrives open box  hit in face with oily fish bomb  jar busted in box and covered other jar and items in box   ill never get the smell off of everything  thanks guy who packed box
  oh god no
  this is fucking nasty dont buy it its so overly salty and texture is bad use it in recipes or dont use it all
    luckily the other items were sealed food items some of that shin black ramen that people rave on
  shin black ramen  meh/10 i refuse to eat top ramen/maruchan etc so shin is my absolute bottom which is saying its still shit but edible did amazon make you send them back 
  try to find this on sale itll be the best decision of your life also tonkatsu but i prefer miso    how was the jarred sardines tho compared to canned
    it was walmart and theres no way i could send them back being an oily mess im out 4 on them so im not going to bother will just stick with cans next time      ill have to look for them and very good quality a lot more smoky than average if thats your thing polar brislings are top notch in any form
  not pickled herring  amateur
  selling the song would be like trying to sell the dungeness crab pasta to long john silvers
  those herring fillets are really good my grandmother used to feed them to me when i was young and i developed a taste for them
how are those chink eels  i keep hearing conflicting opinions
what song where is the song
found this blogpost about sardines a la plancha marinated in green chutney in it is a link to the recipe for the chutney  
    a super based deenz poster posted a glorious recorded track about deenz somebody must have the link
    i found the archived thread with the vocaroo link but it says its expired or deleted
  heres the song boss
  theyre good but possibly too mild
  i dont care if this is old news i lold way more than i was prepared to
when are we going to get these threads sponsored by nigeria
tingi mean clunk clunk clunk  sirs gentlemen may i have your attention attention please  this is a warning from one sucker for sardines to another  deenz reduce inflammation but this also weakens your immune system be warned before you eat em if there are sick people around i made the mistake and good heavens i fell ill with influenza and dropsy i had weathered the season well until the deenz were ingested   ill head the cdc one day so sick people arent legally allowed to be in public or theyll be put in a work camp or shot until then limit deenz intake if there are sick people afoot in your midst
  well that was a funny post
what should i look for in a can of deenz
  quality
  what does that mean ive only had deenz once or twice what sort of texture am i looking for
  portuguese or spanish is toptier  followed by french/italian though they are rarer and expensive and not worth the price  followed by other nearby deenz such as those from morocco   lastly you got the northernly ones from the baltic states and poland which are hit or miss  worst tier is thai and sea of china deenz
  gotcha m8 thanks for the tips  what about canadian sardines pic related seems pretty common around here
  theyre alright overpriced but id eat em
  wait how do inflammation and the immune system interact or are you just bullshitting
    can you recommend a brands of spanish or portugese readily available online
  dont get discouraged easily i bought some deenz on sale early and hated them so much i almost swore off deenz now i eat a tin a day of the fuckers the trick is finding the good ones
  i make fancy sammiches with my deenz
ate an entire tin of these  look at nutrition facts  apparently just got 100 of my daily protein
gentlemen
fried eggs with spinach tomatoes and deenz    breakfast of kings
  ive never had deenz before never really gave them a second thought really before i started seeing these threads im glad you took this picture because that looks pretty good what kind are those
once you go lemon olive oil you never go back
hate sardines but i ate pic related the other day was good
  king oscar jalapeno
  talkin bout them deeeeeeenz
  theyre not for everyone  if the flavour isnt for you you can at least appreciate the value deenz are about the best bang for your buck in terms of nutrition and as far as healthy food goes plus extremely convenient
  walmart will replace or refund chat with them and tell them what happened
  antiinflammatory  immunosuppresant generally
best deenz i can get in central europe prague to be specific
  based
  had these in plain olive oil this morning was my first foray into the world of /deenz/ breddy good but expensive
i cant force myself to eat deenz they just taste gross    smoked trout in a can is fucking magical though
  can i ask you why theres such a big gangbang scene in prague
anyone else tried aldi deenz theyre something like 075 a tin and although im new to sardines the quality seems good for the price
  they are bad
  i know they arent exactly brislings but i enjoyed them well enough
  nah they are really bad in comparison to a 1202 can
    obviously some deenz
  anything in specific youd recommend getting king oscars at 350 a tin is a bit excessive for regular consumption with my current financial situation
    beach cliff are the only cheap ones i can tolerate in mustard or hot sauce
  only cheap ones i can tolerate  in mustard or hot sauce  sounds like you arent truly a fan of them deenz
  i am the truest of fans which is why i enjoy quality deenz namely brislings not the pleb huge chunks of cheap fish with the guts and eggs left in them that you find in cheaper tins if i do find myself eating a cheap can you can bet your ass it will be saved by mustard or another vinegary sauce
  deenz long considered hobo food for years or even decades by normies  can get decent deenz for 88cents a can  start seeing these threads crop up  theyve gone up to like 150 after tax for cheap beach cliffs in the past 2 years  fuck you all why cant i just enjoy nice things by myself
  chicken of the sea are okay deenz theyre a bit salty for my taste and basically taste like tuna probably not even actual sardines not protected name in the us afaik but some other small fish
  dont sardines only come from the med
  aldi deenz are the only ones ive tried but i love them
  based
  
  the bones are so tiny and soft you literally dont even notice them  this has never been my experience what the fuck  i end up picking out the crunchy bits
  what the hell deenz did you have last time i got cots they tasted nothing like tuna they tasted like the bottom of a fishing trawler mixed with cat food and were basically inedible maybe it was the soybeal oil or maybe they just suck      never tried those brunswick fillets though i saw them on the shelf but ignored them will definitely have to give them a try
  i cant eat fish in oil anymore i fuckng hate the taste of oil
  bela portuguese  matiz spanish    used to be the latter was better but the portugese stepped up their game i prefer water and regular olive oil followed by the pepper one
  whats best deenz for caesar dressing i can find in a store lads
  use anchovies instead
  you know what me too i havent for the life of me been able to find caesar salad dressing lately it used to be everywhere say 5 years ago i found some low calories shit of it but still not good
65 aussie cents  i mean is it worth a try at that price
  probably not but who yolo
  did not know that
  yeah theyre probably tough boney and large but who knows
  nordic would be sour cream instead of yogurt and no garlic
  getting upset over a lighthearted meme word makes you seem like a 15 year old trying to act sophisticated the same type of person wholl sip juice from a wine glass
  meme word  what a faggot
  inflation how does that work
  stahp
    its just porn but i guess the czech are more open about sex and kinky too like germans
costco deenz worth the sale
  my wife texted me 420 blaze it and i just happened to be eating lunch at that time so i responded with the pic
  theyre alright good bulk option pretty meaty taste    they were better before they switched to these gay foil easy pull tops honestly harder to open without making a mess than the old pull tabs and the outside of the can is always oily which makes me constantly worry that the packaging is compromised
  this also the prefer the ones with skin and bones better also uses evoo
  whole sardines skin and bones yes  boneless and skinless no
  i hate the bones skin is fine
so how is it different from pouring steaming water into the cup containing freshly ground coffee beans stirring it up with a spoon and chugging like a normie
poor bait
  i believe the difference is pressure
  would you rather eat shit on the ground or right from the butthole
  i would eat it out of your pretty mouth
  two main differences from your sort of greek coffee idea metal filtered out grounds and the pressure in the siphoning action see pic for what you might prefer if you want your grounds to stay there and then settle in the bottom to be ignored though you do drink a lot of them    moka pots make decent espresso facsimile even with a little light layers of crema on top but it is certainly not for the weak/morning roast type folks because it does go to boiling point and beyond and that picks up some acid
  this makes me think of a pee pee
i dont know but it just werks
  moka a cute
you dont have to drink the coffee grounds of you use a moka looks pretty obvious
  moka is thicker and more intense due to pressure fuckery great if you want something similar to espresso on a budget / with a simple mobile device
  a simple mobile device  kids these days and their phones

someone told me the other day that white people dont wash their meat before cooking this isnt serious right
  wash their meat  why should i wash my penis
lets get hygiene advice from a people who regularly have ebola outbreaks
  we whites stopped washing our meat 10 or 15 years ago when people started saying washing meat just spread bacteria everywhere and proper cooking kills all surface pathogens anyway
  welp thats the last time im eating at a white persons house then
  you have to wash it after cooking if you wash it before cooking its just going to get dirty again
  unless you buy meat in some shady alley your meat should have been smoked and frozed beforehand to kill all and every single pathogen then cooking it should kill any pathogens left by heat  if your fridge is clean your kitchen is clean your utensils are clean and your hands are clean why would you wash your meat  also 
washing your meat is only for if youve let it sit in your fridge for 5 days and accumulate a fine layer of slimy bacteria feces on the outside  any actual bacteria on the outside of meat are going to get fucking obliterated in the oven so why splash them all of your kitchen sink
  that sounds more like a white person thing than a black thing tbqhwy
  because maybe you dont want that slime in your food
  so dont let it sit in your fucking fridge and go bad then  that slime is underneath the surface of the meat too so youre still eating it
white people are nasty
i only wash poultry
  no the slime is on the surface brainiac
    im white so i can afford good meat
  the slime is the leftover shit from bacteria eating the food  your food has bacteria below the surface  if there is slime on the surface of your food which is because you didnt cook it soon enough that exact same shit is beneath the surface of the food    this is literally the process of spoiling
  so you admit that the slime is on the surface why wouldnt you wash that off i swear
  dont buy slimy meat dummy
  dont eat spoiled meat brainlet
    its not spoiled its fine to eat it just requires a little rinse i swear are all white people this dumb
another dick in the mud nigga what 
white people are cucks
  only because white women love black cock and white men love seeing their partner in ecstasy you misogynist
    so you were shitposting  ayoooo hoool up /ck/  soo you bee sayin  smack lips  wee  smokes crack  wuuuz  gets arrested  cheefs n shiet  dies from ebola
  because we are circumcised
  do black people really smack their lips im against racism but dont know many black people and really hate anybody who smacks his lips its a disgusting habit
  against racism  dont know many black people  checks out
grilled cheese made with raw grassfed cheddar brie and gouda    with tomato soup    good dinner or best dinner
  clever
  not bad but i still prefer your moms ass
  this but unironically
  please tell me you made a fresh tomato soup and not canned op
  er canned
  did you make the tomato soup yourself if its canned then its a fail grade from me
  see  
  i always laugh like a retard at grass fed cheese butter etc i picture some farmer trying feed grass a block of cheese or something
  based and potpilled
  its all good your taste in cheese makes up for the soup being canned
  top fucking kek
  neither thats an evening snack
you should have stopped at cheddar but i will not judge you for your cheese preferences     no a good dinner a comfy dinner especially with that soup nothing like it
  wheres the pineapple
is that plate gluten free
  grass fed cheddar    cheese doesnt eat grass son
  ass for dinner  but thats for breakfast
  pineapple  thatd be a melt not a grilled cheese sandwich a grilled cheese sandwich is a sandwich with only cheese which is grilled afterwards if you add other stuff it stops being a grilled cheese sandwich
  you have fine taste        but you fine genteel men are true gourmonds
  nope nobody says melt irl ive only ever seen autists on this site use it outside of tuna melt tuna melt is the one and only melt
  gottem
  i melted in your moms pooper
  but thats for breakfast    no i think it was always served for lunch
what can i cook as a complete beginner to survive in this place
hot water
what are the prices of regular food over there  like macaroni and shit
  this is accurate 
  why would you move to a country for work if you arent making enough to afford the cost of living there
  young and unskilled pay is better than my own country and no jobs available
  construction
  not much else i can do
  estonian
  close enough
how fat are you have you located any bulk buying places where is the nearest farm
  i am skelly mode for my height     live in a remote area only have assess to commercial stores nothing local that would be cheaper
also meat is the most expensive thing here
  no one needs meat that often hunting/fishing might be an option if youre desperate other than that make friends and if you can ask poor norwegians what they eat
  is their lots of construction going on in norway  wouldnt mind running equipment up their
  wtf  no wonder varg doesnt live there
  just eat gjetost
most stores have sales from time to time sparusually a pricey store often have certain products for 10 kr    heres an app with all the major stores sales items  
  how much do you earn monthly   potatoes like 2 a 1kg i dont think you will have to starve
  moved to norway for work    norway wages should account for norway prices unless you took the transfer on some equivalent pay without researching the country you were going to in which case youre an idiot you should be able to afford your new living
op was like i hate being at home and starving to death while unemployed lets relocate to one of the most expensive countries of the world do work and still cant afford shit    but hey at least the girls are nice
  i thought they had unions and things in europe    what exactly is your role    in america even an apprentice or 1st year worker gets quite a nice wage if they are truly in construction
  norway has one of the lowest food prices compared to living costs in the entire world unless you are getting cucked by your employer its highly illegal to get underpaid you should have no problems at all
  lowest food prices compared to wages
  if you are in oslo or in the vicinity immigrant stores in the brugata/gronland/toyen area are at timed significantly cheaper than regular stores otherwise try to look for 10/20 kr marked in regular stores look for first price and xtra products too as they are the best value for your money
    unless you are getting cucked by your employer    i thought this was a possibility hence my questions about his role maybe if he getting screwed some norway anons can help him
    weve had several incidents of ee workers getting not payed enough or swindled but contact arbeidstilsynet if you feel that this is happening this link might help  
  is it possible he is in such a remote area that there are exemptions to these rules
  worked in construction last year with a bunch of estonians who had worked in norway that said that sweden is currently the better alternative  dunno if thats true so dont pack your yak on my word
  no there are no such exemptions as the law is applied to the whole country and thus as a construction worker he is entitled to at least 17780 nok per hour of work
  girls are much better in my own country i just needed some money of my own this is not gonna be a long time thing
  working for a company in my own country but this is a secondment so norways wage does not apply
  1600 euros
still sounds like a nice move to make construction might be tiresome but norway sounds like a very comfy country spend 2 weeks there and might be a bit bias from the netherlands if that matters
    are you 18 or above do you have education im no expert but that sounds like it might be below minimum wage     but for the matter at hand you can easily live at that cost in norway i do it as a student just buy cheap food in bulk its going to suck but you will survive
whale cum to socialism bucko
  i guess you live in oslo with a fucking expensive rent
  18 euros per hour  doesnt sound too bad for minimum wages of course the cost of living is higher but thats almost twice the dutch minimum wage
  the rent i dont have to worry about employer pays for that
  i noticed you didnt mention the 60 income tax either
  and you cant live off fucking 16k

  norway is trying to shift its economy away from oil and instead run entirely on taxes  i wonder if such shifts will make homegrown products and smallscale farming more popular in the future
  pay is better than my own country    i mean thats true but that also means we have more money to buy food with so food prices go up
  i wonder if such shifts will make homegrown products and smallscale farming more popular in the future    pppprobably not    its all about comparative advantage neh even if food is very expensive the amount of food i can grow in say an hour of work every day for a year is less than the amount of food i can purchase if i work an hour extra every day for a year    although of course that work is taxed and the garden is not so at some intersection of tax and hourly wage it makes more sense to work in your garden than at your job i wouldnt expect that to happen for most people at any point though
if you arent fussy about diet or slightly stale bread you can use the app toogoodtogo and buy leftovers from caf√©s and other eating places for around 4050 kr   it varies how much you get but you can get upwards to a pretty hefty full paper bag with sandwiches baguettes and stuff like that
  the only expensive thing on that list is the milk
if you live in a city with an import/immigrant store go there and pick up some cheap ass dried legumes and learn how to make lentil soup     if you have a freezer buy stuff in bulk and when its 50 off due to nearing expiry and just freeze shit now that its close to christmas therell probably be a price war on christmas foods where stores cut prices with 90 and ridiculous shit most of the food i buy is like 70 off retail which is already cheap when you consider an average wage here just stop wasting all your money on alcohol as our alcohol prices are retarded

hereford texas beef capital of the world    why is it that the little island of japanese produces better beef than the whole of america
  american autism isnt strong enough
meat production in america is controlled by five huge mostly jewish corporations which prioritize profits over quality
  they can afford to feed them grain from birth only the last few weeks are spent in a feedlot in the usa you dont get that level of extreme fat from a grass fed diet
  yeah but jap beef doesnt have the delicious taste of roundup
kobe isnt really better at this point its just a different thing
  why is it that the little island of japanese produces better beef than the whole of america    what the shit are you talking about most beef in japan is complete shit often filled in with filler are you talking about kobe style hida or what prefecture also what grade    inb4 waygu duh  i dont think you know what that term means
  kobe beef is a meme and i dont understand why people jump on this shit when it isnt even a5 cut go to gifu get some nice hida cuts for like half of what you would pay for the shit they sell down in kobe oh but then you cant meme about it so it must be bad     you can get japanese beef most anywhere but a lot is brought in from australia where japs own farms or america surprisingly
  when did you eat kobe beef where did you buy it from    because you definitely havent
  in osaka now i do realize it is in some of the nightcluby areas but i also had it in tokyo wasnt that great im always willing to give it a chance again but rather would just go back up to gero or this cool shop in takayama called butchers hida beef is a little better imo
its illegal to raise cows like they do here
  because america has the capital and the skill to produce that type of beef but its just more profitable to produce more beef at a lower cost than it is to produce higher quality beef at a high cost its just economics
      good write up on how they differ and it really isnt all that much doubt anyone going over could tell the differences
meats a much bigger industry here so the amount of time and manpower required to raise kobe style beef isnt cost efficient the number of people buying highcost beef doesnt equal the amount of money made on selling standardgrades so basically nobody cares about putting that much work into it for less result
  fugg all those dubs
  its because japanese prioritize intelligence over being obnoxious while they work theyre working on optimizing quality when texans work they yell yeehaw partnah everything is bigger in texas yeeeee doggie while shooting guns in the air
  its true im constantly firing my gun wildly into the air while sucking down some shit mass produced beer
    citation needed    youve never had it
  first one in takayama
  me too it sucks because sometimes my faggot neighbors who hate god come over complaining about my noise levels and i have to waste lead shooting them instead of firing my revolvers into the sky like a real patriot
  hmm might be on my sd card for the kobe waygu a5 gimme a sec to look for it i think it is on my travel phone
  while they work theyre working on optimizing quality    nah they actually work on hiding mistakes better than anything the amount of shit on some dishes to hide shit flavor or lack there of is meh just go there its fairly cheap out of lax in spring only 450 bucks round trip
  ah sorry thought i took pics of that meal guess i didnt or either too lazy to search father on my phone dont worry having it again in 2 weeks flying over for 3 weeks to do xmas and new years
  ive never been much of a traveler but how do people go to countries where no one speaks your language   i would think it would be extremely stressful and tedious to do anything but apparently im wrong since i see so many people doing it on youtube vids and whatnot
  japan has all things in japanese and english below on most things japan is probably the easiest thing to navigate as a english speaker most everyone takes english for 4ish years or so you will be fine with english or google translate     500 yen meal in ueno pretty good breakfast check  japan general for stuff its actually easy to go and be in japan without knowing any japanese language under your belt
  never post again
  amerimutts thinking their cornfed slop is worth more than pure grain fed alberta beef    they are building the wall on the wrong border
  why is it that the little island of japanese produces better beef than the whole of america  accident of history making crossbreeds of european and old japanese breeds capable of generating lots of intermuscular fat combined with autism to optimize it and japanese consumers willingness to spend ungodly amounts on groceries
climate   jap cows are too snowflake to live in texas
  fpbp
  canadian anything  ever    fuck off tao xiu lin
  i used to get pasteured pork from a butcher who imported it from canada and it was far superior to the pasteured pork here in the us and comparably priced trump tariffs nixed that of course now i have to get my pork from a guy who imports it from poland which while not as good as canadian its still better than us crap
  because japan makes their beef with loli meat which is far more tender and juicy they fatten them up a little to get the nice marbling
  trump tariffs nixed that of course  pork
  rofl i live in poland and 99 of pigs are locked in a building and cant turn around    lmfao
  get a load of this salty fag
      looks like a fun trip anon do you live in japan
  no texas rancher is gonna spend his whole day brushing his cow and giving them beer to drink
how do you peel a soft boiled egg without breaking the white throwing it across the room in rage running screaming out of your home and kicking every dog and cat you see
  grow up and stop acting like a child
  leave the eggs youre going to cook on the counter overnight if youre american  this agesthem and makes the membrane between the eggshell and the eggwhite easier to peel  cook your eggs how you like them  drain and give the eggs an ice bath in the same saucepot  drain again when they are cooled  shake the eggs around in the pan to break the shells not too rough you want to break the shells without breaking the whites  peel eggs under a tiny stream of water    works most of the time for me but fresher eggs are always harder to peel
  leave the egg in concentrated vinegar the shell will dissolve over the next couple of days then you rinse it before pulling the membrane off and eating it
  that membrane is the motherfucker      does that really work do you have to discard the vinegar after or can you reuse the same vinegar bath a couple times
  what do you think asshole
  dude just poach it in water as in crack an egg into boiling water and cook it and it comes out like a soft boiled egg    or realize that you dont peel a soil boiled egg at all you crack the top off and spoon it out buy an egg holder
  fuck that membrane
  this is for ramen in ramen they often use a soft boiled egg that is sliced in half and placed on top of the contents of the bowl
  i dont know    considering if you did this with 6 eggs by the time you take the eggs out theyve already been sitting in 6 eggs worth of dissolved shells for a few days so i guess no but thats why i ask
  does that really work  the shell does dissolve but i probably wouldnt eat the egg especially after several days reusing the vinegar works fine the vinegar will eventually magically become a watery calcium solution that could be nice to have if youve got some weak plants around the house
  oh so this is a great trick if im a gardener not somebody who likes to eat eggs
  water your eggplantsbruh
  weak plants  my fern that i nicknamed gatsu because i almost killed it by setting it outside on a hot day by mistake is struggling would this really work to make him stronger
  if they dont make peeled soft boiled eggs i aint fucking with them
  like this homey  
crack the egg into a glass place glass in microwave microwave till egg is cooked to your likening    this way you can see exactly how much your egg is cooked and you dont have to guess
  they use 2 eggs hard boil one remove the shell and slice in half remove the yoke soft boil the 2nd egg slice the top off and poor the yoke into the hard boiled whites
  ramen eggs are softboiled not raw
  i get the feeling that if you try that with a soft boiled egg youll blow the yolk out through the bottom
  not in the videos ive seen
  i dont know how you think this is the answer op wants
after cooking them break the shell and put it in water for a minute the water softens the membrane then you should be able to peel it without breaking the white
  use a spoon under the peel idort
  it doesnt work with soft boiled eggs you smash the whole thing
tfw you only like your hard boiled eggs piping hot and just out of the water
  you probably overcook them with green yolks too
  no i hate the green/ash grey yolks i just like them hot
  add small amount of white vinegar to the water that you cooke them in makes the shells softer and easier to take off
  this guy fucks
  drop the eggs into already boiling water rather than bring up to temp slowly then chill the egg immediately in ice water after cooking rather than letting it cool down slowly    both of these will make peeling easier and they will also make your egg cooking much more consistent since it removes the variable heat up and cool down time letting you much more carefully control the cook time    if youve done both of these things you wont have to do anything special to peel the eggs it should be easy itll come off cleanly in large pieces if the egg is strongly adhered to the shell youve already lost no matter what peeling technique you use
  dont use fresh eggs retard the shell will stick if you do
  how do you suggest someone gets not fresh eggs can you buy eggs that arent fresh do you let them sit on the counter how long
  do you let them sit on the counter  yes     long  depends on how fresh they were when you bought them and that varies a lot experience with your local eggs will teach you try a couple weeks and then see if that helps
  refrigerate them of course but only boil eggs that are a few days old at least
  use a little white wine vinegar in the water and peel as soon as possible top to bottom then around
  if a plant has a weak growth underdeveloped leaves and is looking more pale than a healthy plant it could be that the soil lacks calcium plants use calcium in cell walls and many nutrients arent entirely available to them if the soil is low in it     so this is a great trick if im a gardener not somebody who likes to eat eggs  i mean i just gave that answer because it technically solves a stupid first world problem i wouldnt eat a room temperature soft boiled egg thats been sitting in acid for days but feel free to experiment
  shake them before you boil them  this separates the membrane from the shell i also shake eggs before i crack them into a skillet or for baking just out of habit  youll feel the mass inside the egg detach and become free weight in the shell dont keep shaking or youll damage the yolk a couple good shakes is all you need
  are you aware youre on a cooking board youre bound to see a lot of first world problems on a board where people are talking about preparing and playing food in a world where most of the world is happy to find literal garbage thats edible if you think food preparation questions are stupid then fuck off back to the porn boards
i remember the shells peeling away much more easily when i was a child rachel carson wrote about eggshells getting thinner due to ddt i think the shells have gotten slowly thinner we are all going todie
  did they come away because they were thicker you could grab onto them more easily
all these cooking virgins lmao    2 words op ice bath
  almost every poster that gave actual advice said to use an ice bath
  like 2 other people said it
  my god is this literally the most retarded board on the site fucking hell
      follow this recipe but use ice cubes with the cold water to stop the cooking
honestly there isnt a better deal
  yeah sure is the cheapest way to death at 45
  long lifespans are for queers
  youre not wrong
  the extramostbestest is a better deal if you ask me
  plus tip
  tfw remembering all the times in high school when my bros and i would pile our money together and get a shit load of pizzas and eat like kings at someones house  damn those were the days
  kings dont eat pleb pizza
  white trash dinner
  kings eat whatever they want
  using shitty ingredients  5 dollar is still overpriced for the value
  yeah but kings dont feel like kings because they can afford a few shitty pizzas one night every 3 months
  i bet you had a tremendous social life as an adolescent
  i like it
  youre a cock
i prefer the hut
  well then boy do i have a product for you have you not heard about the miracles of snake oil yet
  kings dont care what you think
  absolutely cringe
  tip  carryout  nigger what

  it sure is 6 for a large pepperoni pizza with that much cheese and meat is a great deal i dont get the hate for little caesars
this has been a thing at sunoco for years 5 large pepperoni cashiers head will explode because they dont usually sell whole zas though
  jabba i assume fucking mongrel shit taste scum
  it used to be 1 large pizza 1 set of breadsticks and sauce and a 2 liter cola for 5 dollars to get the same thing now its 10 dollars why has everyone forgotten about this
5 dollars for 8 slices  how can anyone else fucking compete id go with pizza hut but a large is like 15 dollars  delivery for crust thinner then my finger nails and 6 slices they dont even deliver to my house but theyll deliver to my neighbors because your too far away yeah i guess its too much effort to drive a couple more feet you fucks i fucking hate having to use my neighbors address to get those cunts to deliver my fucking pizza  fuck you pizza hut long live caesar
  legit awesome  when did we start using legitimately this way did the bam margera start saying it
  naan with tomato paste and string cheese you can control your portions and itll last you for days
wanting disgusting greasy cardboard garbage when you can just make the vastly superior version for a little bit more
  lifehack ask for it cut 4 times youll get more than 8 slices and you can save some for work tomorrow
  found the friendless pleb
for me its the deep deep dish the best fast food pizza
  looks like that guy is inflating a huge pizza
  oh just get a wood fire oven just like that go fuck yourself
  just build one pleb
you enjoyed little caesers  where you live now has nothing but a mcdonalds and subway   the closest place for more is a 500 mile trip by boat or plane    fuck
  fucking nostalgia man i wish i had the problems of hs vs today back then it was my beater of a car the girl i was banging still trying to balance being cool while not shruging off my bros who were always there for me many played 40k and dd and other stupid shit     now im feeling that western society is about to go all day of the rope on each other that i shouldnt even bother having kids because lets face it they have no future and that fucking marxist bullshit is going to take us down that same shithole that so many societies were dragged down
  just save up like 600 and get a portbale one wait for it to get between 420470c with some good firewood and the pizza will be ready in 6090 sec got mine when i was im highschool moved to college since i was really poor in college at the time i made nothing other than just bread with the dough and some olive oil other times id make pizza when i had extra cash to buy san lorenzo tomatoes fiordelatte and basil leaves really easy ingredients for dough too just all purpose flour yeast water and salt simple ingredients and yet with proper fermentation and technique it still tastes 100 times better than that greasy disgusting garbage you call food
lc is garbage but its pretty decent garbage and definitely more palatable than dominos deep dish pizza is probably their best one out there      id rather drop dead at 45 than be the next one to beat stan lees lifespan record
  you literally dont have to talk to anyone it is 4chans dream
    lc employees dont work on tips
    still better quality than other major chains and they make their dough out of scratch onsite
too bad the pizza is shit  when i was in flyoverland i had a misfortune of being at an event where they ordered little caesars pizza and it was literally disgusting its honestly tough to find good pizza in the us outside of a few cities
  literally
  literally has evolved into meaning the following word or phrase is to be emphasized its literally how language works stop being obsessed with the fact everything evolves and progresses
  its literally how language works  its how 14 year old girls talk you faggot
  so language evolution generally originates with the youth it sure doesnt happen among knuckledragging fossils like you gramps
  5 and change    what the fuck is that supposed to mean
  language evolution generally originates with the youth    in other words the youth tend to make more mistakes than adults nobody disagrees with that the question is why do you want to coddle that crap rather than stamp it out     evolves over time  which is kind of stupid if you think about it the point of language is to convey information between different people if the language is changing that makes it less efficient at doing its intended job
  means 5 plus tax
little caesars is trash even compared to dominoes absolutely zero taste
  better than dominos    horseshit the pan pizza is literally the only good fast pizza available
  if you dont know how to use coupons maybe
  cheddar cheese pizza
  closest is 95 miles away  its not fucking fair
  and tip
someone please tell me what happened to /alc/
  not acceptable for 4channel
  i wonder how long before inflation forces lc to raise prices on these the amount of butthurt niggers will be tremendous worse than subway taking away 5 footlongs
  its literally how language gets destroyed stop taking words with specific meanings and using them to replace words that are perfectly adequate there is literally nothing wrong with the words really very utterly totally absolutely completely entirely intensely incredibly extremely immensely thoroughly etc
  4 for 4 at wendys with a double stack  fuck you
  as soon as america goes marxist there wont be any american imperialism to fuck up the classes society have faith anon and if im wrong well the world was going to shit long before any of us were alive
  honestly the only thing i would say is even comparable is red baron frozen pizzas those always go on sale so you can grab them for 4 a pie you just end up having to deal with frozen pizza instead of something thats remotely fresh
  youre not supposed to tip at cicis
  literally a pan pizza  call it deep deep dish  marketing
  600 can get you 120 pizzas from ceasers you stupid ugly bitch
  you know what youre talking about that fermentation you get when you properly let your dough rest for more than a day tastes so good
  chicagostyle isnt the only kind of deep dish anon  tradiitional pan pizza ie not the stuff you get from pizza hut is basically deep dish anyways
  im here for a good time not a long time
  5 plus more muslim lead actors

  because it was 30 years ago  its better now than it ever was

what goes in a great italian sandwich    also where do you stand with mayo/no mayo
no mayo plenty of vinegar though and oil i guess
  mayo spread thin
  this also banana peppers or giardiniera
mayo and oil kind of serve the same purpose so you dont need both  they coat the bread so it doesnt get soggy  that being said an italian sub should have oil
  no sandwich needs mayo if its too dry add mustard
well according to quiznos    capicola genoa salami ham pepperoni allnatural mozzarella black olives iceberg lettuce tomatoes onions red wine vinaigrette    i could do without the olives and add hot pepper spread id get one right now if there were still a quiznos anywhere near me that hasnt closed down
its called a hoagie faggets
  mustard is not oilbased and thus does not give the bread a seal of protection      not in america its not ya fackin queah
  love a good italian hot of course as for mayo yes i prefer mayo but really anything to make the bread moist therefor oil and vinegar also work which i put on my italian as well but on the lettuce mayo on bread
i love my sandwich artist shes so cute 
  ewww someone got touched in the naynay and has an axe to grind
  always have capicola and sundried tomato sandwiches one time i tried mayonnaise i had to scrape it off it fucking ruined everything  i love mayo though so i dont get it why doesnt it go with capicola
  mnigga
  based and herb pilled   got me a 12 pack of those
  always have capicola  what  capicola  what  gabagooooooooooooooooll
  italians
  what the fuck is a canye
anyone know what hots are actually called in the grocery store i recently bought pepper relish which is definitely not the same thing
  forgot the pic
  pickled peppers
  giardiniera  yes i am from chicago
  t peter piper
  answering questions nobody asked  you must be a girl
whats the difference between giardiniera and muffelletta salad
  kill yourself btw first tell me how you guys feel about the italian hero from subway
  typically more olives on a muffelletta but depending on the brands signature blend of ingredients either will hit the most important flavor notes if you need to substitute
  subway  its a yikes from me chief
  thanks for the tip
  i dont know what the fuck subway does to their bread but when you eat there thats literally all you can taste is bread and the smell gets absorbed into your skin and your clothes and all you do is smell like subway bread for the rest of the day
the best italian sandwich i ever had had chopped roasted red peppers and some balsamic vinaigrette soaked into the bread  for meat you need prosciutto capicola salami maybe some mortadella  absolutely no mayo ever
    italys got half of all of europes culture
  oh and some good provolone
  they probably blast it with bread fragrance
  thats kinda hot makes me wanna know their secret so i can use it on myself and rape an innocent woman or child so they smell like me for over 24 hours 
  is this sandwich technically a wrap
  iceberg lettuce  americans
  those are not the same thing
  thats salami
  banana peppers are pretty good some fresh jalapenos and alfalfa sprouts   as far as bread goes a nice sour dough or a buttermilk bread is good    im okay with mayo once in a while but greatly prefer sriracha mayo or dijon mustard but a thin layer of it
mayo makes the sub now i remember why i dont use /close/ anymore    fucking zoomed
  zoomers
  ham salami provolone lettuce/tomato/onion vinegar mixed italian herbs i dont like the texture of capicola on a sandwich mayo is fine it has a different texture to just putting oil so some prefer it giardiniera is good too if you have it
if you go to a wop store here and get a sangwich this is what you get  mortadella  salami  provolone  peppers in oil  onions   antipasto spread  served on a crusty bun
  fpbp
  italian dressing
  the only italian sandwich worthy of my palate is a muffaletta and that uses an olive tapenade as the condiment the northeast italian sandwiches can fuck right off
  italian sandwich    you mean a calzone
how do i make the red hots that go in italian sandwiches im somewhere they arent available and desperate to recreate them on my own
  this is true i worked with a girl years ago who worked part time at subway shed always come over reeking of subway bread though i know a girl who works there now and she doesnt smell like subway maybe its more ventilated or something
  happens with pizza places too i guess its because as dough ferments it creates gas with a distinct smell that starts to fill the restaurant and gets into everything inb4 brapposters
number 6 the antipasto   salami  prosciutto  pickled artichoke  danish feta  marinated olives  pickled giardiniera   sundried tomatoes  olive oil  fresh crunchy baguette sliced in half    number 7 the true mediterranean   sliced bocconcini   pepperoncini  kalamata olives  rocket   basil  pesto  olive oil  toasted olive bread centre slice
  whats the difference between giardiniera and muffelletta salad  giardinera is the type of salad where you have pickled peppers pickled celery carrots cauliflower if you trade out the greek pepperoncini or mild pepper for hot peppers that pack a punch to the pickled mix it becomes a hot giardinera the salad is usually big chunks/pieces drained out of the vinegar brine before serving it could be blended and put on a sub  muffaletta is more of a blended oily and chunky sandwich spread it is coarsely chunked black and green olives primarily in copious amounts of olive oil pickled and chopped pimentos etc this spread indeed is the byproduct of one single grocery deli in the french quarter the closest thing to it outside of his invention is the olive tapenade
you guys are all off course there is only one the italian stallion mortadella capicola soppressata pepperoni prosciutto and porketta  along with provolone mozzarella tomato onion greens vinaigrette italian peppers and mustard
  carmella can you get the gabagoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
itt american sandwiches    fuck the usa
  this stuff     
  mayo  if i want something white and creamy in my mouth ill buy a set of kneepads and start hanging out at truckstops after dark probably could pick up a few extra bucks for my troubles as well
  you mean a sangwich
why does everyone put sugar cured ham on italian subs instead of proscuitto or gabagool it doesnt go with the other ingredients at all
  ive never had a hoagie with sugary deli ham where the fuck are you getting your sandwiches
  literally every chain puts generic ham on their italian subs
  specifically pickled cherry peppers i chopped up some jarred whole cherry peppers and it was close enough maybe its a mix of chopped up cherry and jalapeno
  no vinegar olive oil and oregano on the roll
  no vinegar
  t atheist virgin from milan whos butthurt southern cuisine is objectively superior
  its all the bread sauce they put in it
  whatever the person at the italian deli puts in it
  answer me retards
  grow them or you find somewhere that will ship them to you jarred
i just had one of the best sandwiches of my life from subway    sunflower seed bread salami pepperoni shredded cheese toasted lettuce tomato spinach green pepper red onion and chipotle southwest dressing was fucking delicious pretty italian right
  toasting coldcuts
  no its like pickled peppers or something not a single vegetable i want a recipe for them
  not doing that  plen
ill be honest  i usually get both the olive oil for flavor and the mayo light mayo for a good creamy ness this is however for just any old sub shop super hipster artisanal meats and breads or old timer delis with high quality product the simpler the better and usually go sans mayo
roast beef debris poboy is better than any dago faggot sandwich any day  dressed of course
ctrlf  aioli  0 results    i am disappoint
the spicy italian from wawa is godtier and it has pepperoni ham salami provolone oil vinegar banana peppers and lettuce so thats it the perfect italian sandwich
  oil  vinegar  salami   banana peppers    the rest is up to you but if you dont at least have those 3 things you should be ashamed of yourself
  and by 3 i meant 4
  chopped up pickled cherry and jalapeno peppers
  i feel bad for you
i like to buy two hoagies one to eat immediately and then the other to sit in the frigdge for six hours for all the olive oil vinegar and mayo to mix     tastes good man

  im surprised there isnt any protein powder in that recipe must be for cheatdays
  protein powder wasnt invented until 2005
  when did /asp/ get its own memes different from /woo/
  considering beef consomme and eggprotein powders were already being consumed by bodybuilders in the 20th century thats false
  so after all these years we finally know that this whole timeis what the rock was cookin
  since a fat negro from newcastle obsessed with kevin nash to a very homoerotic degree made himself the biggest lolcow weve ever had
it just tastes like really really really hot mustard
scorpion peppers have the best flavor of any of the superhots outside of maybe 7 pot primos  ill shill a company called magic plant farms that will sell you at a really great price jars of scorpion puree which are amazing to use in sauces and particularly soups
  eh yeah but their is chinese hot mustard so i would just call it the hot sauce equivalent of that

most expensive spice in the world  smells of old leather and dusty books
  stop snorting crayons anon youre not in the usmc also drop the wacky tabaccy for a bit let your sense of smell return
  old leather and dusty books is aesthetic tastelet
  also this
  its expensive because its hard to cultivate not because its the best tard it takes a specific dish to use it well
  cultivate  hard to harvest if youre going to be specific
  1/2 a drop of red food colouring  a sock  wa la
  most expensive spice in the world  its 1 a jar at the supermarket because nobody buys it
  its factually not 1 anywhere in the world
  yeah thats typically safflower a substitute
  its not the most expensive   arguably dried fennel flower is its like 15 euros a 100g since it takes away the seed that farmers can dry and sell more economically
  one of the original memefoods bois
the effects are great   you feel happy and everything feels pleasant
  its 1 a jar at the supermarket because nobody buys it  why post lies
buy 25 grams of turkish saffron from a spice market while on holiday wto see my grandparents  cost 1 pound
  thinks he got a good deal because he bought dogshit turkish saffron instead of persian saffron
  why are you being racist against plants  it is a good deal you spaz
  another patrician aroma
  turkish saffon usually isnt genuine your good deal was most likely a ripoff
  what makes you think the saffron you buy in iran is always genuine with the influx of tourists plenty of bazaaris are peddling their shit product and labelling it as genuine
  i tested before i bought  it is a red strand which when placed on the tongue is slightly bitter and a bit floral  a few strands make a pot of rice bright yellow and give an extra dimension of flavour  its legit country of origin doesnt matter and the iranian embargo has caused a more drastic price inflation
  what makes you think the saffron you buy in iran is always genuine  ive never bought saffron in iran but im sure they have the same scams for tourists its just that turkey is more infamous for it    like anything else you need to be an educated consumer and know what the real thing looks smells and tastes like
  what do you mean effects
  its not a touristic area and i tested it  this is the same market my family go to every year to bulk buy spices they know us well and we even have a tea break with them while shopping  it may be cheap but its the first time ive seen it from the test its legit
  i tested before i bought  youre smarter than most    i find that they are usually pretty easy to tell apart visually real saffron looks like stamens fake saffron looks like tiny little strips the shape of the pieces is visibly different    anyway if you got the real thing then you did get a good deal but that said turkey is infamous for the sellfakesaffrontotourists scam
  forgetting the jar is the size of a thimble and at least 40 glass by volume as a result
what do you guys think of italian food im italianamerican and i think its based as fuck
every italian restaurant ive been to uses shit ingredients has rude staff and the atmosphere of a prison
italian food is pretty based most countries have shitty (((authentic food))) with the american version tasting better
its not bad but people who say they love italian food here mean that they like getting delivery pizza or making frozen lasagna
my only concept of italian food is tiramisu meringata and pasta someone recommend me some authentic italian to make     actually dont because i dont like olives and dont need to discover i hate an entire country worth of cuisine
  make osso buco
sunday gravy is the best beef pork beef vegetables beef all in a sauce i dont need the pasta awesome shit been to a lot of non chain italian restaraunts sit at the bar order a drink ask about sunday gravy inb4 they use old product yes yes yes i made my own it is great
  spaghelli and meatball  chicken parm  veal cutlets  ravioli  manicotti  stuffed shells  sausage pepper and onions   clams  antibast  mozz tomato basil   gabagool  vongole
italian food is ultra simple and i like how the cuisine focuses mainly on technique with very few ingredients per dish you need to do the technique properly though or else italians will seize up from sperg tantrums     heres some italians sperging about how people cant properly put garlic and olive oil on some boiled pasta     heres a cringey italian demonstrating proper pasta technique while shilling his sponsor never forget the pasta water 
this sausages look like sht
  they look like sausages im sure youll be fine op
  youre supposed to cook them first
  50 fat 50 unknown meat people will still eat it
  what you have there is adanastyle kebap on the left and fresh raw sausages on the right you need to cook them before eating them   which reminds me i have to swing over to the local magyar butcher and pick up some dry spicy horse sausages
why do they like coconuts so much
  imagine how theyd react to watermelon
  oh you
  being a racist in 2018     back to 4chan pal
  fresh young water coconuts are great  tasty creamy flesh refreshing water can fill it with other juices  plus you have to hit them violently to get what you want  i think they like to do that sort of thing
  ill end up on a watch list if i dont support the opinions of my masters    fuck off
  i miss barry
why are people predisposed to enjoy the food native to their surroundings
  im sure you do
  because on many south asian and pacific islands coconuts are the best source of safe drinking water on their tiny islands and thus probably highly regarded
  cant they plant one its been decades since they received those still no coconuts bunch of apes
  they dont have to plant them coconut trees will happen on their own if you let nature take its course
  theyd do a full blown chimpout
is japanese cuisine overrated everything involves some repetitive combination of sake miso daishi mirin and the subtle results border on blandness
  american japanese food is overrated like ramen sushi etc all that mainstream shit korean food basically covers the underrated japanese food considering japanese culture spreading through multiple invasions of korea and korea not using mainstream japanese dishes because its overrated and amerimutts will think they are the same food     in summary the mainstream food is vastly overrated and korean food is similar but different and summarizes the underrated japanese food you wont find at japanese restaurants

what are some good side dishes for steak
  fries
  beer
  its not rice and corn like you mentioned earlier fuck face
  this i also like bold flavored green vegetables like broccoli and asparagus a micro green garnish is pretty kino too
creamed spinach and loaded baked potato
  fries mashed taters scalloped potates garlic butter noodles baked potato maccheese mactomato corn on the cob baked beans green beans breadbutter garlic bread salad
fried eggs sunny side up
baked potato creamed spinach or kale sauteed mushrooms
  since its winter i would say oven roasted broccoli with any root vegetables with garlic is cheap and easy
  i have steak with my side dish all the time   lemon butter asparagus  twice baked potato  steamed carrots and honey  elotes
more steak duh
    ill have a steak medium and your finest jar of gerbers  right away sir
  for me its the fat of the steak i eat the meat first and save the fat for last and finish with it its almost dessert except i like it
  asparagus
  jelly beans and milk for a deconstructed milk steak
  eggs
  ctlf  no shrooms  seriously kill yourselves
i cant really imagine cooking steak and not deglazing the pan after and cooking some vegetables in that
  i would but i dont have any shrooms and i wanted to trip
other than what was already posted i kinda enjoy pan fried cumin/salt/pepper/garlic carrots
why did they change from cooler ranch to just cool ranch     did they become less cool
first post
  mandella effect  i dont ever remember it being cooler ranch
  you can clearly see the packaging
that was a limited time thing where they added more of the flavored powder to each chip
  zoomers  dont forget about nacho cheesier
for me its the old fashioned the best cocktail    how do you make yours bros what sort of whiskey do you use    1 sugar cube muddled with bitters or orange bitters  3 fingers of spicy bourbon or rye  1 ice cube  orange rind
  imho the old fashion is the most overrated cocktail its totally meme tier    still a good drink but there are much better out there desu
  like what
  cumshot
  for me the manhattan is the best cocktail
  no cherry    try again
  manhattan is just an old fashioned for women
  what did they call them when they were new
  but i am a cute woman
  i dont think its overtated no one but op seems to think its the best people like it because its so simple but still relatively tasty but nobody pretends that theres nothing better out there
  old fashioneds dont usually have cherries you uncultured nigger
  i like a bijou gin chartreuse sweet vermouth bitters negronis are also fantastic you know that one the lucien gaudin is good to gin cointreau campari and dry vermouth scofflaw is great for a sweet drink rye dry vermouth lemon and grenadine though i replace that with raspberry syrup    thats a little list of my usuals but i like old fashions from time to time to
  perhaps you should write to the iba and tell them that they are incorrect then
  iba  nobody gives a fuck
  cocktails  they were the first mixed drinks of the modern era in the late 1800s the word cocktail began to be more widely used as a generic term for mixed drinks and the original cocktail was given the name old fashioned
  e g g n o g
  i very fucking well might
  well let me know when they change their mind and i can stop correcting idiots who tell me that an old fashioned doesnt get a cherry
  make the drink how you want as long as theres bitters sugar and bourbon as the main ingredients its an old fashioned i made this thread to see how other people made theirs
  i make em like you sometimes ill sub the muddled sugar cube for a splash of ginger ale or use a piece of candied ginger at the bottom i think ginger adds an excellent twist to this old standby
  brandy old fashioneds are better
  i usually use quarter to half oz of sugar syrup more or less depending on how sweet the whiskey is  45 dashes of angostura  1 dash orange bitters  2 oz whiskey agree w/ op spicy whiskeys are great  big ice ice cube  one spin with a spoon  express an orange peel over the top and rub around rim then dropped in if im feeling fancy  ive done it with sugar cubes but i like more consistency in the sweetness  old fasioned is probably my favorite if i end up not liking a new whiskey that ive tried on its own its usually still pretty good in an old fasioned
  i normally make it that way typically use buffalo trace since its cheap but good for the price    hosting a christmas dinner party in a few weeks though so will make some a christmas version replace the sugar with a spiced syrup that has star anise clove cinnamon and nutmeg in it
  buffalo trace is one of my favorites as well    angostura has clove and nutmeg already i think if you wanted some anise flavor you could add some peychauds bitters  and then for the cinnamon just use fireball instead of your regular whiskey
    these are interesting takes ill have to give these a try     i havent found anything better to use in an old fashioned yet besides bulleit rye i love buffalo trace but i think its a bit too sweet with the sugar
  and then for the cinnamon just use fireball  good fucking lord whatever you do dont do this
  yeah fireball would be wayyyy too sweet i wonder if you used a little instead of the sugar with your regular whiskey and the bitters i mentioned if it would be better than just adding some ground cinnamon
  muddling cinnamon up with the bitters and sugar sounds interesting im gonna try that tonight
  flips are by far the most partisan style of cocktail
  i dont have any whiskey in the house rn otherwise id try it too    ive only got white rumtried that in an old fashioned oncereally really bad
  duh you retard what did you expect
  i had a rum old fashioned in a bar once and it was good  i dont know what they did different
  it is on the sweeter side i have a bottle of bulleit rye that i picked up really cheap but typically rye is not good value in the uk so im more inclined to keep that for myself as i dont want to have to buy more         i dont think id buy a bottle of fireball when i could just use what i already have in the cupboard i also dont own all those bitters  makes more sense to just use what i have
  firstly they did not use white rum second they were a bartender who knows how to balance a cocktail not some bumbling diy badoon
  ill have you know that ive read liquid intelligence and i make up cocktails all the time
margaritas are the best cocktail real margaritas not that applebees ice cream shit
  my uncle in law gave me a bottle of his distillerys version of fireball not sure why he didnt give me their whiskey which i like so i have to find ways to get through it    you should definitely get some angosturawhat do you make an old fashioned with now peychauds i havent found something its good in desu yet
  k that doesnt mean they are good reading a memeteir cocktail book does not make you a professional
  out of curiosity what do you put in yours i do    juice of 1 lime  tequila  contreau   splash of grand monier  agave
  trips of faggitude my dude
  i was disappointed in how much information is in liquid intelligence if you take out the weird stuff that no one is going to do like repurposing a blood centrifuge you could condense the book into a trifold pamplhet
  i bet you only go to obscure venues you fuckin hipster
  i have pic related     i switch between orange old time aromatic and jerry thomas for old fashioned the celery and creole dont really get used i need to pick up angostura though
  forgot pic
  want to know how i knew it was memetier without reading it because ive never heard of it   want something interesting try the art of the shim
  why is that anon a hipster because he mentioned drinks youve never heard of
  ive always wanted to make a traveling bar in a briefcase that i can take to parties and sperg out making cocktails for people
  looks cool thanks for the rec
  old fashioneds are perfectly fine but i wouldnt call it the best its just a solid foundational structure to build around and out from once you get the basics theres so many different cocktails out there that i cant even list them all but at least these have a permanent place in my home bar recipe book    oldfashioned  manhattan  whiskey sour  mint julep  sazerac  rob roy  boulevardier  negroni  gin  tonic  tom collins  martini  gimlet  aviation  singapore sling  french 75  margarita  paloma  tequila sunrise  daiquiri  mojito  dark  stormy  mai tai  pina colada  hurricane  zombie  black russian  white russian  bloody mary  moscow mule  screwdriver  sidecar  vieux carre      inb4 alcoholic
  shims are a good challenge can you make something that doesnt rely heavily on booze of course you can make a flavored fix and add soda easiest trick in the book now try to make a shim without relying on citrus and bubbles
then comes the zenith of mans pleasure then comes the julep  the mint julep who has not tasted one has lived in vain the honey of hymettus brought no such solace to the soul the nectar of the gods is tame beside it it is the very dream of drinks the vision of sweet quaffings    the bourbon and the mint are lovers in the same land they live on the same food they are fostered the mint dips infant leaf into the same stream that makes the bourbon what it is the corn grows in the level lands through which small streams meander by the brookside the mint grows as the little wavelets pass they glide up to kiss the feet of the growing mint and the mint bends to salute them gracious and kind it is living only for the sake of others like a womans heart it gives its sweetest aroma when bruised among the first to greet the spring it comes beside gurgling brooks that make music in the fields it lives and thrives when the bluegrass begins to shoot its gentle sprays towards the sun mint comes and its sweetest soul drinks at the crystal brook it is virgin then but soon it must be married to old bourbon his great heart his warmth of temperament and that affinity which no one understands demands the wedding
  how shall it be take from the cold spring some water pure as angels are mix it with sugar till it seems like oil then take a glass and crush your mint within it with a spoon  crush it around the borders of the glass and leave no place untouched then throw the mint away  it is the sacrifice fill with cracked ice the glass pour in the quantity of bourbon which you want it trickles slowly through the ice let it have time to cool then pour your sugared water over it no spoon is needed no stirring allowed just let it stand a moment then around the brim place sprigs of mint so that the one who drinks may find the taste and odor at one draft    then when it is made sip it slowly august suns are shining the breath of the south wind is upon you it is fragrant cold and sweet  it is seductive no maidens kiss is tenderer or more refreshing no maidens touch could be more passionate sip it and dreamit is a dream itself no other land can give you so much sweet solace for your cares no other liquor soothes you in melancholy days sip it and say there is no solace for the soul no tonic for the body like old bourbon whiskey
  a reasonable list some weaknesses some omissions but on the whole pretty good
  i like this
    im using this thread to culture myself on how to properly drink alcohol ive been drinking nothing but gin straight like a bum cant stand the taste of whiskey/vodka drank that straight for so long that i gag at the prospect of even holding a bottle of the stuff
  professional  lmao bartending is barely a step above washing dishes
  not having an old smashioned
  the only time ive had a real old fashioned i feel like i was too drunk to really remember whether i liked it or not
  
  tried the xmas old fashioned  2oz old overholt rye  75oz cinnamon liqueur  2dashes peychauds  4dashes angostura  rim rubbed and muddled rosemary sprig    not too bad but i think i should have gotten a better whiskey maybe need something smoother for this
for me its coquito season
  bitters  cherry  toasted orange rind  colorado whiskey    the old fashioned is basically the fedora of alcohol
oldfashioned is an adjective not a noun it describes making a true cocktail the oldfashioned way     a cocktail is a type of sling aromatized with bitters a sling is any spirit slightly diluted slightly sweetened and aromatized what its aromatized with determines what type of sling it is    a traditional sling is aromatized with spice usually nutmeg   toddy is a sling aromatized with citrus zest   cocktail is a bittered sling   julep is a sling aromatized with herbs   cobblers are slings served with ice in them the top of which is cobbled with fruit   there are also wine slings a cup is a charged wine ling    the original definition of the word cocktail was a horse good enough for racing but not a thoroughbred     think of liquor by itself served neat in the glass as a thoroughbred a cocktail has that same amount of liquor with just enough water dilution to open up the flavor just enough sugar to round out the flavor and just enough bitters to mitigate the harshness of the ethanol on the nose a properly made cocktail will not mask the character of the liquor its good enough for the race but not a thoroughbred
to make a whiskey cocktail the oldfashioned way set out an oldfashioned or rocks tumbler add    1 lump of sugar la perruche pure cane sugar cubes are perfect for this size does not matter  2 dashes 1/4 tsp angostura aromatic bitters  1/4 oz water    muddle the above ingredients into cocktail water without fully dissolving the sugar add    1 ice cube 1 1/4 per side  1 jigger 2 oz whiskey  2nd ice cube historically rare but recommended    garnish with a lemon zest with minimal pith cut about 1 x 3 twisting zestsidedown over the drink to express the oil rubbed on the rim and put into the drink    insert a demitasse spoon into the drink take a sip if more sweetness is desired stir the drink
for me its the jet pilot the best tiki drink
  what the fuck is a finger of alcohol
  2oz tequila  1oz cointreau  1oz lime juice  i like to keep things simple
  after 1855 water and ice became industrialized it was also the beginning of refrigeration so suddenly bartenders can use water and sugar to make simple syrup or gum syrup and not have to worry about quick spoilage     they can also use lots of ice to chill drinks and serve them straightup in a chilled stemmed cocktail glass     to make a whiskey cocktail the modern way set out a mixing glass a pint glass will work add    2 dashes 1/4 tsp angostura aromatic bitters  1 tsp simple syrup 11 sugar/water ratio  1 jigger 2 oz whiskey    fill glass at least 2/3 full with ice smaller cubes of about 3/4 per side work best    stir for at least 30 seconds to mix and chilldilute without letting aeration bruise the velvet of the liquor    strain into a chilled cocktail goblet and garnish with a lemon zest with minimal pith cut about 1 x 3 twisting zestsidedown over the drink to express the oil rubbed on the rim and put into the drink
  try them side by side although both methods are enjoyable i feel the modern whiskey cocktail is better than the oldfashioned whiskey cocktail if properly stirred it will be icecold being served without ice it never grows more diluted if consumed in the traditional threeorfour gulps it doesnt have time to get warm    some 20 years or so after this post 1855 method someone must have asked for a whiskey cocktail but made the oldfashioned way eventually this just became the name of the drink itself
i usually sub the sugar and orange rind for cointreau
  in the measurement of distilled spirits two fingers of whiskey refers to the amount of whiskey that would fill a glass to the level of two fingers wrapped around the glass at the bottom

hows does one make a garlic bread im tired of eating the packaged shit i buy from the supermarket any recipes or tips thanks in advanced
it is as simple as toasting bread butter it and sprinkle garlic powder on the bread
  toast bread cut a garlic clove in half and rub the cut side onto the bread after that you can put butter or oil if you want or cheese etc    
compound butter with garlic parsley salt pepper optional basil  even better use roasted garlic  get a baguette and slice in half lengthwise spread butter on and bake    or you just make bruschetta which contrary to popular belief is not tomato shit you put on toast by cutting ciabatta into slices broiling it until as brown as you like it and then rubbing each slice with cloves of garlic while the bread is hot and then drizzling with olive oil salt and pepper and a sprinkle for chopped parsley
did you try using the recipe you stupid baby
  most of them dont use a bread maker and i wanna make it from scratch
  most of them  so some of them do great job
  garlic powder  fucking shameful
    bro i need to read this comic
i made a pretty tasty version of a recipe i found of youtube   but i used those bread rolls rhodes brand  after they thawed and risen i flattened them out brushing a compound butter like mentioned above on each piece then sprinkled some shredded parm cheese on   turned my bread pan on its long side and started stacking  pic related is the final product and it turned out great  if your interested ill find the video and link it for you but she made her dough from scratch if i remember correctly
  then you might as well make old school dominos breadsticks with extra pesto garlic butter if anyone finds the recipe make a thread
      best way imo would be to rub the halved garlic clove on bread add butter and then toast it in the oven  another way to do would be to make garlic butter spread it on bread and then toast it in the oven grind some garlic soften butter in the microwave/a pan and mix those a nice touch for your garlic butter for your bread or eaten with meat is to add a little spoon of dijon mustard to it
  get some bread and put garlic in it like wtf nigga
  go back to 1995 with your shit pic and dubs faggot
  same to  sauce
  garlicbreadblender
  make some garlic butter  put garlic butter on bread  put bread in oven for a bit
      get jiro    written by anthony bourdain  post apocalyptic foodie dystopia worth it
  dude what the fuck lol
  this is good stuff   i do the steps a little different though  butter white bread  sprinkle garlic power salt and pepper on the butter  watch that it doesnt burn under the broiler
  thats so weird i am actually writing a graphic novel about post apocalyptic foodies    although the story focuses on a duo traveling from canada to mexico so they can try fresh coffee rather than instant coffee which is all they had been exposed to    food after shit hits the fan is a really interesting topic with a lot to write on
sorry but were out of hot sauce at the moment  if you want to i can pinch you with some trongs while you eat instead   how do you reply
y or n
  no thanks bring me a cup of honey mustard if you have it
no thank you this is america ill use utensils but theyre in the kitchen so no harm no foul    
  poop scoop wooptywoop
  this guy is a poetand none of you even know it
bump
  huhhhh 
  stoner invention so they wont get chicken grease on their weed
  i dont get it how does not having hotsauce equal needing tongs
  here is the attention you wanted op
  i might have made it a bit unclear my point was to pick on spicy food lovers by equalizing the pinch of a sharp object with the spicy sensation hot food gives you
    am i too complex for complex huh they say he cannot relate he been outta touch
  if you touch me ill fucking kill you
  but if theres no sauce youre less likely to need tongs not more likely
  why not just use chopsticks
  will my mom likes these for xmas she doesnt like chicken wings but has these
goddamn this thread is an embarrassment
  i think youre too dumb to make analogies much less jokes
  then why is this thread still up
be me  go to wing stop  ii dont like spicy food iit hurts my mouth do you have any suggestions  stupid bitch actually suggests grilled unsauced chicken wings grilling it would cause it fucking burn my mouth  managed to outsmart staff and other customers ask for raw chicken covered in mayonnaise sauce with a glass of milk they all look in envy
  blow your brains out
  based
  same reason why jack threads stay up to laugh at your incompetence
  i apologize for giving you an impossible task
  pretty fun idea but instead could you sign that pepper allowing me to bring my own sauces when eating here     dinning experience improved forever  profit 
would you rather a grilled cheese by itself or coupled with delicious soup a friend and i need to settle an argument
  you and your friend need to kill yourselves
  honestly a piece of thin cut ham in between and that soup can fuck itself
  not a grilled cheese anymore im afraid what you would have there is accurately known as a melt
  soup tomato
  picture was more for reference than anything but id love to know if youre in the soup department or not
grilled cheese fucking sucks
no tomatoe it makes it wet
  anything recommended to be done with turkey
good with tomato soup but a lot tart i might add half water next time
  grilled cheese with mushroom soup thank me later
  on white bread it doesnt need anything but on whole wheat/sprouted grain i find it a bit dry and the soup helps
  liking copy pastas  being over twelve years old
  what we have here is accurately known as a faggot
  grilled cheese and tomato bisque dont eat either without the other
  cheese and toasted bread are both common ingredients in soup its only rational they be paired with a soup or salad    dipping grilled cheese in soup that can maintain its flavor is highly rational
grilled cheese with tomato and oregano
grilled cheese is best paired with a creamy tomato and roast red pepper soup any additional ingredents in the grilled cheese like pesto for instance enhances the sandwich but ruins the pairing
does it still count as a proper grilled cheese if you make it in a press or do you guys only pan fry it
  more like a failure to communicate
  tuna melt with lentil soup for a proper luncheon
  heh gotem
mmm here you go anon a white cheddar and bacon melt on pumpernickel served with a hearty bowl of red potato and leek soup skins on of course
  i dont understand that sounds delicious
  by itself  eating a sandwhich and dipping it into soup is a white people thing
  put ham and bechamel in it then put bechamel on top of it
  did you put it in the oven after putting on the bechemel if you pan fried it i dont understand how you got that texture
  the broiler
  this it is the proper way
  ah makes sense
unsure why americans tout a cheese toastie with tomato soup as some kind of culinary apex the only reason its even in your diet is to fulfil nutrition requirements for school lunches  arent you getting a little proud over nothing isnt it more a statement about the state of the public schooling there whats the deal
  what the fuck are you talking about no schools serve grilled cheese and no school especially serves soup    its not a culinary apex its a classic appreciated specifically for its simplicity and how extreme the ratio between ease of making it and general quality of one is
  op here i am canadian didnt get the ole school lunches where i grew up i just think a grilled cheese is infinitely better with a bit of soup
  no school serves grilled cheese and tomato soup  when / where did you go to school grilled cheese and tomato soup is a common school item kcollege
  id rather just have soup with bread and butter
  not everyone goes to a middle class to upper class school that gives them tomato soup au fo crouix a l a penne queso
  its just a big bag of tomato soup they buy american cheese and a panini press or skillet continually cooking them up easier than burgers harder than hot dogs but only marginally
  either plain grilled cheese with mayo and jalapenos or a classic one with a chicken noodle maybe fuck tomato soup
  my point is that poor or average joe places would rather serve frozen patties
  looks fried not grilled to me
  not sure what kind of rant this is for one criticism of our public school lunches means they really dont get hot soup lol  cheese toastie  no one said apex you another trash bong upset the tomato soup doesnt fit in the munchie box
  youre a fucking melt anon
  and im saying youre wrong even the 90 black public school in greenville nc i went to around 1999 had grilled cheese    grilled cheese and tomato soup is literally cheaper than premade frozen burger patties and uses the exact same tools to make
  1999  are you a fucking idiot or what fuck off already man comparing your 1999 experience to anything is fallacious quality food does not go to black public schools let alone schools that arent in middle class or above areas
  grilled cheese and tomato soup isnt quality food its exactly the same cheap tier as frozen burger patties
  it wasnt a rant it was a genuine question aussie so boong not bong id heard a couple accounts of this being a school lunch and wondered the connection maybe its a limited thing americas a big ass place
  
  pumpernickel grilled cheese  forbidden
american cheese  dipped in soup i like manhattan clam chowder or turtle soup  meunster or smoked gouda  just sandwich
  grilled cheese and tomato soup isnt quality food  how so  tomato soup could be anything from shittier canned trash to mouthgasmic likewise for the bread    now i certainly dont expect a school cafeteria to make exceptional tomato soup but to claim that grilled cheese and tomato soup cant be quality food is retarded depending on the care allotted to its preparation its freshness and the quality of the ingredients used to make it it could be anywhere on the spectrum from garbage to quality like any other food really
reminder that emmental is the most supremely underrated filling for grilled cheese also reminder that theres no shane adding tomato sauce pesto or even sweet chili thai to a grilled cheese
  theres no shane  shane disagrees
  like i said in a previous post they just buy three ingredients huge bags of tomato soup american singles and white bread its cheaper than cheeseburgers
  that particular incarnation of the dish sounds revolting    you could make it entirely from scratch and it would still cost less than cheeseburgers theres no excuse for that sad bullshit
  right but people arent specifically romanticizing the fucking dogshit school lunches just the combination of tomato soup and grilled cheese which is a fantastic pairing assuming the two individually are of any quality whatsoever a soup and sandwich is already a lunch plate and tomato soup is the single best soup to pair with grilled cheese
  roast tomatoes with a bit of olive oil  blend  add some chicken stock if too thick  add whatever seasonings you like and a bit of cream  tomato soup is super easy
  where the fuck is the roasted red pepper you cuck plain tomato is depressing
  its super easy when you make it super crappy      i agree the red pepper is a must but be careful with it too much can easily dominate
with beans in tomato sauce pls
  sure i agree i was arguing with the guy saying that kids nowadays dont get grilled cheese and tomato soup for lunch unless youre upper middle class that shit is dirt cheap and theyve been serving it as a cheap lunchroom fare since the 90s at least all over the us
  im a filthy leaf nigger our schools dont even have food for sale
    its the base of a recipe you twats
how do you eat your burgers /ck/ are you hold them low and lean to eat them or you raise burgers right up to your face
  
i like to meet my burgers in public places so they dont make a scene when we break up
  low and leaned over the plate
  grandma always ate her hamburgers upsidedown as in she held it with the top bun facing down and the flatter bottom bun up top got so mad at her  now i do it once in a while and dont notice maybe after so many hamburgers in your life or years in your life you just forget about it
above my head i keep my mouth open and let it drop right in
  t wimpy
  i deconstruct them
  i also eat my hamburgers upsidedown i think its mostly because the slideier toppings are always on the top and so i prefer to apply pressure to the more solid bottom bun instead
  any burger where you have to work out how to logistically get it into your face with the least possible mess is a fucking shit burger  a good burger you should just be able to eat with minimal fuss
  i debling and do the hunch
  depends on their size i guess ones i make at home are a lot smaller so i lift them but when i go out and splurge on a huge one i cut them in half and dip down to fight it on its own level
top bun down eating each topping with a fork and knife
lift to face burger upside down
    i bet u eat ur fukn noodles upside down 2 plebz
touching your burger  i unhinge my jaw and eat the entire burger right off the table in one go
if you cant cook proper cuisine over a campfire like these dudes then youre not a real chef

im looking for the secrets of the pizza dough ingredients proportions  hydratation of the dough  what kind of flour  add any sugar or oil  thanks
  what kind theres multiple types of crusts ranging from cracker like to breadlike to almost a pastry piecrustchicago tomato pie
  anon dont be autistic its clear op is talking about a normal pizza crust not your faggy hipster shit
500g flour  300ml water i prefer slightly less  5g fresh yeast  2 tsp salt    knead with machine for 20 minutes let rise for two hours separate into portions let individua portions rise in the fridge for another 6 hours
  separate into portions  divide into portions ca 6 fuck
  secrets of the pizza dough  1 high hydration   51   2 low yeast / long slow fermentation   1 yeast   24 hour initial ferment in fridge   24 hour dough ball ferment in fridge after initial ferment    those two factors were the most important to master to get a pizza dough right for your kitchen/flour/oven combo
  kind of pizza where the crust is honeycombed      haha he was right to ask      so its 60 hydratation for your recipe i knead with hand hope ill get results      51 is high hydratation  for bread its medium i guess high is above 70  thanks for the low yeast tip i have made sourdough but ill keep it only for bread maybe because it use special kind of flour maybe not good for pizza because i read that pizza need not complete floor    ill try pizza on the wood oven sometimes but other times on electric oven with pizza stone so maybe your recipe is good for both
  i knead with hand  the recipe where i got that from said explicitly you can pretty much forget about hand kneading but i guess you can try of course i use my bread machine when i make that dough it is really fluffy light and delicous though
  this ive been making my pizza dough for years and have come to the same conclusion if youre going to make dough like this you need to invest in a good pizza stone too
long ferment up to a couple of days and and extreme heat from both the bottom and top    i usually fry without oil the laid out pizza on the stove then i put it directly under the preheated grill element in the oven keep the oven door open so the heating element is turned on all the time
  kneating is important for the springyness of the dough to create air pockets within else you end up with a very dense crust
  two 24 hour fermentation periods have you tried just 24 hours if so can you really tell the difference
  have you tried just 24 hours  yes much better results in my home oven after giving the individual pizza dough portions another 24 hours to ferment before rolling them out on day 3 for cooking
  different recipes yield different textures even what one considers normal another may hold a different idea as to what their normal is
  also a scale of some sort when it comes to breads the recipes tend to press the fact that it is necessary to get exact weights and measurements and using things such as cups and tea/table spoons can throw the result a bit off
  kneating  please do us a favor and kill yourself
  says who
  normal pizza crust at pizza hut is oily and almost seems deep fried    normal pizza crust at papa johns is doughy and looks baked rather than fried    normal pizza crust at sbarros is thin and huge similar to a new york slice
  fast food pizza  opinion disregarded
  normal pizza crust at pizza hut  isnt
  true but they do have a point that there are people out there that confuse shitty chain pizza dough with normal so they may be looking for a recipe to a specific shitty chain pizza dough rather than a real normal pizza dough
if you want to try something different try a scone base    blend in butter into plain flour until it resembles fine breadcrumbs add just enough milk for it to form a smooth dough    you get a very rich slightly crumbly base
  scone base  fuck off bong having said that the scone dough is similar to the pastry pie crust used for chicago style tomato pie
    its a bit similar but it doesnt rise and uses milk over water so you get a denser more brittle crust
  this gives a thin crust with some irregular airy bubbles  175 cups 00 flour  5 tsp salt  25 cups 100 hydration sourdough starter  75 cups lukewarm water  1 tsp evoo  combine and knead for 8 minutes let rise at room temp for 46 hours form into tight ball and place in a well oiled bowl covered with plastic wrap and let ferment in the refrigerator 2472 hours longer the better
  try this recipe from americas test kitchen the cut off page says knead on a floured surface form into a ball place into an oiled non reactive bowl and cover for 152 hrs then press to deflate and its ready to use   if making by hand omit step 2  combine salthalf the flour i shake it in a ziplock for uniformity add the remaining flour until a cohesive mass forms turn onto floured surface and knead for 78 mins using as little flour as possible form the dough ball place into oiled bowl cover with plastic wrap i guess wait the 15 hrs again it was good
  so then are you using all the portions on the 2nd day if not how long will they last if i let it ferment for 3 days i can start to detect an alcohol aroma
  i make my own was just using chain restaurants as an example      not everyone cooks and really cares that pizza hut pizza crust isnt your average normal pizza crust      thank you
  lmao nah
make sure the flour youre using is 00
  using2nd  nope i either use it the next day or freeze it  how long will they last   yeast flour type humidity temp recipe blah blah blah 4 days easy in the fridge couple of months in the freezer    i dont recall ever getting an alcohol smell from anything i let ferment in the fridge but id try it regardless should be fine    youve really got to experiment with your setup / flour and shit to get it where you want it but if you put in the effort itll be better than any pizza delivery / syscotrasharaunt shit in your area
  make sure the flour youre using is 00  nope    standard ap or bread flour is better for the average low temp home oven 00 is better for high temp applications
im the op thanks for evyrone answers i have found a video on youtube that seems to give good results considering all of explanations given by the guys whos making it         so tipo 0 maybe for electric oven and 00 for wood oven 
hestons pizza dough is my jam 1/2
  1/2
  2/2
  really really nice recipe thanks
  00 for wood oven   what ive been told is that 00 is meant for high temperature wood fired ovens and wont brown properly at lower temps without sugar added which i refuse to do while ap and bread flour cook too fast at higher temps but fine at lower temps
  2 cups flour  1 tablespoon yeast  1/4 teaspoon salt  1 tablespoon sugar  2/3 cup lukewarm water  plus an additional 2 tbsp    mix 1 cup of flour with all other ingredients  gradually add 2nd cup of flour until it forms a ball use your hands to form and knead the dough  let the dough rest 1015 minutes in a bowl covered with a dish towel or saran to keep it warm  spread out onto greased pizza pan and top with your favorite toppings  bake at 375 degrees for approximately 15 minutes

  no the point is to save money so you can afford to retire  you naive fuck no one is retiring and your savings will be redistributed among the proletariat once whites are no longer the majority youre planning for a future that will not exist
  why take out your frustrations on folks who had nothing to do with this situation why not key his car or slash his tires
  i guess thats one possible future but in that possible future were all fucked whereas in the many other more likely possible futures retirement savings arent plundered and i can retire so im going to plan for that because if im right then i can retire and if im wrong then im in the same situation anyway

invited to parents house for dinner  drive into their upscale cookie cutter development  we got a chili casserole tonight  ground beef can of beans packet of chili seasoning topped with white sandwich buns and slices of american cheese  heres some chocolate milk that always was your favorite  is it real milk  of course son its chocolate milk  look at ingredients  first two are water and high fructose corn syrup    i love my parents but goddamn boomers are retarded
  not even any maters
  waters good for you and so are vegetables like cornwhats wrong with that
  my parents are like this too they want to eat natural but still eat shit i grab all my food local sourced and they scoff that it takes me an hour to cook my from scratch meal
  vegetables   corn
  its because when they grew up there was no such thing as chocolate milk that wasnt chocolate milk they seem to have no idea about all the industrialization of the food supply that took place across 50 years that kept food prices pretty much flat for their entire lifetimes
  is it real milk  im pretty sure they were correct when they said it was real anon
  nothing is more boomer than a crisp refreshing coca cola classic
  dont worry my dad was enjoying one during dinner probably his second or third today

  soys east asian you a chink
  going on a crosscountry road trip through the american west in a classic car  i dont care how boomer it is this is one of my main bucket list items
boomers have no idea how to cook the boomer idea of a meal is the most boring generic meat and potatoes garbage and just massive servings of slop for your fatass my parents have never mad any ethnic dish ever no indian thai chinese japanese proper mexican etc its literally all just oh heres a fucking dry ass meatloaf or a plain ass stew once in a while
sausage gravy  casserole  macaroni salad  meat loaf   anything made in a slow cooker
  lmao why are boomers hell bent on turning 100 even if they cant eat salt did they never deal with existential crisis in their youth my grandpa fried chicken and smoked cigarettes and died happy
  that wasnt chicken anon  that was chicken heads
  30  coke  not beer  im assuming youre a female
boomer tries to eat healthy  saturates it in a disgusting soy oil concoction
  omg yasss nothing like knocking back a few brewskies after a long day in the office

  walmart as a scientific source
  zucchini bread and granola are both boomer foods invented in the 60s that are supposed to be health foods but are not any better for you than just eating candy
  canned shit
    i dont get this meme why are they wearing underpants on their heads
my family has always eaten zucchini bread and we just thought it was a weird pound cake thing i had no idea anyone considered it anything other than a dessert    
  is kroger better
toast sandwich
tunas real good for ya  slathers gobs of mayo on it
  hey anon come eat some salad its healthy  literally egg or potato salad  nothing makes me gag more
this thread is literal cancer
tonight im making my signature dish
you know its funny i consider myself an avid cook but i still learn something new every day from my parents i guess it helps that all three of us are boomers they just have a 20 year head start on me    children always want to eat fast food and frozen dinners  we personally discuss homemade meals like pork ribs freshly made bread in a dutch oven and even delicious december prime rib    theres a magic to having everything come together perfectly
milk is mostly water dumbass
  occasionally my parents make japanese curry but vehemently insist all curry is indian
  thats true i guess at the very least they didnt have the fortified fake shit we have now i swear millennials are the first generation to understand nutrition       nah white american with no strong ethnic food ties my mother just never really learned to care about the food on a scientific level
  that sounds great you ungrateful faggot i hope at least your boyfriend appreciated it
  you zoomers are the most ungrateful faggots ever god damn if you can do so much better then do it yourself     fuck you guys i cant wait for the internet to collapse and disappear so you all freak out and kill yourselves or get killed by the elements
  i like how happy boomer wojack looks in every picture like you can talk as much shit as you want but at least boomers are actually happy and spending their time with their friends talking about the past and enjoying actual recreational activities
  you zoomers are the most ungrateful faggots ever  i was thinking the same thing
  its insane  its like the internet has made knowlege so much more accessable and its easier for people to interact and learn from eachother but these fucking zoomers they are like the new wave of hipsters but its worse because they think they are too good for things hipsters like like modern creature comforts and call it juvenile but they also think they are too good or advanced to do things the good old fashioned way    and they bitch about there not being a real culture in america when they are literally killing it     but kids have always been that way i guess dismissing the old way of doing things but also not conforming with the new ways of doing things
  mac n cheese
  nice reddit spacing
  what is reddit spacing like just making a space between sentences i dont see the big deal if i didnt do the spaces youd literally just respond   wall of text  or  tldr
  wait so were you drinking yoo hoo or something what is labeled as chocolate milk yet isnt    also the most boomer shit is fat free food because no matter how many times they hear how that doesnt help you lose weight it was drilled into their heads when they were in their 20s that fat is bad they think if you go for more than 8 hours without eating you will pass out or something so they eat all the time and its all low fat bullshit which is why every single boomer has some kind of metabolic disorder  i recently visited my boomer parents  go out to eat lunch   come home still full as hell  they start cooking dinner of a full fucking roast potatoes green beans cornbread  wait is that for tomorrow  they just stared at me like i was retarded
  they realize what idiots they were when theyre old enough to experience what they are doing now of course this doesnt apply to everyone
    reddit spacing  a double carriage return after each sentence
  yeah of course i was generalizing a big problem i think nowadays is everybody and everything is labled now so its putting people in all these boxes that they probably dont even belong in     i think in the 80s the whole grouping of people really became apparent but the thing about it was something like being a goth didnt completely define a person and we as a people and culture knew that back in the day people just were who they were granted people obviously will always follow groups its just the natural human way but the group didnt define you     nowadays people are so dependant on the validation of their peers through dopamine feedback loops that they cant be happy until they get the validation and if they dont get validation they further remove indiviual charactaristics of themselves to match the status quo where before people just did what makes them feel good    i think women are a great example of this back in the day a woman was allowed to be strong and sexy and confident nowadays a strong sexy confident woman isnt allowed openly without an agenda because it puts those 3 things above other women who arent as lucky to be strong sexy or confident and nowadays when you be yourself its seen as insulting or threatening to others the stacy and chad memes are 100 prime examples of this way of thinking
  oh i just think it makes sense to type like that in regular speech you pause after statements to give the person a chance to respond or add input you dont just ramble off the entire point in this form of communication it makes sense to space out certain points call it reddit or whatever but walls of text are turn offs
  banana bread is fucking based though
    imagine actually being this stupid
  i think you could narrow it down to being passive aggressive assholes with a good deal of narcissism mixed in
  paragraphs arent reddit spacing 11545343 is just a butthurt idiot
  imagine thinking this is intelligent
  chili casserole    hubby and the kids love it
  its pretty accurate though i mean im not sure how old you are but its plainly obvious the direction the younger generation is going with how they pass knowlege and how they aquire information and what they choose to or choose not too interact with       i think youre correct in a sense social media while it has made us more interconnected it has also made people more idk what word to use timid i guess when it comes to confronting one another about issues they may have with one another     like even something that literally requires human interaction like dating is being done digitally people are breaking up with one another through text its really quite bizarre
  not him but i fucking chug water when im working out in the heat when i get home i like to sip a coke through crushed ice  the marketing got me i guess but pepsi markets hard and that shit sucks
  when im hungover in the morning a nice tall cold ass can of coke really does hit the spot
  question is how were they all so fucking skinny compared to young adults today eating what they ate i know they got fat but i mean 1535 year olds seem way fatter now than then  lots of cigarettes
  not bad to have on hand for emergencies and ive honestly had some stuff that was too bad canned corn nibs seem okay for some reason just heated up in the microwave with some salt seasoning and butter as a fast side on a tired night  whoever decided asparagus in a can was okay should be vilified though
  cocaine  aerobics  rocky movies

  unironically true
  then do it yourselves  we literally do
  water does exist yes
  thats just british
  cringe
  before the internet people actually met up to do real physical activities
  people actually left their house and moved around
  slow cookers are fine as long as the shit you put in is fresh
i see alot of posts about this and it just seems like that in the absence of an actual culture and people the americans just go with the flow its a life someone like me could not even imagine how horrifyingly dystopic
  kids used to play outside with shitloads of physical activity now they are glued in front of a console/pc for the entirety of their free time add to it that women used to do the cooking but now women no longer do that since bossman wants them working 60 hrs a week
my gfs dad used to be an obese megacatholic but then he changed and only eats meijer blocks of cheese and spinach and became a stoic buddhist talks about balance as if every day is penance for his past gluttony but hes still a neurotic smartass who has to imply everything is wrong
  as if traditions and culture aremt just going with the flow of a family problem is in america many people are raised by society and the government instead
  you can only partially blame them for being so stupid their parents lived through the rationing of the war which at least in britain supposedly did horrendous damage to the british cuisine followed by the massive industrialization of food production throughout the 50s and 60s which combined with most western nations having only a very rich but quiet bland local cuisine focused on feeding poor farmers and industrial workers turned into a perfect storm of industrial sludge drowning in oil sugar and low quality carbs
     still its something more organic and born out of the people its seems that these people in america are just consumerist puppets how could you ever feel good and wholesome when your cultural experience is something as vile as that rootless consumption in some godforsaken drywall shithole gah
  in some cases ues but i doubt youre getting a realistic sample
  what is this i dont get the whole america has no culture and white people have no culture memes    everywhere and every group has a culture look up the definition of culture its impossible not to have one  it seems like people who go with this meme boil culture down to novel music and strange smelling foods if those arent at the forefront of your culture then you have none
  if its not classical music or la dia de los muertos its not culture they say then of course they call poppositivity and increased sociality through interest in technology some type of degeneration
    ofcourse you have a culture a culture that is massively depressing and rootless just consuming for the hedonistic pleasure making money just for the sake of making money the new world truly is different
  most of milk is water anon
    you dont like this shitty thing goddamn why cant you be grateful and just eat up my disgusting slurp    stupid boomer i dont complain to my parents ill eat their slop out of politeness but its still shit and im going to voice my opinion somewhere
  carriage return  its been a long time since ive heard someone call it a carriage return im glad not everybody has forgotten why the key is slapped with return
  a bloo bloo bloo you say on a board where people are talking about how cooking has improved over their parents generation because you saw a picture of some slums in another country on the news
invited to parents house for dinner    drinks milk    what you meant to say was that your parents flung you out of bed for dinner faggot
    what i just made a remark towards the fact that any culinary tradition that is not locally grown out of hundreds or thousands of years of tradition seem bleak at best there are no slums here anyways i have a hard time following with what you are trying to say
  its been a long time since ive heard someone call it a carriage return  so you work with your hands or what also it says enter on my keyboard
  depressing and rootless  its literally not either of these though its been fairly industrial and artificial the last 50 years but we are literally going through a boom in food culture and roots arent forgotten at all just because cheaper food is available people still have their shit
    i literally tell my mom to pick out the corn when she uses that thing to cook my dinner she thought it was a joke and did a half assed job and i yelled at her now she takes it more seriously
  only if the beer has some obnoxious name like satans uncut smegma and its from an obscure microbrewery that i can snobbishly inform everyone about to show off my superiority
  no you may only cite based aldi
  i bet it has the curved left pointing arrow though
  yeah its pretty damn good or an ice cold squirt or root beer damn i miss soda
  nope
  my fucking parents dont know how to salt goddamn food i was at their house for thanksgiving and i specifically made sure to get there early so i could make the gravy and i made almost the best gravy ive ever had for all their faults they do at least know how to roast a turkey the next day my mom uses the rest of the turkey drippings to make more gravy and its literal tasteless shit because she didnt add any salt to bring out the flavor  fuck boomers and their nosalt lifestyle
    find me fda nutritional info that indicates the first ingredient of milk is water
  siiiip  ahh nothing like fresh milk from the local dairy heh you millennials dont know how good you have it
  i started cooking for myself when i was 10 because my parents were and are god awful at it
ive never had a meal that my motherinlaw of 10 yrs has made that wasnt a casserole her go to is some ground beef canned beans of course a shit ton of shredded cheese she bakes tortilla chips in so those get nice an soft and greasy and disgusting i die a little everytime someone asks her what shes making mexican casserole can go die forever     of course her kids and husband are like     omg mexican casserole yummmmm
    jesus you guys had shit parents my parents both worked in the food industry in there teensearly 20s and learned how to cook fairly well     nothing crazy but cooked well and tasty
  god this is legit the most retarded boomer spout ive ever heard anyone spew you literally sound like somebodys fucking retard boomer dad that only orders the bacon cheeseburger from the sports pub   sorry i dont wanna subscribe to your ham and banana hollandaise culture or fucking jello salad or whatever boomer slop your great depression family fed you nigger
  be first generation to be worse off on average than your parents  imagine that youre better than your parents anyway  you zoomers really need to screw your heads on
  that was always your favorite  this really bothers me my parents insist that i like the exact same things today that i did 20 years ago and they dont listen when i try to correct them i understand it but it bothers me
  boomer  depression  wew zoomers everyone opinionated yet retarded

itt meme garbage that shouldnt exist
  alcohol
this thread
  salt and vinegar and sour cream and onion are literally the only good pringles in existence
  underage and salty
  based    cringe
  meme garbage that shouldnt exist  op
  9gag
basically everything that is sold in stores
  nice boomer reference gramps
  back to your newsgroups
  only craft beers topshelf liquor wine and sake are food worthy everything else is unnecessary and should be removed from the game all shittier beer does is cause chaos and degenerate debauchery
reeeeeee im a child and the things i personally dislike shouldnt exist
  compromising  you forgot about slippery slope
    correct
  fag
  are you trying to start a fucking war with canada
all limited edition oreo flavors they are all trash
  agreed only high quality alcohol is worthy all the rest is just for getting stupidly drunk on a dry stomach
  from fucking when 9fag is a boomer shit
  since when is macaroni and cheese a street food    hes saying that being mad about 9gag is a boomer thing to do i remember being mad about gaggers they actually called themselves this 9 or 10 years ago in university so he is actually right
  as far as im concerned its impossible to fuck up salt and vinegar ive had some brands where i liked the flavor less than other brands but ive never eaten a sv flavored potato chip and gone this tastes like shit
  sounds weird as fuck but the oreos 4th of july special edition has pop rocks in the cream  is surprisingly not bad
wasnt there a cheeseburger flavor doritos at some point
  there was they just tasted like pickles and mustard i just so happened to fucking love pickles and mustard so it was a happy accident
    these are around in japan now theyre amazing for the same reason    that is to say the cheeseburger one the noodle flavors are fine though
  yo those were dank
  asia has too many snacks at the stores
  those are pringles the other anon and i were talking about doritos
  i dont think someone defending bacon mac n cheese pringles on an anonymous image board has any grounds to call other people children
  youre goddamn right pal i only feed myself with what i find on the ground outside
  when did this sriracha meme start ive known about the specific rooster brand for a long time as a chink and was surprised to see it so mainstream to westerners as of recent
  thats why i drink it
  like a decade ago but it took a little longer to really get lots of flavored stuff
say what you will about taco bell but theyre one of the only places where you can get drivethru nachos
    triple layer nachos  1
  the nachos bell grande for 350 or whatever are good and a good deal two of those and some beer and you will have a comfy evening and a full belly
say what you will about taco bell but the authentic mexican restaurant i went to didnt even know what a crunchwrap supreme is
  for me its nachos supreme
  has anyone ever asked for doritos instead of the regular chips for nachos
  buying small portions of premade nachos because you can waste 3 of gas to drive there to grap 1 worth
  you can go to any gas station or most super markets and get nachos
   and thats not drivethru did you even read the post
  being so disappointed in your diet choices that you have to make a thread on /ck/ to cope
  why do you need drive thru nachos you fat lard nachos are awful car food and the ones at the bell are always soggy and disgusting
  taco bells a mile away30 mpg 280 a gallon     im not saying their nachos are worth even that but 3 of gas is a bit of an overestimation
  being such a fatass that you cant tolerate the minute of walking in a gas station
  as if youve never gone through a drivethru in your life you big hypocrite
happened when i was a younger man  be 16 year old me  eating at taco bell with my buddy  old geezer yells at me because i threw out half of a taco   homeless people could eat that   gramps is mad as fuck  put my ass on the edge of his table  rip the sickest smelliest fart i have ever left   homeless people could eat that too bro  he starts screaming at me and im laughing so hard  manager comes running out and listens to his story  kicks me out  havent been back since
  gas station nachos are way better than taco bell too
  i absolutely detest queso it makes every dish that it touches objectively worse
  i feel weird eating queso especially that tostitos queso in the grocery store i get some every 46 months and feel absolutely awful after eating it but the cycle doesnt stop
  youre lucky people have been shot for less than that
      red sauce is a layer  mfw
  not getting del taco
peak fast food  i honestly dont get why people go anywhere else
    the checkers near my house is shit its also staffed by teenage minorities i remember checkers being really good as a kid though i dunno if they changed like kfc    incidentally i had sonic for the first time in a while probably a decade since a franchise opened up near me i didnt know what to order so i went with 2 double cheeseburgers and some popcorn chicken it was definitely better than checkers    i would go to wendys but its in the black part of town
  never been we dont have these around here whats the price range on the food here im assuming its a bit more than mcdonalds but hopefully its cheaper than five guys
the local checkers is my favorite spot they always hook me up never skimped on the food i love the spicy chicken sandiwches and fries      id say its around the same range as a mcdonalds you can get a decent meal with a fiver and they always have some cheaply priced value items
where my buford boys at
  its cheaper than mcds greaseball drunk food only good if you grew up near one i did and fuckin love em
  cheaper than mcdicks theyre on par with places like white castle only really good when youre drunk/stoned but theyre open late as fuck and cheap as fuck so its fucking perfect   i used to get like 4 of those 2 chicken and fry boxes on my way home from the bar and chow down at like 3am
  out of the four mainstream fast food joints that are in the area ive always thought that rallys beef tastes best come to find out  everything else does too is just a bonus  and they sell real chicken wings and fried cheese  its a shame the closed locations rather than expand in my area  maybe the lack of a dining room has something to do with it
  i love a buford      there are a bunch of locations where i live in michigan got two close enough to my house
  attention  they sell an ovencooked version of their fries  the taste is 11    cook 11 minutes at 425 shuffle them around then another 1213 minutes  its perfect
  i have the pleasure of working right by a rallys they have the best value menu out of any fast food joint except maybe taco bell  i miss the old bacon roadhouse burger they had with the texas toast bread shit was legit
  when i was younger they opened 3 in the county i lived in the closest one lasted 8 years maybe the next closest closed a couple years after that and the one left is not an option unless im doing business in the area  they are doing daily coupons now if you sign up for the email mumbo jumbo they have dollar fries to free cheese stick and all kinds of deals i think they are doing it daily until christmas todays was small baconzilla combo for 5 dollars
  because i have whataburger
  yea and hot wings
  i honestly dont get why people go anywhere else  because the food at other places doesnt leave me feeling like ive been eating from a trash can
rallys is shit even for fast food might as well just get convenience store food same quality and price
precheckers merger rallys started in my city so we have a ton of them theyre usually staffed with the worst of the worst relative to other fast food places around here but it doesnt matter as its hard to fuck up that kind of slop their fries are god tier but seem to be 50 sodium by weight so they can be hard on your system
  fuck everybody who thinks convenience store and gas station food tastes like anything but garbage it will never be on par with fast food
what is this is this literally just all the spices blended together
  yes its what the night janitor sweeps up around the packing machines
  its meant to be put in all dishes every single one
no ya damn simp its called that because it tastes like the three traditional english spices nutmeg cinnamon and cloves
yes can you not read       please stop spreading false information people like you are whats wrong with the world
  is this literally just all the spices blended together  yeah but the question you should be asking is how the fuck do they fit them all in such a small bottle
  he doesnt cultivate an allspice bush  what is wrong with you
beyond burger pfft fuck that for me its the impossible burger  delicious the taste is exactly the same as a beef burger grilled rare  more expensive what are you poor  higher quality ingredients the beets is your new favorite band  better better than the beyond burger
  dont they put soy protein in it i dont care about soy but it ruins the taste and texture for me i love veggie burgers i just wish theyd just use veggies instead of trying to boost the protein ratio
  full ingredient list water textured wheat protein coconut oil potato protein natural flavors 2 or less of leghemoglobin yeast extract salt konjac gum xanthan gum soy protein isolate vitamin e vitamin c thiamin vitamin b1 zinc niacin vitamin b6 riboflavin vitamin b2 vitamin b12    barely less than a mcdouble or anything at arbys
  god that looks good
  for me its the mcchicken the best fast food sandwich
  its like comparing the virgin to the chad the impossible chad wins every time
  coconut oil  dropped
  i eat beef burgers for the nutrition in beef which none of these have
  you will die like everyone else snowflake
whats up /ck/ i have missed you oh so much going to need to cut my budget this next two months and am trying to plan out how to improve my diet at the same time what should i buy in bulk to eat healthier better and cheaper     right now im thinking the easy staples would be rice potatoes and maybe quinoa any recommendations also any batch cooking you know how to do that can be stored or will last half a week would be super appreciated
dont let me down /ck/ i need your great wisdom
  in some places you can buy a pack of 18 boxes of kraft mac for 10 to 15 dollars add in things like hotdogs when you can afford it buy the cheapest sensible vegetable and add it more than mac n cheese if its that cheap it will ration longer     or if you get a job and hit payday you can order 20003000 caloric us military mres
  lean cuisine dinners at walmart
froze chicken breasts i use them for dinner every other night nearly so many things you can do with them and reasonably cheap and healthy
only get a 30 minute lunch break
  hour lunch break
  i hate this feel i want to use the hour to decompress and god forbid i dont bring my lunch then i have to rush to the nearest eatery scarf something down and barely digest it then run back to work fuck being a middle class amerifat
  he doesnt live close enough to work to just go home for lunch
  work in icu  either have fuckall to do all shift because the patient is stable maybe his kids call and ask how he is or they visit and you brew them some coffee  or the entire shift plus a couple hours is a constant struggle keeping the pt alive and you dont even get to force down your packed lunch in a hurry or go take a damn piss    i love my job
  tfw half hour lunch and 2 fifteen minute breaks whenever i want
  live in country with no labor rights
  labor rights are for faggy commies
  tfw fell asleep in my car for a hour and no one cared/noticed  clock in early and out early nobody cares  no work sit on my phone for hours nobody cares  get paid the most ive ever made in my life  jobs pretty comfy
  get neetbux
  what job
  some manufacturing job the thing is i work night shift and theres like no over head to answer to
  that sounds nice i used to do night shift in a grocery store and it was similar except for the money part we used to get fresh bakery stuff right out of the oven it was so good
  ye i did that too it was chill but making near poverty wages im making over double what i was and its easier    seems like the more money i make the easier the work is
  those hours fly by too makes the lunch feel earned    t em physician in level 1 trauma center in the ghetoo
  i love that bitcoin tattoo reminds me that zoomers know nothing about business in general and once crytos become an oversaturated market theyre all going to die off
id rather get home early than spent and entire hour scratching my balls doing fuck all  long breaks are for adhd victims and fatties who cant function without a full meal every 4 hours
night shift leo  nothing better than eating brekkie at the local casino at 3 am
  oh they do i prefer a busy shift to a slow one really   but towards the end youre thinking of that food more than you are of the patient
  not eating the patient  pleb
tfw one hour lunch wirh two paid 15 minutes breaks i can stack  while living 10 minutes away on bike home   and a three minute walk to my citys downtown with many great restraunts  tfw im in college and this is at my paid internship    lifeisgoodjpg
isnt that pretty much the same in every other lowpaying job during my undergrads ive worked in the shipping department of a med lab as a taxi driver at a construction site and as a night guard except for the last one all ticked that box and nobody there gave a shit why is it only fast food wageslaves and waiters that feel so entitled in a lowskill job
  be smoker  spend at least an hour of my shift smoking plus lunch
  enjoy your lung cancer
  2nd shift at a rcra tsd facility here having no bosses on the shift is pure bliss
  bosses will overlook you for promotions unless they smoke as well
  lost a good job in the maternity ward that way man ive learned my lesson
  same here
  they wont promote me because i have a shitty attitude which of course doesnt fly in management but my bosses love me i broke a 6000 computer and they basically laughed it off and coached me on how to lie to hr about what happened
  where tf do you work
tfw work at car stealership  tfw 2 hour paid lunches    feels good mayne
  why would you want to waste more than 30 minutes except for the occasional going out to a nice lunch
  a warehouse half of my bosses are drunks or drug addicts so basically if you help make their lives easier by doing your job halfway decently then you can get away with anything
  its bullshit that employers abide smokers these days i get it for low skill stuff where trash is basically your only option for employees but otherwise this shouldnt be a thing anymore
  so like manual labor
  work in a metal fab shop   we get two 15s and one half hour but honestly we can dick off anytime we want as long as we produce   if i had an hour lunch i wouldnt want to go back to work to be honest the office fags have an hour but its understandable since they just sit on their ass all day and most activity they get is walking to the coffee machine or fridge once in a while
  i drive a forklift so it isnt really manual labor but its the same tier of garbage people
  i get a list of things that need to be done by the end of my shift when i arrive 45 min early gotta get my ot in i get them done plus more while still enjoying my smoke breaks where is the problem
id rather have a short lunch break and go home sooner used to have 2 hours at my first job and it was awful
45 minute lunch break  live next door to work    im on my lunch break right now 
  maybe that they are paying you 45 minutes of overtime every day to do what a non smoker would get done in a normal shift
  you probably come back in smelling terrible annoying everyone around you
  the office fags have an hour  im an officefag my lunch is however long i want it to be since im not paid for it it just depends on how long i want to stay at work that day  i typically bring my lunch so i only need to make up 20 minutes
  my workplace lets me elect to skip the lunchbreak and go home thirty minutes early more time to fix dinner which suits me
  nope im viewed as an over achiever at work spent the first 9 months this year picking up the slack that we were understaffed on 2nd only one employee for my section of the plant when we should have two and got a bonus in september for doing so without complaining      i work in a hazardous waste treatment facility see my post here  i smell better than the ambient air when i reenter the building
  i work in a hazardous waste treatment facility see my post here  i smell better than the ambient air when i reenter the building  i suppose a fitting place for a smoker then
  you personally being good or bad at work has little to do with the concept of companies allowing absurd extra breaks to low class smokers
  minimum 1 hour lunch break  pay 4 euros for unlimited buffet  food is actually quite decent most days  always go for a coffee afterwards  normally end up away from desk for at least 90 minutes
anyone here changed from 1 hour to 30 min lunch break fuck staying longer at work
    i didnt mean to respond to this post
  you personally being good or bad at work has little to do with the concept of companies allowing absurd extra breaks to low class smokers  you mean like the 2nd shift maintenance guy who takes a 90 min meal break and decides when he wants to show up early shorting us of coverage on my shift
  when i was young i mean sept 11 i worked at an office store 51 and they didnt tell me i got two 15 minute breaks   got fired eventually for allegedly opening tylenol and taking some i took it but it was already open and i marked it out for shrink anyways they are out of business so enjoy your break
  yeah similarly not related to what i was talking about
  hour and a half lunch break being a teacher rules
  work in an office  30 minute official break for lunch  boss never is around  start taking longer and longer lunches  realize no one actually enforces this 30 minute break and none of my coworkers are going to talk shit on me to my boss unless i piss them off by not being around when i said i will  one day end up taking a 3 hour lunch break because i hopped on the wrong train to go downtime and went for a wild ride   no one even asked where i was  came back to work like nothing happened    feels good
skip lunch break so i can go home after only 8 hours  no time to eat breakfast  first meal of the day at 7 pm  fall asleep immediately after
  last office job  i knew they were going to fire me  didnt know how long i had left  only one other coworker next to my cubicle otherwise no one could see me  that coworker worked from home most days because waaah im a working mom so she got special privileges  started doing nothing during shift worked on my own shit all day and they had no clue  started just vanishing for an hour or two at a time to go for a walk  didnt even eat or anything just walked around city looking at hobos  got back no one said shit didnt even realize i was gone  current job  we all arrive and leave at different hours  i have half an hour unsupervised at end of shift  i go on my phone the whole time  i wonder when companies will start to understand you get what you pay for is a real thing gonna pay me shit and treat me like shit you get shit work ethic in return fucking niggers every single moment every microsecond that im unsupervised im not doing shit
work in k12 it  low level position but the pay is good for what i do   have my own office  am unsupervised 99 of the time  play games all day watch movies bullshit around  work is ticket based get no tickets somedays  even when i get tickets they take only a few minutes to solve or i just pass it on to higher tierd support   literally getting paid to do nothing  they even give me benefits  still get an hour lunch work 5 minutes from home so i can leave if i want    i could get a better job but its too damn comfy
  my mcdonalds changed it to 45 minutes and its not like they pay you
  sounds like my job anon    tfw wish i was paid more but job too comfy to look for a different one that might make me work hard
are you all kids that have wageslave tier mcdonalds jobs or something i havent had a job that actually cared how long i took to eat lunch since i was in college working at a pizza place     as long as i get my work done for the day show up for any meetings and reply to emails timely no one gives a fuck how long i take for lunch or where i am if they really need me they can call me cell this is pretty much standard for any job that actual adults have
  non smoker here in my state you get a 15 minute break every 2 hours 6 hour shift means 45 minutes where youre dicking around on the clock sorry you work some where that is refusing you breaks
i havent worked a job with lunch breaks in years
  sucks to be you  45 min lunch break
  honestly id fucking kill for this luxury
  practically nobody on 4chan makes more than 12/hr
get 30 minute lunch break and 2 15 minute breaks  dont take any of them and work the 8 hours straight

work 57 hours  12 hour lunch  work 23 hours  no breaks  get regularly yelled at for using the shitter  boss has the nerve to call days where i dont work after lunch half days  but eh its chill work so whatever
  i get paid a reasonable wage given my level of responsibility and experience and i still do nothing    my boss was away for 3 days last week and i probably did less than an hour of work it turns out that if i resize my internet browser it looks a lot like our email screens i pull up news sites which are mostly text and just read shit all day long and troll the comments to anyone else it looks like im reading an email    its frustrating as id quite like to have the motivation to work i just cant bring myself to concentrate on it
i get 20 minutes you ungrateful cucks
  i work in the ed i understand the feeling of not even being able to take 2 minutes off to piss let alone 10 minutes off to force food down my throat
tfw i literally had a 3 hour lunch break yesterday  youre all small time
  sounds boring af
  eating and reading arent boring and itd be strange to describe sleep as boring so no
  if you cant think of stimulating ways to spend three hours of free time youre the boring one
  not at work
  youre a retard

  your boss is the same as mine hes never in the office so me abd my colleagues dont give a shit about 30 minutes lunch break when i used to smoke i usually just spend 30 minutes having a lunch and 30 minutes smoking and chatting with my colleagues
work for a multiinternational company  my boss quit and went to a different place only a few months in  company was too jewish to replace him  instead assigned us to be under some guy from the uk part of the company  the uk guy only flew out to see us once just to say hello and shit  never saw him after that point  basically had no boss  could do whatever i wanted    i stopped showing up for work and eventually got a new job id go in like once or twice a week just to check up on things but it was ajoke
work as a meter reader for electric co was never told anything about lunch breaks but i just finish my route as fast as possible and eat when i get home
im on my lunch break right now    im eating alone in my car im so lonely
  honestly having worked in construction and food id rather stay in construction i deal with way less bullshit
  i get an hour but id rather have 30 minutes and go home earlier
  15 minute lunch break  5 to wash grab food and sit down   5 to eat   5 to wash piss and get back to work     at about 20 minutes supervisors would start coming up and asking around to see what the fuck you were doing good times
30 plus two fifteens  garde manger i sell romaine and romaine accessories
  good thing you got fastfood
    i learned recently that some states dont require businesses to give you a lunch break i live in such a place what kind of 1800s bullshit is that youre not legally required to allow people to feed themselves during their shift
  why would the law matter at all  if you dont agree with the employers lunch policy then dont work there seems pretty simple
he gets a lunch break
  if you dont agree with the employers lunch policy then dont work there    i assume there are people for which this wouldnt work for one reason or another
guaranteed break  wew im self employed and that shit is pure luxury if a customer calls you need to fucking answer i only effectively work 56 hours/day though
  i assume there are people for which this wouldnt work for one reason or another  what reason could that possibly be other than mental illness or stupidity
  i used to work in germany and now work in the usa working in america sucks you get a lot less time off and employers can get away with putting a lot more on you in germany i had all kinds of holidays and then bridge days where the holiday landed close enough to the weekend for you to get an extra day off in america i get like three weeks off a year total and i have some friends who barely get two weeks off total
  i only effectively work 56 hours/day though  so does everyone else if you actually work 56 hours a day thats pretty good most people sit at the office for nine or ten and get an actual 5 hours of work done between office bullshit shitposting meetings waiting for meetings or whatever else
work is a 2 minute walk from home it literally takes more time to drive there  get an hour lunch where i go home and do whatever the fuck i want away from my shitty coworkers
    their financial situation is one that comes to mind but i dont doubt there are more than a few others         also this i dont want to leave the country necessarily but hearing about the work culture in nearly any european country makes me want to your life shouldnt by necessity revolve around your job
  there are things that suck in germany though i mean they had rules for literally everything cant even wash your fucking car in the driveway the taxes are horrendous everyone there is a total pussy compared to america but the usa for sure needs to get both more efficient at working and a more reasonable holiday plan     is it any wonder why only poor people with no jobs in america have kids when working people have barely any vacation education is super expensive and there isnt even decent maternity leave or that they are fat when they work 10 hours a day and have to eat packaged food for lunch
  someone told that its actually illegal to eat your lunch at your desk in france  not sure how true that is but it seems european employers value workers downtime dunno if it makes people more productive
  i think just moving house might be easier than doing 25 to life
  your life shouldnt by necessity revolve around your job  and it doesnt unless you make a willful decision to allow it to      i mean they had rules for literally everything cant even wash your fucking car in the driveway  that shit exists in the states too in many places hoas homeowner associations have horrible policies with the full force of law    taxes are horrendous  well yeah that free education isnt really free    or that they are fat when they work 10 hours a day and have to eat packaged food for lunch  theyre fat because theyre too stupid to bring a sane meal from home and instead they eat junk food be it prepackaged stuff they brought or perhaps a fastfood place they visited on their lunch break
  i get no break
  live 10 minutes from work  driving there and back takes 20 minutes round trip  only get 30 minutes for lunch  not even worth it t b h
  what if you have to take a monster shit would you drive home for a nice comfy clean pooper

  that hypothetical you is the exception and not the rule
  3 hour lunch break  ill translate  works parttime shifts  worked morning shift  about to get off  hey anon flaky mcslut called in will you close tonight  k  have 3 hours until then when you have to come back  brag on the internet about a nonexistent 3hour lunch break

  2 hours lunch break
kitchen right across the hall from me  get stressed  eat a snack  boss yells at me about something  eat another snack  stomach getting sore but so stressed cant stop eating
  pepe wasnt a meme 10 years ago newfag
  who said anything about ten years ago
  must be back in seat 5 minutes before lunch ends  wut  if they are dictating your actions to you how can you still be on lunch  i would turn up with 5 minutes of lunch left and eat a fucking smoked kippers right at my fucking desk the cunts would have to move office by the time i was done eating smoked fucking fish during the last 5 minutes of my break
  i have a 1h12 mandatory lunch break where my coworkers dont they take 30min paid lunch break i work 45 hours 918 5 days a week they work 4 days and one saturday per month i would kill to have 30 min lunch break motherfucker
  tbh senpai get into the mental health system depression is considered a disability by the us govt and half of all adults will have it at some point bam disability and neetbux
  thats one thing you guys definitely have over us and thats every employee no matter the job or length of employment gets 1 month mandatory holiday it can take many years to even come near 30 days and a large percentage of jobs will be lucky to even get 2 weeks after long years service here helk a lot of jobs never offer more than 1 week to anyone other than management workers get fucked up the ass in the us and the rightwing propaganda machines convince them to vote against unions and collective bargaining literally the only means for the worker to get a fair deal
  bruh fuck you my co worker microwaves fucking smoked fish in the microwave everyday and ive tried to get her fired but the boss wont    fucking shit smells like pure ass confronted her about it and she gives this dumbass smirk and says i cant stop her from eating what she wants    fuck you fuck her and fuck smoked fucking fish
  my boss makes a dollar while i make a dime thats why i always shit on company time
get hour lunch and 2 15 minute breaks a day  rarely use 20 minutes of my lunch  just dick around on my phone the rest of the time  would rather do a 30 minute lunch and go home earlier
  worked in a factory for a bit and can confirm do your job good for long enough and theyll let you off with quite a bit now i am a supervisor for a cleaning firm and i do the same to the people who turn up early and get on with their job ill let some of them have a cup of coffee on company time to relax a bit or even bring them some food/coffee to them and pay it myself the fuckers who turn up late and have shit attitudes i dont tolerate some realise how i am and start doing better friend to good workers boss to the shit ones       this is shit i worked in a real old dusty loud factory producing some lab equipment and it was annoying as fuck to just stop what youre doing for 15 minutes do fuck all maybe go to the coffee machine and have to make small talk then the hour long break which you either had to sit at your area on a shitty wooden stool sit with middle aged men eating kit kats and crisp sandwiches at the lunch tables or go get a shit burger from the local takeaway
  you cant eat in the building if your not back in your seat 5 minutes early they count it as a no show for that day

i tried all kinds of way and this is the most based oddly enough all the old women i have talked to never tried this except for one who worked in a school cafeteria and she agreed with me i am talking about a turkey breast though not a whole turkey but thats the best part anyway     pic unrelated
i have trouble believing that boiling is the best way to cook any kind of meat
heh
  i mean stews and soups are pretty fucking good but nothing beats a solid roast/grill just saying i wouldnt discount that method
  those arent boiled
  they technically are you add a few ingredients to the water while boiling anything and youve made a simple soup
  you simmer it not boil you also dont put raw meat in the soup retard
  such glorious repeating digits wasted on a completely idiotic and uneducated post
  kek is confirming my based way of cooking a turkey breast    the meat turns out perfect and you can cook a nice sized breast in a little bit over an hour
  ive had a whole chicken boiled in fresh chicken stock and then served with rice that was also cooked with stock served with hoisin and sweet and sour sauce it was god tier so i believe you op
  i feel like baking bird will always dry it out to an unacceptable level even cooking in a slow cooker wont do it as well as a good old boil you dont have to put a lot of salt in the water either just enough
  heh
  heh
  not air fry heh  please die
  turkey breast is the best part  oh no no no  hahahahahahahaha
  get a load of the dark meat cuck what a pleb lol
  white meat  good  i hate this meme
worked in a school cafeteria
  i make crock pot soup with raw meat all the time retard
  based hehposter
   no one asked what you do   thats not how soups are traditionally made and no one would pay money for your idea of soup
  people put raw meat in pho this isnt just something one random person does
  based and redpilled
  what made you choose a picture of some random bitch taking a selfie with a snapchat filter to start the thread the absolute state of this board
  we dont need toxic misogynists like you ruining 4channel    reported
  out of my way thot  i am here to pet that dog
  i can tell youre from reddit because you take the most ridiculous outlier to fit your argument  this entire conversation has been about western stews and soups and even the op references turkey
i just want to make some good spaghetti and meatballs but google and youtube have both failed me is there an anon out there who can save me with a personal recipe or any tips
all recipes seem to contradict each other some say sear the meatballs some say drop raw directly in sauce some call for whole tomato others for crushed others for tomato sauce what the fuck i need to make this count im having my grandparents over to my new apartment tonight and this is what they requested i have about 11 hours to shop and prepare the meal before they arrive money isnt an issue i already have most ingredients also should i make meatballs with only beef or should i add some sausage spicy or mild why is this shit so complicated
  make a home made red sauce from a soffrito of celery onions carrots and garlic sauteed in a liberal amount of olive oil add salt pepper red pepper flakes pinch of cinnamon pinch of cloves add a can of whole san marzano tomatoes crush the tomatoes one by one with your hand as you add them now turn the heat up until it comes to a boil and then return to a gentle simmer leave there while you prep your meatballs    meatballs ground lean hamburger spicy italian sausage loose or squeezed from casing a cup of bread crumbs form into roughly 1/3 pound size balls and in a skillet brown the sides nice and crispy throw in the sauce for about 15 minutes to finish cooking    salt the sauce to taste    this is a simple recipe that will yield predictable results you can of course modify everything once youre comfortable making it adding ground veal and/or pork to the meatballs is traditionally done
  one made at home

mcds rice burg
step dad told me a recipe someone from his work used that used a ground deer and pork mixture he made them one day and they were actually pretty fucking amazing    otherwise for me a nice and simple 80/20 patty fried flat little salt and pepper
  this looks cursed
  not to be impolite but for some reason my image of you is something like a stephan hawkings wheelchair bound dude
  i picture like the same 4 guys as every poster i dont know why its not intentional
a hamburger inspired from the 1980s miniseries amerika soycake and molasses burger
        learn from the master well before he drowned himself in the shower
  it does look kinda aesthetic desu
  picturing guys
this is pretty region specific but the best burger i ever had was the rocky mountain burger from eddie burger bar in banff ab solid elk burger as far as chain restaurants the bc bigger burger from white spot
  how do you drown yourself in a shower is it like how turkeys are said to drown in the rain
  oh man  i remember crown burger in salt lake city that was sooo good is astro burger still there
  that looks absolutely ghastly
for me its the ultimate double whopper
toasted everything bagel one half with spreaded cream cheese the other starting at the bottom sliced pepper jack cheese two slices of bacon a fried egg over medium saut√©ed mushrooms and spinach steamed lightly in soy sauceand the best part sweet potato hashbrowns on top generous application of hot sauce
  and also a thinly sliced layer of a white onion fried till brown
  so nobody is going to mention this disgusting burger
shizuoka wasabi burger i make it a double because im american
for me its the mcchicken the best fast food sandwich i even ask for extra mcchicken sauce packets and the staff is so friendly and more than willing to oblige    one time i asked for mcchicken sauce packets and they gave me three i said wow three for free and the nice friendly mcdonalds worker laughed and said im going to call you 3forfree    now the staff greets me with hey its 3forfree and always give me three packets its such a fun and cool atmosphere at my local mcdonalds restaurant i go there at least 3 times a week for lunch and a large iced coffee with milk instead of cream 12 times for breakfast on the weekend and maybe once for dinner when im in a rush but want a great meal that is affordable fast and can match my daily nutritional needs    i even dip my fries in mcchicken sauce its delicious what a great restaurant
  thats not a burger thats just a weird sandwich
  pure
  yeah but its going to mask the taste of the beef the beef should always be the first thing down on the bottom bun
  he had a seizure and was unconscious
  kek based trolli used to love these as a child
i hold no torch for mcds but i miss her

  what is the point of vertiburgers how are you properly supposed to eat them if you dont have a julia roberts mouth

byron burgers in the uk are fucking top tier and ive had a few burgers im sure theres a better place but considering theyre a chain and pretty relatively okay in price good stuff
      it looks like its candy or something up close

  ill never understand this why would someone eatraw meat for real grilled salmon is fucking great why would someone eat cold and slimy salmon
        love me some pricks
  i woudlnt feed that to a stray cat
  youve got weird kinks my friend
  good quality raw salmon tastes better than any cooked salmon honestly
  of course you do
here you go friend
  i gotta agree with this the only other method that touches raw is smoked or cured salmon
  you havent had a good fresh salmon steak cooked on a grill have you try it out and your opinion might change its bit expensive but then sometimes you just have to say what the fuck
  is that authentic ramen
  hahaha ive puked better looking stuff than that west coast crap
  my snot rockets look better than that
    thanks guys ill try to do better next time
  thats burning my mouth from here

  ewww a veganigger
yebisu sucks dog ass
howd i do
huh
  its lacking a chutney or pickle component and im not sure about the chestnuts but otherwise a nice little charcuterie platter  im having a cheese board later  smoked gouda black label cambozola and vintage red leicester with some nice bread pickles and a caramelised onion jam
  i believe that any retard could place food items on a plate good job timmy 
who the f eats raw garlic
  looks kind of dry
  prosciutto  over here
  not op but it looks like they are just there next to the stove not actually part of the plate
  im gay btw
  im not sure about the chestnuts  yeah you sure arent those are figs
  thats a lotta nuts
  i see a jar of honey
  those are figs  well fuck me youre right ive never seen white ones though
  honey is dry af anon
  no
  good
  explain how honey is wet  ill wait
  it drips
  needs a sharp more dense cheese one more type of cured meat and something pickled or even a veggie in oil like roasted peppers or artichokes     67 / 10     keep up the good work
   it is a liquid you nigger
  whats a credited hard cheese for a cheese board
  vintage somerset cheddar
  would these pickled onions work
  a cheddar or asiago variation is always a good choice i like sharp english style cheddar     typically on plate like op pic you want full array and contrast of cheeses from soft to hard brie stilton cheddar and parmesan is the cookie cutter way to go
  typically you want all meat the meat is going to go first the cheese second nobody will touch the nuts someone might have some crackers
  are they onions  are they pickled  if so then yes  reminder that honey is dry
  he doesnt make cracker meat cheese and honey combo bites
  parmesan is best eaten with a little balsamic vinegar or some tomatoes  it doesnt really go with the same things that go with a brie stilton or cheddar imo
  if its all you got then go for it pickled items tend to simmer down the funkiness of cheese and the saltiness of the meats
  its about 20 water
  youre 70 water  are you wet
  cut your nails
lacks wetness add some jelly or something
  yes
  humans literally spray and ooze liquids all day long were pretty wet
  if this is for a party horrible as there isnt anything to break the cheese with
  homosexual/10
  those filthy fucking fingernails  jesus fucking christ man
  theres a knife      im a woman
  no
  i hope you wear a pantyliner gril
    theyre perfectly clean
this is the worst pizza i have ever seen
  no theyre not ew
  cut those nasty fingernails and put on a clean sweater
  is that you john
      are you at your parents or your grandparents
  john  eating anything that isnt going to give him cancer by his early 30s

  it doesnt look like you really did anything
  implying that constructing a patrician cheeseboard isnt an essential life skill

  fpbp eternal huh poster dominion
  hey cool me too
  show us your cooter bitch
i love chow mein i usually get with chicken the sauce i just water sesame oil and corn starch      but look at pic releated i got it from this place in south hadly ma and looks like they added soy sauce or hoison sauce to itso dark
  i was going to say you must be from the east coast
  thank you for this diary entry
  is that chow mein
  it is chow mein
  that much soy sauce would turn me off my favorite sauce is the dipping sauce they give you with dumplings maybe if it were that it would be good
  well but most other places dont put brown sauce in it
  chew manchu
chow mein has got to be the most inconsistent chinese food item
  yeah like how some places actually make it with noodles which makes sense since mein means noodle
  chow mein  that is not chow mein looks more like mu shu pork
side of rice with his noodles
  side of rice instead of an egg roll  baka
south hadley i am in grafton and fuck i thought i was in the sticks hows heroin treating you boys out there
  what noodles
  go to local chinese place  pay 7  get large portion of beef  broccoli  big side of white rice and a tasty egg roll    god damn it feels good
  same im op that meal i posted was a lunch special with a bowl of soup and it cost 7 cheaper than value meals at fast food joints now a days    of course i could have gotten it with pork fried rice but i prefer white
  south hadley is not the sticks       i was trying to be a bit healthy considering it was american chinese
  beansprouts are noodles  the state of /ck/
  reddit frog    kill yourself
  lately ive been partial to the wonton soup the broth is usualy pretty good and the wontons have enough meat and them to feel more satisfying that just basically fried starch which is what usuall eggrolls are
  cheaper than value meals    its twenty cents of ingredients you no brain monkey just because its cheaper than fried potatoes and soda doesnt make it a deal
  i never said it was a deal i said it was cheaper than value meals from fast food restuarants you illerate dolt
  there is place near me which has good wonton soup they have the thick skin wontons which i know many peole dont prefere but i like them better than the really thin ones the broth isnt too salty and they load the broth up with scallions pork pieces char sui and snow peas and bok choy    some chinees takeaways just give you some salt water with wontons and thats it
  yeah its cheaper than getting a colostomy too but that would at least be relevant but why am i arguing with a retard who eats restaurant garbage
  the sauce i just water sesame oil and corn starch  what
  youre making a totally different point though than the one i made you fucking moron
  you didnt make a point which is why you were mocked you is so dumb
  its oyster sauce not hoison
  i did make a point you idiot
  how do you know
  its really funny how the variability of chinese places can be insane    i can see you enjoy a bood brocoli and chicken and a good wonton soup    if youve never had it and saying this isnt a copout shrimp in lobster sauce in white rice is a top top top tier underated chinese food dish when your tired of the grease it tastes so soft and if done right velvety almost downright milky the ever so tiniest splash of soy sauce for a dark salinity and a splash of sriracha better if they have a house red chili mash    to be fair this is an extremely aesthetically pleasing image of it only indicative of a chinese restaraunt that would actually cook it good but when its good it s goood
  exactly
  what does that have to do with anything
  wtf
  sauce wont grow if you dont water it bro
is there any benefit to starting with a roux if i boil my potato in my soup base
  huh    no really why do you think boiling a potato is in any way shape or form a proper substitution for a roux
roux  why is cooking so fucking gay
are you making potato puree in your soup if not then yes a roux will be advantageous
  i made potato soup i cooked bacon and onion in my pot and then made a roux with the grease then i added a quart of chicken broth and boiled my potato in it until they started to break apart then at the end i put in heavy cream a bunch of cheese and green onion since roux loses thickening power when you boil it i was wondering if it was actually doing anything or if it was all the potato starch and melted cheese making it thick
  yes the roux is what is making it thick
  /ck/
  this you fucking retard op
just add a slurry at the end op problem solve
wait you make a roux to make potato soup i thought you typically boiled the potato in the stock and then added cream afterward to thicken it
  yes if you want a thick chowder   start with a roux add milk add potatoes corn and chunks of salmon you have salmon chowder   reproduce this for other ingredients and make fucking celery chowder for all i care     i want /b/ to leave
i need an answer do you guys use a roux to make potato soup    ive always made potato leek with chicken stock and cream
  the roux is redundant in potato soup
  okay thank you i thought so but posts in this thread made me unsure
toast crumbs all over the butter
  does that trigger you  i find it funny when someone get triggered by this its just the price we pay for being butter lovers  fuck margarine
  semen stains all over your moms face
  take the right amount of butter the first time instead of double dipping you fucking idiot
  fuck off man
  it spreads easier in small pats though
      i just spread the butter over bread and then fry them in a pan tastes better than dry toast and butter on top
  i like the squeezie parkay for this reason takes 1/2 a sec for a bagel
  are you fucking retarded this is a discussion about butter how did you find yourself in this thread with your shitty margarine

yes i love my cleaver  sure im not as fast as a professional chef but im only cooking for three so i prefer comfy over speed  anyway going to start cooking a beef something to put on top of pasta  inspired by stroganoff but im adding different ingredients as i like so hate away if you need its gonna be killer
  size of beans matters not im not charging 23 per plate rather its going to cost 22 for entire meal with leftovers for another good three meals thats about 350 per serve
  cook this  squirts liquid shit all over your face with a super soaker and runs away laughing
  hate away if you need  was not expecting this
  gonna cook something  cleaver only edition  its about time where you been  one more saturday night  those mushies look dynamite     really what did you expect
  is there going to be a meat  i hope so   your not gay right
  lots of meat anon   also who needs to stir shit right  large as fuck rump steak  cut it up and cooked slightly then took out and cooked veges in the fat then added back with seasoning and shit just gonna add some sour cream a bit later
  ill be back later with more pics just gotta go pick up a present for my first born son   i like saying first born i dunno why it was a big thing in the bible i guess and im old fag
  almost done now  just gotta boil some pasta
  this has plenty of sauce for the pasta  anyone have any critique
  just gotta boil some pasta    you salted the pasta water right  looks good op
  haha even added some post boiled pasta water in sauce before draining pasta    this is end product i wont lie it tastes good but i am missing depth of flavour imma cook longer with more seasonings and then tomorrow its gonna be legit
  my cleaver can do everything bar fish i dont eat fish  cleavers are best kitchen utensil by far  not just a knife its so much more
  i am missing depth of flavour  thats because you didnt use a bay leaf
  shiiiit i have heaps in cupboard  thanks anon
  looks edible but im not about to write home about it    clevers are overrated too
    so fucking watery
  i would saute the vegetables a big maybe more browning of the meat  your depth of flavour might be helped by some savoury condiment like worcestershire or soy sauce or just some more salt  looks like an okay dish definitely a bit light in terms of flavour one step more intense than steamed if thats your thing its cool
  not in the end   always aim for too much fluid didnt you know
  yeah itll be gig tomorrow ive reduced down a bit with a few bay leaves and yes now you mention it why not some of that worcestershire sauce   thanks anon
  absolutely based
  liquid/10
  what is that huge sprinkling of herbs
  what i told you to clean tyrones jizz from your face hours ago  go to your room faggot if it wasnt for you taking it up the ass so happily by all the old men around the neighbourhood so you can pay your way id have kicked you out 6 years ago faggot  but you know that
  yeah its way too thin and that probably is why you dont taste any flavor youll be reducing that for awhile alternatively the shortcut is to make a roux and slowly incorporate your existing liquid or boil your existing liquid and slowly incorporate a mixture of cold water and cornstarch only do either of those once its very flavorful
  its for you to guess pretty easy
  yeah i was being lazy bc reasons  starting with a roux would have been ideal but i did not  inb4 faggot/cuck name calling
  well this is some shitty bait if i ever seen one  way too drawn out
buy cleaver  try to cut  it doesnt cut straight  ok this is epic
    even watery like that it could work if the liquid is flavourful enough though  use broth and some condiment and it will be a bit like a ramen soup or some similar dish where you can eat the pasta and drink the liquid  im sure if you try a bit you can work out a pretty good dish to make or improve onin the future
  clearly has never owned the best utensil there is to own    after adding some worcestershire sauce it all actually came together really well   im still wracking my brain as to why i let it become so watery i guess i thought the packet mix would thicken it all up more
  which is best cleaver to buy /ck/ on a 100 budget  i want one so imma buy it for my wife for xmas of course ill buy her another present
  i bought mine for 30 and it works well ive had it a year and havent had to sharpen yet use it 34x weekly   just did a google search and i see i can but 3 of the same one i have for 1495 lol  mine has a silver blade though
  it doesnt cut straight
  if you are not a professional chef no need to spend more than 50
a bullet
  get a unique one like i did  160  zero regrets as ill have it for life
ahh breakfast at work
  1990 called they want their keyboard back
i have preferences for men if thats of your concern
  the ibm clicky is the best keyboard ever made you fucking degenerate zoomer
  no cherry
  i used to have one of those at work when i was doing ibm mainframe database analysis/development and i loved it wish i could still have one
i miss mcdonalds bagels im not sure why they were horrible but that fucking steak and egg bagel was my shit
  i tried one a few years back and couldnt finish it the steak was not what i thought it would be i get steak biscuits at hardees and they are deep fried and heavenly so when i tasted that junk at mcdonalds i lost my appetite  but a few weeks ago i remembered that mcdonalds has bagel sandwiches i ordered the bacon egg cheese and ate it in the dark driving to work i had no idea there was a sauce on them and was to busy to check it out   that was a pretty tasty sandwich
  your bagels look different than mine  but steak egg and cheese bagel is definitely the best item on the entire menu here in the united states and i ate probably 10 of them when they had their 1 sandwich promotion that month so good      theres this company named steakhauers that delivers a raw meat 4 separate patties to grocery stories like walmart/publix if you can find them my store wont do business with them anymore theyre nearly identical to the steak piece of the mcdonalds
  vintage keyboard  greasy burger for breakfast  40 year old 300 pound government employee amirite
  (((bagel)))    (((at work)))
those fucking keyboards need to banned at work   if i cant hear my phone call because some fucking retarded codemonkey is working hard on that nodejs backed login page then you can fuck right on off
  using a model m at the office  you must really hate your colleagues
  how much that keyboard cost you seen them go for thousands
  its just an old keytronic rubberdome not even a clicky i needed it because anything is better than laptop scissor switches    only downside is that tinyass backspace
  there was a time when those keyboards filled offices and yet somehow people still chatted and got work done what exactly is your problem
when i worked this summer i ate chocolate pudding for breakfast 4 weeks straight  my stomach cant process food until 11 am
  (((bagel)))  (((at work)))  burn the papers and run sham
  i am asserting my dominance by making sure everyone knows that i type faster than they do
  what the fuck that thing goes for like 200 nowadays
  please dont tell me you put the ketchup in the sandwich
  filthy animal
  looks like a jizz stain from an exhuberant porn session
  there was a time when those keyboards filled offices  there was a time when amputation surgery was done without anesthesia too not a great argument
not a sausage boab from whataburger with your shitty work supplied dell laptop they give all the interns  checkmate boomer
  and in that time you would have had a private office
  hes eating at his computer of course hes a filthy animal that wasnt even a question
  eat shitty food  take picture of shitty food  go on shit website  go to shit board  post shit thread  follow up with shitty replies   go take a shit to shit out the shit food    having a shitty day op
  breakfast on a bun  i cant tell you how much alcohol these things have absorbed from my body
  try miles and miles of cubicles
  he already said people back then still understood each other with all the clacking  there were no complains  now whats your argument
  lol  i paid 40 for mine cleaned it bolt modded it and now it looks mint  you only see the ultra rare ones like the industrial colored ssks going for over a thousand
  oh god i love these they dont have them in seattle and i miss them so much
    lol yeah data entry monkeys would have been using ibm keyboards and they sure as hell wouldnt have had private offices you stupid motherfucker
  he already said people back then still understood each other with all the clacking  i dont care about understanding other people i care about not having to listen to clacking noises two entirely different issues  there were no complains  there were no alternatives either thats the point  now whats your argument  same as the first time around citing how something used to be bad by necessity in the past isnt really an argument for continuing to do things that way in the present when its no longer necessary
  they also dealt with typewriters prior to clicky keyboards
  yeah imagine an office full of these id go out of my fuckin mind
  ibm clicky  you dont even know what its called and youre calling others degenerates
  mine is from the 80s and is a month younger than me feels good man  im jelly of ops windows key though i never thought i would miss it
  at work  loud crumbling sounds as you open your wrapping  sound of someone probably choking on a fat dick as he tries to chew and swallow  clank clank clank clank randomly inbetween    you must be really popular at work
  you can literally buy model m style keyboards right now
buckling springs are sucky and overrated topre master race
  being such an antisocial cuck that you cant stand the sounds of human activity  please tell me you dont do this anon
  seriously though why are you eating at the desk doesnt your office have a cantina
  sound hypersensitivity is a classic major symptom of severe autism anon
  just a break room with one table its awful
    durr youre not normal if you dont love annoying loud noises  i know right my favorite is a tossup between repeatedly activated car alarms and people near my office loudly laughing at each others obnoxious jokes helps get my blood pressure nice and elevated its basically a form of aerobic exercise
  what this guy  said is true especially the american made ibm ones   those things could be tossed out of a three story window onto concrete and do more damage to the concrete than to the keyboard thats no made in china joke
  he doesnt have a private office with a door
nice model m i have one too
  no i do its not even an office if it doesnt have a door so i have no idea what youre talking about is your office door soundproof
  i know exactly how that feels especially when fuckers chew or speak with their mouth open if youre going to talk with your mouth open cover it as a courtesy i would visibly cover my mouth in front of the mouth chewer until he started doing it too finally realized its fucking wrong
  cantina  lol  and why the fuck would you want to eat around other people id eat any day in front of my comfy computer screen browsing this shithole
  work in an office with a lot of chinese/japanese tech monkies  a lot of them will get soups for lunch or some noodle dish  they make slurping noises for a solid hour as eat their soup    apparently this is normal for asian cultures so they dont even know any better
  that looks awesome
breakfast bagels dont have breakfast sauce anymore  fucking mccucks
how the fuck do people eat bagels as a bun the bread is so tough when you bite it all the contents squirt out the other side fucking americans
  its rude not to this is a custom based on the science of the olfactory sense by slurping you interlace air with the food for maximum flavor
i work at a 60 person office we have a break room i just get in my car and eat my lunch and cry
  there was also a time when typewriters filled offices and offices had three times as many people typing it would have been way worse if you dont make use of the benefits of technological progress whats the point of technology
  technology has arguably led to the decline of our civilization
  ted that you
  literally the best keyboard ever made
  im ted but probably not the ted you think
  hes correct though but he forgot to mention its responsible for the irreversible destruction of the planet
do wagies really do this dehumanizing
  roosevelt
  2kro  best keyboard ever made  this one always gets me out of all the hipster trash fads
  do you blame americans for your small penis too
  the mechanical keyboard and its consequences have been a disaster for the workplace

make a cake  call it a pudding  why did british do this
seriously what the fuck
call it a speckled cock  wtf
  not eating a bowl of warm spotted dick after a nice big plate of pork faggots
    because it isnt baked like a cake its steamed like a pudding
  i can literally make cake by microwaving the ingredients in a mug but its still called cake
make blancmange  call it a pudding  what did seppos mean by this
brits call all dessert pudding
  they call cookies biccies theyre best ignored
  at least you staircasetoothed brits know when to submit your inferior bushpagan languange to the superior fran√ßaise
    depends on context for example people would say whats for dessert or whats for pudding or in some areas whats for afters all the same a lot would say pudding though    pudding doesnt mean a particular food stuff  just means any old dessert in this case  just in the same way as referring to a shop as toffee shop or asking do you want a toffee does not mean its limited to only literally toffees
  would you like some marklar
  you british sound fucking stupid
pudding is a catch all term for dessert its like says    make a cake  call it a dessert    british english and american english are different languages
  if thats true then why is sausage called pudding see 
  mfw americanns call a neatysweety evening sugar pudding delight a dessert
    english not british and since the language is from england all english terminology is correct by default and everything else is wrong
  they dont even have crunchy spuddy saucy buttys
    its black pudding its steamed its blood mixed with oats and various seasonings
  needs australia on the right with chips chips chips
  well thats silly in many ways modern american is more conservative toward what all english was in colonial days modern british english has corrupted considerably faster than american english
  i dont know i went to england a couple years ago and got the full english breakfast and was expecting the black pudding to be a good sausage turns out its nothing like delicious sausage and in fact was just a grainy dry mediocre thing that had not noticeable meat flavor or texture
makes bread cake with raisins
  who the hell calls pringles crisps in america
  they are not renowned for their intelligence anon
  make cookies  call them biscuits    theres reasons we threw all their tea into the sea
  this sausage that contains no meat has no meat flavor  spastic
  i think the can calls them that since theyre formed from potato bits rather than sliced like a chip
good thing canadians dont have any cuisine to shit up this thread further only real anglo countries
  because pudding is classically a term for all desserts in england not just custards  
  what a fuckin circus of a country
biscuit
  circus  in bongian thats what they call a circle so youre saying britain is a circle of a country which doesnt make sense
  all deserts are called pudding and puddings are also called puddings figure that one out
do americans know what a jam roly poly is
  english not british  all englishmen are british
  but not all british are english
  you mean a jelly roll
  thats literally what they are in fact its a legal definition because its a different food product all together    chips are slices of potato  crisps are a potato based dough    you see here in america where we actually know how to speak we call different things by different names so people know what they are getting
  no jelly is the wibbly wobbly stuff i mean jam
  all british people talk like fairy tale faggots
  all americans talk like down syndrome
  they were sued for calling them chips so they changed the name no one actually calls them crisps
  why did british do this    well do whatever the fuck we want
  because it is a pudding puddings are defined as such by how theyre made they can be sweet fig pudding christmas pudding etc or savoury black/white pudding suet pudding they are typically quite dense and stodgy and are boiled or steamed they have been a staple in britain for centuries because they are easy to make very filling and can be made with all sorts of ingredients and herbs/spices most have fallen out of fashion as their usual function as a poverty food is no longer necessary but some such as black pudding and christmas pudding have become ingrained in british culture
    you mean a swirly whirly jelly girly
cold on the cob is still my favorite
  sausage is a pudding to brits so is baked dough
  see when americans hear sausage they rightfully assume a product is meat based turns out black pudding is unfortunately not anything like actual sausage or pudding
if soda was 30 a can how often would you buy it
a buliet
i make it at home for the cost of co2
  i dont see a sprite cranberry there anon
  as much as i do now
  welp looks like im going broke bros
  id just buy bottles instead
  2018  drinking liquid diabetes
  as often as i buy it now    never
  maybe a dr pepper
i might buy one can a year and savor it deeply
  id just make it too live fat or die trying
  why have there been two or more threads with the stupid pictures of knitted brand food recently
  soda has no calories
is there a buying in bulk discount
  you got a problem with knitted brand food or something pal
  i dont buy soda anyway you fat faggot
  id get a six pack on new years and go nuts
  ill give you a discount from my shop but you gotta pay freight  you pay me you pay me now
  no  leaves
i stopped taking the soda jew long ago   no either way
    water is already 350 a bottle at gas stations  more expensive than the gas  water  we dont care we have you cornered
  same as i do now about once a year when i get a craving for ginger ale
  i used to live in a rural area and this is what caused me to stop drinking soda 99 cents for a two liter bottle of mountain dew or coke and a fucking small bottle of water is 150
  buy the bigger bottles and they cost less you dumb kike
  where the fuck do you live its 1 for 16oz of water sometimes 20oz
same as now never
  never
  probably as often as i do now only in social situations so no one will think im some weirdo cause the major corporations didnt brainwash me into drinking their toxic sludge five times a day like most americans around me
  i wouldnt worry about it because i dont drink soda anymore
  depends on how much im getting paid
i would continue making kombucha at home for cheap or maybe transition into brewing root beer or ginger beer if i need something sweeter
  i like weed i smoke a couple times a week religiously    however i like soda more i would never smoke my weed with out my soda ready it was even like that when i smoked everyday    so id probably be somekind of soda dealer so i could afford it all the time
  about as much as i do now since i dont regularly dring that garbrage
  water here is like 2 per cubic meter aka metric ton  assuming i drink 3l/day this lasts me almost one year
  twice as much
  soda dealer  this is the most american thing ive ever conceived can you imagine when the west collapses methheads will make be making sprite in bathtubs
  well playedsir  ill get you next round  tbig sugar
  wasting even 025 on a can of carbonated syrup water
  never since i dont buy carbonated sugar water
  never just like now theyre one of the easiest things to shoplift
  100 melanin enriched individual
  as often as i buy expensive imported goods like japanese soda
  once or twice a year
as often as i do now    never
  by cutting out juice and soda all people would instantaneously lose weight
  well i only drink soda when its mixed with liquor so i guess id either stop drinking man up and drink my booze straight or drink beer exclusively
when i was little i remember hearing adults say something about drinking soda water is bad for you because it makes your bone brittle or something i guess its a myth but it kinda stuck with me
buy
  not true i gained weight after switching to water i havent had soda in months
  stop liking what i dont like
  even if soda was free i woudnt buy any
    do canadians really do this
  
  and
  how weak are those shelves
  yeah and two liters of water is a similar price  obviously a small bottle of water is going to be more expensive than two liters of water
  i drink 5 monsters a day  actually i cant remember the last time ive had plane water  thats what people a hundred years ago drank lol
  this
  those random busch beers singles amongst sosas are triggering me
never soda is already too sweet and artificial tastes like shit
  put the dr pepper in the bag and no one gets hurt
  how the hell do you gain weight after switching to water there has to be something else in your diet thats causing it
  blacks hadnt been invented yet
  5 monsters a day  plane water
never the only time i use soda is to make jack and coke
  plane water
  i live in australia so i just catch it from the sky checkmate atheists
  1939  not drinking a fine ale from the local speakeasy
  i wouldnt id switch to juice or something instead for a treat
   buying gas station single drinks and complaining that theyre expensive  youre a mong
  never id make my own
  plane water  please just drink some nice ice cold water man youd feel so much better
  i dont buy it now while its 40 cents a can so no
where will you order pizza from now that mr pizza is facing bankruptcy

  ugh no its dr hu dumbshit
  how much do you eat at once

what did you pick up tonight    im trying the cheesy gordita crunch and decided to do a doritos nacho cheese shell also got a modded fritos burrito and 5 layer for good measure    for anyone who cares i ended up going with the switch after not winning that fancy xbox even on cyber monday i still put down half a grand the price of an xbox one x with 3 games tax two day shipping and 70 in online credit i started with mario on my tv took me fucking half an hour to set up because i couldnt remember my wifi password and couldnt figure out where to find it and it was surprisingly unintuitive for a mario game switched kek to the handheld and started zelda and had a much better time i think the handheld is much better suited to my lifestyle  i dont go anywhere i just spend a lot of time in bed really happy with the new zelda so far but it almost seems more like an elder scrolls game probably wont be learning the piano any time soon
chalupaanon so expected you to add red sauce and onions to your five layer and a side of chips and nacho sauce    what happened
  what did you get for your wifes bull
  i only got the chips and nacho sauce usually guac as a sub for the shitty cinnamon twists
2 cheesey bean and rice burritos  12 beefy fritos burritos    thats 12001700 calories for about 4    if i ever grab it its basically right after work when i usually havent eaten yet the entire day
what in the actual fuck i thought id get a nintendo because it was always casual and easy but i keep fucking dying like ive never died before on a nintendo i stopped playing vidya when i got dark souls because it was too hard now i think its maybe just that everything is on expert level when youre always drunk i just want to get that fucking glider
  nintendo switch  underage or a soyboy
  if you want to call playing vidya underage or soy then go ahead though theres nothing wrong with soy just know that youre being a hypocrite by calling out a particular system if you also play games on something else the switch was recommended a bit more than the playstation when i asked here and it seemed more conducive to drinking so thats what i went with you realize this is the food and cooking and drinking board right
  breath of the wild is a lot harder than past zeldas because itll actually fucking punish you for not taking mobs seriously make sure to pay attention and use your environment see lanterns hanging from a rope in that skull cave you can shoot the rope with an arrow and itll bring the lantern crashing down making their barrels of flammable stuff go boom you can also sneak up on mobs when theyre sleeping or if their back is turned and make sure to gather all the damned shrooms and other shit you can find youll be very glad to have healing shit
  you realize that this is the food and cooking and drinking board right  yeah so why did you bring up your shitty choice of console in the op  couldnt figure out where to find my wifi password  oh youre just retarded my apologies
  id still rather do 1 5 layer than 2 bean and rice burritos those are just kind of boring
  ironically i just figured out that you have to into food and cooking to progress
  are you literally only eating taco bell every day  are you trying to do a supersize me but with taco bell
  had taco hell monday tried rolled chicken tacos i am disappoint
  i know youre trolling but why would anyone in their right mind buy a console unless they wanted to fit in with the annoying twats at work who discuss red dead    going further i had to listen to one of it fixing a twats computer today well sitting doing nothing but arguing about the gamecube controller being better than ps3 i had to get up and leave for a smoke before i garrotted both    jaguar controller wins anyway
  quesadilla meal  2 rolled chicken tacos with nacho cheese diet coke for the drink ofc hot sauce was delicious as usual    glad they got a new lto with the rolled chicken tacos  not a huge fan of the double chalupa
  based taco bell poster  i did the same thing eating those double chalupa boxes every day to win an xbonex but wound up getting a ps4 that 200 spiderman bundle was too good to pass up i kind of wanted to get a switch because it suits my bedbased lifestyle as well but i cant really think of that many games i actually want for it except doom and dark souls but i hear both those switch ports are significantly worse than on other systems
  sony faggots are just the worst
  good thing im not a sonygger you retard
  hows the pre appied red sauce i always just use the standard sauce packets as i eat
  bean and rice comes with jalapeno cream sauce which is  their shitty reduced fat sour cream in the 5 layer you can also swap in black beans for free with the cheesy bean and rice burrito since no meat normally  add seasoned beef and cheese and its more calories for cheaper if your poor you just get seasoned rice instead of an extra tortilla an extra tortilla with a micrometer of nacho cheese under it instead of thar micrometer you get a fountain of nacho and real cheese within mingling together lovingly along with the meat and beans  youre just eating a poor imitation of the quesorito in some good forsaken no mans land  then again this all depends on your own joint and their pricing i ask for light rice because i get more of the other stuff when i do but ymmv on all this
  taco bell every day  shiggy  my friend did this in high school and for a couple years later til he suddenly started throwing up for days in agonizing pain then he had to get his exploded gall bladder removed
  faggot
  youre fucking stupid because doing stuff like that will ruin the the loot they drop itll all be incinerated
  thats definitely not good for you but youre retarded some bitch ate nothing but mcdonalds chicken nuggets from 217 until she collapsed with anemia she had severe malnutrition and accompanying problems but that was about it she even looks somewhat bangable pic related  if niggers in africa can kinda survive on mosquito patties and dirt cookies 6 days out of 7 it shouldnt be surprising
    which is to say thats not why his gall bladder exploded
  bingbingwahoo device  the keyboard was just an identifier
  underrated
  i mainly was using it as an example you get a lot more ways to deal with shit in botw than past zeldas that plus at the point hes at he needs survival more than some boko fangs/horns anyway op most of your issues on the tutorial area get solved once you get the bomb power 12 later can upgrade to 24 damage no ammo just a cooldown which isnt global you can swap between sphere and cube bombs to alternate cds and it is a sizable explosion that has massive knockback
  its exceedingly helpful to have good recipes in the game the buffs you get from food can be life saving
  i ate the double chalupa box every night for 3233 days when the promotion was going on and usually got a couple other burritos that i ate for breakfast but i did eat things other that taco bell from time to time i wasnt doing any kind of challenge i just wanted to win that fancy xbox      i tried them when they came out and they were the worst thing ive ever had from tb you could buy literally any frozen taquitos and throw them in a deep fryer and at worst theyd be just as bad at a tenth of the price      im not trying to fit in with anyone i asked /ck/ about buying a console after every other reply was with the amount of money youve spent on taco bell you could just buy the xbox which wasnt true and a bunch of anons said the switch might be a good choice i also started a thread on /v/ on cyber monday and they were actually more friendly and helpful than /ck/ i mean i always thought we were one of the friendliest boards that actually gets crossposters im still getting used to the switch controls but that thing looks like a nightmare
  ill probably get doom but have both dark souls and skyrim on the ps3 and dont seeing myself buying them again for the switch any time soon as they kind of turned me off after demons souls and oblivion      the red sauce is the only thing that makes the burrito supreme kind of different  otherwise its basically a 5 layer burrito made supreme with lettuce and less cheese for almost twice the price its kind of just a red enchilada sauce so you still want to use the sauce packets      im literally still on the tutorial section and just finished the place where you can turn water into ice cubes but needed to make food with peppers to get to still havent found the 4th temple and really dont want to look shit up to get through the tutorial if this came out when i was whatever age i was when lttp or oot came out id probably be halfway through the main story by this point learning new things is hard when youre always drunk
  what even is this is mario considered soyboy now  i dont even know whats going on anymore
  anything you personally dont like makes someone else a soyboy they had to ban the word on /v/ because it lost all meaning
  i think its banned everywhere except /ck/
  this fucking trash  its like youre either a shill or youre a complete moron that hasnt been paying attention lately fast food is cancerous trash thats responsible for turning people into human cows and killing them with diabeetus    the food industry managed to fool two generations of people with their sugar/salt/fat trash but were on to their shit now nobody should eat that shit    kys op you cancerous faggot
  nah taco bell is pretty healthy youre thinking of mcdonalds
seriously why the fuck are the chicken quesadillas so expensive
  chicken  3 cheese blend  creamy jalapeno sauce  379    yeah ive never even considered ordering one of those
how fat are all of you
  beyong your wildest dreams my friend
  shredded mini chicken quesadillas are 1
any other switch owners here straight edge
  they look awfully bored for a mixed group playing drinking games is this an edit
  mixed group  what did he mean by this
  no its legit
  girls and guys usually a little more lively because sexual tension
  i always thought we were one of the friendliest boards that actually gets crossposters  crossposter here  /ck/ is definitely not the friendliest board
  well one of the guys is a faggot  and the girls while not completely ugly arent exactly showing off and theyre huddled together with the faggot while the only possibly straight man at the table works the game  while some faggot plays his video game in public while hanging out with friends from work  i wouldnt be lively in that group either  and who needs fucking cue cards to play a fucking drinking game the object is to drink
  ive never called straight edge fags or vidya alpha before  or even unironically used the word alpha  but at least hes just being like ill do me and you do you theyre already playing games in a restaurant to begin with and at least hes not dicking around on his phone pretending like he has other more important friends who hes for some reason not hanging out with    that said i like that the switch is portable but playing it out in public is pretty fucking gay
someone in another thread shitted on the fritos burrito and said they only get it if they replace the fritos with beans i tried it and it was shit it wasnt a good night in general at this particular store and why cant you substitute ingredients you can remove an ingredient without affecting the price but then they charge the exact same amount if you add another ingredient in its place
  unironically this when did nintendo become something to laugh at especially when their flagship game is a zelda that feels more like elder scrolls and dark souls
  i get a 12 taco box every time i go to taco bell
  fucking hell man foods so cheap over there a burrito like that over here in australia costs fucking 10 usd minimum    you fuckers have it so good
    the nintendo switch has been hijacked no one must know you have one
  because the people making your burrito actually get paid a living wage unlike here
  but why do you shill so hard  i doubt you are on an hourly rate so what id it 1k per month it wouldnt be more than that if you are doing this for 500 a month or less then they are fucking you up the ass op  i should know ive been there and taco bell pay the worst to shill for them   in australia now and red rooster pays really well 2738 per hour so im shilling away here on facebook in air con for legit wages  also red rooster has decent food unlike taco bell so i sleep well at night
  why would anyone do that
  nice fucking blog post you dumb nigger
  thats because the /ck/ mods are based and arent into censorship see this thread
  i really like the frito burrito desu
  where do all the calories come from though are fritos like coated in straight fat
  lol you serious why would anyone work at a fast food restaurant for a living australia must be fucked thats a job for kids and niggers
  ive slimmed a bit
  damn baybee looking thiccc
  american fast food restaurants are considered somewhat fancy dining in 3rd world countries
  welp i swore i wouldnt got tb tonight and even brought home food from work but went home and got drunk and just couldnt resist i decided to try a big menu item tonight and got the xxl stuffed burrito combo with a fritos burrito on the side for good measure but when i got there they claimed that they didnt get my app order so i had to just order the burritos there without the modifications and for a dollar less didnt get the taco and drink or the modifications i fucking hate the location closest to me when the fucking pajeets are working i pulled out my phone and had the confirmation right there but they sweared it wasnt in their system the xxl burrito looks pretty similar in size to the fritos burrito but its actually around 3 times the weight so it might actually be worth it
  so it wasnt bad but it was just too big to eat in one sitting and half the ingredients are cold so it was just kind of cold despite being grilled for 7 bucks or whatever id honestly go to the taqueria next door and get a california burrito that format just doesnt really work for taco bell
how do you know an egg is rotten before opening it im sick of this shit
just cook it in the shell and then eat it in the shell you will be able to tell if it is rotten if it tastes rotten
  a good egg will sink to the bottom of a glass of lukewarm water a bad egg will either sink very slowly or will stop and float before it reaches the bottom  also keeping your eggs refrigerated and paying attention to the best by dates helps give a rough estimate
  if you keep them at a constant temperature they wont get rotten
  how long do you keep eggs for them to go rotten ive never once had eggs actually go bad
  shake it if it is very liquid sounding its bad but if it takes a bit for it to make the sound you might just have shook it too hard and separated the membrane from the egg works 9/10 times for me sometimes the water trick from here works
put it in water if it floats its bad
  really this you have to be doing something horribly wrong with your life for eggs to be going bad
    can rotten baby chicks be hatched or do we call them retarded stillborn
  stick it up to your ear and if you can hear the ocean its fresh  chicken of the sea and all that
  i have had people say this about not only eggs but various other foods that arent supposed to go bad   believe me if it can go bad it will in my kitchen   ive had eggs potatoes milk everything   hell i even have old cans of soup that are years out of expiration that im afraid to try now
  no obviously because the cells fucking decomposed
  one life hack to prevent this from happening is to not buy more eggs than you need
  or to not be fucking retarded which he clearly is if half his kitchen is regularly spoiling
  fix your fucking fridge mate and keep a clean non humid kitchen
i live in southern germany and have never bought or experienced a single rotten egg in my whole life 43 years and that is with buying unrefrigerated eggs in my nearest aldi and sometimes letting them sit unrefrigerated another four weeks in my pantry before eating them
i bought a whole pack of eggs and never got to eat them its been almost 2 months and im afraid to touch them
  what is wrong with you refrigerate your tatos if you need to ive had milk go bad but thats because i was retarded and bought a gallon when i barely use it for anything other than cooking and baking
if youre cracking lots of eggs for one dish crack each of them into a separate bowl and give it a sniff test before you let it go mingle with the other eggs    i think they taught me this in high school but i live dangerously so ive never done it
spoilage increases microbial growth  creates gas inside the egg  if it floats its rotten
  how do you know an egg is rotten before opening it im sick of this shit    if you need to work fast and dont have time to fucking float your eggs or some shit just crack them in a glass before adding them to the common pool  if one of them is bad toss that one and get a new glass before continuing you can wash the rotegg glass when things are quieting down
i have literally never had an egg go bad on me these things last forever and you not refrigerating them serious question my advise is buy fresh eggs and make sure you eat them within 8 months
sourdough bread is for clam  chowder and crackers are for chicken noodle soup right something about chicken noodle soup makes sourdough taste  overpoweringly sour and gross and saltines while acceptable in clam chowder seem secondary to sourdough when pairing with chowder
  stop posting these retarded frogs you motherfucker i will kill you
oyster cracker master race op eats penises lol
bread is for stews  crackers are for soups  but desu a thin broth like whats in chicken noodle soup doesnt need anything to go with it you just end up making your cracker or bread soggy and gross
  do you have battletoads
  you just end up making your cracker or bread soggy and gross  thats the best part
  no frogposter its not
  whether you believe me or not i dont have any of those saved on my computer and i plan on keeping it that way
  i just dont get this line of thought with a thicker soup like tomato bisque i can understand putting a crushed up cracker in it or dipping your sandwich the broth is thick enough that it will coat it without completely destroying its form for a thinner soup like chicken soup itd be like dipping a cracker in water youd get a soggy cracker that would prolly fall apart youd have a bowl full of disgusting wet bits of cracker
  i like to place a cracker on my spoon and dip it in the broth and let it get soggy not so that it mixes with the soup but just so i have something to munch on while i wait for my bowl to cool down a bit    i actually enjoy soggy cereal too
  hmm  okay anon
  also i enjoy making my own broths so letting a cracker absorb the broth allows me to really savor it and everything in it then again i rarely eat my soup with crackers and if i do they tend to be unsalted
  i like frogs
  different types of sourdough bread taste quite different san francisco sourdough is deliberately quite sour but the bread i just baked using my own starter has no sour flavor at all

when was the last time you enjoyed pig snout
yikes
not kosher and definitely haram you bring shame to your ancestors and your children will have club feet
  it definitely looks /aesthetic/ but what does it taste like how does it compare to trotters
is it much meat
  imagine putting your dick in those nostrils haha
  the last time i ate a hotdog
  sniiiiiiiiiff
  haha that would be a funny prank anon lol
never had it by itself but we include it when we make headcheese lots of gelatin in it
  i would try it at least once just out of curiosity does seem more morbid than other slices of meat though maybe its because of the importance we place on faces for recognizing and communicating with each other that makes eating a noticeably facebased slice of flesh weirder seeming
  it was the summer of 2011
  yup headcheese is very nice
  wouldnt they be similar to human nostrils which are just cartilage covered in skin in that case id probably enjoy them if they were seasoned well since i eat the cartilage balls at the end of chicken bones
  are you african
  we prefer the term nigger

  last time i had anything to do with pig snouts was playing alice madness returns
  but thats racist
  dang beat me to it anon
  last time i kissed ur mum

  in what movie are they chewing on a pig snout and mustard squirts out
  your moms home movie
  based haha poster
  nah my ozark whitetrash grandma taught me that
  it was the primary ingredient in my last attempt at head cheese which ive only eaten a couple slices of managed to overcook it by forgetting about it multiple times so it came out chewy and tasteless        trotters have a bit of normal meat on them snout is straight cartilage the advantage to snout is that you dont have to fuck with any bones ears are my preferred type of pig bit but my current town has a dog treat factory so i cant buy them anymore

mexican tacos vs french tacos
  french burrito
  mexican burrito  meaty and manly   french burrito  gay and fruity
  french tacos are really disgusting pleb tier food
how did i do
  what are those two logs pork fish
apples
  well what did you do
  tilapia  the flour has paprika parsley flakes cajun seasoning and red pepper flakes in it
  i dont eat animals but it looks like you did well in preparing your meal good job
  tilapia  ew
the peas were boiled and then fried in the same pan as the fish with additional red pepper flakes added then mashed
  you did good son
  literal shitwater fish
  had to use it up thats why it was lunch and not supper
  anything other than tilapia wouldve been great  mushed peas look okay  apples are great but doesnt belong on the same plate in my opinion  shouldve had some carbs in there maybe potatoes or something
  how did you manage to smash and burst every goddamn pea i eat peas and they come out of my ass still spherical and whole and i chew my food  im not saying its a bad thing but was it intentional  simple solid meal would eat
  patato masher for about 23 minutes the texture is great
fishen chips with mush pee wery good op congratulations
   tilapia lol why what in the heck are you doing
  apple slices as a side dish  is this for grade school cafeteria lunches
nice 40 calorie meal what are you an anorexic dweeb homo you need some starch on your plate either potatoes or rice
  the fuck you eat you think plants grow on clouds after you blow kisses at them  hint its actually literal horseshit
  literally nothing wrong with it   lol eat dicks
the meat looks really good i kind enjoy talapia if its seasoned nicely id imagine the peas look good for someone who likes peas ive never cared for them pretty much the only vegetable i dont like although they are tolerable but the apples need to go its raw an just seems a bit out of place on the plate i wouldve rather seen some rice nonetheless 7/10
  shouldve had some carbs in there maybe potatoes or something  apples and peas are carbs anon
  great looking chicken  overcooked the peas and they became mushy  fruit is more of a snacking item isnt it not really something incorporated into a meal like this especially not apple slices   could use a starch and a sauce as far as the whole plate goes  looks nice anon
suburban white mom/10
  1 its fish  2 the peas are purposefully mashed  3 youre right about the apple slices i didnt have room to prepare the potatoes i wanted to make at the same time so i went with something easy to make
  cool i got 1/3
    apples   with fish and peas  what did he mean by this
  are fish and apples a thing where youre from
  theres nothing wrong with tilapia retard

whats yor fav food to get at 711 mine are pickels
  i love the hot dogs  load that shit up with chili and cheese till the box starts to warp
  god this  one of my fav time periods in my life was when my friend used to live by a 711  we used to get high as all fuck and get 711 food and bring it back to his place listen to techno beats all night and shit   his room was cozy as shit in the basement shut into a corner with bookcases  used to get the chili dogs all the time and just load them with chili and cheese the nachos are good too   taquitos are good but overpriced
  
    my brothers
contents pickle
lots of patriots itt
  oil flavored
  it says dil
  his country doesnt let him drench his food in chili and cheese for free  you have my condolences friend  pic related was my dinner last night
    clearly says dill you fucking idiots      huh isnt that an american poster you replied to
  god damn im jealous  when i was a kid my cousin would get me to go on her paper route with her on the promise that shed buy me a chili dog at the 711 when we got to it  one chili dog wouldnt fill me so id fill the other side with chili and cheese and get a spoon  was good shit as a kid im aware this makes me sound like a fat trailer trash fuck but im not  was just eatin good
  reddit image
  contains soy    they are literally trying to get rid of us and turn us into traps
  thought i was the only one to notice that
    mine are its a god damn 711 for the same money i can get superior food from many other places
  heavily processed soy is bad and its not just limited to this check the ingredients on all your favorite fast foods and i guarantee you there will be soy in it    stuff like organic tofu isnt bad because its minimally processed but when its used as a filler ingredient its low quality and bad for your body
  huh
      yes and
  turn us into traps  not seeing the problem here
  pickle rick wubba lubba dub dub
  god thats hot
  god youre hot
    based id get the buffalo chicken rollers and smother them in chili and cheese and the gross onions and pickled jalapenos that everyone has touched and spit in during the day too this is at a super america though no 711s in minnesota

  buffalo chicken rollers    love thoes
  i bet thats a great hangover cure just gotta drink the juice too
  ya
              good fucking shit boys       i actually love 711 food something about it is so comfy and almost fun obviously not great for you but any of that shit on rollers or other snacks are great     in south florida we have a jacksonville style hot dog that they sell at 711 that is spiced differently that i really likei cant find it online tho which is weird i do that with yellow mustard a bunch of diced onion and jalapenos likely with some new chips and a slurpee
  race war now

  my man
is being vegan white privilege every time i walk by a vegan restaurant in toronto everyone inside is always white and the prices on the menu are high af its weird because white people are a minority here too
i would deep throat all three of them so hard
god i hate canadians
  being vegan or having queer gender pronouns signals class far more than it does diet or sexuality
  maybe i think by proportion veganism is probably more popular among minorities but they never eat out strict rastafarians and other meme tier afro diaspora spiritualist traditions are big on it and so are sects of indian and other far east religions but theyre also all very much into austerity and asceticism too so once youve reached the strict diet level youve also reached the not going out to eat level
  well i mean vegans who dont do it for religious reasons
  white people be vegan like this   but brothas and pajeets they be vegan like this
  the act of not eating animal products isnt a white people thing obviously but vegan restaurants are for rich people so mostly white people  you can be vegan and poor obviously but those people arent eating at those restaurants they are eating at home or cheap indian places or similar
  the other night i bought a hobo some survival food bought a loaf of whole wheat bread plus jar of peanut butter was this vegan
  i would literally tell you to take it back
9 times out of 10 white privilege is actually class privilege but we refuse to call it that because upper class elite university cunts are the main people pedaling this bullshit
  then yeah i guess idk go get a sociology degree and cheat the government out of six figures to do a questionnaire study aboot it    exactly
  because in a weird sort of way if they shift their guilt towards something they cant change about themselves its better than just admitting theyre guilty of robbing the public at large blind by being government subsidized and charging what they do for tuition all so they can cover high six and some seven figure salaries among the admin and low sixes for every tenured professor while also building ever more lavish living and lifestyle facilities and charging money for materials like books mandatory for class when the same or equivalent info is available for free or minimum price paywalls online theyre doing all kinds of gymnastics to sleep at night
  education is bad
  brave man taking on three dicks at once
  i dont get why vegan would inherently be a privilege veggies fruits and legumes are much cheaper than meat props to those restaurants for scamming smug easily impressionable retards though
  kek
  that is broadly true but people with severely constrained resources will grab any source of food they can and commonly raised farm animals convert scraps grass etc into convenient nutrient dense things like eggs and milk not to mention the fact that animal byproducts are found at many levels of production of pretty much everything imaginable making highlevel veganism even more expensive
eh american culture kind of forces that meat is the main dish of a meal otherwise youll be malnourished and that meat has become much cheaper than in the early farming days
  universities  education  i guess a turd between two pop tarts is technically a sandwich so you win this round commissar
eating rice and beans is a privilege  found the trump voter
  biggest yikes of the day
  white people are a minority her  i hate this gay earth but yeah most vegans are white and upper class while vegetarianism is cheap veganism is kinda expensive for anything tasty  t ex vegan
  maybe it was maybe it wasnt if the bread had honey or milk in it it wasnt
  af  you can say as fuck on the internet you god damn n00b
  poop tart sandwich is 3 sandwiches 2 pop tarts  2 sandwiches plus the poop tart itself which equals 1 so 3 altogether
  (((upper class elite university cunts)))
  is x white privlege i always see white peopld doing weird shit    jews use their magic powers to trick white people into thinking they have no culture or history then jews provide them with a new culture in the form of identity politics/stupid diet fads and pump them for sheckles this isnt white privilege its social engineering shenanigans
  lets be honest with each other the average first world vegan isnt doing so out of a lack of economic options
    why arre women in toronto these least desirable creatures in the entire world
  yeah being able to have a super picky and specific diet that requires expensive supplements is a very privileged position
toronto is the worst city in the entire new world second only to san francisco
  how so
  thats a lot of tranny dick anon

  i wonder if i could fit all of that in my asshole haha
  tfw fasting  would love this right now
  the only true value meal left  lmao get fucked retard  carls and dq 5 meals are better
because kfc literally always has black employees
no kfc in my city 
  youre allowed to eat it its fast food
kfc always seems like a good idea but 99 of the time its a huge let down
if kfc started selling mtn dew baja blast i would have 5 fill up like everyday
fastfood  value  psh
  mcchicken  mcdouble  small fries  large drink  more food for about 70 cents extra an you dont have to eat kfc
  haha if it can come out im pretty sure it can go in too haha
bitch have you ever seen those meal boxes taco bell does
  only time ive eaten there the food quality has been shit its like a lesser version of popeyes the biscuit and chicken are much better there then at kfc
  i stopped eating kfc a few months ago when the one closest to my house remodeled and did away with their buffet     i miss the buffet kfc is so much better when you have a trough of gravy take from endlessly
popeyes has a 5 dollar deal too and popeyes is 800000 times better than kfc
  i generally like popeyes better but kfcs chicken and waffle sandwich is fucking tasty i will shed a single tear when the promotion ends
  im not driving all the way across town into the ghetto for kfc
  heh
i like their pot pies
  nice blog post
the ad campaign of the last few years has completely turned me off of kfc not to mention the overall drop in food quality that happened about 10 years ago i also hate the term fill up being used for a meal
  youre just mad the workers dead named you
they dont offer it here but here we have party baskets that contain a medium fries portion and a small bites portion and comes with cheese sauce costs as much as the large fries
  every single kfc i have been too has been fucking disgusting
  is that two burgers fries a cookie and a soda  jesus fucking christ america
  yeah but its a fucking small fry and soda   fuckin jews
  better in than out i always say haha
gonna spend 50 cad on kfc later today i love their poutine

i got the 18 piece bucket all dark meat
  when he spots a cute young boy
the kfc taco bell hybrid at regal cinemas country side in potomac falls is always good some hot latin mommas working there too sometimes

  pepsi  no thank you ill go to a restaurant that takes their food seriously
    why is american fast food so much cheaper then everywhere else
i dont get any of these meals that have a cookie give me more fries or a biscuit or something i could give a fuck about a cookie
  capitalism
  canada please leave      why is american fast food so much cheaper then everywhere else    its fucking inedible for one thing in america and we pay our employees as little as possible     and your weird obsession with us drives up prices for you guys colonel sanders never had any intention  of selling chicken in australia yet here we are
  because the workers arent paid enough to survive arent offered health insurance so the government basically subsidizes the companies with food stamps and medicare
    these retards seriously think youre meant to support a family by working at a fast food joint  this is fucking gold these jobs pay little because theyre meant for teens whore still in high school if you seriously think these burger flippers need high wages insurance etc youre braindead offering benefits and increasing wages would also decrease the accesibility of these jobs
  look at this retard not understanding economics what other retarded shit are you gonna say
  you seriously think these burger flippers need high wages insurance etc    i never said that go back to pol
  these jobs pay little because theyre meant for teens whore still in high school  well then why is the median age for fast food workers much higher than that
  do you understand the history of minimum wage or are you retarded
  probably immigrants     you implied it though    thats literally economics though if mcdonalds offered higher wages health benefits etc hiring would become more selective as it stands anyone can work there because the wages are low and managers dont see a new hire as a big risk
  the minimum wage is a holdover from when a big mining company or meatpacking plant or whatever it may be would move into a small town hog resources and basically hold a monopoly on job opportunities allowing them to fuck workers now we have laws against this sort of thing and people have more opportunities to find actual jobs if youre stuck at a minimum wage job and are after something better you can  learn a trade  go to school  work for the govt  enter the military  theres much more out there in the way of opportunity
  you used to be able to  now you cant but its meant to work this way its better i swear
  probably immigrants  heh i live in a medium sized american city and remember when fast food workers didnt speak spanish the median age is higher because they employ seniors and exfelons
  times change i dont know what kind of idiot lands his first job at a mcdonalds and goes yep this is it this is what im doing for the rest of my life common sense be damned    seniors  thats pretty sad
  probably nobody and yet there are plenty of people who get stuck working a job or multiple jobs like this without the means or resources to escape the cycle created by dumping all your waking hours into a workplace that doesnt compensate you enough to live off of in the course of a normal work week in order to meet their financial obligations precluding them from being able to gain qualification for or even so much as apply for other work and all of the money made from skimping on adequate compensation for labor is distributed to an affluent class     the idea that times just change as if by some force of nature is incredibly naive especially when even the most cursory of investigation will betray that this steady and consistent change is the result of a concerted effort by organized capital to reorganize working society to benefit an idle class
    i get the kentucky flatbread  popcorn chicken then upgrade my fries to a poutine shit is awesome
  thats 5 where i am
  explain to me how anybody is stuck working in fast food there are better jobs out there that wont even ask for experience if you cant find one you can always go to trade school or even college if you cant afford that and your shithole state wont help you pay for it you can go into the armed forces work in security etc theres plenty of opportunity out there
  opportunities are apparently endless  provided you have   the time and energy to commit to executing those searches  the resources/mobility to make it to those opportunities  actually live somewhere where those opportunities exist  all of which are things that are expressly denied to workers living in these situations which is exactly why socioeconomic mobility has been trending downwards pretending that its some sort of accident or thats just the way it goes is completely absurd its the direct and measurable result of decades long shifts in economic policy entire multibillion dollar industries rest on the ability to trap people in debt cycles and general economic precarity if youve ever had presence of mind to notice that even nice downtown centers have become spotted with payday loan services thats a perfect illustration of whats come of this    the apologist line has always been to demonize anyone who finds themselves in an economically precarious statethat only the stupid or lazy fall prey to these things and by extension the poor are stupid and lazy and thus deserve either nothing or simply need programs that will shake them out of their lazy spell its an incredible in the literal sense ploy in actual fact these institutions prey on a class of people who are one inciting incident from not being able to selfsustain and that net is cast across a much wider tax bracket than youd likely guess
  you dont have the time and energy to head to your local recruiting center you dont have the resources or mobility to take a bus to your local recruiting center you dont live by a recruiting center
  cause kfc chicken smells like piss when you take the breading off
  those things are 6 and 7 where i am now
i havent eaten anything kfc for nearly 20 years whats a decent combination to get for 16 aud
  people should have to risk getting killed in a war or becoming a legless war vet on the street just so they dont have to flip burgers for the rest of their life    mericans everybody
every time i have kfc the chicken is always way too salty   id also rather just get hot chicken
  youll make more than at burker king and you can work on base where fuck all happens you stupid memer
  this enjoy hepatitis
  why would anyone go to kfc if chick fil a was an option
  while i agree you can be some faggy pog but as an e1 you aint making shit compared to entry level fast food wages
  what is the chicken sandwich sitting on  why so few fries  the pepsi isnt even full  the cookie looks tiny
  kfc changed their recipe and their chicken again used to be halfway decent i could get the 5 piece tenders mash and macaroni for like 10 bucks and it was like 2 meals now its like 15 for all that the tenders are smaller and they taste like shit  the popcorn chicken and tenders box is fucking garbage now too shits like 80 breading and it tastes like ass too

my guinea pig gets apple peel sometimes

  im always scared of overfeeding her   dont want her to end up like beau nugget
my sisters cat liked grapes and strawberries and salt and vinegar chips for some reason
  you should be autobanned for using this picture stop hurting your cats you retards    nah he wants to eat everything but i dont care for cat diarrhea grass fed beef ground chicken or ground turkey  good post do this dont let your cats eat a bunch of fruit or other material they cant digest diarrhea and upset stomach would be your best case scenario for problems caused that way a worse problem is how pieces of the undigested material you poisoned them with can clump together and form intestinal blockages phytobezoar
    cats cant even taste sugar why would you give them fruit a dog can taste it but still cant digest it
  how should i know why a cat would like fruit some like it some dont
  why would you give them fruit  while their taste buds may not be able to detect the sugar it is fairly probable that their heightened sense of smell aids their enjoyment of aromatic fruits otherwise they wouldnt eat them at all
  fuck off shitlord people are allowed to feed their cats whatever they want especially if the cat wants to eat it     stupid fucking asshole
  not why they eat it why you would give it to them
    dont tell me i shouldnt let my 4yearold kid eat toothpaste how can it be bad when he wants to eat it
  it is fairly probable that their heightened sense of smell aids their enjoyment of aromatic fruits otherwise they wouldnt eat them at all  young children swallow batteries all the time you idiot do you think they must be enjoying the scent of batteries or they wouldnt swallow them
  batteries are delicious
yes i feed my dogs tons of fruits and vegetables every day they dont like fruit too much though apples and pears sometimes my husky loves watermelon and will eat it down to the rind perfectly also they like berries i go wild blueberry picking a lot and take them and they go nuts running around picking all the plants
friend has a dog that begs for pieces of orange and banana    if you crack open an orange hell come running from across the house he smells it instantly and just sits there with his head in your lap until you feed him some
  he cant taste batteries  get a load of the pleb i feel sorry for you and your shit taste
my dog would jump and pick apples and pears of the trees in my yard he would circle the tree and pick a specific one that he thought was ripe enough and wanted jump and grab it he wouldnt eat any off of the ground
eat carbs  become even hungrier  fuck you carbs
im gay btw

eat crabs  crab population slightly reduced  thanks crabs
why did retards stop eating carbs
  intermittent fast for a few weeks and you wont want to eat anything anymore
  youre a fucking retard
  hes not wrong though  most americans dont know what feeling real hunger really is and give in to their screaming fat cells to engorge them with insulin  then it becomes a negative feedback loop  you dont feel satisfied until you eat more and more to shut your fat up  then you die in the hospital at 61 after rationalizing the last few heart attacks you suffered through at home were just tests from god and not at all associated with your poor diet
  boohoo
  eat curbs  property value of neighborhood goes up  thanks curbs
  normies

do dogs eat carbs
  dogs eat anything they can fit in their mouths theyre omnivores
  dogs and koi are natural companions
  yeah i think dogs have some genes to help with the digestion of starchy foods they arent carnivores like wolves probably wouldnt have been efficient to keep dogs around if they could only eat meat
  eat empathogen  not hungry anymore for 3 days  thanks science
  eat food  now hungrier  ask me how i know youre a retard

2019 is year of the vegan what are you going to cut out of your diet first i personally will be cutting out all animals products at once  cold tofurkey
first post
  ur moms pussy
nothing because im not gay
  gluten  gonna replace it with lamb
  you like putting those big firm meat sticks in your mouth those nice firm salty meat balls in your mouth you have something to prove by associating your masculinity with eating meat huh like how notgay you are  you virgins are pathetic
  calm down faggot
  tofurkey  okay im not vegan and think theyre usually faggots who have a deep misunderstanding of base morality dont understand how companies really treat their animals/food dont even get me started about foie de gras something i had to even educate my own nonvegan father on recently conversation was a little awkward if im being honest and/or dont get what makes a good protein i also think that while organic right now sometimes with some foods that are labelled in very specific ways implies or even entails quality organic is still a fucking trend and eventually healthy gmos will help humanity out and possibly be better in a variety of different ways  yet even with all that i know youre full of shit if you mention tofurkey in the op
ive started eating vegan one day a week im not doing any of that processed fake meat chemical pig slop though just meals containing only fruits and vegetables i feel good on that day cleaner somehow but tbqh i never quite feel satiated could be psychological i suppose
  veganiggers are mad at literally all of history
  cutting out all animal products  still eats palm oil  doesnt buy fair trade  doesnt buy local  lol
  if you arent a pussy youre a pussy  why are liberal veganiggers constantly trying to suppress traditional masculinity are they afraid that they cant achieve it on a malnourishing plant based diet
  fpbpdbqhfampidesusenpaifam
  
  suppression of traditional values just another method the left likes to use to control as much of the population as it can
i will be rescuing cats from shelters and releasing them into the wild
  recycles an oldass format instead of crafting something original  hah see we can so maymay

you actually buy bottled water you know you can get it free from the tap right
  free
  well not free but a fuck of a lot cheaper than bottled thats for sure    dummies gonna dumb though
  tap water at my college tastes like shit  school store has the audacity to charge 38 fucking dollars for a case of water  bottled is a fucking scam filters are the way to go
i had the idea for selling bottled water in 1985 i could have been rich
  75 bottles for 38 is probably pretty close to the wholesale price though at my school they had a vending machine and it was 1 each
  does this system remove fluoride
  imagine being such a retarded uninspired female rapper than you name yourself after this
  what
  pretty sure its 24 bottles or about 150 each just dont shop at the university store      the whole system is designed to take your daddys burgerbux of course its a scam
  imagine knowing so much about terrible music that you get offended by a picture of bottled water
  
  its 38 for 24
not living somewhere where tap water is a quality
  what the fuck you can get a case for two fucking dollars dumbass
buys a case of 24 for 3 dollars at costco    wut
lmao at all these poor fags itt    i only drink fiji and grino
i cant relate to any of this    t living in the first world
  well we know you cant live in the us since usa is a third world country    we also know you cant live in europe since europeans have a weird hangup about drinking water that didnt come out of a bottle    we know you cant live in canada because usa is a third world country    so that leaves japan and taiwan which one is it
people who buy bottled water outside of exceptional circumstances are absolute brainlets and its the easiest way to filter out potential women
  t 700 pound ham planet drinking soda out of a sippy cup from the front seat of his suv
  no i dont drink soda juice or anything like that i bring my own refillable bottle or drink from the tap at home you fucking retard
  
  you carry it around in your hands all the time or do you have a giant purse
  most tap water in the usa is pretty good but some is crap like in south florida that crap tastes and smells like sulfer its nasty even more nasty when i have a hangover
  enjoy your floride
  well you either buy a bottle of water and carry that or carry your own bottle of water i also have a car to put it in or a backpack if need be
  going outside  fuck off roastie
  enjoy your flying saucers and lizard people from alex jones
  yeah ill enjoy my good teeth if you believe the fluoride meme you also probably think mercury in vaccines is going to kill you
  bill clinton is a rapist

  im glad im not the only one to notice that
  enjoy your decreased iq modern slave        muh thienth guberment has muh best intwest at heart    moron im 100 you gubble down gmos on your sad because its all you can afford same reason you drink from the tap poorfag    it says dont swallow toothpaste but you drink floride all daym brush your teeth like a normal person retard
  thats a compliment coming from the likes of you
  good response redditor    hows about another chlorine floride cup of former sewage water to wash it all down    mmm you slaves drinking good
  whats your profession
    i said refillable bottle you fucking brainlets you spend 5 dollars once and have a bottle for years and just fill it up at home or drinking fountains or whatever       now you are on gmos kek fucking kill yourself you stupid sheep do some real literature research and get back to me
  fucking hate retards who say this bottled water has very subtle differences only those with a refined palette will notice if youre gonna sit here and tell me dasani tastes even remotely close to arrowhead then im gonna fuck you in the ass you god damned queer
  you dont buy the better tasting high vitamin organic food because you eat factory farm slop which is only in existance to feed the never ending nigger and spic and white trash population    you are a fucking modern day slave and you eat a slave diet      fucking ur mom
  you realize that bottled water is just tap water repackaged
  you sound like an easy target to rape
2018  not drinking well water  plebs
  gmos are nutritionally enhanced you faggot people who buy strictly organic are almost as dumb as people who only drink bottled water
  he lives in a municipality with flouridated tap water
does filtering water change the taste  i used to drink and refrigerate tap water but in my new appartement i cant stand the taste
  i guess but youd usually just get used to it anyway like we always get used to everything
  costcos is like 3 something for 40 if you buy the store brand
  retard alert
  nah i only drink fiji and grino     lmao at all the poorfags on ck
  gmos are nutritionally enhanced  imagine being this much of a deluded monsanto bootlicker
  depends on what type of cartridges you install the sedimentonly ones dont remove flouride but others do
  now you are on gmos kek fucking kill yourself you stupid sheep do some real literature research and get back to me  dont you monsanto shills have a 300 million lawsuit judgement to be trying to spin in a positive light get on it everyone is laughing at you
  i work for pepsi this are not supposed to be sold as whole units because they only come like that to be broke down and sold cold they got this packages for less with that understanding report them to pepsi and they will have to actually buy the packages marked for resale
  these
    monsanto is such a shitty company they literally had to rename themselves this year
i pay 2 bucks for a 6lt gallon dont trust those ose fuckers at least once a month they cut the water and once per week the water comes all muddy fucking pieces of shit
what kind of shithole do you live in      i can get a 24 case of water for 88 cents
  taiwan  first world
  i prefer the tap water from the village i grew up to any mineral water ive tasted in summer i crave that cold stuff straight from the tap has a soft taste with a hint of sweetness
  we also know you cant live in europe since europeans have a weird hangup about drinking water that didnt come out of a bottle  only in southern europe i rarely see anyone buy or drink tap water except when traveling or at a canteen or restaurant    i was surprised the water even in la tasted pretty neutral expected some chlorine taste or other bad taste like in major european cities
  
  aww how cute it thinks thailand is taiwan    
  she looks like sarah sanders huchabee
  kek probably thinks like her too
  you can set up a job interview every day of the week to get free coffee swindled
  bottled is literally just filtered tap water anyway
living in germany  tap water actually more tested and delicious than bought
live in berlin for the summer  everyone buys water and orders it bottled from restaurants because they dont like how the water tastes  read that its not unsafe just has a bit of a strong taste  start drinking it  its totally fine even a kind of good taste  i think yuros are just picky
  ive only come across that egg water shit once and i just chose to be dehydrated after holding my nose and downing one glass i cant imagine trying to choke that shit down with a hangover
raw water is the thingie not sure what it means
    cumulative urine output at 4 h after ingestion of cola diet cola hot tea iced tea coffee lager orange juice sparkling water and a sports drink were not different from the response to water ingestion    a suitable allowance of water for adults is 25 litres daily in most instances an ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 millilitre for each calorie of food most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods if the last crucial sentence is ignored the statement could be interpreted as instruction to drink eight glasses of water a day    back in 1945 the food and nutrition board of the national research council stated that adults should take in about 25 liters of water per day which is roughly the equivalent of eight glasses of water but it also noted most of that intake level was already satisfied through the consumption of food without the need for the additional drinking of water    over the last few weeks those who visited the british medical journals website might have noticed an advert for a new public health initiative hydration for health it is sponsored by danone  which owns the evian volvic and badoit bottled water brands  and urges healthcare professionals to encourage people to drink more water claiming that evidence is increasing that even mild dehydration plays a role in the development of various diseases  margaret mccartney a gp and columnist saw these adverts and complained about it writing an article for the bmj who admitted we hadnt followed our own guidelines the advertisement bypassed our editorial checks about the lack of evidence  and citing the shortcomings of many studies  that people should be drinking more water
    i didnt say i like monsanto i like gmos they are not synonymous not surprisingly no one has presented quality peer reviewed papers on the apparent health risks of gmos in general or the addition of fluoride to water you can very easily find peer review stating that gmos are in fact nutritionally superior and that the health effects due to fluoride edition are negligible google either and you will be filled with results for you to debunk    why do you retards always insist on disregarding science its always some big conspiracy
  good goy

  so youre just kind of dumb i guess
  wait what
  huh
  which one will cool down fastest i thought we all knew that a large shallow pool of liquid will freeze faster than a deep narrow pool of liquid you apparently have never considered this
  what do you mean
  pour a cup of water in a large baking tray versus a cup of water in a mason jarwhich freezes first
  
  thats becuase more of the surface area is exposed to cool air but that doesnt apply to a volume of liquid in a container sideways or not the same surface area is exposed the same
  thats just stupid anon it would freeze faster in a large tray because more surface is exposed but changing the position of a container doesnt increase the exposed surface if it does go faster it is because the container touches more of the solid surface of the fridge/freezer which has much better heat transfer than air
  which of these each filled with one cup of water would freeze the fastest if your life was dependent on it which would you use
  we joke about it but how horrifying were lucky to live in this time
  the same timeline that a tweet from a random person ten years later with no evidence can ruin your career/make you a social pariah
  the largest one since the water would lay flat have a larger surface area exposed to cold air but that would matter in a soda can that is practically filled to the brim leaving only a small air pocket that would insiluate it more than the bare metal
  we are going back to the exact same problem whats your point it doesnt actually matter with an identical closed container if a bottle full of liquid was suspended in mid air in a fridge it would freeze as fast whether it was suspended vertically or horizontally  i ultimately agreed that it does go faster just not for the reason you said
  beer bottles have an air bubble in the bottleare you missing that
  air is still terrible at heat transfer compared to most solid surfaces  once again its not because of the increased surface exposed to air but the increased surface exposed to a solid plus stuff i drink doesnt usually has a giant air bubble in it just a small one that wouldnt cover the length of a bottle put horizontally  once again youre right just not for the right reasons
  bro youre a witch
  i would toss it immediately
  at the most you get some criticisms if its very offensive and your employer finds out then its possible but that doesnt happen often anyways it doesnt compare to being killed for something someone just suspects you of that you know you did not do

  touches more of the solid surface  a cylinder laid sideways only intersects a plane by a line

what are some good restaurants/places to eat at in toronto
get some street meat my guy
what do you mean by good
  why momofuku by david chang toronto of course
  i just want some good food man      is this meat you find lying in the streets
  chinese food
  he means vendor food you have to get a hotdog outside the rogers centre
    grey gardens poutinis
is kegs steakhouse good  also whats the best place to get maple syrup covered stuff
  the keg is a chain anon you wont really find any good places to get maple syrup covered confections youre better off looking for an independent grocer to just buy some authentic maple syrup
all the good places are out of the downtown / financial district theres a momofuku tho   although they are all literally fusion or bistro type places head to the distillery district tho christmas market is open and theres some decent food places there    if you want good food you gotta head to port credit or burlington neighbouring cities
  get one of those little scooters that are powered by a solution of maple syrup and pure unbridled ego
here you go fella  
  burlington sucks ass t oakville cocksucker
  oakville is shit i grew up there snobs and coke heads shitty roads and overpriced bullshit restaurants and malls   burlington is far better
  montreal is where the good food is
  youre probably not even actually from burlington youre some sauga cunt
  id kill myself if i had to live in sauga
  we can agree on that then you have to go out of toronto to get the best restaurants but the best restaurant ive ever been to however is borealis in guelph so thats all the way out of the gta
  north york pleb here hit up koreatown grab some tasty ass fried chicken up by finch or sheppard on the yonge line hogtown pub is good cozy distillery district is nice this time of year too plenty of nice little bars and such there dimsum in chinatown is always great congee queen is a local chain but has pretty reasonable and reliably tasty real chinese food     where are you coming from op like what are you looking for torontos big appeal apart from copypasted hipster bars is the asian food
makers pizza is preddy gud if you want good jerk and roti go up to the 400/401/albion area tons of good places there ginger just south of bloor on yonge is also good shit dirty food in the junction has really good pierogies and the cider house in roncesvalles has had i havent been in a few months the best habanero lime chicken wings ive ever had not to mention a huge cider selection if youre a big fag like myself    t the only person in this thread who actually lived within the borders of toronto and not the suburbs

  toronto just isnt a good foodie city for tourists you need to spend more on transit to get places than the actual food
  last time i was in toronto someone took me to a place called local it was good i recommend the fish and chips  
  not anymore we now have a 2 hour transfer system so you can take as many trips as you want off one fare for 2 hours
  stay away from liberty village its just a new condo area
  the fancy new street cars also have no means of checking you paid unless they have a blatant faresman separate from the driver just hop on for free
  yeah thats true just make sure you dont pull up to any stations because sometimes they will have people checking at the station but never in between
if you got the dough get some kobe at jacobs and co very nice if you dont mind dropping a stack on dinner
  its not real kobe beef
oddseoul in korea town is pretty damn good its a mix of canadian and korean
  i was thinking chinese steaks breakfast wanna drown some waffles/pancakes in maple sizzurp      can you ask for a glass of water to go with your steak to minimize the costs
    also poutine and street food in general if theres any
  i went to a crepe place that was pretty good and saw an army truck towing an artillery piece
    wait no that was vancouver dont go to toronto they all drive like theyre from a third world nation or something i saw a halal meat truck blow through an intersection into the oncoming traffic lane then block it so the driver could back it out into the intersection and make the turn he was supposed to some other guy on a bike got hit a few days earlier  theyve got a lot of good ethnic food though kinsington market has some good options and i saw a pretty good looking french/moroccan place
  theres no street food in toronto retarded regulations its only got dog carts and shit no food trucks unless its infront of nathan philips
place near airport greasy looking but good cheap food breakfast was like 5 pounds of eggs potatoes and bread for like 6
  lol zets
head downtown to the bus terminal and you shpuld find a shitton of ethnic restaurants i usually go to this indian/pakistani place but ive also had good ramen thai and other stuff there as well its impossible to not find something you want to try there
i had a lamb shank at rickshaw
  yes it factually is
    whats in port credit    i always cycle along the lakeshore in the summer and the streets are full with people on patios i just assumed they were dumb faggots trying to feign good living
  theres nothing good in port credit desu good mississauga restaurants though would be shanghai house leelas roti on a bun marconis nickys lucas pizza applewood fish and chipswatan kebab

salad king for some dank ass thai
  depends where you are    rol san on spadinas always been good to me as stated we have a momofuku near the hilton on richmond qmp on dundas actually makes a pretty mean pie penelope moves around but when they were near the cn tower they had some of the best roast lamb id ever eaten    what are you into if youre anywhere near downtown a short walk will take you to a few dozen pubs and restaurants for the most part you can trust the yelp reviews
  there used to be one in kitchener also out of the gta but still accessible by go did they move or branch out
    best place to grab a burger and a beer at 4am

    went through very rough patch a few years ago  drinking was out of control paired with some mild/medium mental illnesses  end up living in my car for a little bit  cut off contact with everyone and just sleep and drink 40s in my car and think im being followed everywhere and that i can control the world with my thoughts  after a few days realize i need some kind of actual food for sustenance  stroll into grocery store  see imitation crab meat packs  have always loved that shit still do  think if i eat some it will settle my brain down no fucking clue why i thought that  grab 4 or 5 packs and take them into bathroom stall  shovel them all down my throat and flush all the wrappers down the toilet  of course toilet clogs and starts overflowing with my stolen krab wrappers swirling on top  sprint out of bathroom pants drenched in toilet water  run out of store covering my face so the cameras the cia installed in the store to track me cant detect me  get back to car and speed away like i just robbed a bank    its ok everyone im much better now

few years ago became convinced for about 5 months that my bones were calcifying   thought i was getting that disease where your body slowly mummifies and this was causing it  started to really worry refused to do anything for myself  laid in bed all day trying to stay as still as possible  everytime my hair moved i got really panicked thinking it might snap off a piece of my mummified scalp   parents got mad and decided to snap me out of it  refused to make me any food  for 2 days ate nothing decide i would either die or they would feed me  i am a big man though nearly 400lbs so this was a struggle for me  got really fucking hungry  managed to throw myself out of bed and crawled along the floor to the kitchen slowly  ended up fucking crawling to the kitchen convinced that every movement was snapping my bones and shattering them  managed to grab some tins from the cupboard on the floor level and eat the food out of them  tfw only snapped out of it because my parents bought a bunch of white wallpaper and put it around my room at night and told me you were vomiting up these bits of bone in your sleep i guess your bones fixed themselves
  what the fuck anon that kind of behavior is consistent with someone whos like 5 or 6 years old but you were 400 pounds do you have some kind of mental illness
  i didnt realize brits could get that fat
  how are you now and what do you think about your condition then at this point

so i broke my back skiing right not super bad but i was in a brace and couldnt move much for 6 weeks a good friend of mine went out and did my food shopping for me each weekend except one weekend he was out of town and i said it was cool but then no one else i knew nearby was available to help me this was before internet food shopping was a thing    so i survived 3 days on a 1kg jar of nutella and milk    fun fact if you eat nothing but nutella for 3 days it comes out the other end looking the same as when it went in
  how did that get you food

omelette aux pommes de terre et gruy√®re
potaytoes  do you have to precook them i cant imagine theyd cook enough in the time it takes to make an omelette
  no he said ground apples
  i usually grate them never tried them in an omelette though maybe grinding works better for that
  so poor all you can afford is ground potatoes
  no i can get apples just never thought about grinding them  i think im getting a new grinder for christmas ill try it then maybe have some apple sausages or something
go vegan  die  hehe  
  enjoy your ban
    if whites are the master race why are they only ones that do this

  mad lad
too much meat and cheese fucks up your body  no meat and cheese at all fucks up your body    why is the idea of a balanced diet so out of vogue
  analysis of studies show that eating unprocessed meat does not actually increase your risk for heart disease or diabetes  what is there left in your brain to make you think meat is bad for you  why would it be were made of it
  because white people are more affluent on average and thus have greater freedom to decide their diets an inuit cant go to a whole foods for granola when seal is all there is
  too much protein in itself can have severe effects on your body such as gout and can kill you if you already have malfunctioning kidneys that cant deal with overwork again moderation and balance is key you need vegetables for important nutrients for your metabolism and carbs to provide energy so the body doesnt need to consume itself
  i think india is the country with the highest percentage of vegans/vegetarians
  the truth is so unromantic  eat reasonable portions and exercise no that cant be right
  analysis of studies show that eating unpracessed meat does not actually increase your risk for heart disease or diabetes  not him but im pretty sure theres decent evidence for red meat and cancer not just processed meat    studies in the last decade provided an overwhelming support that high consumption of fresh red meat and processed meat are associated with an elevated risk of developing bowel cancer especially colorectal carcinoma as well as stomach pancreas and prostate cancers  im sure you could find certain specific studies that argue what youre arguing but i dont think youre right to suggest theres some sort of general consensus that unprocessed meat consumption has no cancer risk tied to it    why is the idea of a balanced diet so out of vogue  extremes are appealing because theyre perceived as nuclear options that aggressively and thoroughly solve whatever problem they apply to eating some meat and some vegetables is something you tend to imagine most everyone does most everyone has problems so both vegans and high meat consumption keto dieters would rather roll the dice on an approach different from the one the masses take and have the possibility of a large payoff on a large risk than they would stay in the middle and have some muddled combination of little payoff with reduced risk also theres a concept of cumulative extremism where vegans and high meat consumers keep antagonizing each other which makes them continually double down and become even more extreme out of contempt for the other side
vegans are malnouri    
   of studies show that eating unpracessed meat does not actually increase your risk for heart disease or diabetes  no way there are currently sufficient raw meat eaters with a reasonable cohort to do an epidemiological outcome comparison maybe if the diet explodes like atkins/keto did then in a couple decades you can do that at best you could do some short term risk factor comparisons  which isnt all that useful    comparing say normal people against eskimos or even traditionally living eskimos against sedentary eskimos is completely fucking useless  too many variables changing
  lel vegans bodybuilding
i make videos about eating raw meat the natural human diet    this is what carnists actually believe
  why did you quote yourself also nobody said anything about raw meat we were talking about unprocessed meat processing doesnt mean cooked
  more than one of those people are on steroids of some kind and plenty of bodybuilders have horrible health issues even though they have big muscles
  lol these two girls have jaundice and that guy apparently just abused steroids without eating since he looks like christian bale in the machinist
      bodybuilders strong men and pro athletes eat crazy diets in huge amounts regardless of whether its vegan or something else cant compare them to regular folk    vegans like in the video love to talk about how nourishing and energising their diets are while they look barely strong enough to pick up a fork or stop themselves from falling asleep
  that video was also cherry picked by a mentally ill individual who eats nothing but raw meat and believes the nwo is trying to turn people vegan to kill them    what regular people do is not pertinent to whether its possible to eat vegan without being malnourished the average meat eater is overweight and dies of heart disease
  the average meat eater is overweight and dies of heart disease  the average age for heart disease onset is 65 for men and 70 for women and heart disease is easily the most common death cause of any kind so thats a pretty retarded argument
  most of these people are raw vegans/fruitarians    im mostly vegetarian so i drink milk and yogurt and whey for protein and im perfectly fine
  only fit vegans take steroids   lmao
  im not vegan but ill give my retarded input anyways  cool    i drink cow pus for protein because i dont know what a legume is  gross
  thats not an argument against eating meat but the idea that what regular folk do has any bearing on what a healthy diet is vegans are extraordinary by virtue of watching what they it while the average person doesnt    heart disease is easily the most common death cause of any kind  hmm i wonder what all those people have in common
  what does the average person have in common with other average people  a shit ton more things than just eating meat i dont think you thought this through also the point is dying of heart disease in old age isnt a negative its not like living a couple years past 70 and dying of cancer instead is a great improvement
  what the fuck are you talking about i dont think you got that machinist reference the post isnt saying only fit vegans take steroids its saying that guy looks like a malnourished freak who doesnt eat enough but also abused steroids
  balanced diet  now youre just talking crazy
  cow pus    so i guess we just feed our babies human pus until theyre old enough to eat cow meat
  so i guess we just feed our babies human pus until theyre old enough to eat cow meat  was your mom kept sedentary in a confined factory farm repeatedly hooked up to a milking machine multiple times a day and dosed with bovine somatotropin to increase her milk output with the aggregate effect of those productionready conditions causing mastitis and the pus that goes with it stop being such a retard youre almost managing to make the vegans look reasonable
  was my mom kept sedentary in a confined factory farm    yes and id thank you for not bring it up
  i love pus though so im going to keep drinking my pus thank you very much
  topkek
  hm so its a high risk high reward psychology behind it sounds about right
  wow i watched the whole thing never knew it was that bad
  you must be pretty desparate anon thats why you keep posting the same shit over and over are you a bot or do you get paid for the bullshit
  that wasnt too obvious
  cope
  fried meat and burnt meat are probably the culprit for the stomach and colon cancer regularly eating lactofermented foods and or cruciferous vegetables has been shown to reduce the cancer risk of meat so eat your meat and eat your vegetables and try to avoid charring/ blackening meat over very high heat
  and how do you cope with atherosclerosis you yell fake news i guess
  carnivores so fragile
  same way you cope with losing your teeth
  fried meat and burnt meat are probably the culprit for the stomach and colon cancer
  nice strawman im a vegetarian but continue to chimp out fatass
  
  what are the safest methods of cooking meat eg saut√©ing boiling broiling or barbecuing  cooking at high temperatures or with the food in direct contact with a flame or a hot surface as in barbecuing or panfrying produces more of certain types of carcinogenic chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic aromatic amines however there were not enough data for the iarc working group to reach a conclusion about whether the way meat is cooked affects the risk of cancer  is eating raw meat safer  there were no data to address this question in relation to cancer risk    that doesnt support your claim at all
  yes it does but i guess you also believe that jesus rode dinosaurs so i dont realy care about your opinion
  cooking meat produces carcinogenic chemicals  what about raw meat   idk we didnt check
  what the fuck are you talking about im not doubting evolutionary biology you idiot i posted the relevant lines from your link that contradict the bullshit you were claiming there is absolutely nothing in that link backing up your claim that fried meat and burnt meat are probably the culprit for stomach and colon cancer the closest thing there is the line about how cooking at high temperatures produces more of certain carcinogenic chemicals and thats a completely different claim from frying / burning meat probably being the culprit for stomach and colon cancer your link even tried to spell it out for you by explicitly stating right after that sentence how they werent able to reach a conclusion about whether the way meat is cooked affects the risk of cancer along with another line shortly after that one which points out there wasnt data to support the claim eating meat without any cooking would be safer in relation to cancer risk let alone frying or burning constitutes the entirety of the cancer risk in a way where removing cooking from the equation would drop the cancer risk to zero
  lol tldr
    how can i be exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs commonly enters the body through eating grilled charred charcoal broiled or contaminated meats or foods    what happens when i am exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs exposure to some pahs can cause irritation of the eyes and breathing passages   cancer    also  
humans evolved over millions of years eating a balanced diet of meat and plants  some dumbasses think changing that diet will make them better  end up dying  ever seen vegan pets look like death
  saying high temperature cooking produces more carcinogenic chemicals isnt the same thing as claiming thats the cause of the cancer risk found with meat consumption you retard thats not even claiming its part of the cause which they explicitly pointed out for you in the very next sentence just because high temperature cooking creates more of certain types of chemicals classed as carcinogenic doesnt mean you get to claim thats the cause of the meat consumption cancer risk there isnt a single person on the planet not being exposed to carcinogenic chemicals at some point or another identifying a carcinogen doesnt tell you anything about modification of cancer risk on its own thats like saying because you found a bottle of tylenol in the room of a guy who killed himself that you dont need to do any tests to figure out what killed him since tylenol is known to cause a thousand or so deaths each year
    go ahead say you were wrong its ok were all anonymous here
  oh boy ok whatever go be a vegan lmao
  hey idiot no nobodys denying carcinogens are created by high temperature cooking thats not the same thing as evidence that high temperature cooking accounts for the increased cancer risk associated with unprocessed meat consumption in fact we can pretty confidently say it isnt the explanation because its unprocessed red meat in particular that this increase in cancer risk is for and we dont see the same increase in cancer risk for unprocessed white meat
  any group has aberrations
  epidemiological studies have shown that environmental factors particularly diet play an important role in colon cancer susceptibility 56 it is estimated that diet contributes to 80 of the known colorectal cancer cases 7 in this context understanding the role of environmental chemicals that contaminate food or diet during its preparation towards the development of gastrointestinal tract cancers is important though several environmental chemicals have been implicated as the contributing factors to crc in humans one group of chemicals the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs fig 1 have generated the most interest as they are formed in red meat cooked at high temperatures   
  i eat meat why are you this prone to making retarded and unfounded assumptions out of nowhere    youre wrong im right and its not even close read dummy or at least do that thing you keep doing where you point your eyes in the direction of words and then infer bullshit that isnt actually written there  
  fucking stupid   medical science cant prove shit about peoples diets and cause for major medical issues     a perfect example is how some people can drink alcohol like a fish and will never show signs of severe liver damage yet some people can go their entire lives without getting drunk once and die from liver disease     cancer is more about your broken genetics and random mutation of cells than what people eat obviously other factors play as well but thats when people are taking literal chemicals that should not be consumed at all and people consume them like smoking cigarettes or breathing in asbestos
  from your link  both content and type of fat in diet have been reported to promote the development of colon tumors rats and mice that received a highfat diet developed more colon tumors compared to controls that received a lowfat diet intake of fatty diet has been associated with colon cancer 157  and once again nobody is supporting your retarded claim fried meat and burnt meat are probably the culprit for stomach and colon cancer do you even read your own links here
  why are you so mad do you have colon cancer and refuse to believe it was from your shitty diet or something what are you trying to argue   i said fried meat and burnt meat are probably the culprit for the stomach and colon cancer you said prove it and i have linked multiple sources stating that charred meat produces carcinogens that are suspected of being a major factor in colon cancer and then you just try to insult your way out of it
  medical science cant prove shit about peoples diets and cause for major medical issues   arent you the same guy who said red meat causes cancer make up your mind
  im mad because youre an idiot whos repeatedly failing to understand everything were trying to discuss you might not understand that sort of frustration works what with how youre an idiot
      seething fat boys im sure your bodies look great huh
  some other factors might play in to stomach cancer therefore ot cant possibly also be this other thing too
  this  they made a documentary following 20 people who only eat meat they ended up really sick  
  like this one literally says eating grilled and charred meat can cause cancer what is there to argue
  one of my childhood friends went vegan and had kidney failure as a result im not saying a competent vegan diet isnt healthy but veganism is not safe for your average lazy eater
  i have linked multiple sources stating that charred meat produces carcinogens that are suspected of being a major factor in colon cancer  that wasnt your claim stop backpedaling heres your claim word for word since you forgot  fried meat and burnt meat are probably the culprit for stomach and colon cancer  which weve established several times over now is bullshit you posted a link yourself that asserted fat content is associated with an increased cancer risk and unprocessed red meat has an increased cancer risk but not unprocessed white meat so no the high temperature carcinogens are not probably the culprit which is something you tried to claim specifically to avoid admitting meat itself had any cancer risk of its own
  except he was trying to claim meat on its own didnt have a cancer risk that was the whole point so saying heres a couple links that states high temperature cooking creates more of some carcinogenic chemicals but also fat content in meat increases your cancer risk and cancer risk for unprocessed meat is limited to red meat while not seen with white meat defeats that point since youre acknowledging the meat itself in these cases does have a cancer risk of its own and it cant be explained away as a cooking problem
  building muscle from grass
  nope
  haha my main man sverige this guy is on another level
  i hope these people dont condemn lab grown meat and it helps them unfuck their brains     i also hopes its somewhat expensive
they just look so freakish every single one of them looks completely fucked
  nah dynamic ip plus phone posting  get fucked faggot
  another level of delusion yah
  still 10x bigger than the average fat fuck on see kay
  yeah definitely it just astounds me that he has a ton of followers
  if that nigger only 3 more stomachs hed be good
  too much protein causes gout  ok phoneposter
    like your obese ass isnt freakish looking
  vegetables for important nutrients  be real no other food has more bioavailable nutrients than meat specially organ meat pound for pound and you cant just substitute it with a pill doesnt work like that
  lol nope one the gout line tard boi
  i kinda hate that dude too but his results are undeniable perhaps you should argue hes not vegan off camera    also lifting for 10 years doesnt actually get you progressively larger for 10 years youll still be 54 no matter what you eat
  well i lost the game damn you
  his reasults are undeniable  anyone can get big on steroids also he lies about how long he has been vegan with approximately 3 to 4 years  nobody in the history of mankind has gotten big on a strictly vegan diet and if they claim so they either just started veganism or they are on a truckload of drugs
  the milk i drink comes from jersey cows who are only fed grass live outside most of the year with heavy regulations for how much medicine they get administered when they are sick its unpasteurized and unhomogenized with a natural level of fat between 35 and 45 percent
there is no vodka better than ketel one
vodka is a fucking neutral you could pour seagrams in that bottle and not know the difference girl drink
  which style magazine told you that its a girls drink genius
  i work at a drug and alcohol rehab center
  then you know eastern european vodka is the best drink
when i drink this shit i get drunk off my ass for a few hours then it wears off with no hangover    its the cleanest vodka ive ever drunken
  at being the choice of alcoholic women yeah
  if you have ever gotten your head out of your ass and traveled to poland or russia you would know that you had your head in your dumbass
  wrong
  i drink around half a handle of seagrams a day and would absolutely know the difference ive had better vodkas than ketel one but if im going top shelf its just about the best im willing to splurge on not op btw just a random al/ck/
vodka should be neutral but the real cheap stuff aint and anyone who wants to argue is invited to do so right after a shot of skol    otoh the expensive stuff is just a label so better off settling in the middle with something like luksusowa or sobieski 20 handles that still leave you able to think the morning after    or go unfiltered and buy a bottle of iichiko wheat shochu and traditionalstyle vodka are the same shit
  you wouldnt the bottle is a placebo
  there is no appreciable difference between any commercial vodka thats glass bottle quality
  mmm this vodka is more flavorless than that one
  i dont think you understand i literally get the bulk of my daily caloric intake from vodka theyre not distinct enough that id be able to get many right if asked to identify 10 unlabeled swigs but theres absolutely no way i could be given seagrams and ketel one and not be able to tell which is which
how do people get so used to ethanol  i want to love cheap vodka but something about it makes me sick
new amsterdam has best pricetoquality ratio russian standard is second best but then youre spending an extra 510 per bottle kettle one is very very fine minded it has a very low cost effectiveness    all vodka is produced the same the only difference is how many times it is filtered take a bottle of newam through a brita filter and you have russian standard take a bottle of rs through a brita and you have ketel one this kills the filter use at the end of the filters life
  it makes me sick too but i kinda like it
  id rather drink half a cask of cheap wine  that at least doesnt make me throw up
yo im drinking now
  t le sophisticated redditor
  this anon gets it
/beer/ general  insta edition  previous thread 
nice al/ck/ thread faggot
i work at a liquor store and im thinking of starting a beer review channel only problem is im 21 and i have no idea what constitutes good vs shit beer since ive only ever had light beer ice cold with pizza or wings  where do i start and how do i mask my unrefined palate
  just start buying random shit novices trying top tier beer is genuinely entertaining
  thatd probably be funny but im not the kind of guy who can justify spending twelve bucks on some premium dogshit sped that i wont be able to tell from a can of pbr without a couple months time learning how beers are supposed to taste
  did you ever enter an al/ck/ thread it was an entirely unrelated thing
  where do i start and how do i mask my unrefined palate  drink a lot of beer
  on some premium dogshit sped that i wont be able to tell from a can of pbr  oh you will be able to tell this isnt wine where a 15 bottle is indistinguishable from a 60 bottle you will easily be able to tell even low tier craft beer from macro beer
  just do it you will easily be able to taste the difference just say what you like and try and rate it based on the different categories    i think they are like taste smell appearance strength etc
  the difference being is that al/ck threads are pretty sad asnd depressing while /beer/whatreyoudrinking/ threads are actually fun because we genuinely enjoy drinking beers
  and i have no idea what constitutes good vs shit beer  about all i can tell is i dont care much for super hoppy beers taste like pine sol just start drinking and having fun
  go for variety packs from consistant brewers like samuel adams sierra nevada or other suggested brewers that are at worst mediocre to find styles you like   go to a local craft shop or a place you can build 6 packs talk to shopkeepers on suggestions its not like game stop where their cringe and fucking obnoxious most of them are decent people   avoid ipas abbey dubels and tripels unless a friend suggests good ones because on average these styles fucking blow and could turn you off of craft
ipa
  ipas abbey dubels and tripels unless a friend suggests good ones because on average these styles fucking blow  ive drank 10x the volume and variety of beer you have and youre wrong
    whats wrong with ipas
  hops dont fucking taste good as the dominant flavor
  apparently the hops are too overpowering and doesnt taste good
  theyve tasted consistently the same for me on average dont wow me ive had plenty of them and couldnt care just the same flavor repeated only a small number of them tasted that different    nothing theres just so many on the market that it just repeats many times over i love ipas but theres a lot of stinkers
  get out of california if added later in the boil they are great
  implying california doesnt produce top tier ddh ipas  come tour laocsd sometime and learn whats what
  read beer reviews then eat foods matching the flavour notes they mention in order to contextualise them if you have a good idea of what a bourbonaged character notes of pineapple and aroma of bitter citrus peel are then youll be prepared to spot them in any beers you drink ultimately the best critics are also the ones who have the most experiences to draw comparisons from
  go for variety packs from sierra nevada  avoid ipas  what did he mean by this
  leave your shit tier arrogant monoculture and see what the rest of the world has to offer as the fags in the last thread pointed out your fellow fornians dont know popular brands and cant find a bottle shop that can compete with a bumfuck grocery store time to move
  i can get cali stuff and not have to wait in line for it
  t never been here  california hate is best received on 
what ever happen to those unhopped ales people used to make the medieval ales youd think it would be popular enough with underaged/sweettooth crowd to still be around
  avoid abbey dubels and tripels  what
  why do people like ipas i live in a city with a ton of small breweries ipas are so pervasive but they taste fucking terrible like some kind of bitter steak sauce am i losing my mind or are ipas a huge meme
  they are starting to but well behind ne and the midwest  but more to the point the ipas generally available on the west coast are considerably worse than those in the north obviously you can get really good ipa anywhere and its not that hard to find but without doing research you are much more likely to end up with a mediocre one out west especially ca
  i was genuinely surprised how bad grocery store selections were when i was in san diego last year the city has so many good breweries but you basically have to go to one or a beer specific bar/bottle shop to really benefit from it the selection at grocery stores liquor stores and restaurants was considerably worse than i was expecting especially given the quantity of good brewers around
  no ipa is good what city are you in maybe we can point you in a good direction
  fort collins co
  this is the result of a high barrier to entry for distributors the big boys get picked up and distributed everywhere out of sheer lack of effort on the part of whoever does the beer order much easier to buy every type of domestic from one guy than deal with 15 distributors so johnny can have his dipa
  tried odell cloud catcher i had it the other day and it was solid
  yeah but for whatever reason it seems to be much worse in california than say the midwest where i am the distribution game sucks though its a shame that the government mandates its existence
  alot of breweries make bad beer the brewery boom is slowing but tons of people homebrew and think they can make it a commercial enterprise dont mistake the style for their shit brewing
  its super fucking hard to get the funding for a brewery if you arent good at it its not as easy as just being a hobbyist home brewer in general most of the breweries from the current boom especially in more mature beer markets are really good often better than the previous generation of craft brewers who are the ones most struggling to keep up in the current climate  this is especially true of ipa most of the most mediocre ipa around is from older craft breweries or fake inbev craft breweries its incredibly hard to succeed as a new brewery without at least a pretty good ipa while many older craft breweries are still selling older style ipas created before the availability of modern hops and before the popularity of modern techniques from the dark ages of the west coast ipa craze  very few ipas from more than 10 years ago are even close to as good as the average new ipa being made today the exception of beers from the midwestern tradition instead of the west coast like two hearted but those are not very numerous
is al/ck/ dead
  beer threads are not and were never part of that
wwere different  lololol
  some folks have started doing it around here not nearly as popular as it could be but it might just need some time    the belgiany red trippel/quad im slamming into bottles today almost got heather and yarrow instead of saaz
      the fucking target by my house carries modern times made west pizza port and cigar city not aaa brands but definitely a list and better than the inbev/constellation shit you seem to have found while out here
  youre delusional
  its a beer thread maybe hes just drunk
  its the plight of the early adopter a lot of ca breweries are still making outdated ipas because they started before modern techniques were developed and now they have brands around them so they cant easily move forward
  i guess i have a higher standard for grocery stores than a few of the good local things and biggest national craft stuff simply much less space seemed devoted to good beer as i have seen through out the north and a similar thing with restaurant taps or non beer centric bar taps
  to be fair youre probably not overrun with mexicans who cop modelo and bud light by the cart full thats who buys beer at supermarkets in this region we have bottle shops and taprooms and direct sale breweries all over for the higher end of the market
  still making outdated ipas  funny how you never hear that argument about european beers california breweries are doing all kinds of shit though this hazy ipa fad needs to die and the classic west coast ipas from alesmith green flash etc are still around because theyre still some of the best theyre only outdated because so many breweries copied the style and people got kind of sick of it for awhile
    russian river are basically the originators of the hoppy west coast ipa and theyre still kino calling pliny or blind pig dated is just contrarian
  hazy ipas are way the fuck better than west coast ipas
  pliny was the original overrated meme beer its good but by no means deserving of the hype you guys put on it
  porque no los dos
  funny how you never hear that argument about european beers  i will gladly extend that argument to european beer its actually much more true there
  like i said youre just being contrarian
  pretty sure hes just a flyover desperately trying to hold onto the idea that his flyover land is in at least one way culinarily superior
  both are good i am definitely not saying all west coast ipa is bad just that a random west coast ipa often formulated in the 90s to mid 00s is considerably more likely to be mediocre than a random modern ipa mainly because citra/mosaic etc werent a thing yet and for whatever reason the best old school american hop centennial was mostly only featured in midwest ipas the other reason being the trend of later hop additions
  beer is definitely a flyover thing nyc and la have never been on the forefront of beer
  its more of a north vs west coast thing than coast vs inland thing luckily both northerners and west coasters currently have access to better beer than people anywhere else in the world have ever had
  everything that isnt nyc and la is flyover  yet another thing flyovers tell themselves to make themselves feel better
  good luck convincing me fresno and buffalo arent flyover
  i think ive had 2 different beers from fresno and nothing particularly memorable
  other half and monkish arent at the current forefront of beer  thats where youre wrong kiddo
  having a good brewery per 10 million people does not make your region a leader
drinking /beer/ all day then calling your mother and crying on phone at midnight for half an hour just /beer/ things i like /beer/
  that cope tho
  yes
  what the fuck is the north i know what pnw is and i know what new england is and they both have their own distinct beer culture so is the north just another way of saying flyover land
  
  using civil war era terminology to describe 21st century beer regions  fucking hell anon
  i wasnt describing a specific beer region just the best place for beer on a broader scale a region that is contiguous and includes most of the countrys best beer basically extending from new england through the upper midwest to colorado the best america has to offer
brut ipas are taking off in my area  theyre all shit and over priced    nobody i know likes them and most of the customers at my store dont like them why do breweries feel like they need to jump on the next fad just because they have a fancy new enzyme or yeast to work with
  north  thats not how you spell california republic
  california doesnt even make the best beer on the west coast let alone compete with the north
  thats the thing with quickly changing technology and marketplaces in order to stay ahead you have to be ahead you hit the trend before its a trend and if youre a bit late but you believe in it you push the trend    ipas hops yeast labs and the storefront are absolutely pushing the market and the market will follow that push right up until the point when it suddenly doesnt then hopefully theres a bit of headscratching and everyone starts focusing on whats possible to grow/source locally and cheaply and what makes sense with their water chemistry a lot of the problem in canada right now is that theres a lack of flagship beers like the bigboys have somebody like unibroue or dieu du ciel or even smaller guys like from toronto using local breweries here halo or town could do wonders with a beerflavouredbeer im glad that there are all sorts of sours stouts trippels ipas dryhopped this and fruitbrewed that but i think that unibroues success above the others is heavily dependent on its blanche and blonde du chambly
  brut ipa is fine
  i mean just straight up unbittered     ale is made of malte and water and they the which do put any other thynge to ale the is rehersed except yest barme or godesgood doth sophistycat theyr ale ale for an englysh man is a natural drynke ale must haue these propertyes it must be fresshe  clere it muste nat be ropy nor smoky nor it muste haue no weft nor tayle
  basically the english hated dutch and german immigrants so the demonized hops for a little while but then everyone realized hops were good so hopped beer eventually took over anyways this also corresponds with english ale being a thing women made at the household to beer made by men commercially this was possible because beer without hops and before knowledge of pasteurization went bad really fast but hops had some antibacterial properties so it allowed it to be made in larger quantities to be sold further away
why is it so fucking hard to find gruit when every other liquor has botanicals in it
  because no one likes it enough to make it economically viable to make it professionally
  does the old household style ale have a new name it just seems strange that the tradition seems to have been killed off almost completely even as a homebrewing exercise
  but they dont taste like anything theyre good for blending to add a crispness but theyre like drinking vaguely hoppy water by themselves       more breweries needs to brew german and czech style beers some of the more up and coming breweries in my city are getting clout on their german beers style beers and this is fucking san diego the ipa market is over saturated so the only way to stand out it to brew stuff thats not an ipa or add weird shit into it and hope they work      anchor christmas is a gruit if youre in the states you should pick it up its really good
  table beer/small beer
  i dont think so it was probably really weak and not very good
  but they dont taste like anything  ive only had a few of them definitely on the lighter end but i wouldnt get upset about them
  its the price factor that really gets me i havent seen any cheaper than 15 for a 4pack
  oh shit thats definitely bad basically only neipa and barrel aged or sour stuff even approach prices that high here
  the hazys get me to some of them are 20 fucking dollars for a 4pack at the price theyre at i may as well just go to the brewery ill pay that much for a sour or a barrel aged beer though because i can appreciate how much time has gone into make them
  i agree with you on more german/czech styles but some of those things actually require investment in specific equipment
  a lot of guys near me do good german stuff but i still find myself going ipa or stout most of the time
  for german/czech most of them are aggressively straightforward those that arent are usually differentiated by local conditions  water chemistry/ph wild yeasts and bacteria and temperature all of which can be replicated fairly easily in a clean room with decent temp control there are even a few attempts at openair abbey/trappist dubbels and dark trippels although im sure they cant legally be called trappist that come pretty close because the local biomes not too far off of rural mountainous belgium
  belgium has mountains
   bavaria one of those places that speaks german and smells like sausage
  the only west coast ipa ive tried and actually enjoyed was grapefruit sculpin and stones original ipa everything else is a fucking messs
  grapefruit sculpin  im sorry anon
rudy van der kelder went into the bottles today this is roughly 1/3 of what i didnt have room for as close to perfect as ive ever gotten  the flavours pretty on for only being 2 weeks old and having a touch of that im not ready yet acetaldehyde/green apple flavour    its exactly
    i was right the first time but also the second but mainly the first
  what for it was a decently balanced beer and refreshing as hell cant say the same about most others from california
  im sorry for the shitty distribution if you think ballast point and fucking grapefruit at that is a top tier california ipa
  sculpin is one if the best classic examples of west coast ipa
  its okay but highly overrated mostly through their aggressive marketing after being bought out
    sculpin  original stone
  mostly through their aggressive marketing after being bought out  maybe thats the case out there but here they generated some natural hype when they first entered the market years before being bought out but its mostly dyed out since the buyout i never understood why sculpin was so overpriced but it is definitely one of the best old west coast style ipas    the only real difference i noticed after the buyout was a million flavored variants of everything
  a million flavored variants of everything  sculpin and vas are pretty good but so much of the flavored shit has just been terrible i got a watermelon ipa cant remember if double or triple on tap one time and it just tasted like they completely botched the batch and then decided to throw in a million jolly ranchers to try to mask the flavor i dont know whos making the decision to release all this shit but its really inconsistent
  i think they are doing the classic big brewer strategy of making a bunch of difference shit with variations to take more shelf spots and taps from small breweries with the added bonus that craft beer drinkers really like trying new things in general
  the dorado that beers is terrible a lot the beer they distribute is really bad save sculpin vas cali kolsh and sour wench its weird because they usually have a lot of really good stuff on tap at the breweries
  the dorado  i was pretty sure it was something id never seen in bottles but looking it up that sounds like it might be what it was or maybe they just have really really shitty watermelon beers not that ive ever had a watermelon beer that i liked
  it was one of the best ones i tried out there like i said it was actually balanced
  yeah this crap they make/made an unflavored one but its extremely rare for some reason they still make this crap maybe its popular outside of the san diego bubble
  never understood why sculpin was so overpriced  whenever i visit my parents they have a sort of biker bar/restaurant that they eat at probably a couple times a week and they have racer 5 for like 450 breaking bud for something like 5506 and then fucking sculpin for 7 because who the fuck knows why even if they were all the same price id probably go for the racer 5 nine out of ten times
  unflavored one but its extremely rare  i feel like i see it every time i go down the beer aisle at the grocery store norcal
  i remember when sculpin first started selling here 6 packs were going for 14 when local beers of its caliber were usually in 89 six packs it was a good beer and a lot of people bought it once because of the hype but it was impossible to justify repeated purchases
    its priced like that because people will pay it amazingly the price actually went down a dollar or two after the buyout
  amazingly the price actually went down a dollar or two after the buyout  that doesnt surprise me at all actually
drinking an old favorite tonight fucking expensive though 13 for 4though thats normal for this hole      ipa is a hipster meme tbqh
  anything i dont like is hipster/reddit/soi  gas yourself quite honestly
  never said i didnt like them    also  writing soy as soi on the cooking board of all places
        drinking constellation brands  ever  its like you hate craft beer and want it to die
  if beer tastes good i drink it simple as that
fuck this is excellent very thin carbonation thats immediately bombed away by the maple and some sweet roasting that deserves itself for the later part of the drink  lervig is really a brewery worth a quaffing eye at
  you should try their coconuts both regular and ba  coconut maple and vanilla fucking mental
most overrated meme brewery in the world
  i havent come to this specific one yet but ive only tried about 56 of them be assured that i grab everything i can get my hands on that says the name  last one was pic related god damn was it good im preciously aging the second bottle i have  its sad that they are usually quite expensive beers though i admit they are quite exceptionnal but damn tho
  if a hole feels good i stick my dick in it simple as that
  yeah coconuts is fucking great   i bought a bottle of this last week too actually   got plenty of barley aging away fucking love it
  their downtown la location has a killer tap list and great food with dirt cheap cans to go the four pack of windy hill for 13 is a steal given 
  sorry m8 all i care about is good beer not who owns the shit it could be goat fucking terrorists for all i care
  the more barleys i try the more im thinking only the bourbon barrel aged ones are the only ones worth much more mouthfeel  king of bourbon barrel aged barleys i tried wasnt from lervig though
  i hope you respawn in 1970s wisconsin with only schlitz to drink
  im 21 ive been brewing beer since i was 18 reading brewing books and formulating good recipies gave me a really good understanding of the different flavors if you actually want to know the different flavors id recommend some reading and trying different beers
  ill just go buy schells
  regular is good but bourbon ba is the best i have had lots and lots of different ones tho     for me this is the best this or their mash ive got a 4 year old bottle of mash aging and 2 of these hidden
  oh god is a 13 four pack really considered cheap in california
  enjoy it man  the only beers ive been keen on aging hard were sours because theyre summer beers  i have harder times aging stouts and barleys because evey winter i drink my year stash away because bad weather and shorter days lead me to watching tv and doing nothing
  for a hazy ipa yeah thats like 7 below average
  my secret is that im a terrible hoarder and to drink them is almost a shame for me not as much a shame as wasting them tho just waiting for the right time    ive probs got about 600quid worth of stout and barley aging   if there are any left id reccomend the 2018 barrel aged sour rainbow project youd love it
  milwaukee had like 20 of all american breweries in 1970
  i refuse to get into stouts in part because i know id hoard them like you say and end up sitting on thousands of dollars of beer sours are bad enough ipas work for me because you just cant keep them much longer than 60 days before they start to decline
  hazy ipas in general or just full neipa
  and they were all garbage
  winter is stout season tho barley and stouts all season
  quality neipa / juice bombs are what i call hazy ipas and most are around that 1822 price point hazy eastwest coast hybrid ipas can be cheaper modern times accumulated knowledge is sold at trader joes for 10 per four pack and its a nice cross between the styles but thats a rare exception
  my secret is that im just like you but i dont have a lot more place to store more than 50 beers so i do have to do regular clearance to my even more greater shame except when i save some by bringing them to my parents cellar
  well yeah all american beer was then i just thought it interesting to hypothetically place him in one of the few places in america at the time that had more than one brewery also interestingly i have heard that og schlitz was actually very good for a lager but they messed with the recipe to make it cheaper to try and compete with anheuser busch in the 70s i think it was and then abruptly lost the confidence of their consumers and spectacularly failed by the early 80s
  i would consider hazy ipas to be a much broader category than neipa though i would consider neipa to be hazy ipa
  i just get indignant whenever im sold a hazy that is just a west coast that hasnt been filtered almanac im looking at you terrible flavor and mouth feel almost goopy
  eh i dont have any expectation of a beer being a neipa if it just says hazy but i also wouldnt expect it to cost any more than a 12 six pack but there were a lot of hazy or juicy or whatever ipas here years before neipa started getting hype and before i had ever heard of a 15 four pack of ipa or even 12 for that matter
good australian east coast lagers all i see are meme look guys we used hops with a cool name ipas that all taste the same no newtown lager i already had that and it was nothing special
do i even gotta say it pbr is the best beer around and thats a fact folks
    lagers  no although some drinkable wa ones feral and mash do one each
  the best beer around  not for long lmao
  all right cheers if i can find them ill give those a try
trying this for the first time tonight tastes pretty good to me so i wanted to know what you snobs think of it so i can once again hate everything that i used to like by 4chans standards
  its fine
    just going to have to come to canada for it soon then
ok i cant stand the taste of beer but i like pic related    recommend me some alcoholic beverages that actually taste good so i can go to sleep tonight also check my reddit spacing so you know im legit
  stella is fine its a generic pale lager but people think its shitty because the glass allows for pretty easy skunking of the beer same with all the mexican beers with their clear bottles the canned version of those beers are near perfect everytime
  i dont why brut ipas are over priced they dont need much malt for abv because the amalyse breaks down even 11 p wort into the 6 range they generally should use neutral ale yeast which is common and cheaper than other yeasts and the main meme part of it amalyse costs about 30 for a half gallon and you only need about 100 mls for 50 bbls theyre dirt cheap to make with the only semicostly part being the ludicrous amount of hops added during the final stages of hot side and dry hop ours is literally just two row barley with a sprinkling of pilsner malt    t brewer
  i only go to canada for poutine and easy pussy
i got a bottle of this for free genuinely surprised at how much i enjoy it its very tropical tasting like some type of island cocktail
  id figure theyd actually be cheaper to make since theyre spending less on malt i wish breweries would stop gouging their customers with these specialty beers also with regards to the amylase why not use on lagers which benefit from being less sweet imperial lagers are always way too god damn sweet so it seems like thisd be perfect for that
  their barrel beers are all pretty good except dkml dkml is terrible
  eh founders barrel aging program has been hit or miss for me backwoods bastard one year was perfection the next year i bought it it was a bourbon bomb and absolutely disgusting
  this is actually a great idea
  millenial detected    new smaller craft breweries generally like to experiment and have less consistency and often blow ass except for a few winners theyve chosen as their flagships    although the more established breweries may not wow you with something new they at least will give a good representation of the style without giving you some infected or disgusting swill    youve got to have some sort of baseline before you can talk the talk in regard to beer styles    as far as avoid ipas goes newer drinkers dont quite have the palette to judge what the hops contribute takes several exposures before your body can handle the bitterness
  hops are an essential ingredient what you mean is the newer trend of going extra heavy on the hops ie hops grown in the northwest usa eurofags have been using more mild hops for centuries
  dope youve got lots to choose from denver fag here
  you underestimate how many zoomers and 30yr boomers will pay for shitty but local beer they love them some stripped warehouse with a few cornhole games and the craft environment
  millenial detected
  for standard adjunct lagers using amalyse would be fine its actually the norm with larger breweries it wouldnt pair well with imperial lagers intense sweetness would be offset by how dry the finished beer would be regardless of carbonation you want residual sugars in the finished beer to add body and improve the mouthfeel think of a doppelbock with the carbonation and mouthfeel of root beer it just wouldnt be good      fuck you that was good
  you guessed it i was born between 1981 and 1996 as i assume most people on /ck/ were
  millenial is a state of mind not an age
  a lot of people will do that but so many of those places exist you need good stuff to survive i can think of very few breweries from the last five years that are not good
  well shit if liking hazy ipa more than west coast ipa makes one have a millenial state of mind i will gladly agree thats that is what i have
  desu i love hazies also
  agreed if i walk into a newer brewery i usually go for their flagship before trying their experimentals
  no way dude shit tasted like whisky mash
  eventually the liver goes or the gaba bomb dts burn them up in a quivering hallucinating mess    your thread was shipped to /adv/ this is for people who have a healthy relationship with mans earliest cooking or who want to shit post about ipas
  which is why the ipa haters who scream whaaaaaaa its killing the beer market my lazy ass cant find anything else to wash the taste of fresh jizz out of my mouth need to try to stop drop and roll the wild fires instead of pretending they know shit about the american beer market
  yeah you dont get that problem in the midwest where while there is a lot of ipa a higher percent of them are good and the average store even shitty ones or restaurants have a decent variety of good styles
tfw started day drinking again
  visiting california from the midwest was weird even our shittiest chains had better beer selection than most restaurants i went to in cali
  i had the same experience i was genuinely surprised at how limited the selection was at not explicitly beer centric places
muh session ale    is there a bigger pointless beer in existence
  session ales rule finding something you can drink on all day in the summer or on a cozy day off in the winter is nice
  how is it any easier to get girls there
    its just a lower abv hardly any difference to a pale
    this why not just drink pale ale all day then heavier ipa when you want to get fucked up at night
  canucks are just loose like that
  right so you can gulp it down drinking 5 beers will knock you on your ass or at the very least just make you lethargic and unmotivated
helping people pick out beer  i dont like ipas theyre too bitter  oh no stouts either too much like coffee  lager the watery stuff no thanks  wheat beers are too filling anything else  again browns are too much like coffee  belgians taste weird  pale ale is that like an ipa  tries the ipa  oh thats good ill have that    why do people do this
  try beers compare them to others two really stick out to you buy them and drink them after the other and compare them read online descriptions of them to help yourself better understand their flavour
  no one does all of those things
  youve obviously never worked at a bar
cream ale  basically just a golden ale with a lighter grain bill    what is even the fucking point to making a niche style if youre not going to do it right
  a lot of places near me use corn for the cream part
  for example wheats theres a way that they handle the wort that isnt physically possible at least where im from because the brewing equipment isnt fitted out for it
  mismatch won an award this year for a helles style lager but thats sa
  i wonder what a creamy beer would actually taste like definitely be a weird experience
  thats what milkshake ipas with lactose are
trip to the grocery michigan win
living in japan sucks for beer the macros may be better than the equivalent american megalagers but theres no variety
  beer should taste like beer not juice sorry you have the pallet of a child
freshly copped alvarado street abominations to trigger the flyover traditionalists
  bad beer would be better if it was a brown       where in japan do you live
  stay mad low test coasty
  kettle sours are so fucking wack dude
  aomori
wat chu know bout dat    probably nuttin     
who here /chimay/
  are these supposed to be incredibly carbonated or did i just get a bad bottle
  one of the best macro lagers
  belgian beers are supposed to be highly carbed yeah the carbonation shouldnt taste sharp though
  grimbergen gang here
    theyre expensive because labor in norway is expensive as fuck and taxes in norway on alcohol are very high and its like a fixed amount per quantity of alcohol no sens in making cheap stuff anyway    this barley wine was amazing
  i lived in france for awhile and for some reason grimbergen was pretty much the only decent beer you could find most places really weird considering that its a really mediocre belgian    nevermind just looked it up and they were bought out in 2008 and the stuff in france is brewed by kronenbourg
  mikkeller sd makes great beer and the euro stuff ive had has all been good as well im not a fan boy but i dont steer away from it the euros also put a shit load of effort into importing some of the best small american craft breweries and throwing it on the web shop i dont see them memed ever what do you not like about them    show us on the doll were the bad harry touched you
thread got deleted earlier testing for ban
  theyre pretty good for 4 a pack but ya obviously there are far better belgian beers out there itsjustkind of my guilty pleasure
will i hate triples if i dont like super bitter hops or do the monks perform some sort of miracle on the brew
  belgian beers are generally not hoppy at all they traditionally use aged hops unlike most other styles of beer
for me its double ipa the best style of beer
opening beer on a monday night
  fur kids on board  emoji plush  omnipollo can  bourbon county  yikes
  unless its a trade secret that only germans have figured out the hardware is most likely on the market worst case somebody knows how to make it    i cant think of a specific piece of hardware necessary for hunflavouredwheat yeast and hop choices should definitely be old world ideally bavarian banana yeast and something lightbutdefinitelyearthy to counteract it like a hallertau an acid rest is a fairly german move and would probably be beneficial to control a wort designed to be a bit sweet and hazy but its only really necessary for a fromscratchwithingredientsfrommybackyardandwaterfrommyriverinczech pils similar results can be achieved with tweaks to water chemistry
  some of us fuck females of the species and will pass our genes on
  this is who buys bcbs
    that said if you have a serious aversion to artificial fruit or clove flavours you may not like them the yeasts used for trippels and quadrupels tend to leave a few aldehydes esters and phenols behind so a lot of banana flavours isoamyl acetate which can taste more like pear in lower concentrations some more generally fruity notes from ethyl heptanoate a bit of 4vinyl guiacol clove or nutmeg which might actually wind up in the beer if the yeast doesnt spew phenol compounds sometimes green apple acetaldehyde shows up but most yeasts will clean it up enough for it to take on more of a cherry or peach note especially with an esterheavy yeast strain
  genes  good lord i hope not
  whats that like
  its like finally being rid of a hackman and a krupa
    try some session lagers/kolschs next    full sail makes a nice consistently crisp lager as for kolsch theres several reissdorf karbach love street st arnold lawnmower im texan yall    one of the better normie options though
  session lagers  like 95 of lagers are sessionable do we really need a term for that
  north coast quince cranberry berlinerweisse for sure tallgrass raspberry jam maybe even ommegang rosetta or kasteel rouge if you can handle dark stone fruit and sour notes    think youll like the more mild sours out there or even flemish/flanders reds a lot of them have sweettart properties that are similar to mixed drinks have fun
  trust me i waitress at a craft beer bar they do    i had a couple come in guy drinks nothing but bud light and wants a beer recommendation offer him something like a lager or wheat and he insists he doesnt drink that pussy shit so i got him a community mosaic while his gf had a session bock she was having a blast chatting me up and he looked miserable chugging down the grapefruit goodness 
  also a sweet/milk stout left hand makes a passable milk stout for 5 boulevard tough kitty is also p good     also recommend nitro pour beer to you while some of the beers done in this style dont necessarily have lactose in them they are delicious and have a nice mouthfeel to them at my bar we do belhaven scottish ale nc old rasputin lakewood temptress and left hand milk stout all nitro give it a whirl sometime
  belgians are bottleconditioned they tend to be extremely foamy upon opening thats why most chimay duvel glasses are shaped like candleholders gotta let the head dissipate unless you got a real pro pouring it might wanna use yours for practice for me i get a decent pour with minimal head about 70 of the time
  sorry work habit haha but youre right theres not a lot of lagers with high abvs is there actually any
  yessir especially if you count bocks which you should theyre lagers
  tons most bocks and forms of bocks are higher abv
this was pretty tasty   not a serious beer but good for what it is your girl would love it
someone redpill me on good hazy ipas
  hazy ipas  good  unless you live in bumfuck vermont and have no better options dont bother
  i live in pennsylvania and heard their popular i have no idea what the buzz is about we have plenty of choices but ive never seen hazy ipas unless double/imperial is the same thing and these niggers cant label consistently
  they basically took ipas and turned them into something like a tropical blended girly drink by adding lactose sugar multiple adjuncts and holding off to last minute with the hops if you live in pa and havent seen them you must be deep in the boonies
  doesnt know the difference between a hazy ipa and a milkshake ipa    dumbshit      hazy ipas typically use oats or another high protein grain to bind some of the bitter compounds of the hops the beer is not filtered and has an almost opaque look to it often compared to orange or grapefruit juice because of the volume of solids left in the beer and the lower apparent bitterness the beer often exhibits very fruity or earthy flavor and a soft mouth feel the milkshake ipas the dipshit who first replied to you take this a step further and add lactose and often times fruit to the hazy ipa to further soften the mouth feel and highlight fruit flavors
  iits exactly what you described but completely different because the real stuff doesnt add lactose  jesus christ turn down the damage control a few notches anon
  the only thing you got right about the normal beer is the tendency to dry hop you really are fucking stupid arent you
  doesnt sound too bad will try them out of curiosity please dont be meme pricing _
    imagine being this dumb
  until they catch on well they will
  dipa  stop stop with the fucking pale ales
  start by drinking barley wine and barrel aged beers then spending a couple hundred dollars on a few 12 oz bottles and ruin your palate for ever
  theyre so fucking boring the market is stupid flooded with dipas and haze bombs right now and that is pretty much the only thing being brewed and pushed aside from fruit puree kettle sours
  youre pretty fucked most people dont develop a taste for bitter foods until 23 if ever you can try stuff but i wont guarantee youll like it until your palette matures i drank good beer at 21 but i didnt appreciate hop forward flavors until 1 i turned 23 or so and biology happened and 2 i drank the nastiest tree bark and pine sap bitter ipa ever and expanded the phenomenal sphere of bitterness to the point that i had a proper metric for the range in between     theres a lot of psychology and physiology that goes into taste
  i didnt appreciate hop forward flavors  but those are for kids and people who dont like the actual taste of beer
  meet me under the bridge and we can get some kids to do a blind taste test i guarantee theyll go for the golden monkey over the pale ale
  you cant just say golden monkey against an undeclared choice of pale ale i mean theyd almost assuredly take the pale ale over a barrel aged strong ale    now if were talking two hearted though i still have a fond place in my heart for that beer regardless of what my opinion on pale ales has become
my stove is fucked what are some good meals to make in the oven    bonus points for low carb meals im not doing keto but im just not a huge fan of high carb meals im general
  im general  hello general im anon
  line up and tell me what to cook in my oven you insubordinate smartass
if you dont like highcarb meals then just eat smaller portions  or you know do a sit up    chop up anything and drizzle it with oil and salt think potatoes tubers peppers etc  shepherds pie  stuffed anything  bread  pot roasts pork roasts beef roasts  put things things under your broiler its like noncontact pan frying
for me its the digorno supreme
  the worst frozen pizza
  looks good what restaurant did you get that delivered from
  for me its wild mikes
  crust is too doughey and barely any sauce always soggy in the middle the starting to burn on the outside
  i had digorno for the first time last night and it was terrible the sauce is horrendous its just like sugar sauce way too sweet and there was barely any cheese on it     whats an actual frozen pizza that doesnt suck
  this one or the four cheese or five cheese one or whatever it is their cheese actually tastes milky and good and the sauce isnt that ketchup shit that every other frozen pizza has including digiorno as you mentioned
  thanks     my gf of five years just left me and she used to cook now im eating sad frozen food on weeknights and screwing up chicken breasts on the weekends trying to learn to cook
  sorry to hear that anon  just dont go overboard with junk food just because its cheaper and easier at some point you will want to be in fighting shape to get another girlfriend
  trying to learn to cook  youve certainly come to the right board 
  thanks yeah im learning to cook on the weekends just not quite there yet and have to eat something at night since its the busy time of year for me ill get carryout and eat semihealthy but some nights just have to eat whatever my gf used to have dinner ready when i got home got spoiled       honestly this board has been surprisingly helpful despite heavy shitposting

really
  not that i know of theres a few good indian places here but nothing amazing
  leave it to inbred scots to attempt to make curry pretentious
  no true scotsman
what is the burnt hamburger looking thing i see it in a lot of bong food posts but cant figure out what its supposed to be
  who
that pic is a great demo of dumb restaurant trends     served in a skillet the food wasnt cooked in for no reason     banana leaf again there for no reason    cutting board but youre not cutting anything on it because the food is in the skillet      awful just awful
  curried haggis
  vdeep didnt last long although it was good from what i heard even if it looks like hipster shite
  yes scots are hopping on the ethnic replacement bandwagon and there are now many indian/desi curry houses in edinbro
  if only everyone ate haggis 3 meals a day we wouldnt need foreign nurses to take care of our elderly    foh racist
    youre all a sad lot
  what im sorry you misunderstood me im all for the ethnic replacement of whites and only whites in their own countries
  how dare you not simply step aside in your own nation for shitskin foreigners  whos the racist thats right you if your shitty brown people could build a decent nation maybe you cowardly traitorous bastards wouldnt have to run away from your own culture and people
  obviously people being interested in eating a variety of cuisines is part of a vast conspiracy against whites  also it is only brown people who have moved to europe and there are not europeans living abroad in every country on earth  you are super smart and not at all a dipshit mouthbreathing racist
  black pudding
  jew detected
  why is any of that worse than a plate from an eating perspective
  go back to your /pol/ containment board and stop trying to make everyone else as miserable as you clearly are
  the banana leaf and cutting board are literally serving no purpose  and the skillets high rim is harder to eat out of than a normal plate   but at the end of the day it just reeks of tryhard
  muh /pol/ boogeyman like clockwork
    obviously youre feeling extra inadequate today so you had to come to a place that celebrates different cuisines to troll with your racist/antisemitic dumbfuckery   imagine being scared of curry ffs
  lol    what is your ethnic background no seriously im interested now
  im as white or whiter than you edgelord  im also not terrified that scots people wanting to eat tasty foods is part of some secret illuminati plot   obviously if fucking curry makes you have such a pantsshitting fear reaction you didnt come to /ck/ to read about food  just another useless racist troll trying to pretend youre persecuted because curry is delicious back to your containment board trash
  it genuinely is pretentious as much as people like to abuse the word its literally pretending to be something its not  ooh look so authentic and rustic they didnt even take it off the skillet     except the plate here probably hadnt even so much as been in the same room as wherever the food was actually cooked so its just pandering to people who like photographing their food more than actually eating the damn thing
  so 100 ethnically soy then lol
  im a walking breathing stereotype of a dumbfuck racist including parroting all the popular rightwing catchphrases    stay scared of curry little racist bitch
  iirc tikka masala was invented in scotland
  glasgow but its really just an urban legend
  first dumbfuck its spectacular to encounter someone so fearbased and racist that the mere opportunity to eat curry makes him think hes being genocided  second youre crying about muh genocide and blaming it on jews but then somehow acting like calling you altright wouldnt be fair  i know racists are dumb but jesus dude tone it down a little
  i eat and make curry  and youre a fucking joke  so kill yourself
  fear based  always with the projecting
  the right is rising desu
  hmm lets examine this claim shall we    you started out by saying that a curry restaurant means ethnic replacement and crying about genocide    meanwhile i havent expressed any fear of any particular cuisine further i know that youre some pathetic noodlearmed twerp who wouldnt have the balls to say this stuff in public stay bold behind your keyboard lil nazi wannabe coward
  responding with a wall of text   lmao you got baited hard
  lmao if you think showing what pussies the farright are is ever bad
  if you believe in the ethnic genocide of whites you are more or less definitively alt right
  you are more or less definitively alt right    yes im hitler whats wrong with that
  go back to 
  go back to 1943 and have a russian tank roll over your dumb nazi head fucko
  found the antifa shill
  howdy hitler i thought you were already reincarnated with an orange tint no
  christ those fucks look as disgustingly whitetrash as the audience at a gop rally 
starving go to pizza hutcom  order 2 x 500 medium pizzas  oops delivery cant be less than 1099  add a fucking topping    subtotal 1163    delivery charge 399  tax 163    driver tip 700    total 24 dollars for 2 500 pizzas    they taste like sugary pancakes with totinos cheese on them    all in all a really bad time just like every pizza hut order
play stupid games  win stupid prizes
recently learned that most pizza places just do huge arbitrary uppricing if your order is large or complicated enough purely because the prices are a huge pain to keep track of  if you ever wondered how your bill somehow came out to 12 more than you thought it should be thats why
he tipped   lol
tipping someone who gets payed an ordinary hourly wage
not getting carryout  leave your house once in a while you fat fuck
  7 dollar tip  who tips this much  2 dollar tip every single time
  40 tip
  how much do i tip my wifes bull i usually give 30 but my wifes son looked it up and most people tip at least 50 i dont want to look bad in front of my wives friends when theyre testing make up on me
  where does this also who the fuck wouldnt notice 12 extra on their order
  i dont think they do they will fuck you over with extra toppings however most pizza places charge 24 for an extra topping regardless of what the topping is want some onions on your large pizza 250 
  americans were a mistake
anyone here try penicillin the lemon one is lush i can drink it recreationally
but why
nothing better than some citalopram on your sandwich
  lole penice    but no i dont think ive taken medicine with flavour since i was ten why arent you just getting tablets
i remember kids liquid oral medicine with flavour taste like energy drink with a slight gel texture like smooth artificial orange juice
  it gives me blotchy hives all over the only allergy i have
you know that stuff is made from moldy bread right
  you know that hitler also drank water too
  i like the artificial sweet taste of medicine to help it go down
  whats todays mary poppins equivalent
  steel reserve and xanax
  it tastes so good like sweet flat soda
does game meat really taste all that better
  no it tastes rank
meat doesnt really have a taste cooking it adding plants to it is the only way to make it taste good meat is a meme
  depends on the kind of life the game lived
  inb4 someone seriously responds to blatant trolling
  no farmed meat has been bred specifically to taste better game meat is more sensitive to inappropriate cooking however the satisfaction of consuming game meat that you have personally killed does add certain enjoyment to a meal
  it tastes a bit gamey
  i think so
  farmed meat has been bred specifically to taste better  nope its been bred specifically to be more bland to appeal to the feminized palates of the industrial age compare the robust flavor of wild boar to hogs deer/elk/antelope to beef chicken to pheasant/prairie chicken/grouse bighorn sheep to lamb wild salmon/catfish to farmed secondly since factory farmed animals barely use muscle the texture of the meat is not as firm as wild in every comparison factory farmed is worse
  its been bred to grow fast  flavor is not a priority in industrial farming
  flavor isnt a priority in nature retard nature evolved poisonous animals literally the exact opposite of that
  i was responding to the retard who said farmed meat was bred to taste better you fucking sock
  this is retarded      of course it has you fucking idiot
      morons
  flavor of meat mostly depends on the animal and what it ate    bear meat from a bear that lived deep in a forest  delicious bear meat from a bear in the salmon season who ate a lot of fish  not so delicious bear meat from a bear living close to humans and eating from dumpsters  disgusting    speaking from experience
  meat from a nonindustrial farm will taste better than venison but game meat will top any industrial crap that people are used to
  interdasting
  farmed meat tastes like bland corn/grain
  post a picture of 100 cal venison vs 100 cal broccoli you would be chewing for hours
  define gamey
  funky  off  slightly unpleasant  like you scraped up roadkill and cooked ot
nobody unironically thinks pheasant is better than the staple meats live in an area known for its pheasant hunting and all the hunters just do it out of tradition/hobby/entertainment not because theyre hunting pheasant because they want to eat more delicious pheasant if they happen to enjoy the annual pheasant meals thats more icing on the cake than the reason for the hunt in the first place
  justifying breeding animals for better taste
  flavor is not a priority
game in itself is no big deal  its eating an animal that has just been slaughtered that matters  the taste of the meat is out of this world whatever way you cook it be it boiling or grilling    almost nobody eats ultra fresh meat anymore in the west
  pheasant is better than turkey
  it depends a whole lot on when and how its been killed  males always have testosterone in their system and if you kill while an hes alert and running youre gonna get a huge amount of adrenaline and other hormones in the meat  a combination of those hormones is going to make the meat taste pretty disgusting which is why the best game is an animal is killed while sleeping or resting and shot through the heart  you dont want any blood in your meat and since the heart is basically the center of the circulatory system a very large portion of it is going to drain out    to answer your question though it just tastes differently  it takes special preparation to make and there are some things you cant cook with it  though i had very simply cooked dear ribs and its honestly the tastiest plain meat ive ever had
  its acquired but i prefer it i think the birds no matter what they are taste better than store bought chickenseven pigeons taste better
  i want to shoot people who hunt animals
  100 calories of steak is 15 oz 100 calories of broccoli is like 11 oz so per pound broccoli only has like 75 the protein of steak    joel fuhrman is a manipulator
  unlimited eggs milk an animal babies
  farmed meat is bred to taste better you think wagyu would have evolved by natural selection
  im not the guy but obviously he wasnt talking about wagyu but your average cheapo meat when he said that flavor is not a priority in industrial farming    actually the question in the op is stupid for more than one reason  1 game taste all that better than what exactly cheap bland shit or quality meat  2 taste is subjective some people just dont like game no matter how good it is game taste is more polarizing than the taste of domestic animals  3 also this 
  based
  t faggot who has eaten tons of meat but never done the deed himself
  youd shit your pants at the sight of a gun
  what a cuck
  this guy probably uses charcoal or some chemically infused wood instead of propane lol
  wrong
  he says providing an example of a specialized non factory farmed meat product
no our farm animals have been genetically modifed through the centuries to be exactly how we like them game meat is a novelty but that doesnt mean its bad
  almost seems too fatty but what do i know
      what is marbleing
  dunno the best i would describe it is go into the woods and smell the soil game meat tastes like meat and forest soil a little bit like wild mushrooms
  eating a whole forest of brocolli to get your 100 cal diet
  i hunt and butcher my own deer and havent detected this gamey flavor people describe but ive never gutshot one or pierced the digestive tract when field dressing the meat has more flavor but not like you describe the deer i hunt feed on a lot of acorns wild grasses and clovers i think that idea of gaminess comes from gut content contamination of meat through poor shot placement or processing and food sourcing of the deer i think rutting bulls also have a bit of that due to the testosterone as my neighbor shot one in full rut with a clean lung shot but we used the meat for jerky so the marinade would cover it because it did seem a bit rank
  nope its literally just so men who shoot animals can feel justified and macho theres a reason why gamey is a negative adjective
  you probably just suck at field dressing get the corpse gutted and cooling down as fast as possible and itll taste great
  yup i live in a heavily farmed area and our deer and turkey taste sweet from eating corn and soybeans all year round compared to the deer ive had up north that lives off of foilage and pine needles that taste much more gamey
  he tastes the heat and not the meat  lmao what a giblet head
  gamey is used as an excuse for idiots who dont know how to properly shoot dress and cook an animal
  i will now be posting game meat beholdsquirrel hand pies made with homemade acorn flour
      based and smartpilled
  groundhog stew
do these actually work im looking to get some new meme kitchen appliances ive got an air fryer on the way and my folks are giving me a slow cooker
yes why would you think they dont
  negative amazon reviews
  what is it stupid
  youre fucking stupid
  yes why would you think they dont    im not op but my experience has been that most consumertier cooking appliances only work in the pedantic sense if you want something that delivers good results and is reliable then you can essentially anything ignore any products meant for retail use and go straight to the professional models    in fact a pretty good rule of thumb is that if you can buy a piece of cookware or cooking appliance from somewhere other than a restaurant supply store its probably a gimmicky piece of garbage
  good counterargument buddy
  this if you can buy it at walmart then thats a pretty good guarantee that its a garbage product
  yeah theyre not bad honestly
    can you guys recommend a good one i love gimmicky appliances
  its just a hot plate that boils water to make steam      i use henrietta works great for me
  put some meat and potatoes and some water its gone real quick
buy something thats 7   they want 875 for it  buy something  cashier gives me incorrect change and immediately closes register  tell him he owes me 4 cents  he apologizes and gives me exact change  decide to purchase booze from mexican a block away further  mention this to him  alledges that same store is filing complaints about him ripping off customers
nice blog post my dude
no i dont buy 7 wine i have an awesome korean liquor store nearby the owner is a wine autist and all the attendants are all angry middle aged harpsichord teachers who know way too much about fermented grape juice and get pissy when someone asks them for the prisoner or whatever mass market crap the plebs go crazy over
  i have a problem with all nonwhites im redpilled as fuck
  based
what happened to those guys that killed a guy over a mattress
  jail/prison
  redpilled
  i dont notice that no indian store has ever tried to rip me off they know id catch it but that applies to any store my only issue is that the selection or whats available isnt as wide as white run places they seem to limit themselves to a single distributor
  this guy fucks
i just wish the retarded kids these days could do some basic numbers in their head  if i buy something worth seven bucks and hand you a ten and two ones its because i want a fucking fiver not because i want you to leave the two ones in the cointray and look at me like im the idiot  fuck
  formerly sucks
  worth and you define that
  ive never personally had an issue like that but i noticed for an indian restaurant i go to itll have a negative review from someone and the only other review from that person is a positive review for a competing indian restaurant
  i mean priced at you pedantic faggot
  formerly a faggot but once a fag always a fag
  yeah actually the closest gas station to my house does that they tried it once and i put the beer back on the shelf after arguing a minute and never went back they are indian or pakistani i cant really tell the difference
  i doubt it
  no because i pay for everything on my cc except for drugs for that sweet sweet cash back
  very foolish you have effectively volunteered to bear the mark of the beast
  huh
  what the fuck
  you bear the mark of mental illness what are you doing on the internet luddite
  i like shooting matresses
  someone asks them for the prisoner  you sure that isnt a best buy
live in the hood  arab liquor store has one random white guy working  wearing a tshirt with sam hyde on it one day  say he cant keep getting away with this heh   looks at me all funny  pay for my hammerhead malt liquor in quarters and leave
  axehead i mean anyway now i have to go to the liquor store five blocks away instead of the one two blocks away to avoid embarrassment
omurice
nice
  looks good  take a big fat fucking ketchup dump all over it  mmmm
  better be some fucking kewpie mayo around there somewhere kiddo
didnt make happy cat face with the ketchup   i deduct 5 points for that so your final score is pretty gud/10
  why i have never heard of this cutopen before is it perhaps a japanese word fellow 4channeler
it boggles the fuck out of me that japanese people actually use ketchup as an ingredient in food   its a surreal type of americanism
  americlaps didnt invent ketchup
  americanism
  ketchup  eggs  shitty rice  do eurofags really
  americlaps invented tomatoes though
  i do an omurice italian fusion where i use leftover tomato based risotto thats an improvement no ketchup needed btw
  whats the uhhh symbology behind that
  sounds pretty legit
  no but theyre the exact faggots id expect to use it as a central ingredient      as in some feat of idiocy that abandons all sense and logic for some cheap usedcarsalesmanesque behavior
omurice
  a rice omelette my god
  what what is that a good or bad thing please tell me

    it is from true lies
  imagine the sheer amount of farts she produces every day boggles the mind
    on january 13 2018 dushku published on facebook an account of her sexual molestation at the hand of stunt coordinator joel kramer when she was 12 and working on true lies according to dushku kramer groomed her with flattery and special attention until one day he lured her to his miami hotel room took off all his clothes lay dushku on the bed and rubbed himself against her dressed until he ejaculated kramer was 36 at the time of the alleged encounter soon after an adult friend of dushku confronted kramer on set the same day dushku was injured during a stunt and several of her ribs were broken kramer was responsible for her safety kramer has denied the accusation
  based and redpilled
  facebook  hardly seems like the place for that   fuck women and fuck metoo
  based
  shes into red popsicles
  seems like a cool dude lmao
  fucking based my wife showed me the original movie many years ago had no idea this existed ty anon
  wtf is this oc
  file name kek  good job anon
just had one of these bad boys swedish cuisine at its finest
  is that plantain or bananas    either way id try it bananas are a tropical fruit just like pineapple and i love pineapple on pizza
_
  sweden was a mistake in every respect and why the fuck does it have a green tinge
  looks tasty
  it looks like a gay dude farted cum all over it
  and i love pineapple on pizza    meto i like the sweetness vs the saltiness of the ham/cheese salt  sweet is a match made in heaven chocolate  salt is also an excellent combo they balance each other well
  probably the syrian or african doctor or scientist that made it
  banana    lightning and camera     i think the people who made it is from the baltics
why does every pizza i have seen from sweden look like one of those disgusting food challenges
  next time i have pizza i will definitely try banana on it
  its missing something
  it looks diseased
    those black things in the middle of your banana is spider legs my big brother told me so
  the most progressive country has the most progressive food
sweden deserves everything that is happening to them
  why do you know how that would look like
  xdddddd
  the crust looks really good too bad they ruined it with garbage toppings bananas arent even indigenous to sweden wtf
  na za
  looks fine to me
  na za na za  na za na za  hey hey hey  good bye
  based underage racist
  i think you have it confused with this pizza anon
  welcome to the american south where sharia law is implemented by loony christians instead of loony muslims
  swedes are shit in the kitchen
  plebs dont know what they are missing banana peanut ham and curry powder get along like a house on fire stay ignorant
  honestly consider trying it  its absolutely horrendous banana is just awful when cooked like that ive had pizza with banana on it once and it was honestly the worst pizza ive ever had because of it  pineapple actually works
this is now a swedish food thread
  sauteed reindeer with chantarelle
  literally nothing wrong with that picture  americans have never eaten the absolute blessing that is blood sausage
  raw sort of fish with new potatoes and dairy products you foreigners cant even source
  tunnbrodrulle is the best drunken food there is and if you cant finish it it is comfy and pillowy to fall asleep on
  nigger youd best not be hating on flygande jakob
the sausage variety of stroganoff is kinda swedish   cream and lashings of paprika powder fk i am getting hungry
foreigners just dont get this with their tiny bags their funky improvised flavours and their stale produce 2 companies locked in die hard competition since 1970 or so always competing on price and quality and never being able to knock the other one out
hasselbackspotato is best potato  here with a red wine jus and beef
  swedish food  not halal arabic cuisine  nice try
  nice meme
  holy lord
  wow im so jealosu
can we just bomb europe already
  over what some food no  besides theres pizza
  that would be great
  try joining isis thats their primary goal
that looks dope
  explain yourself murica
mouthbreathing employees  ordering kiosks smeared with shit  value menu a shit includes things like a 1 plain hamburger    why havent you taken the burger king pill yet
literally cheese on the side  cant complain
  who the fuck asks for the cheese on the side you get what you right well deserve
    they probably literally placed the cheese on the side of the box and when you tilted the box it melted to the side of it lol    or this is what you get for being retarded
  this  only a faggot would ask for cheese on the side at a fast food place
      i always ask for cheese on the side when i get burgers because im lactose intolerant and since the cheese is included in the price i feel that if i just choose to not have it at all im a sucker whos essentially giving money away so i just put it in my pocket and bring it home to put in the garden
  its a picture that he found on google and just added his own faggot caption too its stupid twitter shit people do now
  mental shit lol
what the fuck does cheese on the side even mean
  so i just put it in my pocket and bring it home to put in the garden  obviously
  in most contexts it would be side of the plate instead of part of the dish but this being americans where the national dish is horendous fast food and the plate being a wrapper or card box fuck knows
  i know right
  imagine the dick small enough to unironically post some shit like this
  yeah i a different tweet with the exact same photo with the caption we demand 15/hr pay
  pretty decent shop
  1 plain hamburger  thats a fucking lie you piece of shit please show me that on their value menu you scumfuck
  and since the cheese is included in the price    but thats wrong almost all of mcds sandwiches have variants that are with cheese like quarter pounder with cheese burger king charges extra when you ask for cheese wendys actually includes the cheese most other places follow the burger king model to my knowledge but i havent been to every burger chain
  mcdicks sucks  go to burger king    bks food is better but the company has such loose standards with franchisees that the restaurants are filthy mcdogs is awful but their corporate auditors keep the franchisees on their toes
  this is true  i just always buy the version with cheese because its more premium and therefore better than the cheaper inferior alternative without cheese  i go to restaurants to enoy myself not to watch every penny and get the cheapest option
  i intentionally pay more for the cheese version to not get the cheese    why am i replying
  youre misunderstanding  i dont pay more to get the cheese that i dont want  i pay more for the premium product  just like people pay more for name brand groceries instead of the generic ones even on things like raw meat and vegetables that are basically the same  when youre not poor you start thinking in terms of whats better not in terms of whats cheaper
  what
  worst  most    sorry autocorrect
  hehe look guys i posted something that makes me seem crazy give me replies now
  are you calling me crazy
  im not calling you for dinner fatty
  hehe look guys i posted something that makes me seem crazy give me replies now
  stop breaking my immersion
  turns it into a macho dick comparison   imagine the state of this anglo american dicklet to unironically post this pathetic crybaby responce to a little cultural jibe you fucking pussyole
  at least rename your image before posting it so we dont know that you got it from knowyourmeme  
just took this five minutes ago waiting for my big tasty meal these things are slow as fuck
  is that your comeback i got a picture from a website youve absolutely ruined my standing on this here 4channel how will i every be able to post again without being ridiculed
  bluescreen on a kiosk  microshit never fails to disappoint i cant wait until were all ruled by our robot overlords and the downfall of modern society is caused by a blue screen of death
  mcdonalds shift manager here  kiosks slow as shit  people keep trying to steal drinks  literally wont let me close the store if the receipt paper gets jammed in it  wants me to have a person dedicated to solely helping people take orders on it  imagine being on the clock standing and doing nothing if you wipe down a table or something the franchise owner can have it revoked
  hes proud of going on knowyourmeme  i bet the image in this post is from reddit
  fuck off yuroshit
  if you wipe down a table or something the franchise owner can have it revoked  you mean that if an auditor sees that the guy whos supposed to man the kiosk leaves to clean a table the owner of the frenchise can have the rights to have his restaurant a mcdonalds
  for one i cannot remember where i got it and two if i want an image ill goggle it and copy it from whatever site its on are you really that retarded that your argument has come down to erm ere reddit fucking weak
  this was meant for  
  you got exactly what you asked for
  does mcdicks offer a burger that has lettuce pickles onions and tomatoes
  aint european
  reddit has its own image host and those filenames look like the ones from it  and yew you visiting a website for retards is an argument because it makes you look like a retard  its like if i told you that my favourite site is 9gag or some other site you consider stupid
  you seem to know a lot about reddit
  hes actually wrong ireddit filenames are much longer than that  these pics are from somewhere else    t actual redditor
  putting artificial cheese imitation product in your garden    you might as well bury a plastic bag itll have the same effect
  i do because im not a moron and can therefore learn about things without using them myself by remembering information that i happen to hear/read about it
  so you spend a lot of your time reading about reddit
  holy shit fuck off and die
  why are you telling to die
  i dont because  1 i said i happen to read it not that i go out of my way to specifically read about it  2 im pretty sure my knowledge of reddit is fairly limited considering that i barely know the basicw from stumbling upon information about it and by the fact that i failed to recognize the filenames as noted by   your reading comprehension is pathetic and makes me smile  if anything im more of a tiktok gentleman and an occasional funnyjunk appreciator
  probably not enough feces to lubricate the electrons
  and yew you visiting a website for retards is an argument because it makes you look like a retard  so do you take this back
  no why would i
  because youve just said your knowledge of reddit is fairly limited
  have you got any friends
  how does this contrast with any information that i posted  i said that i dont know much about reddit but some things i do know about it  namely that it has its own image host and that it has an absolutely retarded community which makes people who go on it look like retards by association      i have tons of friends on funnyjunk
  dont get it is there supposed to be something wrong with it 
  i love how much contrast there is in this post
  i dont
  thatll be eight bucks
  i doubt you have any friends online as you come across as an edgy 14 year old confuses themselves very easily and is completely oblivious to their own annoyance
  how do you know it has an absolutely retarded community
  i doubt you have any friends online as you come across as an edgy 14 year old  yeah well you know thats just like uh your opinion man    confuses themselves very easily  where    and is completely oblivious to their own annoyance  youre just annoyed by how right i am and how wrong you are      everyone on funnyjunk knows this
  and is completely oblivious to their own annoyance  youre just annoyed by how right i am and how wrong you are  where are you right and where am i wrong
  all over the thread  literally all our posts reflect this lithium
  an example
  while both are objectively shit at least mcdicks doesnt make my burps taste like i drank a bottle of liquid smoke for an hour
  everyone on funnyjunk knows this  this part was meant for 
  sure    here  i said that you got the image from knowyourmeme which is demonstrably true    here  you implied that my argument is that you took the image from a website while my argument was that you took it from one specific website thats known for being retarded  this is known as a strawman argument and is a wellknown logical fallacy    here  i said that i bet that the image originated from reddit which wasnt the case  this is the only instance of me saying something not completely correct    here  you again implied that my argument was erm ere reddit which wasnt the case for the same reason as above quite obviously a fact    here  i explained why i thought it originated from reddit and also explained my original argument of you being retarded for visiting websites for retards fact    here  you said that i seem to know a lot about reddit which isnt true because someone stating a single fact about something doesnt automatically seem knowledgeable about it he has to make many statements of considerable depth and insight for this to be the case again a bullshit argument    here  anon confirmed that i do not in fact know a lot about reddit    here  i state that you dont need to be an expert at something to know a couple notions about it absolute fact    here  you implied that if i happen to learn a couple notions about something it means that i spend a lot of my time reading about it which is a baseless and illogic assumption another bullshit argument    here  i make fun of your reading comprehension which is at an objectively pathetic level and explain why just knowing a few things about reddit doesnt make me an expert on it or someone who actively decides to spend time reading on it more absolute facts being dropped on your face just like you were as a kid    1/2
    here  and here  you imply that my previous post is somehow conflicting with my previous statements to the point of making me retract them which isnt the case at all as i explained in this post  where i merely reiterate what youve already had trouble comprehending from my previous posts  again a complete and systematic annihilation of your arguments from my facts and logic    here  you attempt at a pathetic ad hominem attack which i absolutely obliterate by simply stating that i do have in fact not just several but tons of friends on funnyjunk  an undisputable nullification of your already selfnullified logical fallacy to which you could do nothing but reply here  that you dont believe me literally like a fucking child who just responds tthats not true ffor random reasons that you just fucking pulled out of your ass    here  you just repeat the same fucking bullshit again without ver saying anything about whats contrasting in my posts fuck you    here  i explain that your opinion of me isnt universal and objective but is just your reaction to being obliterated and fucking raped by my arguments not your uncle this time and again renew my invitation to fucking tell me where im confused to which you cant respond because you are the one being confused    and this kids is how you get an epic victory royale on your ass    consider yourself warned son    2/2
  so you just go along with what everyone else does or tells you wow what a brainless retard
  its a wellknown fact all over the seven seas just like its a known fact that your mother has the cheapest blowjobs in the city even for the toothless speciality which usually costs quite a premium  you dont need to become an expert on the topic to know that something is true
    jesus fucking christ   that level of dedicated miticulous retardation  lol at first i found it funny now im shaking my head in disbelief
  i consider this argumentless baseless personal insult the confirmation to my merciless victory  thank you for partecipating    next
  im actually getting out of bed to go screen cap this on my pc
    these posts are so autistic im at a total loss saved

  fucking hell this has got to be the most retarded thread on all of 4chan and 4channel right now possibly on the entire internet
  i know 
  yes
        this is good
  the software of our water jet cutter runs on windows some time after we switched over to win10 we got the fucking unskippable update message and unavoidable restart in the middle of a running program
extra demands in a fast food shithole  does this make them feel special or some shit
  yes

  another time all went to burger king but mcdonalds had to be further so all the dishes were the exact same hahaha fucking morons
  hamburger 125  hamburger with cheese 150
  no
  see 
    based autist
  hamburger with cheese  also known as a cheeseburger
  a cheeseburger is a burger that has cheese you idiot  a hamburger is a burger that has ham you goddamn retard  a hamburger with cheese is a burger that has both ham and cheese you fucking cunt fuck your shit and your nonshit
  025 for one slice of processed cheese  the profit margin must be astounding
    obsessed  b  s  e  s  s  e  d
  bring it home to put in the garden  to grow more cheese that you will also not eat
  customer was expecting cheese like a processed cheese slice in a plastic sealed wrap and not literally on the side of the sandwich   but cheese being optional with a piece of wax paper separating it is more of a health hazard so this is a cook being literal usually its cheese or without cheese as in no cheese
  and this kids is how you get an epic victory royale on your ass  cringe
  hamburger  has ham  no
  hes right you know
  no hes not
lmao somebody post the picture
    holy mother of based
    youre paying for the cheese regardless you fucking retards this is as bad as the morons that see free shipping and instantly think its a better deal when the shipping is just included in the price
  when i used to work at mcdonalds as a kid they gave you a discount if you asked for th cheese meat or bacon to be removed sont know if thats still the same
    i actually forgot what this thread was about
  its not actually cheese
  this  the fast food worker union complained that it was inhuman to force the workers to manually spit in every hamburger so they just put phlegm slices in each burger now without the cooks having to dehydrate themselves  you just think it tastes like cheese because of the optical illusion but it actually just tastes like grilled phlegm
  go to bed ryan
still no onion rings at mcdicks
  im already in bed with your mom though
  wonder why youd do that when youre gay
  i know were anonymous here and it can be confusing to know who youre talking to so let me just clarify that youre not talking to your dad right now  i know it might seem like it its an easy mistake to make especially with the trauma he gave you when the foreskin incident happened

  201359  spooky badly drawn youtube video xd    i thought it was funny too anon but its time has passed
  pilotredsun profitted off of an already dying wave of animation/comedy  cboyardee is the legend who pioneered this style and created the shrek meme cboyardees influence on internet humor and society as a whole is never acknowledged
  dont enjoy things that arent the newest thing
  you will regret that purchase
try light walkers my sis bought  they taste just like pringles  i figured it out lads  just put less salt on the chips and they become high quality
  and created the shrek meme  i dont think that is true
  can you find any trace of shrek being memed before his shrek is not drek video was uploaded
  tim and eric filmed fake promo bits for shrek 3 before it was released that must have preceded cboyardees video
  come enjoy these crisps
  the shrek meme is ironically worshipping shrek and treating shrek like its greater than life tim and eric just skipped like little kids while watching a kids movie and shouting out sponsors which has all been done before
what do you think of this bacon cheeseburger /ck/
  top bun looks three weeks old  bacon looks like a dog treat  cheese looks like yellow slime  patty looks gray and full of congealed grossness  bottom bun clearly has been eaten once before    school cafeteria    picture is not related
  top is dry  bottom is soggy  would not eat
  is that a frozen white castle burger after its been microwaved
  whitecastle is fucking garbage but delicious and no one in a room with one is going to not eat it im pretty sure whitecastle is where that spongebob episode where squidward says he hates krabby patties but then when left alone in the vault he eats so much that he gains 500lbs deep down we would all like to think we are too good for whitecastle but the truth is it is objectively delicious
  white castle is delicious    hell if youre drunk/stoned enough damned near anything tastes good i once got high as fuck and ate half a can on nestles quick chocolate milk powder i woke up plastered with chocolate crap and my living room was coated with dust
  we should party
  it looks like you bought a whitecastle slider froze it and microwaved it
    everyone is a stoned/drunk degenerate 24/7
  i can vouch for this i used to have a problem with those boxes of microwave ones then my microwave broke and im almost too scared to buy a new one in case i go hamburger on those sliders again
  everyone on /ck/ is a stoned/drunk degenerate 24/7  ftfy
  mhhgrr i nevar had thaat befuure i woould liake sooame
  it looks like it was left under your bed for a day
    thats fresh white castle  you can tell by the cheese
  eating pork beef and cheese together at once gross
too big and the bun is wrong ive come to realise that the chain burgers are all about the bun mcds is a good example  a thin slice of crappy beef burger sauce and the soft perfumed perfect bun mayo mustard ketchup any meme beef and a superb bun thats the key to a good burger and the reason billions flow through burger chains
  why is it wet
  it saw me naked
  mayo  yikes
  not a whole hell of a lot
  top bun too big bottom bun too small too many pickles any pickles on burger  bad  7/10 sometimes a soft bun can be good but only fresh
  he doesnt get pickles on his burg  what a faggot
  eating pickles on your burger past age 0
  actually anon only picky little kids ask for no pickles pickles on a burger are god tier because they add texture and the briney flavor is a good contrast to the savory taste of the meat and condiments i wouldnt expect your poorly developed babby palate to understand this though 
  wants this sandwich to taste like the ocean    hard pass from me dawg
  loser
  the ocean  lol wat have you ever eaten a pickle
  look like a microwavable white castle burger but you added bacon and cheese
looks like you have fucking jizzed on it
  that chinese man looks like sulu of star trek lol
   wants this sandwich to taste like the ocean  that pickle your uncle asked you to suck on with your eyes closed wasnt a pickle anon
   its fresh  you can tell by the cheese
  brine  not salt water
  oh shit i have both water and salt in the stew im making itll taste just like the ocean
  pleb/10 would not eat
  im making one tomorrow and if it turns out looking anything like that then ill hang myself  that looks so bad
looks microwaved as shit soggy ass bottom thin square patty this is one of those horrid frozen white castle burgers isnt it
  this is unironically correct
is this guy cringe or redpilled  he cooks bamboo rats and shiet and dabs on westerners    
  were pathetic losers who participate in this racist support group to make ourselves feel big and important we hate him
  i dont want to give them views did he seriously kill that dog on cam
  remindereverything you do to produce yuan for china brings their inevitable war against the west an army that willingly survives by eating the enemys pets and children will be difficult to defeat
  immediately jumpcuts to skinned animal   lmao ive worked with chinese chefs and theyre bizarre people

  unhappy bamboo rat
  lol i got scolded for saying chinks be crazy at the last video
  fuck you
why are we memeing this guy now just watched a couple of his videos there is nothing wrong with them
  no it said its bloody and messy and just cuts away from it crawling around to being cleaned and cut in half im not going to act like killing an animal for food is wrong when i eat meat but i at least hope he did it quick and properly because in the chicken video he just slowly bleeds it
  but i at least hope he did it quick and properly because in the chicken video he just slowly bleeds it  not knowing the correct way of killing animals  you might as well stay being vegan or you will be forever a hypocrite and an idiot
  i mean slowly bleeding out an animal is the correct way to do it from a food quality perspective otherwise you have stagnant blood in the vessels which make the meat taste shitty but idk how i feel about that from an ethics perspective desu
  dont watch how kosher meat is prepared
  id try it although its probably too spicy for me
the amount of oil he uses in every video  holy fucking shit
  who gives a fuck about what forskin eating kikes are eating and how
  why are asians always soulless what kind of person poses with a smile holding a dead animal
  this is how all restaurant food is made you know why that pasta dish is so good its cause they use a fuckton of cream you know how those potatoes are so soft and pillowy its because theyre 50 butter    its the same with chinese food everything is deep fried and then sauced up its why its so incredibly good
  why wouldnt they im pretty happy when im frying up a steak desu
  the correct way would be to stun it or just cut the head off because thats faster than bleeding while the animal is still conscious      true but you can still do that after stunning      i know how its prepared and try to avoid supporting that if possible just because theres no good reason to not allow stunning and anything that says its not allowed is just cruel
  have my card
  what kind of person poses with a smile holding a dead animal    
    
    
    why are asians always soulless what kind of person poses with a smile holding a dead animal    gee asians huh how bout them muricans
  that animal isnt dead yet
        damn what a bunch of fuckheads  at least they still have a soul since they are not asians
  youre a fucking idiot
i dont get the hypocrisys itt you like eating meat but not the idea of killing animals
  yeah i was hoping hed show the killing  my only issue with chinamen and their eating habits is that they sometimes skin the animal alive or blowtorch it to death or something   only opened that video to see if the rat got a quick death and was cheated even of that
  you like eating meat but not the idea of killing animals    as long as they are killed in as humane a way as possible
  its not hypocrisy to enjoy meat but not enjoy the act of having to kill an animal for it thats why labgrown meat is a thing
those spicy crayfish look mighty tasty   
  its mostly because of maoism and mao zhedongs campaign against bourgeois sentiments    isnt it weird that the same places where buddhist and taoist vegetarianism flourished have now suddenly become absolute toilets where the people are incapable of any kind of virtue its not to do with asians its to do with certain political movements which most likely also exist in your own country as well so if you dont like how it is over in china maybe you should move to make sure that people arent throwing around similar political ideas in your country
  its just racist whte0ids larping as morally adjusted people
  t soulless chink insect    we can judge you people because we are not soulless we are americans
  literally literally advertising nice fucking unskippable ad
  this is a reddit post
  lmao
cringe  redpilled  dab  racist shit    kill yourself newfags
  the end product looked fine and i would have tasted it    i dont really care about eating rat as long as its well cooked and it doesnt give me superaids or something    nothing wrong with video i dont get why it has 5k dislikes
  ikr
  giraffes baboons and niggers are all pretty common in africa the chinks killing rhinos and elephants are the real fuckheads
  use adblock retard right now you are that bamboo rat and im the chink
  the bamboo rats are the natural hosts for the diseasecausing mold penicillium marneffei which is endemic in all species in southeast asia in this area penicilliosis due to the mold is the third most common opportunistic infection in hivpositive individuals
waaaaaaaannnnnngggg gaaaaaaaannnnnngggg    stiffy uh
  why does it really matter i mean that its suffering just like our suffering wont matter after were dead
  suuuuuwooooooo
  i bet you wouldnt stun me till i am out of conscious before killing me you piece of soulless trash
theres nothing wrong with killing the animals yourself and if anything its way better for the animal to live relatively free and then killed than to live as livestock in a cramped unsanitary space until it grows enough and is killed asap by a machine for consumption the animals the west eats suffer a lot but most people dont care since they dont have to see it and they just buy the cuts they need at the butcher or the supermarket    if anything this guy has way more experience on the value of life of animals than the western crybabies complaining about him cooking rat while buying all their shit from a supermarket
  based and molerat pilled  i enjoyed and learned from that would like to see more ching chong cooking videos as long as they dont involve murdering doggos
isnt this bushmeat

  transhumanist resurrection bro
  of course not your suffering makes your flesh tastier
  watasha wa ningen daa
  liar  chinks tortured animals before consumption is not for taste but their own psychological satisfaction thats what made them soulless
  animals suffering makes the meat taste worse from the adrenaline and them tensing up though
  ian
tell me anyone eating that should could even identify the meat
  nice try im posting from taiwan     ÁôΩ‰∫∫Áúã‰∏çÊáÇ
  is this guy rhodesian
  cringe
  i like how he cleans and separates the parts   way better than reddit tier crawfish boils
  ÁôΩ‰∫∫Áúã‰∏çÊáÇ  im black and i can read this  i dont even read chinese but somehow i was able to read this
  dabbin on chinks
  i dont think he is trying to dab on westerners at all these videos are clearly for a predominantly chinese audience and the chinese diaspora he probably wasnt thinking about us at all
  of course he doesnt give a shit about you guys  did some retards actually think that he gave a shit about anyone outside of china
  i mean its quite evident that he doesnt give a shit about english speaking audiences when it has hardcoded chinese subs
      nah he just want to share how to cook chinese cuisine no matter who the audiences are most of his videos have subtitles    
  why are you so gay
  do you frown when cooking steak
   beer can reduce the bad smell of the bamboo rat
  t chink
chinese be nasty as fuck
  that sure was a lot of technique and finesse for just a serving of slop you could find in a mall chinese fast food store
  yea man china is so much worse off now than it was before mao ill throw in a you fucking idiot because youre probably to dumb to catch sarcasm
   thought this was a mongolian basket weaving forum
bam
  lots of people have photos in their homes of them holding up a prize fish or deer    granted but the food that we think of as chinese food might be better thought of as chinese party food
  this is the only chinese i know
  nigga just fried and boiled the bones of some exotic animal its just a bowl of saucey bones weird flex but okay nice intro to sichuan cuisine
  tao vegetarianism    you absolute fucktard mao messed up china thoroughly sure but dont drag chinese culture into your vegetarian fantasies if youve actually been to chinese temples youd know that meat offerings are virtually commonplace
  tfw no spice weasel and have to use spices from a shaker like a pleb
  chinese love to eat boney meat swear to god most shit over there is served with more bones than meat
  those hunts are actually planned culls typically the animals in question are older males who are no longer prolific breeders but who are still healthy enough to fight and drive off other males which lowers birthrates the hunters in those photos are essentially people who have paid a lot of money to do a game wardens job for them
  so you just chew on a piece and spit out the bones and cartilage this is why i hate chicken wings and drumsticks
  im black  cringe
  yes essentially pic related is very standard it has all the little shitty bones still in it so youre constantly chewing around it its just a pain in the ass
  its really cool how he has technical specifications at the end of every video guy really knows his shit
  i liked it simple but instructive video and interesting ingredients/recipe i dont usually see    gonna check out his other stuff    redpilled to answer your question and most definitely based
  how are those woodstump cutting boards  almost every chink restaurant i go to seems to have one
  good for large knives like cleavers
what annoys me about those wok dishes is how much oil they use its greasy as shit
this video is so cruel and terrible bamboo rat is so cutehow can you eat bamboo rats its look like not spicy enough put more chillies on it thank you
  bamboo rat is a chink meme
  specifically this dude  who has dozens of videos all about bamboo rats  
  bamboo rats are relatively easy to catch and a good source of protein you definitely need the antiseptic effect of chilly pepper with it though
alright co/ck/heads     got a 5kg turkey cheaper than a 2 hooker after thanksgiving australian so no one really celebrates it down here but the shops had them anyway     watch as i attempt to cook this bitch
  ok
  this gonna be good mate
carrots onions bay leaves rosemary garlic and celery as a bed to cook it on
shoved an orange some rosemary and garlic up it also buttered and season the bird after i patted it dry i assume this is the correct procedure    im just treating this as a massive chicken i suppose
wa la     ive read its 35 minutes per kilo at 180 degrees thats about 3 hours for this one wrapping it in foil and chucking it in the oven soon
got some sourdough going here too so waiting for that to come out of the oven before we pop the fucker in
  god i wish that were me
  sweet dreams anon
  whwhat is that
  every kitchen needs a proper turkey stuffer mate
now it has been properly stuffed its going in     see you in 3 hours
you making any side dishes op
you should have air fried it heh
  p r o l e v e l
  italian dildo
  maybe just some mashed potatoes and peas what goes best with turkey
  a good stuffing is key to keeping the bird moist and its always nice to have an extra hand in the kitchen
  stuffing is good another popular item is gravy and cranberry sauce if you dont have cranberry sauce you can you a tart jam i guess
  yeah ill be making a gravy from the juices hence the bed of vegetables ill deglaze with some beer or maybe wine and get that shit going while the turkey is resting
expect a nice turkey dinner cookalong  out comes the dildo    never change 4chan anyway something fun for a side dish might be beets of some sort the sweetness might go well with it like cranberries we use here on thanksgiving
  no stuffing  already failed m8
  excellent idea i think i have some fresh beetroot in the fridge i might roast it
  where in australia ive never seen turkeys sold for thanksgiving anywhere
  tasmania mate they had them frozen at woolworths
heres the bread by the way
op didnt dry drine    what a waste of a good bird
  what the fuck is dry brining
op isnt going to post a picture when its done because its going to be charcoal  who the fuck cooks a 10 pound turkey for 3 hours you can cook a 20 pound turkey in that time
impressive kitchen op    also for the gravy adding some honeymustard might pair well with the orange
  great idea ill see what mustards i have lying around
  kek
  go roast it thanks to /ck/ i found out you folks put beets on burgers i guess you probably have a better recipe than me
dude you have to brine and spatchcock that shit those breasts are going to be dry af
  looks good
  meant to butter underneath the skin not ontop
  oh i forgot youre gonna have lots of leftovers from that bird the mustard will come in handy for for turkey sandwiches later use whatever bread you like and put some sharp cheddar on it mayo too if you want
one hour in time to baste it
save the bones op you can make soup out of it
  you fucking burnt it  one job op one fucking job
  enhancing in order to turn up at ops house for beers and turkey
  what range is that
  ilve pw906mp
i have fuck all parsley
  have any cilantro
bit of thyme
  and they were on sale i see woolworths building up their stock of frozen turkey and ham as we approach christmas but having too much at the end of november is surprising
  we already have a bangs thread
lemons are going well though plenty on the tree ill zest one of these
okay here we are butter salt pepper lemon zest and a bit of juice parsely thyme and olive oil
  garlic
  youre able to grow lemons down in tassie
  used all my garlic in the pan and up inside the bird none left should have planned ahead
  yeah they were cheap as chips mate this 5kg one cost me 30 bucks       sure am mate they grow really well down here
  sure am mate they grow really well down here  i thought the climate would be too cold for them down there    i was in tassie for a few weeks last summer late january and it got coooold kinda ruined my overland track as it was raining and just above freezing for 6/7 days i walked it
  ive done that track about 5 times now bloody beautiful the view from mount ossa is incredible if you managed to nip up there
based
op are you the same aussie anon who did the pie cookalong awhile ago  ive had the pleasure of being a part of a few of his threads always top tier
  i sure am mate moved from brisbane to tassie a few weeks ago so much nicer kitchen now
  i knew it remember me i was that drunken shit that was super stoked about it and im still a drunken piece of shithaha
  unfortunately not i was walking up and the weather turned so i decided to go back as the rocks got slippery unfortunately i will likely not get another opportunity to be there as i live in canada and have now traveled around all of australia so will likely not go back for a long time if ever
  will based and redpilled doggo get a slice of turkey
  oh no how are you going to live without being in the vicinity of the xxxx brewery
  how could i forget your drunken arse you an aussie
  no an amerilard senpai
  this  xxxx gold is so robust and flavourful almost like drinking asparagus tainted obese shemale piss
  absolutely
  for me its xxxx summer bright lager  the true taste of gamer girl pee
  hey lads im sniffing some petrol and heading to the centrelink
final stretch
  on a sunday arvo
  gonna grab some ciggies from the servo first
money shot
dont forget to make the turkey some booties
leave this bitch to rest i suppose
  u inviting some black fellas over noonga
  cant believe katie is 73 this year lads  time flies
  kate
  imagine the smell of her mature asshole
  the turkey or kate rest her soul
  dont talk about my nan that way
  i bet she did unprotected anal too probably preferred it to vaginal intercourse
op how long till you cut this baby open  how are the sides coming along
  she blew a wog on kosciuszko
  nice work chef get a drumstick and wing and go to town you earned it
  looks good op next time try spatchcocking it by removing the spine with some kitchen shears it cuts the cook time in half and everything cooks more evenly crispy skin too pic related
  can confirm dry brine and spatchcocking makes a fucking amazing turkey
  hey im alaffin ovah heah
  where im in launceston and would enjoy a turkey and a casual encounter with the kind of person who keeps a rubber fist
  bigggle rick xdd

  based and blessed doggo
    noice
  hobart im afraid my good man
  im a gril anon
bump
  are these tasmanian devils
  this shit actually exists
  post feet
  is that your wifes
  im gay btw not sure if that matters
  what stop
  i do what i want
what is with people and their  small stomach i cant even eat out with people because i a heightlet and weightlet finish my food and proper serving and people who are fatter than me or taller eat much less and the tall ones throw away their food while the fatties take the food home i swear to got they arent even eating piggish amounts some fat bitch cant finish two slices of pizza what the fuck better yet these people sometimes claim to be dieting yet ive not gained a single pound
  ever been checked for worms or beetus
  youre supposed to eat less in public you pig
  that another dumb rule you citydwelling assholes invented like no elbows on the table
  fat people sometimes feel ashamed of eating so much in public or they may be trying to diet taller people than you may also be less active or have worse metabolisms or just have a smaller intake im a lanklet and cant eat as much as most people i know but i never throw shit away
  fat people stuff themselves between meal and they arent active
  yeah im sure ordering an entire pizza pie and eating 1 slice is the most normal thing someone can do
thanks for the blog thats some riveting stuff right there
eat your food
  it is about what you order as well some people when hungry order way more than they can eat which is why they tell you not to shop for groceries when you are hungry
i like these a little too much
  i hate you more than you could ever like anything
im gay btw if that matters
  i would snack on these while playing through katawa shoujo after the release  they bring back some good memories
  fuck off weeb
  i really wouldnt be surprised if i at some point actually did too     theyre hightier fruity candy
hit me with your microwave tips ck    i tired making rice in this but it overboiled and made a mess also i burned the popcorn bc this oven was too small inflated popcorn bag was too big to turn inside and it burned  i need ur recipes and tips please
  the microwave isnt for cooking you mong its for reheating and even then most foods are better off reheated on the stove or in a mini oven
  well its too late now since i bought it also i plan to use it for reheating but i wanted to cook few things too i wanted to avoid buying a rice cooker but i might still get one   also not a mong have only two chromosomes
should have bought a toaster oven
  is getting a microwave really such an event that you have to cook meals in it to try it out
  for idiots it is
  would it be possible to use a microwave to parcook a steak and then reverse sear it asking for a friend
  you shouldnt have said that you better watch your back tonight
  i have no idea i just got mine but it has a grill option that i plan to use for sandwiches and pizza
  iis it steak team 6 oh fuck oh god what have i done
  there is no such thing in my country microwave toaster mini stove yes toaster oven no
  really where do you live
  enjoy the gangstalking
  why does your microwave have a tv
  wtf
  tell them i remember
  making a false report  thinking that anon woild be the one fucked up  hope this was fake for your sake
its funny that the microwave used be such an essential item its literally only good for reheating coffee and boiling water
  oh no no no no no
  your baiting right
  he asks in an entire bait thread
  you can pretty much google these things  you can cook potatoes in them but theyll be just soft with no crispy shell  you can cook bacon in them if you do it right  you can steam things in them probably    a microwave oven would be better for you than a plain old microwave if you wanted to really cook in one
  yeah my bad ive only been on 4channel for 6 days
chef mike is a great addition to any household what if you need some melted butter am i supposed to get out a fuckin pan and melt it on the stove when i could melt in the microwave in 15 seconds which is 1 of the time it would take another way
  i always make rice in the microwave  1 cup basmati  2 cup already boiling water  salt and optional dry seasonings  8 minute cook on medium power  add sauces if im doing that  2 minute cook  check to see if theres water at bottom cook until is gone  ezpz  i do texmex which is just add a packet of saz√≥n at the beginning can of refried beans and onion powder after 8 minutes 45 seconds left i add monteray jack and wala savory af and tastes like heaven  can add a portion of that golden curry shit i always buy from the chink market at beginning for sudoindia food  half jar of pasta sauce after 8 minutes for poverty pasta or just 2 cups rice 4 cups water and whole jar  lime juice and dry cilantro at the beginning to get that signature chipotle white rice  4 can tuna handful of frozen peas after 8 minutes and some chup after cooked for a more filling version of tuna mac  or you could learn what google is
  most of the world is 50 years behind us microwaves are for rich people in europe they are just now getting past jello molds
  have you read the manual maybe youre not ready for this
  your digits aside microwaves are magical souffle machines
  put a small box that had frozen food on the glass plate thingy and youll cure cold spots
never cook microwaved foods at 100 high power always double the time and half the power it will much more evenly heat your food
  dont do this op
  put metal form in it for 2 minutes full power to season it you fucking noob
  a metal fork
the convection toaster oven basically shits all over microwaves
  it keeps boiling out of the bowl and it floods the microwave    this is not a bait thread cant a girl ask for advice
this oven was too small  the best tip is to not get a shitty small microwave go big or go home
  make sure the bowl is 3x the amount of dry rice you plan to use in it i use a 7 cup pyrex glass bowl with no cover and regularly make 2 cups rice in it  the reason i leave uncovered is bc the microwave does a good enough job keeping the steam from seeping out i literally microwave rice daily and have never had this issue
  i covered mine thanks for info will try again i still have rice from the other day made 4 cups on the stove it works like magic for reheating
  reduce power to 70  cover your dishes  get a stove
the eyes of a helpless innocent being it cries for family attention and friendship we kill them at 1/20th of their natural lifespan we torture them we brutally kill them a good portion of them die before slaughter from terrible living conditions disease and injury    stop eating pigs

  low iq le bacon response  
  you clearly didnt imagine the smell
  real question why dont we just kill and eat animals when their natural lifespan is nearly over
  be me  go deer hunting  watch buck spend time trying to breed wounded and dying doe  yeah theyre just dumb animals bro

   have no comeback   better call anon npc    something an actual npc would do

  the only way to do so would be to ban killing them outright stop the leftist mentality also so what if we did thats nature actual nature not slaughtering 70 of beings on earth every year
  hello redd√≠t
  why do people expect other people to give a shit about the lives of delicious weaker machines when most of them prioritize things like buying colored shoes or computer games over improving or saving the lives of children and other innocent people
this thread is a dumpster fire
  the vast majority of livestock wouldnt even exist if it wasnt for humans raising them in confined safe areas
  animals arent people
  fuck youi was a middle man who took care of them until they were old enough to slaughter they are adorable as babies but something in their brains clicks when they become adults the pigs i took care of were treated very good but if you fall down around them theyll eat you if a pigs injures its leg the others will attack and eat it alive i have no problem cooking these assholes
  so animals can eat us with no consequence simply because theyre of different species
  ah yes never seen a wild bull chicken or pig after all      enslave them to be slaughtered     why are they violent

    this is where your bacon comes from
  why do you post this edgy shit
now i really feel like a bacon and egg roll  added smoked bacon to my shopping list thanks op

  its an omnivore reverts to abortion nonargument to avoid their own hypocrisy episode
  oof um actually no sweetie that slaughterhouse is on the opposite side of the country from me so im relatively certain that my bacon is not from that particular establishment as it would be inefficient to ship meat products all the way from there to my local grocery store thanks but no thanks honey pie 3
  the eyes of a helpless innocent being  posts a fucking pig  those shitheads will kill and eat farmers the wild ones ravage ecosystems and are wiping out native species in the south and hawaii the first documented manmade extinction was the dodo bird which was killed off by escaped pigs fuck pigs if anything we should make it a point to torture them more
  literally worshiping a sacred cow  all the while endorsing the killing of unborn humans  thats gonna be a big ol yikes from me sugar plum
go swim in some shark infested waters and see how vegan you can turn them
  sharks are actually pretty friendly
  uh oh wowzers but it uh well it looks like you didnt read my comment butter bear
  promoting a leave the animal the fuck alone episode  this equals worshipping the animal  killing a conjugated group of cells at 1 month with no nervous system is the same as killing a fully grown pig    big ol yikes on your delusion sweetie 3
  who is saying that vegans want animals to not act like animals  are you retarded
  base argument against eating animal meat entirely around the axiom of premature death/suffering being an evil  try to argue that the sanctioned premature death of a human beings at the maximum possible point of life potential for the sake of convenience is somehow less atrocious than the killing of a developed prey animal for sustenance    i know youre baiting but prochoice vegans/vegetarians will never win an argument for their dietary habits
this thread is shit and you all should feel bad for bumping it its obvious bait and you all fall for it everytime theres literally nothing wrong with eating meat you cant blame a consumer for the shitty practices of the company selling the product they buy this issue is way more complex then just stop eating meat if everyone did the companies would go bankrupt and thounds of people would lose their jobs and livelyhoods and then they cant just release all the animals into the wild they would just destroy the environment i know i fell for the shitty bait but anyone who legitimately thinks that showing us how our meat is made is going to make most anyone stop eating meat is stupid its dumb propaganda and blaming the consumer is not the right way to do it the issue is the meat producers not the consumers you retards
  how long have humans eaten pigs/boar wanting animalshumans to not act like animals    think about it then answer who is the retarded one
  how long have humans eaten pigs/boar  10 of our total evolution  90 was spent eating plants fruits and bugs
  says nuveganscience dot com articles    feel free to devolve all you like im going to keep enjoying the fuck out of pigs flesh
test
  why the fuck did you shoot a doe you piece of shit
  but its not crying for family youre passing off human emotions onto a non human animal because youre retarded
  did you eat its semen
  absolutely animals eat people all the time its partly why we keep animals we cant control away from people
  the meat gets tougher  less flavorful the older the animal is
  all the progress happened within the 10    case fucking closed
  other way around on flavor
hey /ck/ i need your help   part of what i wanted to get my parents for christmas was a gift basket for each of them with some good liqour but i have no idea what is some actual good liquor vs just overpriced shit  my dad doesnt really have a preference but my moms been drinking wine a lot lately   they both have been drinking belvedere a lot too   whats some good cheap liquor i got about 200 to work with for the drinks
  casually ask them what their favorite drinks are get them their favorite not what some moron here says
  disregard what this faggot  says if you want to get your parents a cheap yet extremely good alcoholic drink i got you buddy    nog season    put your hands you motherfucking nogger
would you like one /ck/
ill pass but thanks anyway
  nah
looks good fag
whats that a like a pizza thing uh
yes please
  cheese
  id like to eat it yes
  ham  come back to me when its roast beef
  you mean   fuck    you think it would sting my urethra
  what are the transparent rings around the meat
  what do you think it would feel like haha if it burns the pee hole would it feel good haha
  yes but id probably end up on the toilet by the end of the night discharging everything from my body
  of course what do you think i am some fag like   that almost looks like the perfect sandwich but it needs onions
  crohns bro here too so when do you plan on giving up with in the next year for me
  i dont have crohns i just know that large enough of cheese alone would wreck me before getting into the oils and shit too
  the last time i had some of my small bowel removed a guy asked to pray about my surgery and then he started telling me about his crohns going away after giving up all dairy i told him that i like cheese too much to even think about that its so strange that there is preachers there to talk with surgery goers
   i had some of my small bowel removed  thats some deep shit man i have a friend with crohns and he basically at this point in life has found out what he can eat or not to avoid feeling awful all the time
  have you ever considered your lactose intolerant or some other protein in milkbased products
  yeah actually looks yum in my tum
  of course especially after hearing that preacher guy   but im almost ready to call it quits so fuck it i just hope i can last through winter so i can try some may apple root to put an end to it once and for all the only things that guarantee a bout are oranges and popcorn usually i can eat dairy and be fine    that was my second bowel resection both times 18 inches removed
  stromboli
that looks like the kind of thing where visually it seems good but then you take a bite and its so rich and salty and overwhelming and then you wish you hadnt gotten it
  looks like undercooked dough
just had jaw surgery food suggestions other than soup and ramen preferrably
  haha dank meme my friend
eat this  grabs cock
  applesauce  also stop sucking so much huge cock
yogurt greek regular and gogurt extra cooked oatmeal porridge warm white bread no crusts with butter or soft cream cheese jello pudding because its delicious and soup
  have a boost for breakfast and an ensure for dessert and when someone orders pancakes just sip the sizzurp
  milkshakes
  when i had my wisdom teeth out i lived on cottage cheese and apple sauce for a week it wasnt so bad  a protein shake a day is handy as well  iirc my dentist told me that high fat intake is most important when bone is healing
  chili
what kind of surgery i need surgery to fix my severe overbite but the recovery is supposed to take a year or so and i cant risk losing my job as im on a contract
sopa de macaco
  i have an amazing diet its called everything goes in the blender diet works great for when you cant chew
  i never heard about jaw surgery recovery taking more than a few weeks sure the year isnt for it to be fully healed
  yeah i meant full recovery
    cant chew  no soup suggestion please    wow i guess beggars can be choosers
  you should be able to work and eat real food after a few weeks maybe as little as two  unless you work as a rugby player
  could only eat through a straw for two weeks after 4 wisdom teeth were hacked out by shit tier dentist    semolina with sugar milk lots of cream was my absolute goto so comfy even through a straw
do you eat while browsing /ck/
that looks so good
  you havent seen this yet
  what kind of sauce is that it looks like tapioca puddin
you know i can just hide your thread and then it doesnt bother me anymore and it takes you longer to make a thread than it takes me to hide it
how do you like your beef
this isnt natural
  first off no cow is the species is came from is extinct    secondly if thats a belgian blue then yes its just bred that way making you insecure
  define natural
  obviously on some peds if you feel me
  it actually is
  with a side of beef
  rare to medium rare no matter what
  its better than everything you believe in
  bottom pic is a brutal mogging how can other bulls even compete
  big
    bottom pic is a cow not a bull
  does this beef have autism
    its a steer which is a bull thats been castrated as a calf i live about an hour away from the farm where this unit is on      cattle sizes have increased year on year its just a consequence of breeding programs its like corn going from an inedbile stringy little piece of shit to a huge juicy mother
    hmm everyone reported on it as a cow and i assumed they knew that words meant things
  put a semilarge cow next to some calves  lelel look how big this cow is
  the species is came from is extinct    evidently not retard
  you went to school in kentucky didnt you
  absolute unit
  most domestic animals we use were bred from wild forms of animals that are no longer extant today dogs for example were bred from a kind of wolf thats extinct now not from modern day wolves
  you didnt pay attention most news sites in the headline explicitly pointed out that its a cow male
  cows are female    steers and bulls are male
  i trusted the media

taking a week long trip to la what spots should i try bros already know about roscoes and pinks and all that
   mcdonalds get the mcchicken
  go to a birrieria and get some good goat
cocos you need to try cocos
  roscoes and pinks are alright but not really worth the long wait and price id suggest howlin rays for good chicken wurstkuche for good dogs and night market song for god tier thai food
  mmm any streets you recommend    this is the type of stuff im looking for not the over packed stuff definetly interested in all of these especially the thai food thanks bro
  ok whos lebron
  oh the place from nathan for you
  lebron james
  the french basketball player
  try the original phillipe the french dips are great the mustard is hot and the place has a nice retro sandwich counter feel to it
  fuck you la and fuck you lebron clevelands a shithole and you abandoned it again for another shithole
all of the ones on olvera street are pretty good
    terrible sandwiches tourist trap dont go
  howlin rays wurstkuche and phillipes are all about 10 minutes from each other too bad howlin rays line is long as fuck the area around these spots are shitty too hit up manuels el tepayac for a fat burrito and then never come back to these shitty parts of los angeles ever again
churchs chicken at the intersection of orange grove and fair oaks in pasadena please eat in the bus stop out front and feed the skin/bones to the pigeons
  get some dude weed brownies and 420 blaze it at macarthur park then go to langers while blazed out of your mind
  try to go to howlin rays as early as possible to avoid long fucking lines    also pinks is overhyped
  they have the best cream of broccoli soup and the best house dressing get both the soup and salad with your meal definitely
if youre willing to drive out from the la/downtown area cooks tortas in monterey park is worth it or titos in el monte
  fuck you and fuck cocos  i had some rude ass nigger bitch waitress ask me whachoo wann might have been carrows though
  what part of la definitely hit up a jims for a dui    also this  
hit up a king taco while youre there
do not go to roscoes horribly overrated
  kys
tommys nice burgers that are packed with chili
  which is why its full of movie executives and their pas at noon
  get ramen and pho from just about any place that looks good on yelp i like shinsengumi  try not to get aids from the loud aggressive woke faggots
  caring about apehoop  yikes
  little tokyo is pretty good shabu shabu mr noodles or orishan     cant go wrong with the original tommys not toms tommies or timmies    king taco or titos tacos
la is a godforsaken shithole and the food is probably the only good thing you will have there
  you son of a bitch i will hit you with my truck if i see you instead go three blocks east to roma market on lake and mountain and get the sandwich its made by a 90 year old 4 foot italian man its absolute perfection

  put them on your dick surprise your boifriend
  maybe its because i used to eat those with my main girlfriend in college but i always associated peach rings with eating pussy and thats a good thing
      stay on topic niggers
  its good dry but damn when its moist in milk it retains a light crispy crunch while being nice and creamy inside    however it will slice the roof of your mouth to shit totally worth it
  when i was a teenager i tried to cram as many of these things into my ass as i could
if you like crunchy vegetables and have never eaten kinpira gobo burdock root you are missing out
  you know i just realized the other day that all my preferred sweet foods offer roughly the same moist dense texture  cookie dough  marzipan  mochi  fudge  etc  its probably some childhood imprinted thing anyone else know this feeling
bean sprouts
  peach rings are not only my favorite flavor but they remind me of buttholes my favorite body part i love to pretend im tonguing a cute girls butt hole when i eat and suck on them
  you ate playdoh as a kid these are just the socially acceptable variants
  they remind me of buttholes my favorite body part  my brother
  sometimes i shove a couple of these up my ass
  koreaboos
  you teethed on daddys dick
well cooked eggplanti think thats the only reason for its existence how creamy soft it is finally decided it was about mouth feel and nothing else
actually just had one   very little flavor but the texture is best in class
  arent buttholes where the shit is made tho
  just ate my wifes ass earlier it certainly helps to shower
  thats like fucking with a condom  no risk no pleasure
  doesnt have to be risky to be pleasurable eating ass is definitely haram as fuck and that alone is worth it
how can i into molecular gastronomy to make my own peach rings at home out of other fruits or ingredients
  try google
  thanks found it 
i can definitely see why some people hate tripe but i think its fucking delicious and has a texture like nothing else
  id eat it just gushing over the fact poo was being produced by what was becoming a part of me
  do you eat sausages the skin is made of intestines
  only if you eat fancy sausages  here theyre all just collagen so im eating feet instead of poo transfer devices
  very little flavor  clearly you didnt eat it when it was ripe
  yes gobo so fukn good
happy caturday /ck/
cool
        braps on every single cats faggot face
  rude and uncalled for
  sounds like somebodys having a bad caturday
  you got me

what makes filipino food superior  the right ratio of fresh vegetables to meat perhaps
  what makes filipino food superior    usually vinegar
  why is flip food so unappealing look yet so delicious its a shame the people are all snakes
  let me just go down to the local flip restaurant  oh wait there arent any   not when i lived in japan not here in australia  speaks volumes
flips think very highly of any food thats not from a landfill
  this    never heard of a filipino restaurant
filipino food is dogshit
  i bought a filipina wife 2 years ago  she cooks cleans and it submissive  a very good investment    she cooks everyday and only uses fresh ingredients   pretty healthy cheap and tasty
  pics  i love asians but very very few flips i find attractive
  she likes to take selfies
blame the spanish and american colonization for the bad quality of filipino food
  oh here we go blaming whitey still in 2018
  truth is something difficult to change comrade
  i bought a filipina wife  a very good investment  jfc
  spanish  white  pick one
  american colonization    i wouldnt call military managed prostitution zones colonization
filipinos managed to take the worst aspects of white spanish and japanese culture and mash it together
  be islandniggers  do nothing but sit around  white folks come  make every aspect of your life better  alright boys its time to go see ya   omg white people ruined everything
  the irony of your image with your kindergarten understanding of history wasnt lost
filipino food is the worst of the cuisine from all the asian countries ive been too save maybe for laos    its not bad its just very average compared to good asian cuisine
oh no i dont like the yolks running be me as teen well ive learned     things we need to teach teens
  to take a joke without crying  and also to not overcook everything its ok for a porkchop to be a little pink in the middle
  dont overseason everything seasoning should enhance the flavor not be the flavor dont overcook things embrace the various textures of food
  rare pork is disgusting you damn retard
  he said a little pink not rare you donkey
  found the teen  and lets add reading comprehension to the list of things to learn
  a little pink on a pork chop isnt rare you moron 145 is done
      disgusting
  oh child
  runny egg    enjoy getting sick
  damn that looks like absolute garbage kill yourself
  it was great 
  i know youre trolling but i still get mad because i know there are people who really think like that    there appears to be a public information campaign running in my country right now telling people to put their leftovers in the fridge  two thoughts  1 they wouldnt spend money on this unless they were seeing an increase in idiots who get sick from off food    2 they are specifically saying to put the food in the fridge quickly and im interested to see how many retards will end up spoiling everything in their fridge by putting a nice hot pot of soup or stew in there so the whole fucking thing heats up to room temp    god i hate people
  that has nothing to do with what he said you schizo
  i didnt say it did retard  you can talk about two things in one post
  nobody cares about your autistic fixation with irrelevant shit stop posting
  good food is bad bad food is good good posts are shitposts shitposts are good    /ck/ has always been garbage because of users like you
  autistic ramblings about random shit arent good posts stop posting
  yes you should i think we all agree on that
  that better fucking be toenails and not some shitty plebtier cheese grating
  cringe
  cringe  go back to reddit any time im sure they miss your insightful posting habits
  you are getting desperate
  no honestly i bet they love you over there i know id upvote you here if i could really top notch posting
  allowed to drive after 4 pints  clearly this was made before ipas came along
  embarrassing
  they are specifically saying to put the food in the fridge quickly and im interested to see how many retards will end up spoiling everything in their fridge by putting a nice hot pot of soup or stew in there so the whole fucking thing heats up to room temp  the problem is that if you dont tell them theyll leave the rice out just as long as the soup rice needs to be chilled down fast letting it come to room temp first is a bad idea
saw these and was like woah neato a new entry in spicy chip game problem is i cant even detect spice why are the paqi ghost pepper chips the only thing even trying to be mainstream and spicy theyre not as hot now as they were at first either but still you can tell they try    come on americans can handle spice now just do it
  consuming taco bell products
i find takis to be fairly spicy
  he thought taco bell was spicy  i have news for you kiddo
  its for suburban soccer moms to feel dangerous
nobody makes spicy chips because nobody buys them  nobody buys spicy chips because theyre too spicy  people cant get accustomed to spicy chips because nobody makes them    the paqui chips are an exception but i bet they lose a good chunk of money on them even if it is a meme at this point
lpbp
paqi chips got nerfed bummer they were great during the winter when i had congestion and needed to clear out my sinuses
never been to taco bell  go there one day while on a work trip  everyone looks at me weird as i put on a couple packets of the diablo sauce onto my taco  it feels like a solid 2/5 star spice
  this  make your own spicy sauce at home
  boomers literally cannot handle black pepper and taco bell is typically full of boomers who think that it is actual mexican food
  ive always wondered in a major city where you have inexpensive authentic mexican places everywhere what kind of retard would eat taco bell how can they even stay in business
  many people especially millennials and zoomers are uncomfortable going to a normal restaurant they want what they are used to which is taco bell they can order with an app so they dont have to gasp talk to a waitress
  taco bell has a drive through neets dont like leaving the safe space of their car unless its to retreat back into their dungeon
  2/5 star spice  p much when i get taco bell i take it home and dump a bunch of el yucateca sauce all over it to get it kicking
go to cupbop popular local korean meme food for all you non utahns  their whole selling point is their spicy sauces  scale of 1 to 10 1 being just sweet 10 supposedly being spiciest shit around  order a 10  r u sure lol its super hot   yes im sure fag gimme  zoomers behind the counter all start chanting n shit  line behind me laffin  oooooooh he gon get burned  try it  fucking nothing  i hate this state so much the spiciest thing most people have had here is fucking mustard
  lose money  nah little chicanos eat em up like its the only food in the gas station my high school was like half mexican and i can assure you paqui and takis and the whole lot of spicy mexican brand shit has 0 sales issues
  places arent allowed to sell hot shit they get sued by americans im american  the hottest thing i can find in a grocery chain is awesome scarred habanero peppers in winndixie publix has that gay waxy weak orange stumpy habaneros and i was surprised when i found those    anyway mainstream spicy cant happen bitches will complain that they got what they ordered same reason i cant order anything spicy from asian places they call me round eye your best bet is hot sauce try daves brand insanity sauce its popular found it at a vitamin market a couple miles away the ghost pepper sauce version isnt spicier its just thinner so you accidentally use more of it
  daves scorpion aint hot for me
  im american  obviously not from the south in new orleans 99 of the shit is fucking nuclear if you want it hell even all the way up in natchez they had a thai place that was so god damn fucking spicy i was crying while i was eating and it was the best goddamn thai i have ever had    just go to a hot sauce store retard or a local wing joint hell even buffalo wild wings has some nice heat on their higher level shit
  even b dubs has some decent level heat  idk why but their second hottest to hottest is like a quantum leap i cant make it just seems so much hotter when i comfortably demolish the 2nd hottest
  i personally used to like the mango habanero or whatever it was the perfect spice for 10 wings by the time you were done youd have felt like you have had some serious fucking spice and still some solid wings but their hottest is aight not a good spicy flavor    sucks because bdubs was very on and off sometimes they were great and sometimes it was straight up bad
  come on americans can handle spice now just do it    if youre looking for extra hot food at a fast food place like taco bell you are really really doing it wrong you need to go to a non chain place for actual hot shit     fast food places will often make shit screaming ghost pepper or carolina reaper when in actuality it is like 001 of the active ingredient just so people can feel like the heat is cranked up major chains and stuff are often afraid to make anything too hot because people are idiots and will rub their eyes with the shit on their hands or horribly underestimate what they can handle      this
the spicier the better i need my spice  cant think of a more numale redditor thing other than maybe cast iron shit
  cant think of a more numale redditor thing  how about posting on 4channelorg/ck  doesnt get much faggier than this
  t midwesterner
  yeah my local b dubs can have atrocious service and wait times for like no fucking reason it should take all of five minutes to deep fry some traditional wings and sauce em sometimes theyll even be slow on my beer and beer refills if i was their manager or franchise owner i would lose my shit if you werent pushing beer like a motherfucker the wings are a loss leader the only way im making moneys is on the beer refills because the soda refills are free     ive eaten at b dubs coast to coast and my local one is the worst by far very disappoint because its the only place around that doesnt fuck up the wings by trying too hard or breading them or some other bs
  obligatory reminder that wing stop is superior
  do they bread their wings tho i wont stand for that shit
    based breaded wings are trash
  op how did you make this gif
  he doesnt know
  not sure if they still make them but blairs had some pretty nutso chips happening for a while    3am reserves still my goto for i love the flavour but this chili needs to be hotter so maybe that companys actually doing something right
  he knew at one point and then forgot
  even their hottest sauce fire is just watered down tabasco with xantham gum
  mine is the same way i never stuck around long enough to get service i just walk out because those dumb 15 year old cunt waitresses are scared of me or something
mexican here if yall can find some chiltepinos you can make a really tasty salsa however the spiciness from batch to batch can vary wildly i love them though they have a very peculiar taste
doritos has already made spicy chips you idiots didnt buy them enough
  all of them are way too salty    like  says  just make some spicy salsa
actually eating  you pathetic mortal plebs
  not just dissolving into the mother consciousness to feed on white energy
  based and sunpilled  
im actually a breatharian
  i live off of psilocybin mushrooms 2ce and green tea

i tried lemon tea with milk and its ok
  weird i just tried milk tea with lemon and it was ok
i tried ok tea with lemon and its milk
      im not gay
  have an upvote friend
  for me its lady grey with a splash of milk do not try to put lemon juice and milk into regular tea because the acid curdles the milk and you get flecks of milk pulp in your drink
  heh
are applejacks any good /ck/
  huh
what
they used to be
  for me its applejacks    best cereal of all time crisp and tastes like heaven with milk even makes a good snack when eaten dry
is you want diabetus
  no but applejack is a mighty fine booze mighty fine indeed
  based
  i prefer twilys ponuts
  its just round sugar puffs like all boxed cereal
  would substituting applejack for milk with your applejacks work for you
  cinnamon flavored foods are usually high tier
apple jacks are top tier cereal followed by honey comb
ive made my christmas pudding batter here is it currently steaming it will be ready in about 5 hours
  and here is the end product
  you stay away from my pud pud
why do bongs call this pudding
looks like baked puke
  because thats what its been called since before the american continent was even known to exist
  i believe its this     protogermanic put pud to swell compare dialectal english pod belly    it makes sense on 2 levels it swells as a it bakes it swells he stomach    also most english is germanic     my name is bongbot and ill be your guide traveller
  you believe wrong  the term pudding comes from the french word boudin
  should have just bought one and saved yourself the hastle christmas cake is better anyway
  you believe wrong  the term pudding comes from the french word boudin    yes this also seems accurate    even a combo of french and german    as a word it is certainly one with grade one heritage within our culture
  wasnt that bad honestly
why are my farts made to smell of the earth because of multivitamins i am eating of course sometimes this smell of feces will change when you eat some things that are different flavor but why from this multivitamin cause my farts to smell of the earth or clay smell
  are you okay
  based fart inquisitor
  what
  natural ingredients  also this 
is applejack any good /ck/
yes
  no
maybe
  its good if you like teen drinks as ive gotten older i prefer drinks that taste bitter and harsh it has a hint of apple and sweetness but if youre under 30 youll like it    i just realized that it would be godly to marinate steaks or bratwurst in an applejack marinade i might buy a couple bottles of this the next time i buy groceries
  i didnt even know it existed until i was watching the good eats episode on apple pie
the best thing i could make with it was the jack rose cocktail which is just applejack lemon juice and a lil bit ol that ol sugary grenadine eh ya shee
star cocktail 1895    into a mixing glass add  2 dashes aromatic bitters angostura  1 1/3 oz applejack  2/3 oz traditional vermouth wine dolin rouge vermouth de chamb√©ry    fill glass 2/3 with ice and stir for at least 30 seconds to chilldilute without letting aeration bruise the velvet of the liquor  strain into chilled 4 1/2 oz cocktail goblet  garnish with 1 wide x 3 long lemon peel with as little pith as possible   twist over drink to express oil and drop in      s
lairds is cheap apple flavored brandy real applejack is freezedistilled cider
  lairds is good apple brandy made and distilled with real apples but yes originally applejack got its name from jacking the ice water from the cider leaving a concentrated alcohol behind
  freeze distillation cant legally be used for the entire distilling process anymore because it leaves way too much methanol in the finished product and methanol is poisonous   also at most lairds is mixed in nj its made elsewhere in the states i think virginia or west virginia
shes probably worst of the mane 6
  calvados is superior but it works in cocktails
  eyep
  basically this
  forgetting pinkie pie exists    go home big mac youre drunk
  applejack  thats not how you spell candleja
  stupid newfag doesnt know how to spell out candleja
  stop
fuck you op you and your horsefucker b8
  fucking dumbass pinkie is actually the best
  rarity is better
  patrician
nothing to see here just working on ruining the health of a 3rd generation of americans is all    the food industry bribes the politician to ignore their cancerous products because after all one meal isnt going to harm anyone is it they pay marketers to normalize their cancerous products 24/7 on tv in film and in print they specifically target kids with their shit so as to condition their taste buds and brains to view the abnormal levels of sugar/salt/fat as normal so theyll grow up thinking their shit food/drink is normal and will keep buying their shit     look around you probably 40 of the population is overweight and about 30 are just straight up hambeast fatasses    quit buying their shit    if you didnt make it dont eat or drink it
  i probably make more unhealthy shit at home cupcake
  whiteknighting for the murican diabeetus and obesity industry  so how fat are you    you know you can change your life right
  but taco bell is soooo yummy
  of course its yummy dumb ass its loaded with sugars/fats/salts that are biologically given preferential status over other food stuffs because they were once rare theyre not now these industries spend millions investing in psychological studies on what food substances trigger your reward centers and then they load their products up with that shit to hook the naive and ignorant    if you used the same amount of fat/sugar/salt at home your food would be just as yummy
      subway  implying
no offence but you shouldnt be blaming fast food for the fact that you have no self control
  pedoways nutrition info is so similar to mcdonalds that its not posted on their website unless your bodyweight begins in 3 you wont lose any weight eating there
  i defy you to find me food i could make at home that would have less nutritional value than mcdonalds
  chocolate chip cookies
  go burn down a restaurant then instead of blog posting then you pussy
  you sound angry fast food joints like these are american as fuck theyve built entire empires that stretch into multiple countries    theyve influenced other countries to make fast food joints    if you dont like it fine but fuck off telling everyone theyre a dipshit fatass for eating this crap 24/7 they already know it
  he lost that weight raping kids
its stupid people that are more likely to be overweight/obese    round them up stick them in cages and use them as biofuel two birds one stone
  thats a reasonable argument until a product starts to have a negative health impact on a significant segment of the population as does fast food and soft drinks     they used to say the same thing about patent medicine that was laced with opiates but they finally pulled their heads out of their asses
  fast food joints like these are american as fuck  crack dealers would be too if they were allowed to market and freely distribute their products
  crack is very american as well comparing crack to fast food is however very retarded the craving of fast food to the addiction of crack is almost noncomparable    i dont see bums begging for money and sucking dicks for hamburgers    i dont see people robbing hamburger shops for food or committing robberies to acquire more fast food
can i get a box to take the rest home
based
  do europoors really just throw away their leftovers
can i get a home _
  doesnt stretch out his dish to 2 or 3 meals despite spending 200 more than the cost of ingredients or effort it took to make
  they threw away their countries to immigrants so
yeah people who do that are the epitome of being poor and annoying
so i think ive developed an actual physical addiction to capsaicin if i dont drink some of this stuff or drown something in it for a while i get really irritable and hypersensitive to temperature ive tried to ween myself off of it but i cant stay away can an excess of hot stuff over time cause any sort serious health problems
that sauce is the best i add it to dishes to give good heat without adding too much vinegar or otherwise tampering with the dishs inherent flavor  also to answer your question you probably have parasites that are temporarily subdued with capsaicin
  parasites  i know youre joking but heartworms typically flourish if you go without capsaicin for too long
  humans get heartworms the fuck
  wean not ween
  daves insanity is fucking delicious    but yea op if you eat very spicy food daily it can very much cause intestinal problems i have a cousin who had ulcers and can no longer eat spicy food because he permanently damaged his stomach and intestines he lived in calabria where they put spice on literally everything so he was raised on spicy food    i wouldnt worry too much about it because that was years and years of damage he did but if you find youre starting to get stomach problems suddenly especially when exacerbated by spicy food visit a doctor immediately
  sort of related question  ive been getting this crazy headaches right behind my eye recently but it only starts after i eat something spicy  what gives
  idk higher blood preasure from spicy food look on the mirror right after meal when i eat a lot i can see my arity limit coffee bud
  i might be a pussy but i put too much of this on some jambalaya one time and almost threw up
  oh fuck it might be that ive been drinking way more caffeine lately
heartburn becomes a thing when you hit your 30s
  heartburn hit me at 25 i think what did me in quicker was too much booze ive cut way back since but i still cant drink a lot of things neat anymore
  you probably have developed a physical addiction to capsaicin which is understandable exposure to capsaicin makes the human body release endorphin similar to morphine and dopamine so in a way eating spicy food gives you a low level natural high very enjoyable if you dont over do it and get a bad case of heartburn     
  maybe it does something to the sinuses and the pressure difference causes you pain
  you can develop serious stomach issues if you eat too much of that stuff it messes with the acidic balance in your stomach
  eh i wouldnt call anyone a pussy for underestimating daves its easy to overdo it
  the ghost pepper one tastes better its way too hot for most things but it has that bright fruity tang to it just like a fresh naga pepper
for me its the vark
  can we go one freakin thread without vark posting
  i got fresh ghost peppers sitting in my counter right now cant decide if i want to make sauce out of them or chop them up into a pot of chili or maybe fiery thickroux gumbo
  i know vark shills are the worst
  heartworms are only transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito in rare cases people can get heartworms after being bitten by an infected mosquito but because people are not a natural host for heartworms the larvae usually migrate to the heart and lung arteries and die before they become adult worms   fda says not to worry about it and theyre usually all for telling people to panic about nothing
  i fucking hate this meme    you can get stomach ulcers i think google it
  no you cant you fucking retard

last pic i took is of the pumpkin pie i made for thanksgiving     i made chicken last night but didnt take a pic
i dont fotogrpah food but kassler salted cured pork with eggs and shittons of lard and butter like my favorite shit the extra butter is just filler to not overeat w/ meat  basically one of my favorite things
  eating pure fat to not overeat protein/fat  
dont have a pic but its diced grilled garlic chicken in a miso shiitake alfredo sauce just try to imagine it
  diabetic on a lowcarb diet too if you overdo protein on any diet the broken down aminoacids it gets converted to glucose because too high a nitrogen conc in blood i eat once or twice a day so eating something tasty doesnt really help restrain me and i frequently overeat   fat is filling lard is kinda meh goose fat/lard is better but still kinda animaly to eat butter butter is easy enough to go thru
  at least eat a good fat like from fish or nuts omega 3 and 6 not saturated fats
  sat fat isnt unhealthy polyunsat fats are really bad trans are the worst but hard to find so they dont count as much  i do eat deenz a lot and cod liver here and there when i can stomach it theres a lot of info regarding how sat fats have been demonized quite easy to find to if youd like    tho fuck you americans for having cheap nuts i fucking hate that everything in uroop is imported and expensive i wanna at least try brazil and macadamia or pine but like 5x more expensive than meat for sth that you gotta pour water over ffs
  you dont tell them but you still do it shit for brains
  sat fat isnt unhealthy   incorrect    poly unsat fats are really bad  even more incorrect    theres a lot of info regarding how sat fats have been demonized quite easy to find to if youd like  yes medical peer reviewed literature     demonizes poly fats while advocating eating nuts  it must be blissful to be so fucking stupid like you
  i made white chicken actually turkey chili out of my turkey leftovers it turned out pretty good
  instead of bluntly stating that im wrong without providing any backup how about assuming you could be wrong about at least something and that you dont know everything science is a process new things get tested old evidenced gets refuted or supported etc there is no one objective truth a lot of the time if you wish to live in blissful ignorance of other opinions or even facts its nothing to me id love to learn something new if id met someone who knew something i didnt    some condensed vids i found if you wish reading thru descriptions comments and citations you could get more detailed info        this guy does a lot of reading and summarizing    i dunno ive been doing this for a while and have been having really good lab results
  instead of bluntly stating that im wrong without providing any backup  ah but its fine to make claims without any backup if its convenient i see    least something and that you dont know everything science is a process new things get tested old evidenced gets refuted or supported etc  and theres nothing to back up your claims nothing to substantiate that saturated fats arent unhealthy that polyunsaturated fats are unhealthy etc new doesnt displace old by virtue of recency you have quality  quantity of evidence versus quality  quantity of evidence     some condensed vids i found if you wish reading thru descriptions comments and citations you could get more detailed info  thats not backing up your claims thats being a retard copping oilyt and being unable to actually support the framework and base of your argument     i dunno ive been doing this for a while and have been having really good lab results  yeah and my patients actual lab work shows otherwise
  good job nice rustic look how did they come out in terms of taste/pastry texture
  look up the videos there are doctors that support this and do rigorous studies randomized etc  i know even a creationist can get a phd a publish in some unknown journal and claim science but this is backed stuff which working supported by studies hypotheses just search sats fat and carbs of course are the worst possible combo ever but i didnt say that and i have no fucking clue what your patients are doing but theres a growing community of doctors and people who dont get the light of day from people who dont accept any new knowledge or opinion or whatever    its not my job to do my best to convince you youre wrong but do yourself a favor and even moreso your patients dont assume you always know everything about everything leave room for improvement what you get taught in med school wasnt written in stone it was written by fallible people
  look up the videos there are doctors that support this and do rigorous studies randomized etc  and you even just stated in the following sentence how useless this is you either have the research or dont having a talking head cult leader say it smoothly isnt evidence     sats fat and carbs of course are the worst possible combo ever but i didnt say that  didnt say you did    but theres a growing community of doctors and people who dont get the light of day from people who dont accept any new knowledge or opinion or whatever  im not even sure what youre basing this from public opinion and media seems way more in favor of this neoluddite movement than the alternative     its not my job to do my best to convince you youre wrong  evidently     but do yourself a favor and even moreso your patients dont assume you always know everything about everything  i dont but you clearly think you do since youve dismissed over a centurys worth of valid research because of evidence which you cannot provide and is likely shitty that is in your uninformed opinion recent and therefore more valid    what you get taught in med school wasnt written in stone it was written by fallible people  then follow your own advice and apparently dont even bother giving any advice on anything saying science changes isnt an excuse to ignore actual evidence and logic
  why are you so hostile  probably all science is trying to prove something using some combination of logic and evidence   again youre assuming youre correct and infallible which is a bad approach to science and life in general but im ending this with that
  why are you such a little bitch are you just not used to people calling you out on being a dumbass    probably all science is trying to prove something using some combination of logic and evidence  okay    again youre assuming youre correct and infallible  im not thats you projecting your insecurities about being a fucking idiot you actually have an assumption everything is completely opaque therefore only your utterly baseless assumptions need to be taken seriously over actual valid evidence    but im ending this with that  thats because youre a fucking pussy cuck that cant stand his ground act like a man

  my new favorite breakfast is to mix 2 eggs in a bowl with chipotle pepper powder or smoked paprika red pepper flakes salt pepper a little cayenne then dump into a 6 inch pan with some heated oil then sprinkle some cheddar cheese on top cook at a low temp so the bottom doesnt burn until the top solidifies best to use something to cover the pan it fluffs up and creates a hearty little breakfast that tastes delicious
  chop up the rosmary so you get better coverage
  im 2 months without grocery store and in huge crunch time no cilantro or cheese but chilli regardless ate the late of my cumin

  wypipo
  why are any of us here god i guess
postthanksgiving birds are so cheap 18lb wild turkey for 10 bucks lol
  only had dish prepared like this once and it was absolutely lovely
  hu durr why did you do respond to op with the last thing you cooked ha hyuck
  that looks edible my friend 3 thumbs up  dont ask
  goddamn
  looks like youre doing good in the flavor concept of it but you seriously expect people to dance around the damn stem of the rosemary and what the hell is up with serving the lemon halves just squeeze the lemon at the end of cooking and strip the rosemary   cutting the onions in a dice would also make a more pleasant eating experience since some of the slivers are difficult to maintains a good ratio to the meat what meat is that anyway i cant tell
  too much oil and juice from overcrowding but youre trying and i like it
  gotta say that sear is hardcore either that or you used an actual grill
  damn thats impressive
  it looks like you burned your seasonings while you were trying to sear it and no pan sauce or anything otherwise cant say anything bad about it
  if you quarter the garlic itll become stronger and you wouldnt have to use as much saving you garlic cloves   please pan sear the steak before you add your butter i cant imagine you got a good sear especially for only five minutes all that butter will hinder your crust development   is that rosemary thats the sparsest thing of rosemary ive ever fucking seen i wouldnt be surprised if that turned out to be tarragon    that cut of meat doesnt look fit to have been used as a steak theres absolutely no marbling worth ogling at save for like two streaks recommend a ribeye or something that cut of meat looks better as a stew or a braise not to mention it looks too goddamned thick anyway     im sure it tasted fantastic anon especially when i can tell you put some research and effort into it but please understand that you can make it so so much better
  dorilocos is an actual traditional mexican dish    lol
  looks yummy  recipe please
i made shakshuka for myself because it sounded good when i read about it on the internet i like eggs and baking them on top of spicy tomato sauce sounded fun i might have made them too spicy for myself because i put in the cayenne the recipe called for plus a sliced up jalapeno that i had anyway i underestimated how much of a little bitch i am i guess unfortunately i was too busy eating it to take a photograph of it all
  looks really nice bro
whats the key to a perfect fried egg sandwich
  looks like 711 tier
  tthanks for the tips anon id like to improve on it ill try your tips next time updating my recipe now
  never understand why people slice their perfect ribeye into strips do they like eating cold steak
  dont know where you buy nuts from but a small bag of almonds is almost 20 here in canada
  i appreciate the effort because that doe looks appetizing as i recommend next time you make macdonalds style fried pies with your components my fat family gobbles the shit up when i make it
  looks comfy
  food bloggers do the picture is mostly just to show that its hard to do a meal justice with a phone camera i always see posts on ck where it looks like shit but probably tastes good
  do you partly boil the potato first or is it just pan fried looks heart and good btw
i borrowed my aunts instant pot just to see what all the fuss was about and made adobo chicken thighs served on cilantro lime rice
  more details brother
  lmaoing rn are you eating on your cutting board  looks nice anon
  did you take out the bones anon or do you just dance around them when youre eating
  no too much herbs is a fuck up only making more of literally everything else would fix it
  ahh yes the good ol fashioned depression meal
  point taken
  ive never seen food that actually looked gay before
  why does your gravy look gray   looks like you needed herbs for the sausage medley the eggs are up for preference as far as herbs go
  goddamn you like scallions
  this is the last thing i took a picture of that i cooked we made the broth and pork ourselves this ended up being pretty delicious
  that looks like you grabbed the spine and shoulder cant you at least get an actual cut of the chicken   the onions are a bit weird but i know in mexican cookouts they grill the whole wild onion so its not that strange i suppose   the weirdest thing is your sauce why is it translucent it looks like it was some frozen processed sauce that was heated up wrong
  and whatd you think of that instant pot i see so many bloggers using one like its hot shit but it seems to me you could achieve the same stuff with a slow cooker or regular pot
  depression/10  but the fact that you gave us the grams of your food tells me youre on a diet so i wouldnt fret if i were you
  it seems to me you could achieve the same stuff with a slow cooker or regular pot    of course you can the instant pot isnt some magic tool that does new or different things its just an allinone convenience tool it doesnt do anything better
  snack    looks like it was just braided unevenly but otherwise seems like it was prepared and baked nicely
  looks great but needed more browning/time in the oven try brushing the top with some beaten egg and sprinkle with sugar before you bake it to give it more richness and help with browning
not actually the last thing i cooked but the last thing i photographed
is baking okay     i wanted to make mary berrys cherry cake but couldnt find the candied cherries so i substituted dried apricots and chocolate since my neighbor really likes chocolate and figured id give it to her it came out pretty good taste wise it got a little stuck when i tipped it over though can see that on the far side of the photo i took it from the good angle not sure why
  why do people that bake always just give the shit away
  looks good honestly its better with corn tortillas imo but to each their own   the cilantro looks like it was cut pretty lazily though try getting a finer cut on them and they wont be so overpowering when you bite into them hanging out of your mouth or just sticking to your teeth so easily   if you want to be more authentic the onions are usually raw and they dont use crema they usually use red or green salsa   its interesting that you incorporated sliced radishes into the tacos instead of just quartering them and putting them on the side
  do you see yourself eating a whole cake nigga unless youre morbidly obese theres no way you can bake as a hobby and eat it all plus then people like you more
  because if you dont you get fat
  yea that looks really good
  damn
    this besides neighbors i give a lot of my baked goods to the girls at work i have this fetish about fattening them up so fun to feed them and make them bigger
  looks nice anon edges are a bit dark here nad there but thats just a conventional oven error which looks nicely managed seeing as how i can only find two or three small dark spots
  a bite and a half is a meal for you
  damn nice one anon
  ill give you a c for effort
  i have faith anon
  frying the egg proper    heat the pan  heat the oil  crack egg on its side on a flat surface  open low over the pan  lower heat as soon as egg on pan  dont touch egg till bottom hardens enough to flip  when ready take pan off stove and flip egg   wait ten seconds for other side of egg to cook    wala
  nothin better than taking a hit before you eat
  corn

this was a while ago but its the last time i took a pic of something i cooked donkatsu with cheese and sauce on top
arugula and roasted garlic hummus
  solid post
  buttered corn is a common addin for ramen here and in japan what about it
  only weirdos like top raw
chicken with some frozen/fresh asian veggies and coconut milk
  looks good i think i saw it the first time you posted it
  t snot eggs
  if it dint touch the pan its fucking raw
  thanks yeah i should start taking more pics since all my cooking pics currently are from a while back
  i know how you non flipper kids like your eggs snotty and sloppy
  i think he cant flip it without breaking it is why hes so defensive
  chicken thighs were just as tender as if id braised them or done them in a slow cooker it seemed to take forever for the machine to build pressure so i spent the whole time assuming i was using the thing wrong but after reading the booklet i realized it could take anywhere from 1040 minutes to build pressure at the end of the cook time youre supposed to release pressure via a small button the noise and steam generated scared both cats and my wifewho were watching intently pretty badly which was kind of funny i will say that having used it once i would happily try more recipes the 3 pounds of chicken thighs i cooked took under 45 minutes from start to finish so i can really see its value as a time saver for weeknight meals if your family is a fan of slow cookertype meals       my dude this was dead ass the easiest dinner ive made in months threw in 3 pounds of chicken thighs seasoningscumin chili powder oregano paprika garlic onion sp or even just taco seasoning packets small can of tomatoes and green chilies half can of stock put the lid on and set the instant pot for 22 minutes the thing builds pressure cooks for the set amount of time then beeps to let you know its done and turns itself off releasing the pressure is incredibly important i would think turned it onto the saut√© setting for a few minutes while i shredded the chicken so the cooking liquid would reduce and cook into the chicken made some simple white rice and mixed in a little lime juice and plenty of cilantro when it was done only other fixings i had on hand were shredded cheese roma tomatoes tapatito hot sauce and sour cream was tasty will have for lunch today
actually surprised theres no spaghetti in this thread yet heres last nights dinner
  looks bad either way
  what is the sauce it looks like shitty melted cheese which i hope it isnt that salad also looks really low effort
  he pours the bologna onto the pasta  pleb confirmed
  oh yeah guys and i use cast iron by the way  fuck off with your soii boii shit cookware stainless steel squad can do all that shit and more
  the cheese was melted by putting the meat and cheese together to broil in the oven for a little bit and then we ladled some korean donkatsu sauce on top and yeah lol the salad was pretty halfassed it took so long to pound out the meat and then fry it i just wanted to eat
  im used to dark brown sauce for tonkatsu so this looks really weird to me at first i thought that orange stuff was the cheese so not as weird as that at least
  youre right the sauce should have been darker but it was my first time still tasted fine but definitely not as nice looking as it could have been
  you are correct proper tonkatsu has a dark brown fruitbased sauce  what he made is either korean or an unholy abomination possibly both
cooked this on monday buffalo chicken pizza used a bit too much mozzarella i tried more than the last one next one ill split the difference and itll be perfect and cont
  the pizza has bleu cheese crumbles too    then on weds i made these mcchicken ripoffs breddy damn good
  thats not too much mozzerella you just didnt bake it exactly right try broiling it for a bit before pulling it out and it wont look so grossly stark white on top
  i just thought there was too much drowned out the bleu cheese which is the best part

it is objectively impossible to find a flaw in nissin cup noodle    go ahead    ill wait
  its probably been a decade since ive tried one since every grocery store carries alternatives that actually sort of resemble food these days
  nissan curry noodles exist
  tastes like shit
  i bought 244 cups from costco a year ago only 3050 of them are gone and my closet smells like chicken seasoning
  one of their sealing machines applies to much glue to the lid making about one in four cups impossible to cleanly remover the top
  peas  i hate peas so i pick them out but thats still a flaw
packed with sodium  noodles are disgusting  freeze dried veggies dont rehydrate correctly at all  only one good flavor its shrimp
maruchan  nissan
  high blood pressure
  fucking heart attack in a cup
  the spicy flavor doesnt exist any more so theyre shit
haha wtf     not killing yourself  ducks
  freeze dried peas  if it isnt split pea get it the fuck out
christmas dessert  its maple flavoured
christmas dessert  jello mixed with whip cream
holiday party    its a christmas party
  triggered cucks literally the only people crying now that orange man is getting taken down
  sausage party  its semen flavored
  worst christmas dessert is profiteroles tasteless bland pastry filled with tasteless bland whipped cream topped with a slight bit of shitty chocolate
  worst christmas dessert is peanut butter balls asshole
  ive got a cousin that brings a crock pot full of meatballs and bbq sauce its pretty baller
  lazy and they arent even real meatbawlz its that walmart frozen bullshit that its mainly made of chicken like some dog food ass shit its all weird textured man like itlian wedding soup from progressive but your bro just cooks it longer in the slow cooker who would have thought right that it makes it tender the reality is hes an asshole for not just buying those tiny sausage things in bbq sauce man those are good
  may as well go to mms and get those bacon wrapped steak bites
  that sounds good
  sorry you make shitty choux and shitty pastry cream cream puffs rule
what would be the best anime desert

wranglerstar go away
  ok ill try it tomorrow
you have to blend it somehow you can just stir it in might as well dip your toast in in your mug for breakfast would only recommend with a dark roast
  japanese style ketofag coffee
  might as well dip your toast in in your mug for breakfast  thats closer to what some tibetan people actually do sometimes theyll add roasted barley flour to the tea along with milk/butter to make a kind of thick porridge or dumpling
  i tried the meme and it tasted bad and gave me heartburn
  italian
  i tried it its not that good butter tea is better
i want bulletproof coffee shills to leave
  he thinks chemex is nip shit  why do you comment when you clearly know nothing about it how embarrassing for you
  japanese style pourover refers to putting ice in the carafe as you brew japanese style ketofag coffee refers to what you see in the picture
nice yaeh
  holy shit
butter bump
  this is sacrilege
he drinks coffee     why is coffee pushed so much yah all gonna die of heart attack
  fucking degenerate wtf do americans actually do this
  do you faggot deliberately add 200kcal and zero nutrition to your coffee and make it taste worse in the process
  implying coffee doesnt already make me shit like a demon
  butter  zero nutrition     if it were vegetable oil that would be true but butter has a lot of nutrients
  when having liquid sharts twice a week isnt enough
  mountain climbers do for the calories anyone else who does it is weird
  if you had to drink american coffee youd probably be putting weird shit into it too i mean it cant get any worse
  how so i drink it black and the beans pretty much always are imported from south america
  this isnt as awful since apparently its fairly common for people dunk their fries in milkshake
  milo with egg  coffee with butter
  based matto
  no i just use cream like a regular fucking human being  look at me i add butter im so fucking bad ass  literally all youre doing is adding back the fat that was skimmed off to turn cream into milk
  i think he means american as in usa which means crappy filtered coffee for the most part
  no he doesnt
i prefer coconut oil and a splash of heavy cream
  that sounds gay
  have you ever tried this it is fucking disgusting
  one tbsp per cup is phenomenal
americans
  poor people

      putting hot shit in your blender  please dont do this
    your mothers screaming for my penis
  he doesnt butter his mug then pour in his coffee
  what am i looking at here
  why cant blenders handle hot food genuinely curious
  i suspect that anon is either an idiot or has some sort of irrational phobia    any blender worthy of the name has no problem with hot liquids its standard restaurant practice to puree things while boiling hot because that produces a finer textured puree
  people forget that the top will get hot and dont use a towel or something as an insulator so they burn themselves
  kek
    apparently its called bulletproof coffee keto psychos do it
  that knife isnt rustic enough for wranglerfag
i tried this but all the butter would float to the top so when i went to sip it id just drink pure butter until it ran out then just had black coffee am i doing something wrong or do i just have to stir the fuck out of it before every sip
  its better with coconut fat also it doesnt shitty your cup as much if you let it cool    boomin
bump
  bumps dont work on 4channel oldfriend
  butter
  think you have to put it in a blender with coffee to mix it in all the way
bump
  then how does a thread get to the top of front page
  decided by janitors
  at least that dragonfly got sucked off before getting vored
  its not really a problem with a standard blender but bullet style blenders are closed and rely on rubber seals to keep everything inside when you put hot anything into the blender and close the lid steam starts to build inside as you blend it more steam is released eventually the air pressure inside the container forces liquid out through the sealed lid making a literal hot mess
he doesnt pepper his coffee
  little girl starts crying
he doesnt butter his margerine     are you even american
  which yakuza game
  i really didnt need to see that

at least add an egg yolk so it emulsifies

i just tried this because i saw this thread last night  it was okay i guess i used unsalted butter a decent pad and just stirred it in until it melted i might try it again i guess but i still prefer black or black with just cream
  thats just nasty
  correct     i just started putting coconut oil into my morning cawfee its amazing it goes well with a little honey and milk too coats the lips so ive not had to experience cracked lips all season too
  oh yeah those nice heart clogging nutrients
  bulletproof coffee is only for ketomemes no one would drink it otherwise
  i want to feel pity for her but shes not pretty enough    i guess a womans value is directly related to how good she looks am i autistic for only realizing this now
  if youre older than four yes
some are saying over a table spoon per cup also adding another oil along with blending it all seems like a pointless step as long as you add warmed butter before the coffee
forgetting mct oil
yogurt or cheese is where i draw the line
bump
  youre autistic but not because of that
was just gifted about 2 lb of ground moose meat whats the best way to cook it i was thinking chili but i dont want to mask the natural flavour or gameyness also i guess general game meat thread
raw bear is great you should try it

  never seen a game meat thread wanted to ask the best way to cook moose and i guess give people the opportunity to talk about killing and eating animalsthis board is nonstop garbage threads anyway
  you know i ment bear the animal right
  sorry i thought you meant gay cock i imagine raw bear meat would be filled with parasites much like gay cock
  your right there bear is known to carry trichinosis thats why they say to make sure you cook bear right
op i know that people use vinegar to get the gamey wild stink out of wild animal meat so a bit of that soaking in should help you prepare the meat to grill stir fry or slow cook
whats game meat tast like deer for example
  cant go wrong with burgers and brats
since its already ground id experiment a little  moose burger moose tacos moose stroganoff and so on
  moose burger  i would like to try this
  i have a moose hot dog you can nibble on
  isnt moose lean like venison in that case it would need 2030 fat added
  most places offer to add beef suet to ground game the place i work for offers 710 standard fatt added but we will add more or less upon request
that shut is horrible just throw it away and get some beef
  game meat is best stewed or cured like in sausages or even jerky to be honest  venison and wild boar make excellent roasts but i find they need to be slow and low cooked and always with a gravy or sauce     brining game is also a good way to reduce the gamey taste     id start with a simple stew to get a feel of the taste make sure you skim the scum off the stew very important for game meat
  as a hunter my go to recipe for venison ground meat is frying diced onion and garlic in a buttery pan then add the meat then cook it while adding some spice and maybe a hint of barbecue sauce then when the meat is almost done just add a can of green peas with a bit of the peas water but not to much remove from the heat right before the pea would start to boil its really not a sophisticated dish but its comfy tasty and easy to make
  yeah bear is great but dont eat the fat that shit is nasty
  either youre retarded or you only know shitty hunter
you need to come by my place later for some moose soup
a
  lmao raw bear sure love trichinosis troll someone else dumbass ive been on 4chan for longer than youve been alive
  when people describe venison taste and texture they often use words like rich or earthy this is a festivetasting meat often imbued with hints of the acorns sage and herbs that the deer enjoyed during its life its also considered to be less juicy and succulent than beef but also smoother and firmer    not my words but very accurate in my opinion
ah
  fucking what
  friend shoots 2000 pound animal  gifts you 2 pounds  you guys must be close
  most of its fur and antlers
  plz no eat moose and squirrel
  chilli seems like a good idea
  how the fuck do you make stroganoff with mince you galloping fucktard
  have never tried moose but its a kind of deer so i guess a stew could work with herbs for game meat and red wine i ate a lot of venison and wild boar i prefer the latter venison is a bit too dry for my taste
  1 a moose doesnt weigh that much   2 after butchering you dont get every bit of meat off the animal   3 a lot of an animals weight is its skeleton   4 youre retarded
    ok scracht that i just realised its ground meat meatballs maybe
  bullshit i got a moose one year and ended up with 300 pounds of meat
  that easily can be you can expect the meat you end up with boneless to equal roughly 52 of the gross weight of the four quarters with the skin  if the four quarters weighed 600ish pounds theres your 300 pound of meat
  thats fine but the post i responded seemed to think that a moose weighs one ton which they dont and that a 1 ton animal produces one ton of mean which it doesnt   plus regardless of how much meat the guy had 2 pounds of free meat is 2 pounds of free meat no need to bitch like you deserve more just for knowing the guy
  heart soup the meats tender  but you only got random parts  fry it with sliced potatoes and onions  make spaghetti or something idfk
  fair enough the few times ive hunted moose i gave away quite a bit of meat the dude probably either has a big family or figured op may end up not liking the taste honestly the whole reason i dont hunt moose more often is the meat takes up to much room
its fucking december have you made grilled cheese yet
  first post
whats so special about december and grilled cheese
  fpbp
  doesnt fit my macros
  is a cubano a grilled cheese
  its fucking delicious is what it is
whats a good cheese for grilled cheese    i like shredded mozzarella and a little of that white sharp cheddar
  velveeta slices dont overthink it its just a grilled cheese
  mozz and parm  pepper jack with sliced pickled jalapeno  gryuere  swiss or havarti  muenster makes god tier grilled cheese
  might as well sprinkle gold dust on it and have bread harvested from virgins that have only ridden unicorns
  gouda
go to grocery store  get home  go to make dinner  realize you dont have any of the ingredient you assumed you had plenty of so didnt bother buying any  have to go back
its already thanksgiving  make deviled eggs with yum yum sauce instead of mayo
im gay btw idk if that matters
  frogs    sage
  make the planned food but with a subbed ingredient that you just throw in tto make up for the missing item  it tastes better than it would have normally  i love discoveries like that
  ayyy
  name 10 or youll die of stomach cancer
  not that guy but    cream cheese or sour cream instead of milk in mashed potatoes
tfw im a good cook and i make something nice with whatever is on hand every time and dont go to the store with any set ideas of what ill buy and hardly ever throw out food and experiment all the time and rarely fuck it up and never stress about cooking and always have fun and make nice food and love life every day
  lol op here and thats what happened  i was making sausage gravy and biscuits got home and realized i had everything but no butter found some saved bacon grease in the back of the fridge and subbed that and it was more flavorful
  and also you dont know how to end a sentence
  got any examples to share with the class
  based mashed potato ingredient
  cry more you fucking cuck

  nice heres yesterdays
  dont get your knickers in a twist laddie
  did you whirlpool your water for poaching egg on the left seems a little mangled
is it impossible to make a shitton of wokfry veggies without it turning into a stew  i mean it tasted good but it was probably more like a stew  do you need to wok each veggie seperate
  anything is possible when youre gay like me
  do you need to wok each veggie seperate  yes thats the proper way to do it so the food doesnt just steam
  your stove probably isnt powerful enough to use a wok you need some serious heat
  you add vegetables according to how much time each is going to take to cook and you need a high heat so you dont end up just boiling the vegetables in their own water
  this happens when you cook too long at too low a heat to get a proper stir fry it needs to be so hot that stuff will burn if youre idle for for than 30 seconds
  this my local chinese restaurant let me come in the kitchen and their cook tought me to make a few of my favorite dishes when you lift the wok its just like a jet engine exhaust theres no way youre getting that heat unless you put in an outdoor kitchen and a specific wok burner
  your pan is overcrowded
make sure dont use frozen vegetables especially broccoli use more dry vegetables like carrots garlic onions depends on dish and dont sauces till the very end finally dont cover with a lid while veggies are steaming hope this helps op
  my local chinese restaurant let me come in the kitchen  i know we all love cooking but calm down man
  well yeah i said it was more liek a stew then anything else      okay      there was no water at any point and every veggie was added at a different time      when wokking daikon would you need to steam it first because else it wont get soft at all      its probably just the amount i make i didnt use frozen didnt sauce and didnt cover except for the first 2 hour when i was making the onions and last hour when i added the garlic
  do you need to wok each veggie seperate  nope  you just need a stronger flame and/or a bigger wok      you dont need an outdoor kitchen a portable propane burner aka turkey fryer works just fine you can also put your wok over a bbq grill gas or charcoal
  okay so then crowding my pan doesnt matter because i wont have the heat to wok anyway and might as well just settle for stew like veggies when making a stirfry
  you mean a soup  a stew is cooked over several hours with meat so that the toughness of the meat is broken down to become tender
  soup and stew not the same just one has flour in it  what
  then wtf you want me to call this  stew is the closest i can come if you dont allow me to call it a stirfry
  daikon  all long cooking veggies should be blanched before going into the wok this would include broccoli and carrot as well
  gotta cook that shit hotter hombre    real stir fries are not really possible in apartments with bad ventilation though you will set off smoke alarms
  okay so then crowding my pan doesnt matter because i wont have the heat to wok anyway  i was suggesting that getting more heat is a better solution that doing it in batches    but if getting more heat is not an option for you then you have no choice but to cook in batches
  k thanks
  you will set off smoke alarms  i disabled mine for this reason
  still dont have the heat available
  you dont have access to a grill
  i have a large cast iron wok and a 125k btu burner that may be nowhere as hot as a burner in a chinese restaurant but given 57min of heating up i can start cooking at nearly proper temp and if i move quickly i can get good results no real wok hei unfortunately but my stir frys do not turn stew like or soupy
  this is a good trick if you dont have the btu then rely on storedup heat instead preheat a thick heavy pan and use that ci is ideal    you can even use multiple pans have two big pans/skillets each on their own burner start cooking in one as its heat starts to drop then transfer all the food into the other pan then put the one you just used back on its flame alternate between the two pans    also wok on gas grill works most gas grills have far stronger hobs than a consumer range
      i dont care this much    if you would go with a nonstick wok on a normal gas stove what would the order and time of the following veggies be  onion  garlic  mushroom  carrots  paprika  beans/rice
  agreed
  also wok on gas grill works most gas grills have far stronger hobs than a consumer range  my bro is stuck with an electric range so this is what he does
  nonstick pans dont work for stir frys getting anywhere near the proper heat wrecks the pan what youre doing will always come out as a sautee
  i dont care this much  walking out back to use the grill is this much i guess the zoomer generation really is as lazy as people claim     you would go with a nonstick wok  a nonstick wok is about as useful as a perforated condom its a contradiction in terms    id use whatever the thickest/heaviest flat pan you own is ideally cast iron a skillet or dutch oven would be best preheat the piss out of it until it is actually smoking hot     of ingredients  impossible to answer without you specifying how large of pieces you cut them into remember that cooking time is dependent not only on the type of ingredient but also how you cut it smaller pieces cook faster than larger ones
  nonstick wok would be a misnomer just get any normal one and use a lot of oil as for your order of operations its always best to toss in the aromatics that wont burn first onions carrots and mushroom are all things that can go in at the start after that its fine to toss in whatever beans/rice/protein just make sure you throw in the garlic before you start to build a sauce that way it can be incoroporated into the oil    tcooks in a wok for a living
  wanna get technical roux is meant more for a gumbo   stews dont need a thickening agent to be a stew
probably several factors    a youre overcrowding the wok  b your heat isnt high enough you need to turn that shit up to the highest setting you have and constantly move the food around to avoid burning  c your wok sucks this much is definitely true its one of those faggy nonstick ones that was probably an impulse buy while you were baked at target get yourself either a cast iron or carbon steel wok unless you actually want cancer carbon steel seems to be the more preferred one around here the heavier it is the more consistently and evenly it will retain heat  d with all of this considered you still will not accomplish 100 authentic chinese takeout commercial stovetops are nowhere near as hot as the industrial ones used in restaurants if your stovetop is electric dont even bother gas or induction are ideal you can still make great stir fry at home but it wont be takeout tier
  stews dont need a thickening agent to be a stew    hard pass from me dawg
  you dont need an outdoor kitchen a portable propane burner aka turkey fryer works just fine you can also put your wok over a bbq grill gas or charcoal    those all sound like outdoor kitchen devices
  outdoor kitchen implies a complex construction with a sink lighting running water a stove and all sorts of other things you dont need a whole fucking purposebuilt kitchen a grill or propane burner on your porch or balcony is sufficient
  which would then become your outdoor kitchen area
    you guys are stuck in a semantics loop its true that in the warmer parts of the us and other warm weather places people build elaborate summer kitchens outdoors that include plumbing a grill or burner on your porch/deck/patio qualifies as outdoor cooking but not really an outdoor kitchen kitchen requires a sink
  if you want to call a balcony with a grill on it an outdoor kitchen thats fine by me though that seems a little strange    like i said kitchen implies an elaborate structure ive never heard of anyone putting a grill out their back door and referring to that as their outdoor kitchen    google outdoor kitchen and you get pic related you dont need anything that elaborate to cook a stirfry
  everybody has a backyard and a grill  fuck americans
  i mainly use the thing for meal prepping or making a giant batch of caramelized onions so the heat wont be that high on it most of the time it was super cheap in a chinese shop hat went out of business
  well hopefully your wok doesnt fill with rainwater and serve as a birdbath
   has a backyard and a grill  where do you live where you dont have easy access to a grill    dane here plenty of people have them not to mention you can find them in parksoryou knowbuy one then take it outside when you need to use it
not to be that guy but    kitchen a room or area where food is prepared and cooked
  so if i put pic related in your bedroom would you call it a kitchen now or do you realize how retarded that would sound
  kitchen area
  what wok
go to mcdonalds  get big mac  no lettuce onions or sauce  just three pieces of bread and two plain patties  fucking hell how hard is it
  big macs are gross and you deserve what you got
  maybe if they were paid more than minimum wage they would have more motivation to do their job    more income  more effort
  did you tip no serves you right
  more income  more effort  is that what the left believes now  those billionaires must be really hard workers
  no billionaires are lazy scum shut up
  this they deserve 15 an hour starting pay
stop eating fast food fat fuck
  its a pretty good business model that some companies are starting to use i know aldi and trader joes both pay 15 but have high expectations of the work you have to do and because there is usually competition for positions because of the good pay they have a better selection of candidates to choose from
  maybe theyd be less lazy if they made more dosh
order a plain burger  get plain burger  be mad that you got a plain burger
  but op ordered a big mac not a plain burger so your argument is invalid
  its pretty fucking plain if you ask them to leave off everything that goes on it
that one anon that ordered just cheese  lmao what a retard
  i didnt tell them to leave off anything  i said i want a medium number one and a dr pepper  they skipped half the steps of my order
  probably a dipshit cashier handed off the wrong order theres some weirdo somewhere pissed they got a sandwich with everything on it
  the though of someone being upset about getting a regular big mac made me smile  thanks anon
  id go back and nicely explain what happened theyll probably give you a free meal and some coupons or something   or you could rage about it here instead up to you op
  honestly im not that mad just annoyed  ive been working all day and found time to leave the office to grab some food real quick  i probably would have told them about it but i already got back to work and cant leave again  i figured if make a thread and maybe other people would post their fast food stories
  its more that too little income makes you feel unappreciated and when you feel that way you stop giving a fuck about your job it doesnt give extra motivation it just removes an obstacle to having any motivation at all
  i feel you nothing pisses me off more than getting cheese on my burger after i specifically ask to not have it   id like a hamburger please  do you want cheese on that  no id ask for a cheeseburger if i wanted cheese half of the time i still end up with cheese kiosks cant come quickly enough less of a chance they mess up your order
  no
  imagine living in such a shitty country that the every day consumer has to pay extra to cover the wages of the workers
  we dont tip fast food workers it was a joke
  i know this is bait but if minimum wage was raised they would still be lazy cause its still minimum wage  also poor people are generally poor cause theyre stupid lazy lack of impulse control or a combination of giving them more money wont make them wealthy
calling 3 pieces of bread and 2 hamburger patties a big mac    you got what you deserve
    i love big macs but none of the mcdonalds in my area serve blacks
  for flipping burgers haha yeah ok buddy
  i came here to laugh at you
  if you dont need them dont employ them
  if i was paid 5 to make a reply to your post then this would be much better  giving them more money wont make them wealthy  really activates the almonds
  noone said to raise minimum wage they said if they wanted workers beyond the minimum wage level they should pay more you get what you pay for at lower levels of salary
  money has diminishing returns on productivity once youre making 100k 200k 1million whats the motivation for you to keep doing better

i dont know how to cook anything but i want to make something special for my gf this christmas something healthier and not just a brownie she likes strawberries dark chocolate carrots and all that any ideas
  make her a chocolate strawberry cake with carrots
  any ideas  yeah theres about 983 gorillion special holiday cookie/cake/sweet recipes to choose from how about you try and narrow it down to what sort of thing youre looking to make strawberries and chocolate narrows it down about 9829 gorillion recipes
  how about a cannoli filled with strawberries dark chocolate and topped with little carrot things if she loves you she wont care as long as you put some effort into it
  that sounds good      i dont even know what there is besides cake and brownie i know about cookie too how about cloud bread
  cookie i know cookie
carrot upside down cake with caramelized strawberries on the bottom     follow a carrot cake recipe but put 1/2 cup of halved strawberries on the bottom of the springform pan you make it in
  make a chocolate fondue perfect excuse and setting for one
i just got back from a holiday party not your ordinary party because i got in a fight with the host    heres what happened i bring tupperware to all the events i go to to collect unused food so it doesnt go to waste doing this for years and only had a small number of incidents so i was in the kitchen collecting stuff like salmon chicken steak sushi cake and the host and his friend walk in they tried to take the tupperware from me and i fought back and we got into an actual fistfight     i am thinking about suing or am i wrong here
  you fucking idiot
  how dont just dis me what did i do wrong
  did you pay for the food was the food offered to you to take home do you bring tupperware to buffet restaurants if i saw a guest who wasnt family or didnt ask doing this id be pissed off what if i wanted those leftovers
  if it was the hosts food and you didnt ask if you could take some home with you then you were in the wrong
    the party was almost over that food was there for partiers not the host he had his own shit in the fridge
  did he make all the food or was it a potluck you are in the wrong if the former is true
  he bought all the stuff from a butcher and the rest at whole foods
  what is your ethnic background
  so it was his property that he offered to other people that generally implies the food was meant for the party and only the party that is it would be inappropriate to do what you did its always best to talk in ambiguous situations im surprised that he tried to take your containers away at first to me this implies that you have done this before to him and he reached a boiling point i would strictly follow norms for the time being if i were you
  that food was there for partiers not the host he had his own shit in the fridge    unless you asked the host personally thats all an assumption in your head not reality     the partiers  so everyone then not just you did you ask the other partiers if they wanted any of the food too    this cant possibly be real nobody is that autistic were all just piling on the hook
  stale ass copypasta
  leftovers belong to the host its an unwritten rule
nothing this guy cooks looks presentable or tasty his personality is overall unlikable
you dont have to watch it v
also hes clearly not white
  my only issue with him is that he tries too hard to be charismatic
  every board has those retards that bring up e celebs in the topic theyre discussing but why does it happen on /ck/ so often
  you dont have to read it v
  people who look like this should have a bad time in life
  /ck/ probably has the widest range of age groups of any board from underage genz to boomers the genzers and young millennials are the ones who worship at the feet of ecelebs and insist on shitting up this board with these threads the next world war and military draft cant come soon enough
his teeth are too perfect  dude has veneers or something
  looking forward to your autobiography op  dont know why you posted that guys pic though
  its a relatively new thing i blame jack posting before that we only really talked about actual cooking channels on yt now we have /tv/ tier waifu threads about bon appetit e celebs posted literally every single day like its normal
his lips make him look allergic to that food
he is pretty annoying but his fried chicken recipe is amazing used it to batter and deep fry these two thighs into these mcchicken ripoffs the other day thy were pretty damn fucking good
  nice appetizer now whats the main course
  can you fucking explain to me how to cook chicken thigh without it being miserable    do you buy boneless thighs or something
  they were 700800 calories each and im cutting so they left me with 600400 calories left in the day think i had a beer and some trail mix and strawberries to close off the day      yes im not even sure if my supermarket sells bone in thighs
  dont know who he is but from one look at the picture id guess this is that epic filipino cuisine ive been hearing about steamed whole vegetables and crustaceans served cold and dumped on the floor
  got the recipe for that
    ignore the asmr and mukbang parts the recipe is top notch he used halved chicken breasts i used thighs because im a cheap bastard and i think their juicier
  thanks homie
do you guys like shake n bake    itt we talk about all the different ways youve used snb im getting ready to shake up some breasts right now how bout you
  why dont you just learn how to cook and create your own coating which only takes an extra 2 minutes and tastes a lot better
  i put it on your moms breasts
i did when i was a kid havent had it in 15 years so maybe idk
  what would taste better than snb
  it does not taste better youre full of lies
  you wouldnt talk like that if you saw my ma
i just use this for quick n dirty chicken parm
  i would like to know the receipt for this
  protip crushed frosted flakes dont knock it till youve tried it
i use panko and old bay  comes out pretty good
    youre shit at seasoning your breadings
  what do you use thats just as fast as shake and bake fancy pants
  yep but sometimes smashed up restaurant seasoning croutons and breadcrumbs
  i prefer the ritter reaction
old tool good  new tool bad
im gay btw not sure if that matters
  it matters op as it explains everything
  glad we clarified that
  cast irons are cheap super versatile long lasting easy to maintain heavy the only reason you would dislike cast iron is if you are a retard that cant figure out how to season their pan
cast iron fags are the new vegans  the fedora of cooking
  i like cast irons and i also like steel and copper
spoilers o u l
  this
  tassie rape me with bowling ball
  similar to shaving with a straight razor its a process that was perfected 100 years ago  scrape blade across face  theres definitely fags who fetishize it but the alternative is paying 20 for a triple blade plastic piece of shit every other week
good tools good  bad tools bad
  the only reason you would dislike cast iron is if you are a retard that cant figure out how to season their pan  how about the fact that the food you put in the middle gets burnt when the ones on the edges are raw
  or you want something that actually spreads the heat better like say basically everything that isnt cast iron of course if all you cook is fried chicken and cornbread you wont notice the difference also if youre a broke neet this is obviously not an option    imagine being this stupid you can get several years worth of de blades for 30 have fun scraping your dovo against a belt for 5 hours every time you need to shave
    old tool bad  new tool good
  good luck finding a pan that spreads heat better in the same price range as a cast iron
  see broke neet    ive been cooking on the same heavy copper skillet for the last 6 years thats 350 a month or less than you spend on your nightly craft beer
  ive been cooking on the same cast iron for 8 years i found it in my parents cupboard calculate the value of that for me gayboi
i just use teflon when it scratches i buy another one feels good not being african tier poor
  if its new it must be good
  but thats objectively correct
  and how does it feel using shitty pans
  you need to preheat your pan put your pan in the oven set the temp and wait 20 to 30 minutes i do this for spatchcock chicken but set the oven for 500
  they arent shitty at all they work for everything including searing things
  how about the fact that the food you put in the middle gets burnt when the ones on the edges are raw    the only fact there is that you put large pans on small hobs dont blame the pan for your inability to use it correctly
  i dont get why people dislike the simplest implementation of a frying pan that doubles as a fucking medieval weapon
  they work for everything  not very well    you sound like some kind of idiot redneck mechanic   tools and shit nah i dont need those this hammer can do everything    cast iron and nonstick are both kitchen essentials different tools for different jobs
  simple many people are stupid and they dont use the pan properly as expected this gives poor results for which they blame the pan rather than realizing the real problem lies between their eyes
  non stick is not a kitchen essential it does nothing well carbon steel or copper sure non stick definitely not its the best way to tell someone cant cook if they use nonstick
  youre cooking on a piece of plastic and no they dont fuck off faggot
  it does nothing well  it does the notsticking part pretty damn well     its the best way to tell someone cant cook if they use nonstick  i see plenty of 3star chefs with nonstick pans in their kitchens how many do you have oh great master chef
fuck this stupid jap way of thinking more stepsmore better cast iron folded 1000 times if i buy something i want to use it immediately not have to do some voodoo bullshit to get it working
tool bad  tool good
  tool good  tool bad
  its good at non stick  so is every pan if you know how to use it im not even going to bother with your mendacious claim
  ptfes nonstick properties are far superior to other materials even if you know how to use it    also you forgot to answer my question about how many michelin stars you have
  copper and ci are good for different things i wouldnt do heavy searing baking or pan roasting in a copper pot and i wouldnt try to make delicate sauces or other things that require very fine temperature control in a cast iron theyre not mutually exclusive theyre different tools for different functions
  i want to use it immediately not have to do some voodoo bullshit to get it working  which you can do most cast iron comes already seasoned
  exactly
  ttwo
  i dont have time in the morning to wait for a castiron pan to heat up when im making eggs
  pleb
  the only eggs you should be making on cast iron is frittata
  i wouldnt use a ci skillet for eggs either thats what nonstick is for different tools for different jobs    that said your goalpost moving has not invalidated your silly voodoo bullshit claim and dont lie you have the extra 30 seconds it takes for a ci pan to warm up even if that means you have to make one less shitpost on your phone toy
  yes they work why are you getting angry at a pan imagine not being able to use a teflon pan properly lmao    yes they do ive cooked in teflon for years maybe you should learn to use one imagine not being able to use such a convenient simple pan lmao
  enjoy cooking on your plastic baby toy
  i do a lot of people enjoy my cooking ill keep using teflon while you get mad at a pan  protip learn to use one
    underrated post
  it doesnt take any special skill to use in fact its probably more beginner friendly than normal pans but im glad you and your gay friends enjoy cooking on plastic baby toys you do you
  hes still mad at a pan  rofl
  why wouldnt you do searing or pan roasting in copper because the tin lining you know you can get stainless lined copper right
  i cant think of anymore bullshit refutations so ill just call him mad  brilliant
  you can and there is nothing wrong with doing so however cast iron does have better heat retention
  you are mad at a pan imagine that
  im not that guy but in my case  i wouldnt sear in copper because its thermal mass is lower than ci thus ci is a better choice  i wouldnt pan roast in it either because cis black color gives it better emissivity and ability to absorb heat in the oven    copper is a godsend for things that require quick changes in temperature like emulsified sauces which easily split but i certainly wouldnt choose it for searing or roasting
  i guess ill have to imagine it yeah
  the thermal mass thing is overstated it matters for ovens where the heat comes as much from convection as from radiation but for stovetop its all coming from the flame copper can absorb all the flame contact area and pass the energy to where its needed most whereas with iron you get a cold spot where the meat hits it and its going to struggle to come back up to temperature
  copper can absorb all the flame contact area and pass the energy to where its needed most whereas with iron you get a cold spot where the meat hits it and its going to struggle to come back up to temperature    i have tried both ci is easily superior    ci lets you store up heat via thermal mass think of it like saving money in your bank acct before a big purchase copper sucks for that    can you cook a steak or whatever in a copper pan of course you can but it certainly wouldnt be my first choice different tools for different jobs
  its the opposite really
  yes like saving up money vs just having a higher income better just to have the high income no    ive cooked steak on copper and ive cooked it on cast iron copper wins easily now ive got a shitty rental stove with like a 4 inch burner ring so all the fire is concentrated in one spot maybe if youve got a really fancy stove putting out 50k btu over a perfectly even area cast iron might come out ahead for this purpose i dont know just going from personal experience
  no it isnt really
  i wish everyone had to take a thermal dynamics class so they wouldnt say stupid shit like this
  it is cast iron does a better job of retaining its heat when food touches it this is one of its main selling points im not sure where your confusion started but its pretty common knowledge
   better just to have the high income no  absolutely but in this case income is the power of the stove how many btu/hour it has a copper pan and a ci pan would have the exact same income if we used them on the same stove the difference is that the ci pan lets us save up more heat in advance      you and i both
  i use a cast iron all the time and agree with this i do have to say i have never had a pan clean this easily though
  a copper pan and a ci pan would have the exact same income if we used them on the same stove  but that just isnt true the iron pan lets a lot of the energy just roll past it and into the surrounding air the copper pan soaks it up better in this case the stove is like the general economy and the pan is like the individuals actual earning potential
  cast iron is old as fuck youre trippin dog
  you realize the value of cast iron and you still agree with him are you fucking retarded veganism is pointless faggotry cast iron actually has a useful purpose kill yourself
  the iron pan lets a lot of the energy just roll past it and into the surrounding air    no that misunderstanding is why i wish everyone had to take a thermo class     go read the section on heat transfer in modernist cuisine then read the sections on pan materials
  always fun when someone tries to cite something he thinks is obscure hoping that the other person cant just easily look it up    i might suggest you refer to vol2 pp4344 where it agrees with me and not you
  pan shot pan shot
    in short  evenness is a function of conductivity and burner size  small burner  you need better conductivity  better conductivity either from thicker pans or better material  25mm copper  roughly 7mm aluminum  in your case youre dealing with about 5mm of iron iron is about 1/4 as good as aluminum which in turn is about 1/2 as good as copper    so good luck finding a 16mm thick cast iron pan i guess
      pan shot
  heavy  pre 65 cast arns are lighter than modern lodge cast arns
everyday i wake up and put tree resin in my fireplace and light it up by rubbing two sticks together then i go out to my pasture and slaughter a pig once i butcher the pig and remove its belly i take 30 minutes to prepare my cast iron pan to fry it my wifes boyfriend loves the natural flavors that come from this traditional method
  my cast iron is shit it doesnt heat evenly   i used to have a really good one i bought in nicaragua but i lost it it hurts
  everyone in those old west movies always looks way too healthy and well dressed
listen everybody you need to understand basic physics different metals have different specific heats the thickness of the metal will also affect its conductivity thin metal will conduct energy directly through it thick metal will transfer heat more slowly if you want an even and steadier heat use a thicker pan if you want heat thats rapid and adjustable use a thin metal copper is more conductive than iron and thick iron is less conductive than aluminum use the tool that suits the application if you dont know what im talking about you need to reconsider the cia degree that your parents paid for
    ive just been microwaving most of my stuff it works really well if you figure out how to do it right
  my cast iron is shit it doesnt heat evenly  but jesus that is actually how its supposed to work take a thermodynamics class like me
  he doesnt know how to grill with just a hammer
  so are tattoos but theyre trendier than ever
old tool is ok
  you asian
  cost of manufacturing and resources have gone up exponentially producers are always looking for ways to cut corners to increase profit margin 9 times out of 10 older products are objectively better than newer products usually if they arent its because of new manufacturing and machining processes that werent available back then that allow for better tolerances and precision during manufacture this is mostly true with internal combustion engine rotating assemblies now you can have an engine with 003005 inches of tolerance in the rotating assembly compared to 008015 of yesteryear along with developments like overhead cams or enclosed systems like fuel injection that are subject to less wear and elemental exposure   i understand this is a shitpost but if you can educate even at least one person every now and then maybe 4chan boards wouldnt be such a fucking joke
  ive been cooking on a cast iron pan that was passed down from my great grandmother that was traded for in 1913 with a day of yard work
  even most people with decent money dont want to spend 9k on a pan
  9k is the price of solid silver you can get a brand new heavy copper pan with steel lining on ebay for the price of all clad because soccer moms get them as gifts and are afraid to ruin them by taking them out of the box so theyd rather just not have one at all
  why would you use solid silver when you could just microspray platinum it doesnt tarnish like silver and copper has like 96 the head conductivity of silver people are weird
  thought the post i quoted was more of a what are you too poor for a 9k pan deal
  well if youre a cast iron neckbeard a couple hundred might as well be a couple million
  four legs good  two legs better
used my cast iron once to cook a few steaks  the entire thing was rusted the day after    what the fuck did i do wrong also it was a pain in the ass to clean all the burnt gunk off
  similar to shaving with a straight razor its a process that was perfected 100 years ago  scrape blade across face  im pretty sure people have been shaving and cooking for several thousand years  theres definitely fags who fetishize it but the alternative is paying 20 for a triple blade plastic piece of shit every other week  nigger i pay 9/month for dollar shave club and its the best 5 blade razors they have
  t retard
  should have just scraped the burnt stuff off with a metal spatula and wiped it out with a paper towel while it was still warm if it was really impossible then you could have just boiled water in it and scrape while it simmers dump the water and wipe dry
  see this   10 for 2 years worth of razors another 10 for a puck of soap that will last a year dollar shave club is retarded
  does a good seasoning prevent burnt residue i just used the lodge preseason
  yes and no using some oil in your pan will help it not stick as badly but the whole point of using a cast iron on your steaks is getting that crispy sear and there will always be burnt bits as a result what you should do while your steaks are resting is make a pan sauce its easy to do and there are a variety you can choose from basic steps are to reduce heat to just under medium add a slice or two of butter as needed or olive oil melt to desired doneness browned butter can definitely be good here this is also the spot where you can add onions or garlic if you want them if you added aliums make sure they cooked down now sprinkle in a bit of flour and whisk vigorously with a fork the more flour the thicker your sauce all the way up to gravy consistency this is a roux you can leave it pale or browned depending on how dark and rich you want your sauce to be now this is where the magic happens youre going to deglaze the pan with a liquid of your choice wine stock milk/cream pour it in slowly while you stir this will lift anything stuck to the pan off and incorporate it into your sauce you want this start with a small amount of liquid and add as needed especially with wine you dont want it too winey if you add too much liquid kick the heat up and steam some moisture off salt to taste wa la when you pour your sauce out nothing will be stuck to the pan and you have a delicious sauce that will compliment your meal i know its a lot of writing but trust me it all happens very fast youll want everything you need to do it out and ready on your counter because its easy to burn your roux fucking around with shit should take 1015 minutes at most
  if it aint broke dont fix it
  a bad workman blames his tools
  thanks will try this
  bought 500 feather blades for retardedly cheap less than 50 for this and a safety razor total  one blade side per shave bc thicc hair  down to my last 32  should i consider the other two
  wtf is that thing on the right baili
  whats that horse vibrator in the middle an immersion blender
ctrlf  stainless steel  no results found    you dont need this fancy schmancy bullshit people
  only have a non stick and stainless steel  i legitimately cant see what i can do in a cast iron that i can do in the pans i have
  20 minutes extra per night to heat up and clean  yeah theres no value in it for me lad
  weeb nigger btfo
  it sears stuff better fried potatoes and steak come out great
  cooking steak on anything but a charcoal grill  shiggy diggy doo
  my stainless steel does a pretty damn good sear if all im getting is a slight upgrade on my sear it doesnt really seem worth the investment
  how are there even still people on /ck/ who cant recognize an anova
  to be fair sous vide is a meme and i dont visit /ck/ that often because its full of mouth breathing subhumans
  ts full of mouth breathing subhumans  yes weve been getting a lot of crossboarders recently
  implying crossboarders wouldnt be an improvement  even /pol/ocks
  its 4chan bro lighten up  theres nothing wrong with wanting to turn every board into /b/  unironically kill yourself
  this board is /b/ with a topic crossboarders would inherently make it less /b/ like
  im just going to assume whatever shithole you crawled out of is basically /trash/ tier and you probably take that as a compliment
  easy to maintain  nonstick pans are way easier to clean
op is a gigantic hypnosissy faget
  i dont know anything about cooking and will do whatever gay people tell me
  pan seared is better i like to baste in butter and make a pan sauce i bbq cheap steaks in the summer too but i dont think its as good    its probably not worth the investment for you tbqh but i can do everything your whole set does with one pan so if i were advising some one whos buying a new set from scratch ci would be my suggestion once someone is really getting advanced in cooking and theyre after making certain emulsified sauces then its time for a copper or thin mm carbon steel i wouldnt ever buy a stainless steel or teflon pan because i dont need that many pans it doesnt save me anytime or allow me too cook any better and cast iron doubles as a perfect roasting pan if you were building a tool box from scratch skipping the cast iron pan is like skipping the ratchet i mean yeah i can buy lots of other tools that will allow me to on total replace the job of the ratchet but theres no advantage to doing it that way

mmmmm pseud juice
  ahh yes the beverage you have to condition yourself over time to like because most people find it naturally repugnant ah what a delicacy  i fucking hate pretentious wine snob faggots
  im getting hints of saltiness
nice thread you retarded faggot
  grocery outlet is a pretty good store to check out for wine the have a huge variety and some great bottles and most of them are under 8
im living in bergamo right now and all the wine at the supermarket is like 3 and good is that normal for italy
  normal wine has very low taxes and italy is the biggest producer in the world
    your mom got more than just a hint of my salty juice if you know what i mean
  mmm under 8 for identical tasting burn juice
  thats nearly all booze you wanker
  its only pseud if youre paying over 2530 a bottle for it      i liked wine and beer from the get used to swipe sips from my dad when he wasnt looking when i was a wee lad hard liquor not so much    you lucky dog
  more like pleb filter
  i liked wine and beer from the get used to swipe sips from my dad when he wasnt looking when i was a wee lad hard liquor not so much    thats interesting because i hated the first beer and wine i had but enjoyed the first whiskey i tried i think its because i had misconceptions about how the first two would taste but more or less guessed right about how liquor would be
  this its like any other nuanced food/drink its all about growing your palate
  i do not know what you mean sorry
  no kuvee anon are you poor or something

go to restaurant  menu is all small plates
  who wants to eat the same thing for a half hour straight  i heard the late great mario batali say something to that effect and it rings true god bless his crocked sole
  small plates restaurants are always expensive too youre paying a lot for considerably less food
  what if you are not an 80 year old woman and can finish a large plate of food in 10 minutes
  but better quality nice dishes different new combinations going to eat at a restaurant is not only about calorie intake per 
  nonutilitarian scum leave
  just stick to applebees and olive garden friendo
  then go somewhere else you are allowed to choose restaurants if you want to eat good food get small plates type of shit if you just want to eat a quesadilla for 5 hours then go to chilis red robin applebees etc
  go to chinese restaurant  you have to stop and take a purge break to finish the plates
  heh
  go to chinese restaurant   food is served family style
  maybe its a tapas joint
what sort of american snacks should i send to my friends in the uk for christmas
  inshallah we will teach the kuffir to respect us
hand guns and cereal with red dye 40
inb4 thread full of roasties seething
the ones that hypnotize them into eating more and more
  there is literally no american snack that is worth sending they might want to try twinkies or something out of morbid curiosity not because they taste good
  unironically this candy is way better in europe    chocolate is over acid assness that just loads up on sugar  gummies and other non chocolates filled with artificial garbage and shit tons of sugar  like why
  cheesy poofs
  buy him a snack lootbox from another country
swedish fish turkish delight danish cookies
  snyders of hanover mustard onion  honey bbq lays chips formerly crisps
  i dont think cheeseburgers do well when shipped internationally
  god imagine if those were sugar free bears and you could hear her shitting out explosive diarrhea and in between violent bursts you could hear her asshole puttering like an old jalopy
  jelly belly jelly beans get some of those asshole flavored ones too
  true beef jerky not the megacorporate processed shit vacuum packed in plastic
  reeses    alsoive heard americans refer to british chocolate shittier as delicious  if this is truly the case by comparison with american chocolate you probably should not inflict it on anyone
  send them a herseys bar and tell them it is the finest chocolate they will ever experience
sees candys but dont tell them 90 of them are inedible garbage
    ive heard weve got better salty snacks than you fags but it could have been a jest
mexican candy if you want to give them somthing they have never had before im pretty sure uk already gets all the good candy we make
freedom
  traditional american chocolate is like hersheys which is more like chocolate product and not straight up chocolate but we also have a huge selection of smaller craft chocolatiers that like to charge a fuck ton because theyre too good to use slave harvested coco you can find that at nicer grocery stores and co ops
send them a large bag of ruffles potato chips and a package of the ranch dressing powder toss in a few pounds so they can go to the store and get a container of sour cream instruct them to mix the ranch powder into the sour cream and enjoy with the chips     delicious and a good representation of american snacks
  mmmm some of my favorites butt plug shoe some of a donut toungeringpop and pile of aboriginal hair muy bueno
pork rinds
  thats in very short supply in the us only possessed by megacorporations nowadays and theyre not selling

what kind ketchup does is a mustard based or mayonayse
  mustard
somebody broke tay again
huh
    this guy gets it
if you put ketchup on a burger when theres already tomato on it youre a faggot
  you having a stroke anon
  there is nothing based about mustard
  putting raw tomato on any burger or sandwich is a mistake
is molecular gastronomy a real thing or did they make it up for food wars/shokugeki no soma
real but meme
the entire show is made up cooking isnt real
  that makes sense    i just googled it whys it a meme
  food doesnt exist
cooking is just applied chemistry
  its real but im pretty sure the guy who invented it would take it back if he could    hes pretty adamant it has fairly limited uses
  is internet search engine a real thing or did they make it up for google
  is like distilled food autism
  isnt that just how chemicals react to cook food
go back to your containment board you weaboo trash
  fuck you this is an anime site
  youre thinking of 4chan 4channel is not a web site
  did you know love hides in molecular structure  well it does  molecular gastronomy is fake and sounds like the name of a syd barrett song
molecular gastronomy is kinda scary to me honestly im afraid itll take the joy out of eating now that we have the ability to scientifically extract the flavors from any food and even create our own flavors artificially then inject those flavors into a shapeless paste to make the nest tasting spoonful of food youve ever eaten how can cooking be interesting now that we can effortlessly recreate the just sublime flavors wint sublime flavors become boring  its like what that short cunt from the incredibles says forget namewhen everyones super no one will be except with fod
  cooking is fun and itll always be special taking ingredients and making them into something tasty even if we could call up perfect food with a star treklike replicator
    there you go traditional cooking is for uneducated plebs
for me its the 3dprinted vegan burger
  did you get all three d for free
  based  redpilled   dabbed
  but in a fightthat cow would eat your grassy ass
  is the joke that theyre hardly different
more info please
  the point is that theyre hardly different to a point that if they served you that in a burger youd have a hard time telling the difference
  except the price and the fact ive eaten beef at least once a day since i was hatched
  yeah aside from taste and texture there is hardly a difference
but there is no vegan burger its called a sandwich
    its getting closer you philistines not there yet though
i want to share this with you today ive made meat with wine sauce
cccombo breaker
  lets see the meat baby 
  nice knife faggot now fuck off
some steamed potatoes
  woah buddy
  thats not meat those are called carrots
  no you fuck off    first i put the meat in the oven for 15 minutes
  no you fuck off you dumb australian

  how did you get the meat to stay up there
then i put the meat in a hot pan
    why are you just calling it meat  why not specify the type of meat it is you creepy fucker
  its an old familiar trick i cant tell you    now the other side of the meat
this whole thread
  well i dont know how to call it in english it is ribeye steaks maybe there is no need to call me creepy fucker just for that its not human meat    i take out the ribeye steaks and then i add the onions
then i put the carrots some red wine and then broth
i put the mashed potatoes in the bottom of the oven with cheese in the top to gratin it i didnt take a photo of that
  its all just muscles and fat anyway some connective tissue too maybe
all together in my fork
if you dont start rotating pics youre going to have one less finger for each post that you made
  fucking love onions i can smell that pic      looks great to me fuck the trolls you did fine theyre just wishing they had your meal instead of frozen pizza
  thanks anon its a simple recipe but it was really good
thoughts
i fucking love it at least the classic chickensaucefries but since you can make the sauce at home now i havent been in years their fries are great hough
quintessential restaurant for canadian boomers that have given up on life
  only ever heard of it on a canadian board seemed like it wasnt common even there
  my friend used to get given garlic bread for taking there trash home walking home from work every night
  pretty shitty but good if you have no standards and have the coupons
  i want that so much right now
  take out  yeah theres your problem its twice as better when you get it inhouse
this place is one of the main reasons i will never leave canada to live somewhere else i wish i was joking
  pretty they have them in a few of the northern states like new york
  in 2010 the last two swiss chalet restaurants in the us closed they were located in the suburbs of buffalo new york
  do block heads really eat this stuff
  we have boston market here its the same except better
  the day of the rake approaches
youll never eat the hickory bacon flatbread again  a nice hot chicken sandwich though is to die for
  i love it  their ribs are pretty tasty but only ever really worth it when they do the promo for the free quarter chicken when you order ribs      im sure there are plenty of boomers who would be willing to trade a few swiss chalet restaurants for olive garden restaurants
  canadian boomers are content with east side marios the shitty olive garden imitation whos better prices win out over the worse quality    what wed fucking love is to get outback steakhouse back also swiss chalets ribs are tasty but they fucking never cut or trim the meat whatsoever and they always have tons of cartilege ends popping off of them
  ah ok i havent visited buffalo in over a decade but i remember getting some fries and sauce from a sc there
i used to be a line cook for swiss chalet and i would always make sure the fries would be as fresh out of the fryer as possible sometimes i let them cook abit longer for the golden crisp i always hated when i get fries somewhere and they have been clearly sitting out for awhile it was a nice feeling to know i was in control of the outcome of fries at swiss
  we  dude your country doesnt agree with every thought you have
  im sure there are plenty of boomers who would be willing to trade a few swiss chalet restaurants for olive garden restaurants  olive garden in many places is the only italian restaurant and swiss chalet is a no name which seems to be canadas version of the cracker barrel it doesnt seem like a fair trade
  never heard of it is that like outback but with skis on the walls
  in quebec / neighbouring areas they have st hubert chicken which is the same but shittier
  i remember when there were long john silvers in canada fucking sucks theres no longer a fast seafood chain
he doesnt remove fat from his steaks after its prepared  might as well get a spoonful of shit as a sauce to it bruh
  why would you
  do what now
  after its prepared  ftfy
  no idiot thats wrong its shows possession its is a contraction of it is
    since steaks is plural he should use theyre retards
  based do what now poster
  not standing the steak on its side and rendering out the side fat while making a crispy edge  not frying the steak in a mixture of rendered beef fat and butter   not making a pan sauce of rendered beef tallow and butter    op you best unfuck yourself before i gauge out your eyeballs and skull fuck you
  it says  after its prepared  are you legitimately fucking retarded or what
  how are you gonna cut away the fat thats already been rendered out you twinkle toed cock sucking faggot
  if the steak is prepared correctly there wont be an appreciable amount of fat to remove afterward
    i never cooked a steak
  i have never cooked a steak correctly
  based anti quotation marks poster
guys thank me later so easy and super yum  sorry for the poor quality photo but i got up for midnight snack its just so fucking good  med heat  onion garlic large sweet fresh chilli olive oil  add sausages cut in 3 per saussage  add devilled saussage packet i used maggi broccoli can of tomato some t sauce mustard salt pepper chilli powder cumin little ginger little celery feeds and a bunch of dried parsley   it is just fucking devine anons  i served over mashed potatoes with fresh bread/butter    bonus points if you can guess the cubed vege it brings some needed texture
yeah cook a bunch of shit and eat it we all know to do that
sounds good but  super yum  you fag lol
  fuck forgot after sausages are browned added about 250ml water/250ml beef stock    man its way better than stuff i cook with this little effort    so saying yum makes you a fag now too got it  but yeah its yum
  ehhh saying yum is cool but calling something yum is kinda queer im mostly joking it does sound yum though
righto so what drug/s are you currently under the influence of
lol
  just al/ck/    also fuck forgot i added a diced apple in and cooked a bit before adding the sausages it was pretty much all absorbed into the sauce combined with the tomatoes it made the dish the perfect amount of sweet
  man sober up and check this thread in the morning  is it really that good
sausages  cut in 3
poverty
  i sometimes make stewed apples but only to eat with pork chops could see work with some fresh pork sausages tho
  you could cut in 4 it your autism needs even numbers    it just added another level of sweetness to the dish not overpowering at all so im glad i did it    is really is cant wait to have last if it for lunch    someone write down this recipe already
  poverty  sausage  what sausage is expensive as fuck
looks like a slop o shit
  yeah not expense but tastyyyyy    no one has tried to guess the secret vegetable
  how much was your cleaver  why do you say its better no one on /ck/ says a cleaver is better so why do you
  what the fucks a sweet fresh chilli
  anonymous 12/01/18sat084351 no1155  what a fucking post
  bonus points if you can guess the cubed vege it brings some needed texture  kohlrabi
  no but hint maybe  its more famous in japan to win i want the japanese name
  yeah cook a bunch of shit and eat it we all know to do that    i like to cook but i have little talent for it my last gf was a super picky eater and essentially she always cooked for us and never me one time she said to me    anon you dont know how to cook you just know how to make food    i think that pretty much sums up my skill
  and this is after following a recipe quite precisely    i wont eat my wifes cooking unless she follows a recipe
for me its ranch

  come on anon grow up
  i just posted it to shit on vegans women and fat people librels glad your on board
  grow up  suck my ass
  continuing to prove the statement
          cursed food thread is this way 
  carbs are vegan anon
  in my experience fatties are only vegan when they feel like it as soon as they get in front of food that isnt vegan they decide they are on break until they have eaten whatever it is then they go back to being vegan
  well thats your experience anon meanwhile ive known turbo fatties who ate falafels and fries as 90 of their meals and only to wash it down with a whole family sized soda bottle
  that actually looks like a really tasty vegetarian dish
  love him
  rick stein is underrated

  its akin to lesbians using strapons it just makes sense while in pursuit of something naturally nonsensical
  this one seems the most legit hearts of palm and artichoke have similar flavor and consistency to shellfish
  i think most people go vegan because they dont like how animals are treated in factory farms or just dont like the thought of having to kill something not because they dont like the taste of meat i dont really see how its that confusing
  i agree with this if you ethically dont agree with eating meat why pretend to eat meat when theres plenty of tasty vegetable dishes they can have and if you dont eat meat purely because you dont like the taste or texture then you wouldnt eat this anyway nothing wrong with veggie burgers or sausages when they are just made from vegetables and not trying to emulate flesh textures but why make a fake chicken breast      not a food analogy  but seriously maybe the strapon user has a fetish for wanting to pretend to have a dick and fuck their girlfriend with it whilst not wanting to actually be a man dominance reasons and the receiver wants to have a nice relationship with a woman but sexually still want to be humped and penetrated simultaneously lesbians arent fucking women for ethical reasons its not the same principle

  anyone can comment on why he gives such thin sheets of this and what it might taste like
  looks like hes burning his fingers  it does    why not wear gloves   gloves are a safety hazard around rotating machinery if the glove gets caught on something it will pull your hand/arm into the machine whereas if you werent wearing gloves you just get cut instead     tool  for what reason i assume its much easier to tell when the food is cooked when you can feel the texture with with your fingers
  probably pretty hard when thick
  theyre just chocolate candy anon
  eggs are vegetarian dummy they arent meat at all its vegan youre thinking of
  gloves are a safety hazard around rotating machinery  its a rotating flat surface that can be stopped by hand not a meat grinder not that using gloves would make sense in this case anyway

my local mcdonalds raised the price of their mcchicken to 219 anyone know a good lawyer
  its 100 price was its only appeal sorry anon
  mcchickenshill btfo
for me its the mcchicken the best fast food sandwich i even ask for extra mcchicken sauce packets and the staff is so friendly and more than willing to oblige    one time i asked for mcchicken sauce packets and they gave me three i said wow three for free and the nice friendly mcdonalds worker laughed and said im going to call you 3forfree    now the staff greets me with hey its 3forfree and always give me three packets its such a fun and cool atmosphere at my local mcdonalds restaurant i go there at least 3 times a week for lunch and a large iced coffee with milk instead of cream 12 times for breakfast on the weekend and maybe once for dinner when im in a rush but want a great meal that is affordable fast and can match my daily nutritional needs    i even dip my fries in mcchicken sauce its delicious what a great restaurant
sonics chicken strip sandwich is better than the mcchicken
  dang that sucks you can get chickfila for 3 is this the death of the mcchicken
    ok this meme has gotten stale
  stop living in california

  mcdonalds is so shit that even sonics food is better
  i highly doubt that bucko sonics is just a white trash mcdonalds that serves corndogs to obese housewives

do you get mad when people use their phones at the dinner table
  not really it just means theyre too autistic or socially awkward to carry an actual conversation and it saves me the trouble of awkward moments when they cant keep the conversation going
  depends on how long they do it  getting mad over someone sending or reading a quick text is fucking stupid
  hi lefty/pol/
    no one has conversation anymore thats what autistic people claim they care about when they cant talk about movies or video games anymore or theyre on an actual phone hookup meeting where the pretense is gone and they know its a ritual to fuck  i have dinner with my friends no problem they might get a text from a wife
  it depends if theyre so focused on their phone they dont pay attention to anything around them pulling your phone out every few minutes to check or reply to something isnt a big deal
you can be social while looking at a phone briefly or longer if you dont respond to other thing or prioritize the phone in terms of attention then you would seem like a dick though
  what are you talking about
  not mad but i do think its extremely rude i grew up with everyone having dinner together every night and from the time you sat down until dinner was done nobody answered their phone or anything it was really nice
  ive seen groups of millennials eating at restaurants and every one of them had their head buried in their phone the entire time they were probably texting each other instead of talking lol the military draft and ww3 cant come soon enough
  imaging taking a joke seriously on the fast food war board of a mongolian throat singing website
  t grandpa
  be me  be on first date with chick i met  go to local sushi joint  shes on her phone the entire time  i eat my roll  excuse myself  go to my truck  drive home  she never called or texted me after that i hope she made it home ok
  grow the fuck up already
  do you get mad when people use their phones at the dinner table  i get mad when people are at the dinner table
checking it once in a while is fine   using it constantly is rude i guess but i dont get mad since i just dont care that much it is poor form though yeah    i dont see why they do it either if i go out with people its to spend time with them not to shitpost on 4chan or chat up whores on tinder or whatever it is people do on their phones why go at all
  imagine being such a beta pussy you whiteknight for shitposting pieces of shit when people mock and reject their stupid memes
  lol thats funny as fuck she was probably confused and offended too
  if you want to socialize with people why go out to dinner its hard to talk while youre stuffing your face and theres loud music and screaming kids everywhere just chill at home and have some drinks
  ask me how i know this picture is british
  not him but every modern social interaction is just a shit slinging contest no one is genuinely interested in a conversation at dinner

  no i clean up everything afterwards they probably just dont like smelling food at midnight i dont cook until they fuck off out of the kitchen since they just sit there all day       retard i only ever use enough olive oil or butter to make sure food doesnt stick its not floating in grease      i think they both have dementia or are developing
  they probably just dont like smelling food at midnight  that was going to be my second question put a fan in an open window and air the place out
  butter to make sure food doesnt stick  dude  dude what

  learn to cook nigger       wouldnt work windows are too far and its too cold for that     i could try using the air purifier i guess this is just dumb though i have to smell their nasty old people food and their nasty prune shits and farts but i cant even cook     i bet theyll find something to complain about with the oven and make me start microwaving my steak
yeah i can see this being an issue i used to fry steaks at all hours of the night and smoking up the house annoyed my parents try to open a window when you cook
  they probably just dont like smelling food at midnight  i fucking hate this shit i had a roomate who would complain about me making food late at night then would get up at fucking 5am and make coffee and the fucking smell would wake me up every time  theres nothing worse than the smell of coffee when youre trying to sleep
  well shit im out of ideas except maybe murder
grand pa    do americans etc
  agreed     even worse is that they get up every morning at 5 am and make a bunch of fucking noise in the kitchen basically yelling at each other because theyre deaf also while clanking dishes around because their fragile old bodies and nerves cause their hands to shake and jerk all over the place so they end up   slamming doors and pots and pans and waking me up constantly    fucking boomers       greetings fellow night eater

i cant find that anywhere here and i live in socal
  all the more reason to consume pork and pork products      99 ranch
  should have bought ham hocks cheaper and the flavor is better  why do they smell like rancid ass when cooked and make me afraid to eat it i washed it quite thoroughly before i dropped it in the pot
  they shouldnt smell anon sounds like you bought spoiled meat     washed meat  you are a retard your intentions might have been good but washing meat causes bacterial splatter all over your sink and surrounding area its also unecessary since you will be cooking the meat before you consume it thereby rendering it safe
  its stock cubes thats like asking what to cook with salt

the government should reward adults with free pizza for finishing books prove me wrong
  the government doesnt want an informed population they want people to be stupid
  how does one prove they read the book      true
  le tinfoil guy
  theres no such thing as the government there are people with money and people without money and two political parties one party cares about nothing but money while the other party cares about money but is idealistic and actually believes in an informed public and tries to do things to make the country a better place
  yes there is theyre just easy to buy
  one party cares about nothing but money  true cant stand democrats  while the other party cares about money but is idealistic and actually believes in an informed public   based republicans
  thats too stupid to even be considered bait
  2016 elections  clinton raises over a billion dollars mostly from large corporations and private donors   trump self funds campaign and after winning refuses president salary  oh yeah youre totally right
  republicans  believe in an informed public  i know this is bait yet i still took it
  while the other party cares about money but is idealistic and actually believes in an informed public   based republicans    and they exemplify that with donald trump
  you need a bribe to read books are you a literal twelveyearold
  the democrats are no better they are corporate overlords trying to control everyone and keep everyone ignorant of the truth so they can keep race baiting everyone into hating each other and controlling them    republicans just come off as idiots who think obeying their corporate overlords will be good
you guys sound too young to know what ops referencing here we used to do this during the early 90s back when people still read books where you would read a book and then theyd give you a sticker so you could get a personal pan pizza from pizza hut it looks like they still do it today although i imagine it isnt as popular with modern kids having smart phones and the internet as it exists now to entertain themselves with  
  it got started in the late 80s i used to read the whole years quota and get all my tickets at once those personal pan pizzas were the best back then
  did they change the personal pan pizzas havent eaten there in a long time
  i dont need it but i want free pizza
did pizza hut charge 40 dollars for small signature pizza in the 80s too
  a person who pays that much for 8001200 calories of food is definitely a pizza slut
  le bootlick guy
  40 dollars for small signature pizza  what is this a reference to i dont remember anything at pizza hut ever costing anywhere close to 40
  your post proves people do not want freedom
  the jewish principal at the local hs told everyone we shouldnt be teaching history anymore    ya its real and the backlash will happen
  elementary school used to give pizza party buffet for everyone who participated in book club  pepperoni  sausage  bacon  variations of all sorts  all for reading fucking books on school time  even had dessert pizzas  can eat as much as you wanted  principle shook your hand  thanks a lot faggot its just not the same to pay for a pizza buffet as an adult you dont even get a fucking handshake
  promoting literacy is fine but dont pretend modern literature isnt an ideologically barren wasteland of low key smut for women and tutorial books for old people too stupid to find information online
    
  how about you finish the book and have a fuckin salad
  when i did this in 1996 i believe i had to read something like 5 books of course they were like 10 page childrens books and i was in kindergarten/1st grade    i always had a really high accelerated reader count because i spent all my free time in school reading because it was that or stare at the wall
  not true theres also books about sexy action lawyers
  at pizza hut you have to get the deals like when they have a 5 each for 3 medium pizzas or something     or you know just make your own pizza
i read lots of books i would be fat with that much pizza
ahem

how did i do cunts    just made carne asada on the weber baby q    flank steak  bunch of coriander  zest and juice of 1 lime  1/2 cup olive oil  3 cloves garlic  1 tbsp cumin  sprinkle mexican chili powder  salt  pepper  splash of soy sauce  marinate overnight    cooked on high on the webber for 13 mins total so fucking tender and juicy
  youre trying too hard by calling us cunts go back to kekkit
    im australian you fucking dickhead
  looks good m8 id have that with some nice crusty garlic bread
a side of green beans too
    yeah thats just the cut served with green beans broccoli and a tiny bit of guac
  marinade sounded legit although i use a mix of orange and lime juice and leave out the cumin i like to chop it into smaller chunks and serve on tortillas with onions pickled jalapeno or serano and tomatillo or pico sauce    really smells great as its grilling doesnt it just like an authentic taco shack run by abuela
  overcooked 4/10
  cunt
    that sounds great im thinking about dicing the next one and putting in a wrap with some grilled onions lettuce tomato guac and sour cream its amazing how fucking tender it stays        this is how i like steak ahahah just about medium

what are you drinking today    this is a thread for general discussion about tea tisanes and yerba mate    faq  embed embed     pictured ito en iced tea

  ito en is tea 1
  i like my green tea sweet
black friday order from ys a couple reorders a couple samples and a cheap af aged white cake im excited to try
  i am from the south of brazil which is where most of brazils white people live the monthly minimum wage here is u230 and thats what i earn as a college student doing internship though i dont have to worry with food and home expenses  as for tea i pay u18 for every 100 grams of sencha tea and thats about the same price for most other simpler varieties of tea  therefore 100 grams of tea can be almost 10 of a wage i bought like 400g in the past month and spent almost half of my entire intern wage so its a hefty cost but i dont regret a single cent  and to be fair i also think these 400g of tea will last at least two months if i drink moderately  ive also nearly eliminated the bitterness of sencha tea by using cooler water like anons recommended thanks going to try gong fu brewing this week or the next
  jesus christ 400 grams for a month im new with leaf tea but that is alot how much do you drink a day
right now im drinking some garbage seven ingredient korean tea because someone gave it to me tastes like dirty water
just got pic related and im making milk tea out of it using sweetened condensed milk and evaporated milk
  that seems ridiculously expensive but maybe they have some tea tariff in brazil here in europe a normal sencha costs like between 5 to 10 euro a 100g
  where slovakia sencha costs like 8 for 50g
      yeah if i do a 5 gram gong fu session every day 400g should still last me over 2 and half months i get a about half a liter of tea from each session    you must drink like 5 liters a day if youre going through it that fast brewing western and thats drinking moderately jesus anon
  i think it sounds about right i cant imagine any tea that costs 5 for 100 grams is of any quality
      i see seems like i miscalculated how much time itd take for me to drink the tea nice to know itll last longer  and there is no tariff as far as i know
  im in scandinavia and i mean yeah theres more expensive sencha but those are brand ones from shizuoka or whatnot    yeah its probably cheap chinese stuff but it tastes alright and i figure it does the work if youre poor
  yeah shizuoka is the one i have although not sencha but kukicha      400 grams is alot of tea i use like 34 grams a day so your supply would last me like 3 months

rule abiding hiroshimoot ordained /ck/ meta thread    how do we fix this shithole of a board its getting to /x/ levels of cancer
  waaaaa lets cry about things in a meta thread
  i would say the shitposting is unironically what made this place what it is it was always here serious discussion still does occur and the shitposting is humorous most of the time not only that but it often adds to the board culture blatent bait threads are an issue though
this is one of the only boards on this shit site thats still worth browsing  t oldfag
  what the slop 0f shit are you talking about anon
  i agree but that doesnt mean its good
  the board is fine could use more dickered cookalongs tho
  reminder that the meta thread rule was revoked and youre supposed to post it on the shitposting board /qa/ where no one who actually comes here will ever see it
  the only way you can fix it is start your own board
  hiroshimoot ordained /ck/ meta thread  these threads get deleted faster than al/ck/ threads dum dum and that op image sure as fuck isnt representative of this board kind of funny how these threads are always started by newfags or crossboarders whens the last time you even saw hiroshimoot post this site is run by a handful of rogue mods at this point moot may have been the og fag but it didnt matter because he at least checked in every night and made sure this place wasnt turning into a complete shithole to his credit he got out at the perfect time everything was going downhill but nobody could have saved this place after trump was elected and we were overtaken by t_d
im gonna have a long ass day tomorrow and will therefore get a pizza on the way home and pass out after eating it     should i get little caesars or papa johns which has better breadsticks

  little caesars the patricians choice
  if you want quality get papa  if you want to save money get lil caesars
  better ingredients better pizza papa johns vs hot and stinky lil cs

racist frog  i think the answer is pretty clear cletus
i should also add ive never had papa johns in my life i dont eat out much
  lawsy wont someone please think of my 12 sickle cell niglet chillins
let the good times roooooolllll
  if you didnt get the little caesars extra most bestest pizza with stuffed crust youre missing out

lil caesars deep dish and some cheese bread whatever the fuck maybe some marinara on the side for both niggers
the guy behind little caesars helped pay rosa parks rent when she was old keep that in mind when youre deciding your next pizza purchase
two hours to decide bros still not sure

  wrong there are some folks who are more interested in providing unique quality than expanding to where theyre just another pig trough ladle small and medium organic farmers who reject the usda rules permitting megacorporations to use broad spectrum pesticides under the umbrella of organic are the same type but youll never understand because you think everyone sucks mammons dick like you

this shit is amazing  fuck that overpriced la croix
just buy the store brand stuff by the liter for like 70 cents its all the same
clear american flavored water is 57 cents a liter at walmart
    this theres really no need to tell any sparkling water brands apart from eachother when theyre literally the same exact thing but with a different label attached to them even in blind taste tests you wouldnt be able to tell the difference     then again most people probably only buy lacroix for the pretty looking can anyway and not so much the water itself all that for some expensive shitty looking label that was probably sharted out of photoshop in less than two seconds by some highschool sophomore for art class during finals
why does this shit have literally no taste
  they arent the same lacroix is complete shit polar has the best flavor plus they have seasonal varieties all the time
  fuck that overpriced la croix  8 packs are like 3 bucks how cheap is this stuff
  go try their cranberry cider flavor or dont i dont give a fuck
  i love the white grape one but apparently so does everyone else because its almost always out
  man where i grew up they had these everywhere where im at now though they only sell polar in the 1 liter bottles forced to buy lacroix 8 packs      lacroix is like 6 for an 8 pack here where polar was like 3 where i used to live
  the liter bottles are usually 1 but they often go on sale for something like 4 for 3 the 12 pack cans are usually 3 for 10
  you can tell some waters apart by flavour some of the concentrates used for the flavouring can vary by brand ive tried at least 3 variations of pear at this point
  lacroix is like 6 for an 8 pack here  rip my man its 3 bucks for an 8 pack at my local smart and final and 375388ish at walmart
  i pay roughly 4 for a 12 pack of lacroix only catch is its at winco
  i gotta go to the different grocery store that has the wide selection of obscure polars i hear theyre northeastern but some things pop up here and there ive had their bitter lemon soda and its delicious as with the grapefruit and stuff quality brand
    store brands can vary some have better flavors and fizz retention than others frankly a big brand like polar is consistent at least
finally    fucking finally     someone who gets me     polar brand seltzer is the one brand i would be fine having a monopoly     i would happily work in the water mines and be paid in pure pure seltzer water only in cans though that way the kikes bpa shit cant steal my balls     i go through a case of seltzer a day if im working on a project only usually 13 a case due to sales     i would give up bone marrow to get a lifetime supply of polar brand seltzer specifically black cherry alternating with unicorn  i like seltzer

  i was for like months when i didnt know i had ketoacidosis my blood was so fucked i spent a week in the icu on iv mineralsl
  thats not nearly enough anon
i wanted to make some hummus but didnt have any lemons to juice i subbed for a tsp of powdered citric acid and hit it with a touch of apple cider vinegar the pita bread i had was moldy so i made tortilla chips instead what came out was pretty much a bean dip so i said fuck it and added some pickled jalape√±os i give you a true american dish
  ok i guess    i mean if you liked it then its good
i can dig it never thought to make my own hummus thanks for the inspiration
  easy to make i know you didnt ask but heres my recipe  slowcooked chickpeas  sauteed onions and garlic  more garlic  blitz  adding hot garbonzo juice so the blender doesnt do the thing  toss in some pine nuts  a single chipotle adobo  lemon juice  shit dont forget the tahini  a little more raw garlic couldnt hurt   salt and pepper until it tastes edible    nice
  thats not hummus
  slop
  huh
  he said its not hummus you hummusgus faggot
  go back to r/triggered_by_chipotle
  as  said i said its not a hummus you faggot huhposter
  this  hummus     lol embarrassing
  doesnt know what hummus is  its okay anon you dont have to post if you have nothing to contribute
  sauteed onions and garlic  toss in some pine nuts  a single chipotle adobo  no olive oil  only basic seasoning  thinks its hummus  oh you
  i threw in some toasted pine nuts to the hummus at work one time and weve been making it that way ever since sounds like youre overpowering it with garlic and then throwing in a chipotle in adobo for no reason like you know you can blitz that shit with a little olive oil and add it as a garnish if you want right but pine nuts in hummus are top tier
is it really bad for you if you eat a watermelons seeds shouldnt they have the same effect as fiber
  i dont know about watermelon seeds but i know apple seeds have tiny amounts of cyanide and eating enough could possibly kill you i think its a natural defense mechanism to keep wild animals from eating seed    same goes for peaches and such
  go back to the shithole that is /tv/ and stay there
  no they dont release anything in the seed your body doesnt process them     the whole reason why god made the fruit so tasty was so that animals would eat them along with the seeds and poop them out spreading new plants across the land
  well i mean if youre eating fruit chances are you might chew on the seeds as well thus opening them and causing your body to interact with the chemicals inside the seed but yea if you are really careful to not chew on the seeds and swallow them whole you should be fine
  yes you can grow watermelons in your uterus if you accidentally swallow seeds
  just smoke some cigarettes the smoke will suffocate the bacteria in your stomach
  she probably pays 450500 a month for that apartment most likely a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom 9001k for the whole thing
  i always eat the seeds and never had any issues the effort of having to spit them out is too great and makes the fruit less enjoyable so i just chew them up i dont mind them
  she
  is it really bad for you if you eat a watermelons seeds  no roast them though they get pretty decent however any health benefits are marginal since you have to eat a ton of them
no its not bad how can you be this stupid
  i always thought that was how black babies were created
  that was almost funny
how did you loaves turn out today /ck/
im gay by the way
  what shop did you buy those from
  nah     made a wheat starter and used bread flour king arthur bought from giant eagle   this was the recipe i used  
  my bread always comes out better than yours
  happy for you anon what recipes do you use
  the better than your bread recipe  works every time
what meat can you travel with that doesnt need to refrigerated i know jerkey/salami but are there any others
salted pork is particularly good
  have some hedgehog
ronnie too good for a goddamn apostrophe
spam
  op here i should probably have stated i dont want to carry any tins for packing reasons
  tuna or salmon in those foil pouches would be good  you said camping so i assume wilderness is it high calorie meats you want
  shooters sandwich is the only correct answer anybody have the infographic
  yes as im south african biltong jerkey is readily available but i was thinking of something that can go with couscous or pasta  not all our shops have the tuna in the foil packs
if you are near a large asian community there are many kinds of dried foods  there are dried shrimp and bonito it tastes like tuna for example not sure of meat as i havent shopped for it but definitely those two items there are many many kinds of chinese sausages sold dry as well   for protein have you considered hard cheeses they would work for travel if you can keep them coolish and the odor isnt an issue wrapped in foil you should not be able to smell many cheeses
  are you backpacking or will be in a truck  south africa seems to have some animals dont carry food instead bring a gun and/or fishing kit
  oops wrapped in foil no one can smell anything at all lol sorry for semantics issue i mean if you wrapped the cheese
  backpacking and you cant hunt on private property unless you obviously pay the owner for hunting on his property
  she can jerky my salami heheh
  underrated and viagra pilled
  prosciutto capicolla dry spanish chorizo three of my favorites anyways
  peanut butter in tubes very calorie dense and easy to pack some meat but thats mostly for flavor than anything else most freeze dried foods work well assuming you have access to water    this all assumes youre on a good sized backpacking trip
i went on this camping trip this weekend  one of the boys made chili  i had made it clear that i am jewish and dont eat pork but after eating dinner i was cleaning up the trash and saw a packet of panchetta  turns out he had sauteed the onion in that to begin with  i freaked the fuck out made myself puke and made the person who had driven me drive me home it was a 3 hour drive i feel totally justified in doing this  was i in the wrong i mean i look at it like if someone said they were diabetic and you served them a bunch of sugar or you gave someone with peanut allergies peanuts    i think my crew is going to be going down 1 if you catch my tokyo drift no more kicking it vtec style with me and my boys
  too blatant take out the driving and maybe the last sentence
  i am jewish  stopped reading right there
  its a sex shop for ronnies dumbass
i want to suck on her milf pusy
  ronnies burgers
  you tried too hard on this one champ
  how long do you need it to keep for
  the sex act
    has always been my first reference when going camping in the bush
  yeah definitely taking peanut butter i havent seen any freeze dried foods at the one retailer i went to we do have a lot of dried fruits and nuts available     cool ill look for these     less than 5 days at a time  probably closer to three
if you have a problem with eating the one on the right but not the one on the left then youre a fucking hypocrite    and thats them facts
  bitch im from mexico we eat grasshoppers for fun    
grasshoppers dont live in piss and shit water id rather eat them over sea bugs
  okay so im a hypocrite     and what
id try anything once provided its not harmful
  a little dumb baby bitch p
  no no nooooooooooooooooooo
  dey da same lol  nobody eats the lobsters shell head or organs and only weirdos eat whole shrimp
  left side has actual meat  right side literally just a crispy exoskeleton  jesus fucking christ the state of op
espera acaso soy un hip√≥crita √∫nicamente porque no soy amante de comer insectos y t√∫ s√≠     eres est√∫pido eso es un hecho     wait  am i a hypocrite only because i am not a lover of eating insects and you are youre stupid thats a fact sorry for the google traductor
meat is only for gods chosen  fuck off un shill
  cerra el orto mexicano trolo y mierda
  over 2 billion people already eating insects  well its not working then is it
  people
i have yet to be offered insects at a restaurant or grocery store if it tastes good why not
  crickets are ok taste a bit like salmon skin nice crunchy texture    mealworms are fucking delicious though have them with bbq seasoning and they are as good as any chips but more nutritious
  food preferences are cultural not logical
  fried shrimp heads taste deliciousyou really dont know what youre missing its like the shrimp flavor has been concentrated
if im allergic to shellfish would that make me allergic to insects as well
  only one way to find out
  i actually cant stand the left but always eat the right
  ill eat both if they taste the same but the one on the right doesnt taste the same or better thats the problem
no matter how many times i do it this is always the hardest decision ill make in a day
  i want to object to this but i also dont want to offend you
  freschetta or go home
  buying frozen pizza
  as opposed to stealing it
  make a homemade pizza you lazy mong
  pick the heaviest ones so you only have to eat 2 or 3 per meal you fat fuck
  its really easy once you realize they all taste like shit except digiorno
  why bother when you can just defrost a homestyle pizza
  red baron pan pizza master race
  digiorno  pretending they dont have the worst crust of every frozen pizza
check price per ounce and get the cheapest
why are you eating frozen pizza every day spoileror ever/spoiler
  thats a terrible way to go through life
  red baron is the only right answer its frozen pizza after all you buy it because its cheap and filling not because of something like taste so you might as well go for the cheapest and most filling option available
  the only good stuffed crust ive ever had was digiorno
  that would be this masterpiece often on sale for 099
do city dwelling retards really eat that stuff like why would you do that
  pic related is god tier
  the best stuffed crust was the freschetta sauce stuffed was like eating a masters thesis on frozen pizza
  agreed if they used that same crust but offered a pizza with slightly higher quality ingredients i would spendd my hard earned pesos
  it tastes nice and is done quickly why wouldnt you eat it
  wrong board
culinary circle is the only one worth buying
  making your own pizza is reddit go join your fellow faggots here  
  crust is so dry and lacks flavor but its my favorite style if im buying that brand
  get a local brand
  i have that here its pretty good i think its a regional pizza but i dont know what makes me think that ive only seen it at certain stores in the midwest
    i miss when they used to make their version of hot pockets they were fucking god tier
  obligatory    brick oven goat
  look at some of the storebrand pizzas  small print in the back  product of germany  crossing the atlantic in a temperaturecontrolled container ship is somehow cheaper than manufacturing frozen pizza here
  if we are going for best of the shit tier cheapest pizzas tombstone over red baron
digirono pan pizza and stuffed crust bacon me crazy are what ive been going with lately
leafy greens taste like such fucking shit can i just eat delicious bell peppers instead and get similar nutrition
  posting the worst bell peppers  you cant go wrong with greens
  eating fruit instead of leafy greens
  green peppers are just bitter which tastes good with some things but orange ones have a nice mix of sweet and tart
  disgusting  this is the most wrong opinion i have heard the entire day     i do not like your taste in bell peppers anon
ok so occasionally i grab a rotisserie chicken unseasoned no stuffing have i just never looked inside or is this normal it looks like a fucked up gutting but i realized i havent exactly looked inside a bird and havent gutted anything since we hunted pheasant when i was twelve    so what am i looking at is this normal for a bird with no stuffing or is this a fuckup
its just a cooked carcass
  normal
  so what am i looking at  the spine and bones
    op is retarded
i dig every little morsel of that rib/spine meat out too good
i get rotisserie chickens all the time there are always bits of organs sticking to the ribs in them i personally dont eat them ive never gotten food poisoning
  yes its normal fucking millenials
white people
cringe
  its a chicken tumor  you can get poultry cancer by eating meat that has been contaminated by that
  thank fucking christ i was worried it was aids
to be honest i love eating the spine
  i have aids for you
  you have aids
you know what would be fantastic this christmas a fresh ham

most underrated cereal coming through
  all cereal is trash though
  why is it not 199 still   it sure does a number on the roof of my mouth though thats why i have to stir it around for 20 minutes before eating  looking at your pic and mine i see two different brands i never knew
  yeah i think bought it from general mills or some shit recently
  wow this cereal is the best no one eats it
  imagine actually being tricked into consuming government subsidized sugar and corn in a pus blood and hormone filled liquid anons told to believe is the healthiest thing on earth on a daily basis
  fpwp  if people want to eat trash then let them eat trash
  i agree with op this cereal is severely underrated dont like the tiny packaging though
it was one of the few cereals that had a low price printed on the box and all the stores i got it from sold it for that two dollars for the longest time that has got to explain the small box i couldnt tell you the price now ive been buy the off brand bags that taste as good as the name brand stuff sadly there is no off brand ohs
  completely agree i used to eat the hell out of these when i was a little kid and i rediscovered them in college
soup cu/ck/s could use some help found this halfassed recipe on /fit/ and its breddy gud but it definitely doesnt come out in true patties as the picture states and i dont use a whole fucking onion thats insane i replaced flour with breadcrumbs and its dope but how can i make it more sturdy and actually like a patty any way to fix this up better    qtddtot i guess cuz i aint find one
heres how it turns out which works and its fine i dont mind eating it but it would be easier if they were patties i could pick up and munch
  add an egg and some breadcrumbs
  drain the tuna better  use flour instead of breadcrumbs  add another eggwhite into the mix
  this extra protein
  or cornstarch which will also help the patties crisp a bit better
ty yall i will try another egg and more crumbs and one with flour instead
  maybe use the whole fucking onion next time
oats/instant mash powder if youre so inclined  a little goes a long way and consider baking in muffin tin/ramekins instead of frying i make similar often make sure your onion is squeezed dry or go for half and boost with powder/granules
  i didnt follow the recipe how come the end result is completely fucking different  retard
  report back faggot what are your findings
i changed the recipe and now it doesnt end up the same way
ive made this recipe a bunch holds together much better if you use two eggs and three tbsp of flour yes use the whole onion no dont use breadcrumbs jesus christ if youre gonna use them just put them on the outside or something
inb4 he eats it 4 times a week and gets mercury poisoning
  we make something like this but with raw ground cod instead its pretty good  not a fan of cooking with canned tuna in general i only like it on bread
  i dont use a whole fucking onion  i replaced flour with breadcrumbs  how can i make it more sturdy and actually like a patty any way to fix this up better  by following the fucking recipe
  based fiskefrikadeller
ive never made it but i dont blame op on the onion a whole onion compared to a can of tuna and a few tablespoons of other ingredients seems pretty nuts
how does one get into the art of cooking where can i find educational resources on food and cooking
how educational do you want  i started with this site      and then i moved on to watching chef john      not really a super formal education but its good to know some of the basics  if youre a super brainlet just try making easy things first and building up from there
eggs a lot of eggs
  that comic site is obnoxious
  start cooking are you stupid or something
practice like crazy be curious and try cooking things you love i loved chicken parmesan as a kid so it was the first meal i got stupid good at now i dont care for chicken parm because ive eaten it a million times but im the process i learned how to make my tomato sauce how to bread and cook chicken how to boil pasta noodles really well on a time crunch and so on just practice everything and experiment all the time
  nice blog post man do you have any social media i can follow you on maybe a tumblr or an instagram or something perhaps a reddit account that i can hit up with some gold
  yikes dude feel better
i want to read a book about the basics of cooking like not a book of recipes but about understanding the fundamental chemistry  reactions involved anyone know of books like this
  im sorry i was simply asking if there was any way i could keep in touch with you you see i was simply enchanted with your post me and hubby love to cook and hearing about the rich history surrounding an anonymous internet chefs quest to finally understand how to make chicken nuggets and spaghetti was mindblowing would read again
  on food and cooking maybe
    go back to /lit/ you bookworms
gastronomy is fucking pretentious bullshit food is not art literally the most important thing about food is its flavor not how it looks on a plate
flavor can be enhanced by other taste factors such as presentation so youre an idiot  that being said i agree with the first sentence it always looks stupid to me and the people making a big deal about it just have an air of snobbery about them imo
  people who let the way food looks influence how they think it tastes are retarded  for example eww this fried cricket looks gross why would you ever eat it
  that looks like someone put their cigarette out on your food
  its leek ash
whats wrong with it looking nice and tasting good    such a strange reaction to plating
  i get to decide what is and isnt art    pretentious faggot how do you not see the hypocrisy in this
  people arent allowed to think for themselves
  your original post suggests that you dont hold that sentiment
  that plate looks like it was just found on some garbage dump
  which restaurants have you eaten in that plate food like that
  literally the most important thing about food is its flavor
  literally the most important thing about food is its flavor  liiiiiiiiiiiiterally the most important thing about food is its nutrients faggot  food is fuel not fun
  literally
   
          im literally gay btw
  youre literally a bundle of sticks
  literally the most important thing about food is its flavor  no dude stop seriously its nutrition   nutrition is the most important thing about food
literally had been said so much that it has literally lost all meaning
  literally  as fuck  literally  the fuck  literally   wtf    i feel bad for kids today educational systems have failed them financial systems have failed them civics and families have failed them they just stare at screens and mumble af tf literally like neanderthals
  it is this isnt the dark ages grandma
  it really makes my blood boil its truly a plague on the language its actually cancerous it totally makes me crazy its absolutely destroying the world    youre literally a fucking idiot
  disagree most customers can be sold on looks alone not too mention its fun and looks pleasing to make slapping this same meal on a plate haphazardly wouldnt look appetizing at all
  lets defund education to raise people stupid enough to support defunding education and then bitch about the ignorant kids ok  oh christ the absolute state
  education isnt a brick building with a pricing fixing cabal on outdated books  were in an age where all the education you could want is at your fingertips and free yet were the dumbest with the most years of education
  literally the most important thing about food is its flavor  literally  literally  nope no it isnt i hope youre stranded turn down emergency rations and die
    1 it is scientifically verifiable that presentation plays a not insignificant role in taste    2 to take it to the extreme how would you explain cases of cheap generally poorly flavored foods being lauded for their taste when presented as fancy im reminded of a few experiment where franzia was served to wine clubs and peddled as a rare vintage
  hahhaha bro just eat this greasylooking messy slop of food i threw together i swear it tastes good
  literally placebo effect
for me its abusing the word literally to piss off seething grammarfags
why is something not allowed to exist simply because you dont like it gastronomy lead to stuff like instant ramen and cold brew coffee
  source
  this greasy slop o shit  as opposed to an olive oil money shot truly this is high cognition anon
  gastronomy is fucking pretentious  you know this because for you it would be you are not a member of the socioeconomic class that is the audience for gastronomie so a guy like you claiming to appreciate it would be pretense if you walked into a restaurant on this level youd stick out like a sore thumb and it would be obvious to everyone that you do not belong there those people are not your peers they live in a different world than the one you inhabit and have already become jaded to things that will never be within your reach stick to gaming he buffet to get your moneys worth because thats where you belong
  lol have you ever seen a gastrofag be fed scratch home cooking i had a guy devour almost an entire pan of cornbread once he kept demanding to know what my secret was he put a fair dent in everything else too ive no idea where he put it all
  implying gastronomy by which im guessing you mean fine dining cookery is just about looks    the amount of work that goes into some of that food to make it as delicious as humanly possible is insane in addition food can be really enhanced by presentation tell me youve never seen a plate of food going by in a restaurant or somewhere and thought damn that looks delicious
  just because you appreciate places with michelin stars doesnt mean youre immune to good home cooking or even delicious street food the thing is that people usually associate with members of their own socioeconomic class and someone near the top who can easily afford to eat in fine dining places often is simply unlikely to encounter much in the way of home cooking or street food for that matter because nobody in his peer group is a home cook they all have nice kitchens and some have personal chefs but they dont do any cooking themselves not did their parents home cooking is exotic to them
  michelin star restaurants just arent full of those kinds of people any more though they probably used to be but times have changed    in my experience at least half if not more of the dining room in a michelin star place seems to be people who would have saved up for a while to go and its a big event for them     its not wildly expensive to go either you can do a taster menu at a 3 star place for less than 200 no problem
  you might be onto something with that i mean not all fancy joints ive been to have been a waste of money not by a long shot but some really seem to take advantage of people who arent used to find dining like theyll pretend to like it or be afraid to say anything about it they can write crispy poultry medallions on a bed of penne romano served with pomme damour reduction and garlic dill emulsion on the menu and serve bullshit like this for 3000 yes chicken nuggets mac n cheese with ketchup and ranch dressing obviously i am exaggerating but i have seen a fair amount of rip offs the excuse for it i suppose being presentation and the environment you eat it in
  at least half if not more of the dining room in a michelin star place seems to be people who would have saved up for a while to go and its a big event for them  certainly the trend in the 21st century so far has been making fine dining less stuffy and approachable the rise of the celebrity chef certainly helped that along but id still say when talking about 3 star restaurants and others in that price range the cost of entry kind of assures an exclusive crowd places like masa and per se are not full of punters celebrating their tenth anniversaries theyre full of rich people celebrating special occasions
  there are a lot of restaurants out there that arent going to get a star or even get close but still charge high prices lots of places where youre probably going to pay at least 50 for 3 course a la carte i used to go to them and they are ok but having been to quite a few i now avoid them doesnt feel like good value for money as they really arent memorable i prefer to save the money and use it to go somewhere really good even if it is double the price      im certainly not rich have a reasonable income but also a lot of debt ive eaten at places like restaurant gordon ramsay dinner by heston le gavroche amongst others avoid the drinks and it isnt too expensive i was 21 when i went to ramsays and the food for one cost twice the amount my suit cost
  when i went to ramsays and the food for one cost twice the amount my suit cost  you might not have realized it but you probably did stand out as the guy in the cheap suit then
  probably and i remember before i booked that i wasnt sure if going to a 3 star place was a bit out of my league     turns out no one is really that interested in the people around them when they are paying that much for food and have been on a waiting list for up to 3 months and also its not something to be bothered about  it might affect other peoples day but it doesnt matter to me what they think     the trend seems to be away from pretentiousness and towards a more welcoming environment in these places the most expensive places i know in the uk are about 300 for the food thats far too much for me but there are plenty of amazing places where you can get a taster menu for half that
  most important thing about food is its flavor  so how disgustingly fat are you 350 400
  the trend seems to be away from pretentiousness and towards a more welcoming environment in these places  absolutely it is the focus has shifted much more toward hospitality than exclusivity across the business but in places where there are lots of wealthy people the cost of entry kind of enforces exclusivity anyways the tasting menu at masa is nearly 750 and per se just over 650 these places are not packed with middle class diners
  gastronomie  jesus
  yeah im not sure we have anywhere that expensive in the uk at that point youve probably priced them out     nice for those who can afford it especially when they dont have to be surrounded by the lowly middle classes
  are you seriously arguing that the most important thing about food isnt flavour that really isnt some controversial opinion only the morbidly obese adhere to how out of touch are you do you really think youre doing something important putting a couple twigs on a plate jesus christ
  america has some stupid ass memes luckily theres also a ton of undiscovered gems that serve high end fine dining for 50 and under an entree and affordable appetizers and small plates
  nice for those who can afford it especially when they dont have to be surrounded by the lowly middle classes  like i said people are most comfortable around members of the same social class they are the guy in the bespoke suit and john lobb shoes isnt all that likely to feel comfortable surrounded by guys in jeans converse and thrift store blazers he knows his shoes cost more than the monthly rent of those around him and he really doesnt belong at the hip place with the up and coming chef and the relatively affordable menu his peers are at the place with the stratospherically expensive wine list where his peers sometimes show off dropping thousands on wine
  are you seriously arguing that the most important thing about food isnt flavour  nutrition fatty its nutrition    so youre 400 arent you
  i thought like this till i actually went to a place that had a 9 course tasting menu
  only a faggot with bad genes would say that youre either a former fat or a current self loathing fat hence the automatic fat hating rage if youve never been fat you dont even think about that shit you just eat what tastes good in a moderate portion fatty
  people go out to eat because of that sweet nutrition which they can totally not get eating home  im bony as an auschwitz survivor m8 and dont act like you care about nutrition when youre a faggot that gets all his protein from jizz
    400 it is got it    get help fatty
  if someone served you the most delicious ice cream but you had to eat it by having someone dip their erect penis into the ice cream and then into your mouth it would be pretty hard to say the most important thing about food is its flavor    yeah flavor is important but theres plenty of things/reasons why you eat food  i mean nobody is vegan because cashew cheese secretly tastes really good  nobody eats mcdonalds because its the best tasting food anyone could ever buy    yes flavor is important but food is more than just flavor
  the prices are getting out of control a couple of years ago 3 star restaurants were under 300
  seems like youre projecting bro
  you sound like my fat boomer mom
  
    how do people even get this much money man crazy anyhow is the taste of the shit theyre buying truly worth the price
  enjoys eating a dish because the dish tastes good  enjoys eating a dish because the dish looks good  enjoys the dish  t autist who hates people who enjoy things
  i am a chef with gastronomy incorporated and i tell you gastronomy is not bullshit
  anything can be art if you make art with it
    nice pic
  literally the only important thing about art is how it looks
  its called the culinary arts its a fact
 op  the dressing of a plate is probably more important to the cook than to the person who eats try cooking for the enjoyment of it and for others than you to enjoy youll see how you cant help but to try to lay out your ingredients properly and add little visual enhancements when it is not for the sole purpose of subsistence cooking is a multidimensional pleasure and the dressing is part of it
  took me too long to write this post  mfw my lunch is over cooked
  food is not art    not the way you make it maybe
how do normies not know how to cook    like just google a recipe like just follow the basic stepbystep instructions hahah
  i was afraid to use milk in my cooking till i was like 16 true story
  true story
  also why is this thread stickied
  i feel like youre trying to be funny but thats unironically true literally just follow any well put together cooking instructions and it will turn out as it should
  this i rarely cook and even i dont fuck stuff up it should taste good but lacking at minimum like when you actually learn to cook you make something and learn from it improve someone less initiated wont do that and thats where mastery comes in but the food should turn out okay
  why is this sticky
  this its fucking true and even if you are too dumb to read and follow a recipe there are many cooking channels or even cooking apps that guide you step by step its like you have to intentionally fuck up for it to be bad
  uhh thats expensive good food costs more you cant make cheap food taste good and thats the issue
  literally just follow any well put together cooking instructions    how do you tell those from the bad instructions if you as op mentioned dont know how to cook    you can tell i can tell can normie mcfuckstick    cooking is like all other skills much easier to get started on if theres somebody practiced to guide you through the start and help cover for your inevitable initial fuckups
im a babby who just follows recipes i like  i have no idea how to make shit of my own  i like to adjust things by increasing the amount of spices for curries because only pussies seem to write curry recipes online  how do i get started actually cooking
when did you stop
  baking potatoes  never  baked potatoes a delicious
  never started didnt grow up trashy
  i only ever use it for potato stuff and as a bbq sauce base
i took the aioli pill 4 years ago
  as a kid i harbored an autistic hatred of tomatoes so never ate ketchup now it makes sense as i only had access to shitty midwestern watery bags of sand and not real tomatoes still hate ketchup because adding sugar to savory things is generally gross
  ketchup on steak is gross tomato and chilli jam however works just fine
it looks like there is a space between the words and the question marks/exclamation marks in that ad was this normal in american english at the time i have only ever seen it in written french
ketchup is fucking disgusting shit for fat people that are hard wired to fucking love sugar
fuck you retarded niggers spaghetti and ketchup is goat
tomato catsup  spicy    an ad for white people by white people
  catsup  spicy  this is what neanderthals actually believe
    this ad is over 60 years old back then ketchup had things like allspice and mustard seed and spicy doesnt refer to hear but the use of actual spices
the only place around me that delivers is dominos and ill often get it 23 times a week do you think they find this annoying
  i bet youre the dumb one in your family
  yes the main goal of any business is to serve as few customers as possible
as a delivery driver i definitely judge the people who i see multiple times per week except for the little old ladies they are sweet   sometimes ill get curious about a customer and look them up online/social media
  no but the drivers will start to know you and refer to you among the other characters that order often if you tip well and dont cause any fuss youll probably start to get better service even
  obviously the business overall likes it i just wonders if the workers and servers find it annoying    i tip 15 in this day and age i hope thats enough 20 seems high
  why would they find it annoying its better to deliver to a known place than an unknown one that could be full of crackheads or whatever as long as you tip if you are in america and arent a dick they probably wouldnt mind or even prefer it
  if youre not a dick and dont have odd requests with every order they prolly wont give a shit
  i used to be a delivery driver if youre under 10 minutes away from the place just tip at least 2 i will be indifferent instead of hoping you die in your sleep if you live 15 minutes or more away from somewhere they shouldnt be accepting deliveries from you but some places are jews and hate their drivers so they will but anyway if you live 15 minutes or more away i hate you and 100 fuck with your food every time unless you tip like 10
  how old are you 
  edgy underage detected the only workers ive ever seen fuck with food were dindus all three got fired and two were arrested no normal delivery driver or ff worker does that kind of shit
    t never delivered food
  t underage child    i didnt fuck with anything when i worked for dominos the worse thing that might happen if someone didnt tip is that i did their house last
  can you share some stories i bet you did some naughty stuff with peoples food  this is why i never order food from home
  that behavior is pretty fucked up dude
  do you have low selfesteem
  i deserve 15 an hour
call pizza place  ah hi anon same as usual
  i just wonders if the workers and servers find it annoying  its only annoying when you dont tip or live in a gated residence without giving us a way in and then go complain about how we were late     t former delivery driver
  when you get delivery you should be tipping for mostly distance and not for the amount of food
do they get mad at special instructions
  what would be the point of fucking with dominos can you make it any worse
  be honest how fat are you
  uhhh no this time ill get 2 meatlovers large and uhhhmmm a 2 liter dr pepper hehe for delivery ok bye thanks
whats your favorite knives to use /ck/  pic related my set
  based offset serrated knife user
  how about buying some socks before ever taking another photo of anything again
all i see is meme knives poor effort op
my kiwi vegetable cleaver best 10 ever spent
im a big wusthof fan
  mirin that chinese cleaver im guessing you use the thick german chefs knife for breaking down chickens and racks and the cleaver is just for fine cutting
  at least invest in a decent steel anon  jesus have some respect for your meme jap blades
  the two knives i use the most are a victorinox fibrox 8 chefs knife and a w√ºsthof 7 santuko  i also have a w√ºsthof 8 chefs knife which is great and all but the problem is the bolster extends all the way down to the heel so after a few years of use and sharpening the blade doesnt make solid contact with the cutting board because the thick bolster which cannot be sharpened with conventional sharpening tools protrudes slightly past the blade  very bad design feature not sure why they continue to do it
  i use my 270mm gyuto for 90 of the time i carry a pairing knife just in case although almost never use it and a 6 utility as well for boning things and other more finicky tasks a couple kuhn rikon veg peelers and backup blades since these always seem to go missing and a couple plating spoons
    hello friendo
does anyone else stand in the bathroom mirror with their favourite kitchen knife to see if it suits them
  this is what happened to me too the first chef knife i bought had that full bolster    never again that is fucking plebtier shit
  do people really cook with opinels i just bought a carbon steel one and its nice but i would rather just use a paring knife if im in the kitchen      i love the full bolster for pinch gripping and i think its a great knife but i did recently start sharpening on a waterstone and now i see what a pain it is whats the solution once you sharpen away too much of the edge are you supposed to grind off the bolster until its flush again or what    i fucking hate santokus maybe its just because i had a bad experience with a shitty one my parents had when i first started cooking but what are those stubby tall pieces of shit even good for that a chef knife cant do better
i have a 270mm carbon steel gyutou coming in the mail anything i should know before i start using my first weeb knife i already know to be anal about wiping it off so it doesnt rust but im more worried about the 70/30 edge and how im supposed to not fuck that up the first time i sharpen it
my usual go to for most cutting i made this knife myself from scratch i tried to design it to meet as many of my needs in the kitchen as possible the handle is zircote if you havent tried making a knife i highly recommend it the process of highly gratifying this piece makes my store bought knives feel as sharp as bricks
  these kiwis are beasts for the prices
knives are 100 metal rather than having wooden or composite handles  my smallest one has a knick in it  it hurts my little boy
  can anyone give recommendations on a nice skillet i know its off topic but i dont think it deserved its own thread
  i used a 4 knife from target for years it dulled quick recently upgraded to a victorinox 8 chefs knife which is much beefier and doesnt dull as quick
  those are great and cheap they sharpen up easily too but the do just get wrecked after a while bent etc  especially if youre near a restaurant supply like kamei in sf  id buy several every 23 years and eventually replace them
  i only need to use three knives
  why are they so curved up
  german style knives typically have a bolster what you need is french or japanese style chefs knife
  theyre all curved up because theyre designed for meat filleting trimming and deboning
soras were my first knives that i got about two years back the gyuto is a yoshikane clad w2 thats no longer in production cleaver is a dexter used mostly for various gourds and breaking down chickens
  nope now days i even see it of bastardized versions of santoku knives
    this post has convinced me i made the right decision in buying zwilling pro
  the three on the left are all i ever use
  sorry i meant the three on the right
  i pretty much use a santoku for everything
  because they are fully erect
  looks like every single one of those knives is a cheap piece of crap
  i took a cruise to alaska and saw this at the gift shop and i dont know how to cook  does anybody buy those to actually use them
  yea all the shit ones in the front i put in the drawers for the flatmates to use  i put them on a whetstone every now and then so theyre sharper than they look like they should be  the set at the back is what i use though they dont live in the knife drawer
  dont you have a rotary tool or even a metal file and a couple of minutes
  when i lived in alaska my apartment came with one it was the only knife i had for a few weeks they are ok
whats the deal with all the fucking cleavers
  no i have knives that dont have a retarded thick heel bolster in the first place  a metal file would not do the job in a few minutes any sort of home grinding will make the knife look like shit  
  hestan nanobond
  in the second part he cleaned it up with a rotary tool 
  we eat vegetables sometimes
  and why do you need a fucking cleaver for eating vegetables
  based kiwi poster
  i use my opinel for personal knife tasks like sampling fruit or cheese its my special personal sampling knife
  love the tank of a handle looks like a very sturdy all purpose shit kicker
  he never cuts bone   wheres your cleaver mr butcher
  how much was the dexter
  useful for chopping bone and gourds/squashes
  end product looks like shit look at the sort of slob who does this
  my main knives for work    left to right  takeda nas gyuto 250mm  kujira handforged iron damascus clad gyuto 240mm  masakage koishi as kobunka 130mm  fujiwara maboroshi w1 gyuto     not pictured is my suji its downstairs on my sharpening bench and i was too lazy to go get it
  closeup of the iron damascus on the kujira
  i just use stamped wuhstof  nice jb prince towel
  you probably shouldnt bother when it looks blurry as shit
  pay a professional to sharpen it
  yeah regrettably my phone camera is fucked so the photo is done by my shitty tablet it turned out even worse than i thought in all honesty but i guess it gets the point across
  chances are the socalled professional will be even more clueless than the owner anon most of the people who sharpen knives for a living just slap anything on a fast belt sander deburr on a wheel if youre lucky and boom theyre done
  trimming and cutting meat    i have a saw for bone using a cleaver causes the bone to fragment and leaves pieces in the meat nobody wants to be picking bone chips out of a bite of steak
  are you a butcher or just a person
  wheres the fun in that hand sharpening is comfy
  thank you yeah that was the goal and i love how it turned out big handles make such a difference in usability
  meat cutter my store doesnt do full butching
this is my vg 10 damascus clad yoshihiro i like that it has a combination of western and eastern features my next knife im looking to get is a proper paring knife i use a cheap hefty walmart chefs knife to break down raw meats because i figure its basically disposable someone in the thread mentioned having a proper saw for going through bone and i like that idea would a small band saw be ideal
  either you have a handsaw or you use a table saw that is more adapted to dealing with meat bits and not wood/metal bits and using a chefs knife for breaking down subprimals is pretty shittier a victorinox breaking knife are under 30 bucks and unless you use it for 3040 hours a week like me will outlive half your kitchen
  victornix breaking knife is less than 30  thanks for the tip i dont find my way mart knife particularly enjoyable enjoyable to use
  being barefooted is comfy though you pleb
this thread hurts the bong
  table saws are going to throw shit far and wide band saws are the appropriate tool
  do people really cook with opinels  i use my number 9 as a paring knife pretty often it just cuts so well
  table saw  point corrected i was meaning band saw because holy shit a radial blade would have my room looking like a friday the 13th movie in seconds
  those bargain club chef katabas  the club chef steel  the cheap bread knife you probably stole from front of house  i hope you dont actually use those    nice cleaver though
  big handles make such a difference in usability    if you hold the knife in a proper pinch grip the size shape and texture of the handle actually matter very little
  i have the same yanagiba but mine has the caligraphy on the other side its nice but i havent owned it very long not a true yanagiba since it doesnt have the concave grind but still good for sushi    i rarely use it though my main knife is a victorinox fibrox
  the grip someone use should change with the work to be done anon
  yet having a heavier handle changes the balance of the knife
i use a honing steel on my chef knife pretty much every time i use it i just bought a carbon steel gyutou am i not supposed to hone it do i just not do anything except sharpen once every few months
  you can steel your carbn steel knife just as well as a stainless steel one just remember that the steel is supposed to realign the bent/folded edeg of an already sharp knife most steels you can buy or that come with knife sets work more like files that produce a horrible jagged edge that doesnt last long and fucks up your knife over time get a microgrooved or smooth steel or at least take the sharp edges off an ordinary steel with fine sandpaper if those dont restore sharpness sufficiently anymore it is time to take the knife to the stones
  oh wait i didnt see that you said gyuto if you have a knife with really hard japanese steel 59hrc you should indeed abstain from steeling it you need stones then
only knives you ever need
  babbys first nife set
  to have become so neet and autistic that you need color coded knives that will only ever be used to open stubborn boxes of tendies
  masakage koishi  nicetiff
  then why do you have 4
  i have two 8 breaking knives one is dedicated to the beef table and the other is for the other meat station for cutting pork or fish
  cuddling with qt314  she asks to see pictures of my holiday home  sees the thumbnails of my knife posing  anon why do you have so many pictures of you posing with knives she sounds concerned  try to explain that your knife choice is very important and go into visceral detail about how the weight needs to feel right in the hand and it needs to match your personality  she gets increasingly nervous tells you she needs to leave  you offer to show her your knives  shes panicking fumbling at the door  come out of the kitchen with knives in hand tell her to look at you and see how sharp the edges are  she starts screaming  stop being weird anon
  youre a knifewear boi too
  knaifu  gf
been using this knife for nearly every home prep mostly vegetables work for 6 years i had it sharpened by the makers yoshihiro company 2 years after i bought it switched to a better cutting board and now its been 4 years since the sharpening and its still going strong yeah it has memebumbs and memelines but meh i like how it looks and i like taking good care of it has served me well
  i like mine so far too anon had mine for 6 months glad to hear yours is going stronk
  nice hah im pretty sure that is the one i almost got instead of the one i did being american myself i was really close to getting the western style handle too but i thought fuck it and went with the eastern style since id never tried it before and it was a good opportunity to do so its a great knife for sure chop your stuff up on a decent board wipe the blade clean slip it back into the wood case gold stays sharp for many years
  jesus you can see the chips in the blade already
  beef table
  mai knaifu
    more likely some minor fuckup in the factory the steel of those knives is way too soft to chip i have the top three knives and while they do cut pretty well mostly due to them being really thin behind the bevel the grip is uncomfortable and the top knife have a weird shape  too much belly for chopping or push/pull cutting too short and tip too low for rock chopping sure you can get stuff cut with them but it just doesnt feel like it works well
  2 years before sharpening  4 years since sharpening  anon you either cook once a year or your knife is blunt as fuck
  ran
  ruuuuuuu
  nah i drive past them every night on the way to taco bell
i made ramen broth from a nugget of flavor powder i got in my bag of doritos   thoughts
how was it what size nug are we talking
  eating dorritos  eating ramen  consuming gforce
dorito ramen and naan bread    dinner of champions op god bless
that moment when you choose the healthy and nutritional food option  how the fuck do i lose weight when so much healthy food tastes so bad
  eat less masturbate more
you dont eat just healthy food  thats a one way ticket to bingetown  you cut the shitty food in half and eat some low cal sides with it also stop drinking soda or booze
  what did you eat an uncooked leek
  your palate will adjust to healthier foods if you keep eating them
you can do keto and the weight will literally melt off  youll lose 2030 lbs a month    spoiler and youll gain it all back the second you stop keto /spoiler
  what are you eating that tastes bad
  it is about calories you could eat twinkies and lose weight if you ate less calories than you use
one thing i can promise you is that if you go without sugar or junk food for long enough your tastes change and fruits will taste sweeter and you will be able to taste veggies and meats better and appreciate them more stay strong op tomorrows health is more important than todays indulgences
  based and trollpilled
  stop fucking eating just fast you dumb nigger you have enough fat on your belly alone to feed a family of 5 for a year you dont need to eat
  what healthy foods taste bad faggot
  what is seasoning  a good balance of herbs will take you a long way
  ketotards are getting very obnoxious  it doesnt help that like 95 of you fuckers are/were obese  i dont dispute that you might be able to lose weight by eating like that  thing is you blame grains and starches for being fat fucks when its your absolute lack of self control and discipline that brought you there  just do your fucking meme diet or whatever else help you avoid exercising and let normal people eat whatever they want please read fat fuck / normal
  how the fuck do i lose weight when so much healthy food tastes so bad  maybe when your realize that healthy foods taste so bad because your taste buds and brain have been tricked by all the shit foods you eat to believe that the abnormally high levels of salt/sugar/fat they use is normal its not its fucking abnormal    recondition your taste buds by cutting out all the processed bullshit you eat and drink and consume only things you make yourself when you start to appreciate the natural sweetness of fruits again and soda is too sweet then youll be on the right path again
  grain brain isnt normal either you dont even know how foggy your mind is because youve never known anything else
  yes just think of all those great keto thinkers of history we would be colonizing alpha centauri by now if not for that pesky bread
  all of them name one 1 good tasting healthy food
  the only thing that clogs your mind is the fat in you belly that stretches your blood vessels and takes blood away from your head  not to mention your stomach drawing blood constantly to digest all the shit you eat all the time
  name one 1 good tasting healthy food  all of them
  they are palatable once you balance the healthy tastes with fat and excess salt
  they are palatable once you  grow the fuck up and accept that food is fuel and not something you do for entertainment
  banish yourself to /fit/ please
  banish yourself to /redddit/ please
  fuck off mealprepper
  mealprepper  nope try again pumpkin
  since i do a lot of sports i can eat 30004000 kcal/day and still loose weight despite beeing a manlet  my weight is 130 lbs at this point
  it stands to reason that if you only eat for fuel that you meal prep youre inefficient and retarded
  i have nothing relevant to add so ill just double down on my incorrect accusation again  were done here fatty
fruit smoothies
  i got cornered and realized that i dont even believe my food is only fuel bullshit   at least stick your convictions asshat
  it tastes bad only because you dont know how to cook and you dont know whats actually healthy and unhealthy
  based    get occupied stop finding joy in food or enjoy eating no calorie options
  just like with any diet the preachers are all fat people who have done it either for a few weeks or intermittently to the point of ineffectiveness for years and are fantasising about the idea of it actually working/ justifying their emotional investment in it
  what are spices  whats knowing how to actually prepare good meals  whats realizing you dont need a fuck load of salt and sugar for food to taste good  just go back to whatever you were shoving into your face cause youre not going to make it
  sugar is a culinary spice
  its true though you would hate your life and be hungry all the time but you could do it
  beans and lentils are delicious also soups from homemade stocks are nutritious and taste amazing
  beans and lentils are delicious  only with added fat of pork if youre not adding a hock to your beans then they are shit
        these guys are giving some good advice its just a shame that their efforts and well intentions were wasted on a shitpost
  aaaaahchoo
  remove all added salt and sugar from your diet your tastes buds are currently retarded
so apparently these exist anyone tried them yet
  why do the dumpling wrappers look like theyre made out of a transparent garbage bag
  they dont youre just being a bitch    looks interesting for an instant food foreign ones usually do
  i might head by the korean shop if im in that part of town today and pick some up if they have them or at least ask if they can score some
  terrible like all processed chinky foods
  willingly giving money to immigrants
  why not they hate blacks jews and the chinese almost as much as i do
korean again
  you dont know that he could live in a korea
all the best frozen korean mandu are rectangular
  i live in bulgaria
    cringe and /pol/pilled
  over here they only stock the jiaozi shaped ones
i get my dumpling from chiantown handmade
  you had better understand that there are far more of us than you had initially thoughtyou are the minority
  nah youre just the loud retards
  those are still good honestly its hard to go wrong with frozen fried dumplings i just prefer the rectangles also i always fry up the whole bag at once so i can enjoy cold mandu the next day
  i live in korea where there are 43724 different kinds of frozen mandu all are meh
  willingly giving money to immigrants  fucking nigger    its made in sth korea
i made these yesterday wontons are harder to pleat than i thought any tips
  look gof
the real question to fry or to steam
    both
  for me its steam/boil usually
  explain
    steamfry    fry the bottoms nice and crispy in some oil  add some water carefully like covering bottom third of dumplings or so maybe a lil less if they arent frozen  cover for 610 minutes  remove lid and swirl lightly around the pan until all the water is evaporated
  610 is a long time in the pan how high are you cooking i use chicken broth to fry and everything is evaporated/dumplings are cooked in about five minutes at max on high
    i dont have things on max no  i dont use so aggressive a boil when im coverin it to steam mostly it just needs time to get to the frozen center
  ohh i was talking about homemade dumplings my center is usually room temperature that makes sense then
  huh
where do you even buy this
cooking anything from frozen seems so wrong to me
  somewhere on the other side of the ocean
  this brand sure is popular huh my zoomer siblings are crazy for the original spicy instant ramen
  this
eating imported gookshit
  theyre more gummy from a glutenous rice flour than a bready opaque wheat flour and dryer because theyre steamed
  eating imported gookshit    no you dont have to nigger    nobody is forcing you shitposter
  looks good anon i made wontons before my plan was to make dumpling but i didnt realise the wrappers i bought were squares
this is the ideal start to a day you may not like it but this is what peak breakfast looks like
funny i just saw the episode of netflixs the final table where this dish is featured even made a reaction image because of this guys sheer horror when they tell him his english breakfast was shite
  only if you work a heavy labor job or dont plan on eating the rest of the day
  there are smaller portions for children but you have to be 18 to post on this site lad
  i saw that the only team that didnt overthink it and actually just produced a very well made but normal full english actually did the best in general i dont like the show though its all a bit over the top and dramatic and staged cant watch american reality tv not as engaging as master chef the proffesionals
  not as engaging as master chef the proffesionals  checked and patrician detected
  i like how they present the big chef as a final boss and he comes out in smoke and light i watch it because of how they spin dishes and the first episode was fairly interesting specially liked how the mexican boss chef was like fuck you and cook with this cactus you fucking amateurs
  ideal  beans for breakfast  nope
do brits actually do this  jesus christ
  they do this is why all their teeth are black and falling out of their head and also why their women are all so fucking hideous
  this thread is too perfect to be true
  british women have huge tits though from all the milk they drink
  i drink a boost for breakfast and an ensure for dessert
  why would you waste time with netflix when you have eighty years of classic film to fall back on im being generous by excluding silents but there are also those
  give me a quick rundown what is all that
  probably because weve already understood the lessons from movies from previous eras no one needs a lecture in how a big red blob represents communism we already know its bad
honestly dont understand why tomatoes are included
  then make something good with those lessons every single thing on netflix is absolute shit
its been 8 years since my last full english   im really fucking craving it unironically looking at flights to london right now
  make your own jeez
  am i a soi boy if i could only eat half of that until it started to get uncomfortable to eat more
  it might be fine in the evening with a 6 pack of beer but in the morning id probably crash on my couch right after also lose the blood sausage
  my one issue with all english breakfasts are beans being on the same plate as everything else beansmake everything they touch also taste of beans eg the beans in op are gonna absolutely ruin the egg they should be served in a separate pot also thats a kinda shitty english breakfast quite a few things are done wrong
  why would you waste time with 4channelorg when you have thousands of years of human knowledge to fall back on im being generous by excluding sumerian scrolls but there are also those
  not him but its almost impossible to get the right bacon  sausages outside of the uk  ireland as for black pudding fucking forget it    in b4 somebody suggests things that are similar to but not the same as the right bacon sausages or black pudding
  whats the shit on the blood sausage rice cakes
  do you also sip maple sizzurp
  lol
  mmmm full scottish breakfast i coud do some right now yeah thats a big portion as well o much bigger than spoons    pretty sure its haggis
  praying praying for the moment in time when people stop putting these weird sharpness filters on food where the edges glow and it looks like a nauseous blur
  what is this retarded post even netflix has thousands of movies on it with plenty of classic ones    why do you go to the grocery store when there are plenty of classic vegetables out there
  white pudding
  its called hdr
  my favorite cat food with crackers
  looks like a slop o shit
  fucking retard we hate popular things because they suck not because theyre popular netflix is literally just a fucking streaming service that hosts those classic films youre referencing in your own stupid little post
  t 20 stone
  change those beans to refried pinto beans the blood pudding to mexican chorizo the back bacon to belly bacon the toast to tortillas and ill agree with you oh and change the warmass ale to an ice cold modelo and ill give you a big fat kiss
  huehuehuehuehuehuehue
  clockwise from the beginning of the top left quadrant  sausages  2 slices of black pudding and 2 slices of what looks like either white pudding haggis or lorne suasage  looks like bubble and squeak with is like hash browns  back bacon  steaky bacon  2 fried eggs in the middle  mushrooms  tomatoes  baked beans    wala
gotta admit i really want to try one never had blood sausage but everything always looks delicious in these and i love mushrooms with breakfast stuff
  so make one
  i dont have a kitchen only a microwave
  make a kitchen
  doesnt posess the means to properly cook food  you an abbo or something
  im in the military im basically provided with a hotel room to live in and theres a place near me i can eat for free from
  gets cold before you even finish a third of it
  if i was like 400 pounds then i could eat that plate
  this is what you pray for try something more important nerd
  sounds comfy desu  or is it like martin sheen in apocalypse now
reminder that this is a huge challenge portion and most people would only eat half this amount and even then most people dont eat this every day anymore  looks good quality though very nice would share with the waifu
  it gets old real fast
  getting soft
  ironic
   you wanna bet your corn syrup stewed life on that mutt
i honestly feel more energized in the morning when i eat a breakfast like this i know its probably terrible for you but i just cant stand waking up to fucking oats
  our teeth are fine but our women are mostly creatures 1 out of 2
  this is just way too many calories
  you must first invent the solar system to make a kitchen from scratch
  kek
  summerians had clay tablets not scrolls
  i bet it is but who actually has the patience to cook anything before work
nope
  everything is fine except for the blood sausage
how does someone eat all that sausage wont that give you a heart attack
  ten thousand years ive searched it seems and now  gotta get to you  but i dont know how
  thats why you go down the caf lad
  it would take me the whole day to recover from eating that grease pile
  not liking blood sausage
  looks pretty tidy i would swap the mushrooms out for some chips
i cannot imagine even being in the same room as that plate of shit even the stench of bong fodder is disgusting
  i got so jeeved at the british chef who had such a blatant herpes outbreak i cant believe the judges all ate the food hed cooked and tasted
  surprisingly enough the components of that plate is not exclusively eaten in england  the more you know
how does anyone get anything done after this breakfast  arent you in digestion throughout the entire morning    for me its a plain black coffee
  there is plenty of fibre in this dish are you blind
  no one eats portions this big itll be 2 slices of toast one egg couple sausages couple rashers of bacon beans few shroomies not for me maybe 1 grilled tomato and one bit of blood pudding  sometimes a hashbrown or two
  only one egg  what a let down
  ctrlf hockey  0 results
my breakfast was  3 eggs  bowl of oatmeal  orange  milk  is that not good
  fiiill my mouth  rrreeeasons for me to bite you
  is that two types of bacon looks like 3 rasher streaky and 3 rasher back bacon to me
  idk i just coffee and toast with some peanut butter

  not strictly applicable but it upsets me that at places like starbucks every normal/rudimentary food ingredient needs to have some bullshit descriptor    its not bacon its double smoked bacon  its not bread its artisan bread  its not eggs its cage free eggs    fuck off seriously
  but the libtards lap this shit up   its not going anywhere ever unfortunately
  this  farm fresh milk  imported fairtrade coffee/cocoa/cacao  sustainable sourced fish  himalayan pink salt
  and served with xs famous fries  literally just normal fucking fries    why do this whenever these chain restaurants try to make things seem signature it just emphasizes the soullessness of the restaurant id prefer they just improve their dishes instead of creating a brand
  none of those are words they are all phrases pathetic you are totally illiterate from my perspective
  illiterate  noun  1  a person who is unable to read or write    good work
  kale and quinoa
  pic  bread with holes big like that annoys me
  you
  organic  halal  vegan friendly  or the one i eat a lot of  institution use only
  famous fudge  easy cheesy baked potatoes
  turkey  heh
whats the issue with fish of the day  i live in a coastal town and the small restaurant i often go to usually has this since they just buy whatever fish the fishermen caught in the morning and use it its always fresh fish that was still swimming few hours ago and not some shit that they delivered from abroad and has been frozen for weeks
  theres nothing wrong with any of those descriptors except perhaps deconstructed op is just frustrated he doesnt have enough money to visit a restaurant other than mcdicks
  rustic
  i tought this was a meal plan and was exited    deconstructed is the the answer to the fact that you cant innove that much in cooking anymore
  homemade
  you are retarded these are all different and better products    why are you bitching that normie restaurants are trying to serve better food
famous / award winning wings  famous / award winning ribs   the amount of places ive seen that shit on a menu
  himalayan pink salt    take that back right now
all those words have a specific meaning and are useful to describe products and dishes
  its literally just salt that is pink due to some impurities its no different culinarily from regular white salt you literally pay more for it because it looks pretty
  locally sourced
  deconstructed makes it sound like it was constructed and they took it apartwould it be as popular if they called it by a more accurate name unconstructed probably not
  artisan anything  especially if its at like a fast food resto or something where they absolutely definitely are not hiring artisan master craftsman to handcraft each product fuck off mcdonalds you lying bastards    there are people who work hard their whole lives for the privilege to call their product artisan and that term has just been fucking ruined for them
  lets say you go and buy a deconstructed hamburger youre paying more so the restaurant can hand you a plate with half a bun a patty and one leaf of lettuce with a tiny smear of ketchup on one end wa fucking la    and despite all this these people eat it up i dont get it
  hey i have herseys chocolate should i just call it chocolate    not too sharp there bud
  well the idea is that you can adjust the quantities and combos as you eat it should keep the meal more interesting and interactive    but i agree its kind of a ripoff especially since most eateries really exploit of the cost savings opportunity and you end up paying more for less material and less work ideally with a deconstructed meal you should get more variety and options in place of reduced quantity of individual components    one nice thing is that almost categorically you can expect ingredient quality to be higher with a deconstructed meal they cannot rely on masking subpar ingredients with each other since it is expected that the customer will be trying the components on their own
  umami  foodie  mouthfeel  fast casual  artisanal  notes of flavor  buddha bowl  choice of protein just say meat you pretentious asshat
gluten free  its not even made with fucking wheat
  foodie is the worst
  i sincerely hope someone made a good screencap of that thread
  what the actual fuck is a buddha bowl image search just shows mishmash salad/wok shit in a bowl
  protein     im about to snap
  choice of protein just say meat you pretentious asshat    what if they have tofu on the menu what then fucker
vegan beef  our local californian carolinan cowboy king racho rodeo smokin hog tyin country city burger with cheese  supreme  queso  mongolian
just like mom used to make
  should be called unassembled
i fucking hate the du jour shit we serve pasta of the day which actually is fresh made pasta but in two types two different sauces and 4 toppings ill have the pasta of the day aight cunt spaghetti or fusilli pesto or pomodori any spinach of mushrooms   also our fish of the day is always the one thats closest to turning
  our fish of the day is always the one thats closest to turning  thats every restaurants of the day items     theres a reason most soup du jour has a stock base its all the meat that was going to sour the day before
  like mom used to make  mom is dead  makes me cry every time
  maybe they should get the word protected by law like some professional positions do     fuck artisan branding seriously
  go to the grocery store and see random ass products like steaks and heads of romaine lettuce  gluten free  the retard fads have finally found the rural midwest
  umami    its just salt dumbass
lava salt
  fish of the day  legitimate if a store buys fish every single day  a la carte  things that are extra to a dish are considered a la carte  farm to table  this is good if a restaurant is buying ingredients from local providers    otherwise good list
fish of the day and not catch of the day  fish of the day is just whatever fish theyre featuring and its usually the fish thats going to fucking expire so they can cut their losses catch of the day means it was fucking caught that day or rather it does if the restaurant has any credibility whatsoever and isnt just using it as a catchy line it should be obvious ie is there a fish market in your town so its actually fresh
  people with ciliac disease  fad
  farm to table  i agree its just the restaurants that claim it even if its obvious bullshit ie mcdonalds    catch of the day is fine    managers special makes me cringe as its usually a shitty unpopular dish and they want to move an expiring product  maybe theres room for  managers special fish of the day  that would get some autists seething  also this thread needs more hubby posting  hubbys meal was so big he could barely finish
  most people who eat gluten free do not have celiacs which only affects about 1 of the population in the us theyre mostly just trend following retards who think its the hip healthy thing to avoid gluten
  managers special fish soup du jour
  i sometimes find the fish of the day to be quite nice but places around here usually have fresh fish and do change the fish of the day daily places that do this are good though some places cheap out or are shit and they usually have bad food around any way
        are you legit upset about shit from a decade ago
  dude these are flyovers theyve just heard these terms in the last week or so and suddenly feel inferior
  i love french just recently learned that the word fiancee comes from the french term financier makes sense
  gourmet  hand made
  what if they have tofu on the menu  then you get up and leave thats the point retard
  everything later than the 90s feels recent to me youll probably get that way too when youre older
  the impurity is rust but himalayan rusty salt doesnt sound as good
  but lots of chink restaurants offer tofu as a protein choice
  i get chinese food delivered when im at work reasonably often and ive never seen the menus for the ones by me use the phrase choice of protein its usually just beef chicken or shrimp and if theres a tofu dish that gets its own entry somewhere else on the menu in any event theres no reason to say choice of protein when what you mean is your choice of meat with some shitty vegetarian alternative also available
  the fuck youre talking about fiancee come from the french fianc√©e since its the same word with the same meaning
  im like 99 sure that when it comes to produce being gluten free it has to do with the pesticides used on them and shit some of which apparently contain gluten hence gluten free produce being a thing and with meat a lot of time wheat is used as a filler use google you dumb shit     also  retard fad  i mean it is a retarded fad but also some people have celiacs and shit
  my friend with celiacs loves it he described it as the first time hes had pancakes in 10 years
  but pancakes are shit
  use google you dumb shit  how can you google something you just pulled out of your ass     im like 99 sure  you made it up dont lie to me
  the shit  fixd
old world style  wtf is that supposed to mean
  mouthfeel  im still mad however many years later with how utterly redundant and pretentious that word is
  its hersheys not chocolate  mic drops
  shrimp isnt meat
  i dont understand why that word took the place of the word texture which describes the same thing and also doesnt make you sound like a five year old
  this was actually a pretty good burger from what i remember it was the only decent thing on the menu along with the chicken tenders
  people are refusing to buy meat thats been fed gluten
  deconstructed is supposed to mean you took the same ingredients and broke them down to use them differently in a traditional dish than you typically would like curing egg yolks and shaving them over the pasta dish instead of making a traditional carbonara the egg is in the dish with everything else you would expect but in a new and modern way it gets misused alot desu
  theres nothing wrong with any of those    eh    artisan bread  makes me suspicious of everything else why call that one out in particular    our famous fries  get fucked either they are famous in which case i already know about your fries and you dont have to waste my time calling them famous or i dont already know about your fries and you seem pathetic as fuck for calling them famous    inhouse bbq sauce  see artisan bread    fish of the day  often completely fine but occasionally you find somebody selling the same fishoftheday every day and at that point just add it to the menu you freaks    managers special  so i can expect if i order something else its worse    a la carte  that ones fine or at least i havent seen it misused    soup du jour  see fish of the day    deconstructed  that ones fine    from the larder  directly a buzzword might as well serve your vegetables from sysco it fucking will has to come from somewhere    farm to table  this one either means was originally from a farm in which case it gives me zero fucking information or it means we bypassed traditional logistics and acquired this from a farm instead of a middle man which means we enjoyed none of the advantages of scale and polluted significantly more than if we got this from a soulless farming corporation in direct contradiction to the green image were trying to project which sets my blood to boiling
  those all mean something other than your garden variety version of the ingredients though
  this is good if a restaurant is buying ingredients from local providers    get your fake green movement off my food board and preferable away from all humanity
  that is a buddah bowl
  the starbucks sous vide egg bites piss me off they are just reheated to rubber in store anyways
  but double smoked bacon is different to regular bacon the taste is not the same i prefer unsmoked bacon cage free eggs also refers to the fact that theyre not buying them from battery farms which is a concern for some people the artisan bread thing is fucking redundant though
  thats right worth the 5000 added cost better ingredients sustainable with eco friendly footprint and green  open up for your greatest allie
  i like to eat shit because sustainable living is a conspiracy
    being actually fluent in french makes visiting /ck/ difficult sometimes
  probably not even bad desu theyd just mcchicken it so theres a clump of lettuce and barely any sauce im sure
  but it is meaty
  100 arabica coffee   grrr
  celiac here  get fucked retard   pesticides dont contain gluten gluten free tags at stores are used to push product onto idiots who dont know better i had to inform a fellow customer the other day that canned tomatoes are gluten free and she didnt believe me bitch i have celiac disease and bloat up like a cattyn fanart if i even get cross contaminated i know whats gf and not  next time youre in a grocery store take a look at what has gluten free tags and what doesnt that is obviously gluten free    the only things people should worry about that arent labeled are chocolate bars and prepackaged nuts cacao beans and nuts usually get processed on equipment coated with wheat to keep them from sticking  eg most planters products and most american chocolate
  i think that anon meant fillers like in sausage and hot dogs of course only cheap meat for poorfags has grain as a filler which is clearly labeled on the back of a product
  yes

  fuck you that movie was iconic
any advice on making crepes i keep getting a texture thats just a little too chewy also i cant make shapes other than eldrich horrors
  dont overwork the batter and stretch the gluten  some lumps are fine  did you have the pan nice and hot and use a minimal layer of batter
  cut half of your milk with water and voila you cant miss your crepes even if you tried
  i must have overworked it because i really went to town trying to get lumps out and yeah the pan was hot and tastefully oiled however using a little bit of batter seems to create ugly shapes i swirl the pan around but it cooks so fast that i cant make a beautiful circle it seems that the only way i can get a beautiful circle is to add enough batter to cover the bottom of the pan
okay well since you guys are pros let me ask another question how long do you let your batter rest before you use it
i normally make the batter then the filling so it just rests for about the time it takes to make the filling but other times when im using a simple filling that doesnt need much prep i let the batter rest for 1530 minutes    my recipe is  3 eggs  125g flour  250ml milk  30g butter melted  pinch of salt if i can remember lol    ofc just the standard crepe method but i tend to do the butter last when everything else is combined  for me its the breville crepe creations but sometimes if i wanna make a lot of crepes fast i do them in a pan you dont need to fully cover the bottom and u dont need a lot of butter either  in the pan i usually put a knob of butter and once the bubbling starts to slow i wipe it around with a paper towel just to get like a nice buttery film on the pan  then i use like 2/3rds  a bit more a ladelfull which measures to about 100ml in a 9 inch pan on high heat  you really have to tilt the pan to spread the batter aswell
  i really went to town trying to get lumps out  make a predough by mixing it with only like 1/2 or 1/3 of the liquid first that makes it easy to get the lumps out because the batter is so thick that the whisk can crush them add the rest of the liquid and the eggs at the end
  not at all any resting time will allow the gluten to develop
  3 eggs  125g flour  what growing up i was always thaugt that 1 egg  100g flour then adjust milk to reach your desired consistency
      this was a good starting point for me atleast the ingredients and measurements adjust to your preference    i usually combine the ingredients using a whisk with minimal mixing and let the batter rest at room temp for atleast an hour at which point the lumps are gone after resting i usually have to add a bit more water or milk and whisk a bit sometimes i dont add any butter because clumps like to form during resting if its not warm enough my pan is usually smoking hot and i flip as soon as it stops sticking to the pan most of the time i dont use any oil or butter though because of the misses  getting crepes with a nice shape is just a matter of practice most of the time but it does help if your batter flows almost like milk i take my rough measure of batterand dump 3/4 of it in the center of a hot horizontally placed pan and then start rotating a little at first and a lot towards the end to reach the edge

i seared a steak with a propane torch after patting it down with a ground mix of sea salt roasted garlic black peppercorns mustard seeds red bell pepper cumin seeds chili dehydrated onion coriander seeds ginger and paprika     how badly did i fuck this up need to know what to expect before biting into it im nervous
  looks pretty good sear could be a little better but id eat it
  itll make a turd
  i like rare but that doesnt look right to me the sear could used to work it doesnt like you got a good crust
should have used a searing hot pan to develop a good crust
this is fine if you have an extremely sharp knife and can basically shave minutely thin slices of it
  i seared  no you didnt
  what is the filling of that potato
  here are the steaks with which i started
  you dont want the answer to that
  how was that sear achieved
why cant any of you stupid fauxpretentious cumgurgling fucks cook a fucking steak right god damn just throw the fucking thing on a grill or hot pan and sear the bitch to medium rare
  thats fucking retarded and you ruined a nice steak
  youre an idiot
  i dont know how to cook  huh
  should i just turn the stove as high as i can and put some butter in the pan
  essentially theres a bit more you can do for a better steak
  let it rest before and after cooking remove excess moisture and just using salt and pepper were what i remembered hearing
  in my experience butterhighest heat leads to smoking in the kitchen
  gross dont smoke in your house go outside you animal
    that looks like blue rare aka you need to leave it on the heat element longeri like my steaks rare but that shit is basically raw with a 1/16th of an inch of crust on each side
  based ecolibro
  season your meat very generously with salt bring it up to room temperature appx 1 hour    dont start with butter put some neutral vegetable oil in the pan to begin then bring it up to temperature high heat until it smokes sear one side for 23 minutes flip throw in some butter and aromatics baste 23 minutes as well simple and delicious
  then bring it up to temperature high heat until it smokes  you dont wait till the vegetable oil smokes retard youd literally spoil it ie its no longer suitable for cooking
  huh
  blue rare
  propane torch   next time use microwave
  looks like coleslaw  also probably cum
  medium rare  neck yourself
    op here i was aiming for blue rare       dont have one probably why i suck at cooking desu
having your steak anything but pittsburgh style
  piss poor attempt learn to cook dumbass
    these motherfuckers know whats up

  there is in fact data showing that iq is not nearly as static as previously thought theres new evidence that iq and the corresponding intelligence can increase throughout a single lifetime although its still largely a mystery as to how an individual could go about increasing it certainly routines would be valuable including a dedication to extraordinary nutrition and fitness but also a commitment to intellectual rigor
  sources
  can one really boost their iq
  yikes no source but i do vaguely recall this data being around since the early 80s the problem is that its difficult to get individuals to live their lives in laboratory settings in order to observe this cognitive transformation its largely a mystery as to how increase in iq over a single lifetime is possible though i do distinctly remember it being observed

  almond milk is healthy and doesnt contain antibiotics and pus  maybe not but the almond orchards are usually covered with harmful pesticides  almonds dont suffer  why do people talk to their plants studies have shown that plants thrive when spoken to and veggies want to kill them  baby almonds are not taken from their mothers after birth  tell that to the almond trees  almonds are not forcibly impregnated  see mendels principals of genetics  almonds drink less water  you have any idea how much water is needed to hydrate an almond orchard  almonds dont generate 450 million tonnes of manure annually  cow manure is a great fertilizer i certainly hope it isnt wasted in an almond orchards
  almond milk lacks the protein of dairy milk depending on the brand and variety it may lack the sugar as well but the lack of protein makes it comparable to water
  dude reread my post im shooting down almond milk
  maybe not but the almond orchards are usually covered with harmful pesticides  like every other farmed food in the world you anti vaxxing cuck    why do people talk to their plants  schizophrenia     studies have shown that plants thrive when spoken to and veggies want to kill them  studies show that meat and dairy and are estrogen bombs that kill you    tell that to the almond trees  tell that to a mother cow    see mendels principals of genetics  not impregnation plants are not sentient and have nothing with semblance to a nervous system    you have any idea how much water is needed to hydrate an almond orchard  do you have any idea how much water is needed for cattle    cow manure is a great fertilizer i certainly hope it isnt wasted in an almond orchards  its also a great environmental destructor       muh protein  eat some beans you weak willed cuck

hey co/ck/s this is my first stainless frying pan and i have no previous experience with stainless steel  should i scrub this residue or leave it and let it develop  i cleaned it with hot water and a brush no soap
i cant tell if the picture is really showing the residue thats building up on it  this one will probably be sideways too  stupid phone poster
scrub it clean dude patina on ss pans is retarded
youre supposed to use detergent to clean stainless steel and every so often you can clean with products specifically designed to clean stainless steel    cast iron is what you clean with hot water and brush and avoid detergent
  this  buying a fucking demeyere when you have no idea what youre supposed to do    cast iron is what you clean with hot water and brush and avoid detergent  stop perpetuating wives tales dear redditor
  its not a wives tale that you shouldnt use soap on cast iron unless its been very very thoroughly seasoned
  explain why
  a properly seasoned pan is not harmed by soap    the wives tale of you cant use soap on cast iron comes from idiots who never seasoned their pan in the first place they keep it perpetually oily to prevent it from rusting because it was never seasoned right to begin with
  are you really asking the internet whether you should wash your dishes
  yes clean the damn thing even cast iron gets cleaned not soap and water  use it to saute vegetables and pan sear steaks dont cook eggs in it
  even cast iron gets cleaned especially with soap and water do cook eggs in it
  you can use soap and water just dont leave it like that even if you seasoned the everloving fuck out of it dont wash it after its been seasoned soap and water will wash it off   i never use soap on mine i always just scrub it with salt and oil and disinfect it in the oven
  wont there be soap residue in the skillet even after you rinse  and hell no you cant cook eggs in an ss
  and hell no you cant cook eggs in an ss  maybe if youre a brainlet that doesnt know how to cook with stainless steel i do it all the time and they never stick
  dont wash it after its been seasoned soap and water will wash it off    if soap and water washes it off then you had a dirty pan not a seasoned one     never use soap on mine i always just scrub it with salt and oil and disinfect it in the oven  why would you willingly choose a care method that requires that much effort    just season your pan properly and you can wash it like any other stop confusing a perpetually oily pan with a properly seasoned one youre making more work for yourself for no reason
  wont there be soap residue in the skillet even after you rinse  no cast iron isnt porous surface imperfections arent pores
  wont there be soap residue in the skillet even after you rinse  no why would you think that you rinsed it therefore there is no soap left     hell no you cant cook eggs in an ss  i can and do nearly every morning what proplem are you having sticking thats operator error
  use barkeepers friend and a rag with some water it will come off easy
  stainless steels best friend
thanks anons  i used some hot water detergent and a green scrubbing pad and it came out fine
    deglaze it you mong
  i hope youre kidding  steel wool can make stainless rust    bar keepers friend is far better if you must use a scouring pad use a nonmetallic one like those green synthetic ones
  normal soap and water scrub for day to day cleaning    this stuff to refresh make a thick paste rub it in a circular pattern from the center until it shines rinse off wash like normal
  stainless rust  lolwut  only way to get that polymerized oil/fat off of those shitty stainless steel skillets is sos pads and a lot of elbow grease barkeepers friend didnt do shit neither did comet  i own a stainless steel stockpot and a stainless steel saucepan  neither of them have the problems the skillet does with polymerized oil becoming fused to it after a single use
  derp  honestly i didnt even notice it was that dirty until later when i went to clean up  ive only used this pan a few times so far   i like it though it will definitely be used more
  if you really want an erection get something like this  
  looks nice but i think i have enough pans for now  thx anon
can we bicker about cast iron now
  the fuck are you talking about ive been cleaning my stainless with soap pads for years with no issue
  faggot
  my god i hate elaine
  stainless steel on shit ranges will always get too hot and cause sticking that is a pain to scrub off copper is much better
  are you retarded
  maybe but thats besides the point
  checked
  my my this pasta i made does come in handy    how to quickseason a stainless steel pan to keep your food from sticking    1 heat the clean empty pan on your stovetop  2 pour in a quarter tsp of water when the pan is hot  3 if the water sizzles and boils off the pan is not hot enough yet keep heating  4 if the water doesnt evaporate but floats and rolls around the bottom like a puddle of quicksilver leidenfrost effect the pan is hot enough  5 now wipe the pan completely dry with a dish towel and generously coat the bottom with some hightemperature cooking oil eg canola  6 keep heating the pan until the oil just barely begins to smoke keep it at that temperature for a minute  7 pour out the excess cooking oil and let the pan cool down to the desired temperature    wa la you now have a perfectly nonstick stainless steel pan the seasoning will last through all frying until you strip it off with dish soap or acidic stuff
  on second thought it is probably not necessary to coat the pan generously with oil a little oil and spreading it with a spatula work most likely just as well
  i put a splash of oil in mine and then buff it around with a paper towel gets a nice even coat without any pooling pooling  rubbery gobs stuck to your pan  when you do it right your pan should have a slight golden shine to it
  i bought my first ss pan the other day and the very first thing i cooked was an omelet we have a shitty coil range it didnt stick at all and the omelet turned out fantastic  i think you may just be doing it wrong    honestly im not sure what ill be using my cast iron pans for now since this thing seems to do almost everything better and is less of a hassle
  yeah ill edit my pasta
  saute pan  it seems a lot more versatile than a frying pan
  my fuckin nigger i buy ghese things in bulk npw anytime i cook with ss almost daily i dont even bother trying soap and sponges anymore i just reach for one of these and looks good as new after every few months ill hit it with barkeepers friend just to keep them extra spotless fucking sos pads best thing ever
why the fuck would you want to season a ss pan why are you so retarded that you cant look up a youtube video for how to properly cook things in one
11552431  you
    can confirm this stuff is fucking magical and keeps my pots and pans looking almost brand new
i reckon most anons here learned cooking through their family such as their mother father grandmother and so on or maybe a friend thing is i have no one to teach me how do i learn cooking  tried to follow recipes before but i get stuck on the most basic things such as trying to figure out which one of my spoons is a teaspoon and thats just an example i can get stuck on any step ever for not knowing the exact intentions behind whoever wrote it what do i really want to cook fancy things its one of my life objectives
i had nobody to teach me you just power through with learning and trial and error you have the entire library of google and youtube at your disposal there are a lot of great cooks to help teach you recipes and how to cook them food wishes is a great channel for that youll fuck things up at first but as long as you learn what you did wrong youll get better overtime honestly if you commit to it it doesnt even take that long to be a good selfcook
  any beginner recipes you recommend that can teach a thing or two
  not the anon youre replying to but what sort of recipes what do you like to eat what sorts of things would you like to learn
  i started with this guy many years ago i learned a lot of basics from him    
  maybe stir frying heard that once you know how to do it you can cook tasty things with anything  or an egg dish i can only boil eggs and make shitty mixed eggs even after watching ramsays guide 50 times
  this is probably a better video that would be more immediately helpful      
  stir frying is generally pretty simple but its all about learning which of your ingredients take longer to cook carrots take longer to cook than mushrooms onions require less cooking time than broccoli etc a lot of people will cook the protein for the dish before hand then add it in near the end if you throw all the ingredients in at the same time youll end up with a pan/wok full of mushy veg and crunchy veg with a stir fry you still want the veg to have a bit of texture and use a bit more oil than you think youd need    as for egg dishes omelets are a good way to start perfecting eggs they definitely take practice but once you can make a good one you can make lots of variations of them
  this might be what i was looking for gonna check his guide thanks    omelette sounds like a good idea ill look it up
  is he speaking in celsius or farenheit
  check out alton browns good eats or french guy cooking on youtube theyre both weird and hipster but they do a good of explaining not just the how but also the why of various recipes and techniques
  farenheit
also dont try and cook along with a video/show watch it a few times take notes print off the recipe and have cued up in case you get stuck somewhere  but dont try to cook in real time with a video it divides your attention and leads to defeat
  i like this guy thanks anon
  i only recently started really learning how to cook by myself maybe 23 years ago and i think im pretty good now really just do what  said and use google and yt a lot i recommend starting with dishes that you really like or cuisines you like and youll pick up skills from there while having fun you can easily look up guides on dicing or prepping certain ingredients too also if you dont know what something means in a recipe measurements terms techniques ingredient etc just google it dont wing it
i took home ec in high school for an easy a and actually learned a lot about cooking
check out foodwishes aka chef john on youtube he gives super clear and easy instructions and doesnt draw out his videos to ridiculous lengths just straight and to the point    if youre completely retarded in the kitchen but want a homecooked meal get a slowcooker its virtually impossible to fuck up slowcooker recipes just throw everything in and 68 hours later food
maillard effect  fresnel effect  knowing how those two work will save you so much headache in preparing meals     start cooking eggs in all sorts of ways to learn how to control heat and use oil boil fry over easy scramble french omlete omlete omurice poached etc cheap and doesnt matter if you fuck up     eventually transition to steel pans as nonstick has a short lifespan and is generally bad for health as people seldom use or care for them properly dont buy meme chopping gadgets slapchops are great for nuts and pickles tho will admit learn to use your knife dont get discouraged if you cut yourself use your bear claw at all times to protect your pfeengors    learn proper hygiene and dont cross contaminate surfaces utensils rags very important especially if you want to cook for someone else    if you start a kitchen fire put it out with baking soda dont use water or youll start a grease fire a kitchen extinguisher should only be used in emergencies as they leave a mess so hard to clean youd wish your kitchen burnt down anyway dont get discouraged if a fire happens i caught my pan on fire a few times remember different oils have different smoking temps    youll be a pro in no time
for me its ottogi yeul ramen with fried kimchi and canned tuna
first post
  i always want to eat this shit so bad then i turn over the package and remind myself if i eat it all id be on my way to a sodium overdose i only eat this during summer months at work when im sweating buckets
  its obvious this stuff is bad for you but hasnt the idea that salt  bad been disproven recently
store bought kimchi  canned tuna    weeb status confirmed
  no brand  fucking hipsters
  isnt it yeol
  i made the kimchi you faggot    i assume you catch your own tuna
  while humans and animals alike need salt there is always going to be an amount thats terrible for you its very easy to eat too much sodium if you just go full tard
  not going to a korean supermarket and buying the kimchi some oldass korean ladies make in store
  i usually use a teaspoon of miso paste and just a bit of the seasoning packet when i make it maybe like a 1/3rd of it
  based if it doesnt come packaged like this i dont want it
  its spelled like Ïó¥ which to me would be yeol dunno maybe some koreanfag can explain
  no i understand the english translation im talking about the korean itself phonetically Ïó¥ i thought was yeol maybe it can be yeul as well
  korean propaganda again
is medieval times worth going to  t thinking about christmas break road trip
id go if i thought id have a chance to talk to that lady she seems interesting and i hope she has a nice personality
  whos the wench 
  looks like she is wearing a wedding ring
  went for my brothers 14th birthday i remember enjoying the food for some reason the least i can say about it is that its a memory from before the age of 10 so it left an impression one way or another
idk bro last time i went everyone smelled like shit and it took forever to get anywhere shit public transportation would not recommend overall
  90 of renfairers are morbidly obese and smelly  the program is cringe worthy our queen was some thot from new jersey with a nasal voice  the food is garbage and they serve corn despite corn being mesoamerican  jousting is a literal larp not real at all    its some dd nerds conception of what medieval times were like with no bearing on reality and is not very entertaining if you want something fun go to that fundie holy land theme park to laugh at them bonus points of youre catholic and you can talk circles around them theologically
  sure i fuck kids hey jesus forgives  sir would you please leave already youre upsetting the other visitors
  potatoes are also new world
  dnd nerds conception of medieval times  you know that dnd is a high fantasy game right there is no mesoamerica or anything geographically real
  bonus points of youre catholic and you can talk circles around them theologically  so am i anon but why would you mention this are you insecure about something  though i do agree that its fun to watch fundamentalists try to explain their beliefs i love talking to those jehovahs witnesses who wait outside of public transportation and making them uncomfortable
  that looks better than anything ive eaten in the past week
why does only north america has this kind of entertaiment with integrated dining
  i have a medieval studies degree and my main board is /tg/ while youre correct that its historically innaccurate its a fucking blast get drunk eat chicken look at tits good time man
  what do you think the savage lands are retard
  i went to the one in orlando and i had a blast its a pretty sick atmosphere and the food isnt half bad idk how much it cost since i went with a large group for a birthday but we got pretty messed up and had a ton of fun lots of chanting and yelling really felt like u were in a gladiator match go on a weekend though so the place is full its best that way ive heard it isnt as fun when its only half full on weekdays
  is it similar to in my favourite movie the cable guy going to america next year and im thinking about going out of my way for one but im scared it might disappoint if its not like in my favourite movie the cable guy
its a good time the food isnt 4 star shit but for a mass produced feast you wont leave feeling hungry go with your buddies get drunk and enjoy a show that youd otherwise have to go stand outside in the heat/rain at a renaissance festival
  god anita is hot  id give anything for a night with her asshole
  what a honey but i wouldnt want to hurt her so would never violate her asshole
  they serve corn despite corn being mesoamerican    i think youre the autismo in this scenario
  with the exception of plato aristotle and kant all the best philosophers are catholic or have strong catholic leanings gem anscombe has the best interpretation of wittgenstein this side of subahibi notre dame arguably has the best philosophy program in america and thus the world if i were not a gnostic and could get over the weird marian and papal obsessions i too would be catholic
  all the best philosophers are the ones that tout my preconceptions  i wonder why
  dinner and a show
  i recognise her thats the turk who thinks advertising kfc with reference to international cricket team rivalry is inherently racist
  tout my preconceptions  expressing extreme disbelief in the marian and papal cults  is a selfproclaimed gnostic which would get you instabanned from any christian church  wew lad you are certifiable    projecting your inability to evaluate arguments by their own merits onto others  look wittgenstein an atheist jew said that a bull dykelooking catholic was the only one who understood him not i if you cant appreciate aquinas theory of natural law  which is so complex and subtle that it persists to this day defended by modern natural law theorists and even logical positivists are collapsing into it  then you are a lobotomized fool
  sure thing nothing like imaginary transubstantiation and sticking a dick in five year old assholes to bring a chap closer to ultimate good
  well done
  since you seem to be too thickheaded to get the point  not a catholic  not even close to being a catholic  appreciates good philosophy  notices that catholics tend to be good philosophers  even if i were a catholic i would not abide by vatican ii so it would be easy to declare all the weird pedo shit as a proof of sedevacantism and corruption within the church also almost all of the ritualistic doctrines of all churches are gay and null heads i win tails you lose
  i wish this site werent anonymous id love to report you to the authorities
if you enjoy the smell of horse shit while youre dining
  try and backtrace me faggot
  like just her asshole and you in a room together think about it that sounds like it would be really weird
  sounds hot to me
  medieval times  tomatoes  potatoes  fucking corn    reeeeeeeeee    thats literally so fucking retarded i cant comprehend it
  only the asshole not the person just a floating anus that you kind of know is anitas but theres no body or any kind of context just a fucking sphincter
  is she on the young turks
  whats the problem here  its anita sarkeesians fucking asshole  imagine the smells  imagine the flavors
  brainlet alert
    i dont know anything about savage lands lore but im going to go out on a limb and guess that nowhere is it specified in any canonical or fuckin noncanonical for that matter material that european old world crops grow in greyhawk/whatever the default setting for your edition of choice is and new world crops grow in savage lands maybe im wrong but that would be arbitrary and retarded
  kek thats one super nerdy response
  reads a bunch of words you didnt understand  wwell you must fuck kids  every time you shouldnt have even tried
  if this isnt some quirky internet persona you have adopted to bait people then please end your own life
  the virgin medieval times vs the chad dolly parton branson show
  the best part about this is that the vegetarian option manages to be slightly more historically plausible than the regular but they had to fuck even that up by using tomatoes
        this is a redditor isnt it
  i want to pork the poop out of her
  it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea than that he should offend one of these little ones    but yeah jesus was totally cool with people harming kids    read a bible once in a while
  grace doesnt exist if youre mean to the younglings   wrroooong incorrect
  niggah your own nonsensical doctrine says you can commit any conceivable abomination and simply mumble a magical incantation and youll sit on the right hand of skyboi champion grow up
  more to the point shes clearly a noble why would she ever go for a serf like 
  the crap hole in times square nyc  no its a fucking tourist trap and that whole area should be avoided like the plague
  finally i arrive in america producer of my favorite movie the cable guy hopefully to tour many location similar those feature in my favorite movie the cable guy
what would you add to this pepperoni roll
  i could definitely fuck that
  i avoid west virginia also those things are terrible
  it looks like a gateway to hell
  my penis
  a couple banana pepper rings and some seasoning i grabbed a few months back  also garlic butter on top before and after baking  that seasoning is a salt free mrs dash sowthwest chipotle
  the same thing i added to your mums roll last night
  mushrooms sausage onions maybe some green peppers
  marinara
  a bunch of mushrooms onions and pepperoncini
  toilet paper
  kinky
  melt the cheese fucking properly would be number 1
  crushed red hot peppers
  red pepper flakes  i put them on everything    intelligent poster
is a pepponi roll just stromboli
  no its worse
  came here to say this      it needs something juicy and fresh to keep you from vomitting from all that grease   shredded granny smiths would probably work well  otherwise try some jalapenos corn ranch and lettuce
  invisible inter web force field activated  pineapple
  a dusting of icing sugar
some damn pepparoni
a little marinara

  damn bro stop giving away all the industry secrets
  thats not even real brick is it
putting your menus on panels that are just going to get screen burn in less than a year and youll end up replacing them over and over and paying more  why do take out places keep doing this
  most menus like this change their graphics every once in a while to prevent the burnin you mentioned
  that only happened to older lcd screens what i dont understand is why a smaller business would spend hundreds of dollars on a menu that would be a fraction of the cost from a printing company are we supposed to be impressed by your dumb fuck powerpoint skills or something
ill take the lobster
  keeping your wallet in your back pocket  ill never understand you people       theres one of those places nearby their donuts taste weird because they cook them in the same oil they do fries and chinese food
  would you make a brick counter
can you put m  ms in the fridge or does it turn them shitty like ketchup
le unrefrigerated katsup trick thread    logging in  hmmm whats this         ahh i see    he wants to bait me into posting that  m n ms can be refrigerated and that kechup does not become shitty  in a fridge    i lose either way     just by    posting       he      had      won
  i legitimately do want to know if you can refrigerate m  ms i got bags on sale for snacks on christmas day but theres going to be a bunch of hot days between now and then so i want to ensure they dont go funny
how can mayo be real if my car needs gas
  sorry im ususlly on reddit not used to this whole four channel thing yet   heard there was bad guys  and i had to keep tough       you could probably keep them near the back broseph     keep on owning     rock on
  do you live in the third world hot outside should still mean room temp inside
  i live in australia and i dont have air conditioning our summers get hot as fuck
  why the fuck would you live there and not save up 250 for a decent ac
  i rent
  4channel was a mistake
  enjoy your ban
  this
  yes theyre actually pretty good when refrigerated although it may make them melt in your hand
  how about peanut butter and crispy
  its all fine except the candy shell melting when you eat them
  the fridge makes them do this more than they would otherwise
did mook change the domain so more third worlders could access a previously blocked website  post quality has actually dropped through the fucking floor
  both are fucking trash and youre trash for liking that shit    pretzel and peanut you fucking plebiscite
  pretzel is fucking dogshit and so are you for liking that shit   peanut are good
  2018  not knowing about dynamic ips  suck my dick buttfucker
  pretzel isnt that great but it has some layer of taste and texture as opposed to crispy which just makes eating regular mms loud and annoying
  it also gives them a ricey taste and a little airiness
  yes because when you take them out the temperature difference causes condensation to form on the shell making them melt
  that doesnt sound pleasant how about if you take them out let them sit to room temperature then serve them
  they will still form condensation in the bag basically once you refrigerate them expect to get candy shell color on your fingers
  gay
  pretzel  no
  hi op
  hi
havent talked to the ex wife and daughters for a few years because they are hateful feminists  find out they all converted to veganism    what kind of negative health effects will i be able to see over the next few years
  negative health effects will i be able to see  brapps from the bowels of hell
  hurt on your general butt area
  every aspect of your health will diminish rapidly youll age at three times the rate of a normal person youll blame alcohol its a contributing factor but the fact that you were unable to keep your family together is the primary factor your genes now recognize you as a failure and seek to self destruct
  its funnier that you married her in the first place and want us to sympathize with your dumbass
  you need to be a larger part of your daughters lives youll seriously regret it when its already too late and theyve grown to resent you dont make my papas mistake and try to crawl back years later looking to finally act like a father god knows your wife is an insufferable cunt pushing vega it and god knows what else
redpill me on this shit /ck isnt it just the nasty fatty part you cut off all blackened up why do those southern amricans worship this stuff so much
  kansas city isnt in the south
  is that where its from is it some special regional dish without looking at a map i would say kansas is in the south with arkansas
  yes its a regional dish and no its not the south its the midwest
cooking is easy as shit   women who are bad at cooking are fucking up intentionally because they dont want to do it for you  if a woman wont cook for you then break it off she doesnt love you
  fuck off to /r9k/ you weird fuck
youre not wrong but fuck off
one scrambled egg please  how will cast iron cucks ever recover
  oiling the pan and cleaning it after cooking
  get a better image i cant even make out the image
  i made scrambled eggs in my cast iron this morning my secret i used oil  shhh no telling
spend several hours re seasoning my pan layer by layer to get a perfect finish  apartment smells like shit but at least my cast iron will work right  eggs still stick  clean it off with salt  seasoning looks like shit now  whats the advantage of these pans again
  yeah fuck that shit thats what teflons for
cast iron is for trannies
  shut up i dont use cast iron
  i dont use salt    i give mine a quick rinse with cold water and use the softer side of a sponge if it needs spot cleaning wipe it off and briefly heat it with a touch of oil rubbed in good as new
  nothing ever comes off well enough to clean it without some abrasion
  imagine being so asshurt about cast iron that you need to make threads like this someone is veeeerrryyyy obsessed
  use stainless steel   works perfectly every time   no maintenance required     
  a fucking white male
  huh
i like sunny side up eggs and doing them in cast iron is a pain in the ass is there a trick to it so i can avoid my nonstick pans cancer coating    i use liberal amounts of butter and have tried oil in the past
  use the nonstick pan and move on with your life jesus fucking christ
  use butter you cockwomble
is carbon steel a meme
  no but theyre expensive
but for me but for my money though its gotta be the the rock cookware
dont preheat pan on medium low flame for 5 god damned minutes and then add butter/oil and wait until it starts shimmering  oh no my eggs are reacting with the ice cold surface of the pan cast iron suxss  im retarded this is all your fault /ck/
  then your pan is improperly seasoned dummy
  is this postmodernism or contemporary art  i can never tell the difference
  imagine wanting to have such a maintenance heavy cooking utensil that eggs become a hassle
  you can use wooden utensils the eggs dont stick if they stick then youre doing something wrong because the oil/butter will cook them before they touch the surface of the pan and prevent a chemical reaction of the proteins in the egg
  posts coated cast iron
  coated  thats a preseasoned cheap as dirt lodge all it takes is 23 additional seasoning cycles before theyre fully ready to be used for cooking if they didnt preseason ie bare metal then youd have to apply like 10 seasoning cycles and it would probably already be rusted by the time you bought it
  its teflon coated
  no it isnt you mong just because youre dumb as rock doesnt mean cast iron doesnt work    
  get autism
just use teflon pans to cook fucking eggs v    i swear cast irons ade the fedora of cooking utensils
  wrong meme sweetie
  see     you just dont know how to properly use it and i dont blame you because neither did i when i bought my first pan id slap on eggs meats on it after only a few seconds and when it came time to wash the burnt on crud i would use steel wood and concentrated soap and sometimes even leave it soaking in hot water all night long it was absolute hell but i was doing everything wrong know how to use your tools
  too clean pans do this grease needs to burn into the surface to makes it less sticky thats why they are used by unwashed gay cus theres no women around cowboy type guys living in beat up cabins cooking spam in cast iron skillets over campfires those eggs wont stick
  lodge marketing video  still visible burnt black shit on the egg not pepper on top of a side being burnt beyond salvation
  i got difficulties smelling whats being cooked
  see       how is that burnt it just looks like the seared part of the egg do you eat microwaved eggs
use teflon  thats it  just werks
  use teflon  get cancer  just kills
    these pans are unironically quite nice i got some for christmas last year and they perform extremely well fond peels right off of them and i can reliably make french omelettes
  seared shit isnt black/grey theres no searing there it just goes from normal coloration to flecks of black shit and the complete absence of any sort of browning those eggs are burnt
  crispy eggs are good though
  i fucking love crispy eggs my eggs foam up and get crisp real nicely frying it in the leftover bacon fat but thats not whats in the picture those arent crispy eggs thats overcooked but not crispy eggs with fucking crap on them
  use ceramic then
  so these are teflon free apparently nice
  you can see in the view from above that spot just had thinner egg its brown and youre seeing it as very dark due to the darkness of the pan for an autist you sure have poor eyesight your intellectual dishonesty is spot on though
thank you based stainless
i cook only on a plate of armor my grandfather stole from a damaged panzer iv tank
  can you be serious please
so get nonstick then
  ask me how i know these eggs turned out like shit
  lookout we have an amateur egg cooking riddle master
daily reminder that nonstick or any pans dont get hot enough to start vaporizing the fucking polymer coatings unless you are severely handicapped in which case the teflon cough is the least of your worries
  you mean unless you leave them on high heat for a long time
  theyre a meme made for hipsters
  if you somehow manage to leave your pan sitting at 500 degrees for an extended period of time yes
  500f is not that high
  rinse with water run with sponge dry it off add oil heat up every time u want to make an egg     vs    wash with soapy sponge
      edges are browned/crispy and the top of the egg isnt even cooked through yet heat was set way to high on these
  seasoning cycles  what the fuck is this guy talking about lmao
  he doesnt even sear his eggs to lock in the juices
i use teflon pan because    easier to use for eggs   and  makes someone seethe on /ck/    win win basically
  just cook it longer until it gets flaky itll wipe out easily
you people disgrace our surly king of the egg fort with your burnt eggs and spilled yolks what would he have to say to you
    i dont understand how you can have these issues i got my pan cooked just bacon in it for a week then it basically became nonstick for life i treat it like shit i almost never scrub it out a little butter and my eggs slide around like its a water slide yall must be fuckin braindead
  he uses a legendary pan of ancient damascus steel
  how far down does your neck beard grow bro
  you realize most stoves get pans to 500 or more right if youre cooking for an extended time or youre a professional chef your pan is gonna get wear and tear
  i use teflon pans all the time to sear and literally nothing has happened to me it just works maybe you should learn to use teflon pans  the it gives you cancer memers are actually retarded or just pretending  also all professionals chefs use stainless not cast iron
  im a chef we use both     i have nothing against teflon just replying about the temperature
  flipping the eggs
actually i feel sorry for you cousin this is how mine looked after making scrambled eggs this morning
  not using olive oil to fry eggs
  stainless left less residue than your cast iron pic related
  first time i cooked bacon it created a sticky residue in the pan made more of a mess than the eggs
  doesnt look like it to me desu seems pretty negligible in either case your grasping at straws my dude
  pic from 2017  idiot try posting something from the current year
  the reason why food sticks to cast iron is because it reacts with the iron and forms chemical bonds burning a very thin layer of oil causes the oil to polymerize and form a teflon like coating that also prevents food from making contact with the iron as time goes on this layer of protection will thicken if used properly and you will start to get teflon like properties
  just get a teflon from the get go then
  and then get it again and again and again and again teflon pans are nice for what they are but unless you use them with a low flame use silicone utensils and only wipe it down with paper towels for cleaning you will never see them maintain factory nonstick properties for more than a year which also means youve been eating teflon flakes isnt that toxic personally ill just stick to stainless steel but i wouldnt recommend teflon pans to anyone desu
  maybe we dont like eating out of disgusting pans with caked on rotting grease
  kek based retard poster
  pan shot
  nice reference bro
  marshall dont come through but once a month
  whats the advantage of these pans again    lasts forever  holds heat like a motherfucker  sears super hot  not hard at all to care for get super hot hold under hot water and rub with a brush if you need to dry out hot light coat of oil you bring up to smoking hot    enjoying the shit out of the sirfry i just made in my new lodge 14 wok
  this cast iron weeds out the impatient idiots
  complete bullshit  i have a 5year old cuisinart nonstick skillet that i use every day at temps ranging from mediumlow to mediumhigh use rubber wood and occasionally metal utensils and clean it with a normal dish sponge or brush nylon and soapy water the teflon is completely unblemished and perfectly nonstick to this day  contrarywise i break out my allclad stainless steel skillet only 23 times per year because everything sticks and it is a pain in the ass to clean
  youre dick female is for trannies
  you first
  contrarywise i break out my allclad stainless steel skillet only 23 times per year because everything sticks and it is a pain in the ass to clean  its supposed to stick youre supposed to deglaze the fond and use it to make a sauce
  deglaze your stainless and make a sauce its not hard you just suck
  teflon is garbage      and yes it is toxic i use ceramic ive been using the same 3 ceramic coated pans for about 10 years frequently i tried iron really tried too much mixed info out there too my trial and error on my part found some expensive at the time at least ceramic coated pans and ill get the same again when these finally show that its time a decade in and theyre still near perfect condition and as nonstick as day one with no upkeeping needed can wash and dry in nearly every way i have no reason to look elsewhere
  also if stuff is sticking and you tear it up off the pan it was neither running hot enough or left long enough to release on its own
  post it right now i dont believe you
  holy shit you are literally so retarded that you fucked up a piece of metal
  also also fuck you for wasting money on an amazing and stupid expensive pan you dont know how to use
  only cost me 25 brand new  lid included  about 10 years ago when they were on sale  must suck if youre a fag who paid over a hundred bucks for the allclad meme pan
  you still suck if youre blaming a pan like that for your shit cooking
  cooking the egg  your just as bad as the rest
  perfect finish  damaged by salt    you did it wrong
scrambled eggs  mix eggs with small amount of milk in a mug   add salt and pepper  microwave  take out mix and add butter  microwave  perfect scrambled eggs
  milk  microwave  fucking neck yourself
sup 
cast iron is goat for a mountain man breakfast
  teflon bad  burnt oil that chemically reacts with heavy metals good  bbut dont burn olive oil thats bad  but use a lot of grease and let it make a sticky icky mess good
  nothing man  what is up with you
  are those crutons
  left over thanksgiving stuffing with some sausage
youre not supposed to use cast iron for eggs or pancakes or for acidic sauces    its great for certain things but its not supposed to be used for literally everything
  its the goat for pancakes flapjacks johnnycakes hotcakes and johnnyjacks you absolutely retarded mouth breathing waste of matter do the universe a fucking favor and get smart or make yourself useful and reincorporate yourself into the organic milieu of soil so at least my garden can get something of worth from you
use teflon  just werks  feels good not being a contrarian
  need special soft tools  cant sear  cant go above a medium heat  i get way more use out of my cast iron than i do from the one teflon i have
  i sear and go high heat with it nothing happens to it maybe learn to use one
  different tools for different jobs bro there are no points awarded for using one pan for everything    nonstick for delicate foods which stick easily  iron for searing  stainless for when you want to generate fond for later deglazing  copper for delicate emulsified sauces candy and jam    youd be stupid or a very limited cook not to own and use them all
  show us a sear faggot anyone can talk big i squat 1000 lbs am a billionaire and have a personal harem
  burning and outgassing his teflon because he keeps using it wrong      and i do have a great array    though id argue you get a lot more use out of a nice multilayer stainless saucier i got a decent deal on a mauviel a while back than spending extra on copper if you arent constantly doing copper ideal stuff
  i just start by frying the bacon in the pan then cook the eggs in the bacon fat
  i dont care if you believe me or not i have nothing to prove to your autistic ass     im not burning it at all it still works perfectly
  t tefloneater  you know that food normally doesnt smell like burnt plastic right
  there is a point awarded for using one pan for everything youre good enough to make shit with one tool   i do not count a pot as a pan though like people seem to do thats for a different type of food but you can still totally use the wide shallow pan for that
     and outgassing his teflon because he keeps using it wrong    theres nothing wrong with using teflon on high heat what matters is that the surface of the pan doesnt get too hot thats easily done by making sure there is food in the pan and/or not keeping it on high heat long enough to get the pan that hot     id argue you get a lot more use out of a nice multilayer stainless saucier i got a decent deal on a mauviel a while back than spending extra on copper if you arent constantly doing copper ideal stuff  agreed
  i know my food is very good and has been enjoyed by many people in several countries around the world  you sound like you started cooking after coming to /ck/ and got spooked by the teflon memes before even trying it  learn to use a teflon pan
  my gfbf swears by her cast iron pans youre onto something
  huh
  cast iron is only important for the visual aesthetics in this  ceramic pan would do everything this does just as well
  eh the way cast iron interacts with heat and oil gives you a different result    plus youre probably not going to be using your ceramics over an open fire
  ceramics over an open fire  not that anon but fun fact thats the only time i use my ceramic pan
  except i had to cook the sausage before i threw it in the oven
  bitch why the fuck are you cooking eggs in a cast iron skillet
  i make surly eggfort sandwiches most weekends in my cast iron i furtively cook the liquid eggs and bread leisurely eat and then wipe out the still hot pan with paper towel once finished never have i been left with a dirty pan

  get the fuck off my board
  low blood sugar
  be me an almost retarded anon getting hungry so i pull into my negros local bk i had heard they serve the very finest foods this planet has to offer but have never been the kind of person that trusts what my negro says boy was i surprised when the lettuce was crispy and the service was better than what i get at home   now thats a tasty burger
  someone piss in your cheerios you know cereal and milk isnt cooking cereal and piss definitely isnt cooking
  if i knew you in real life i would fucking kill you not kidding i would actually slaughter you i want you dead
  cash me outside
be me  a highly intelligent gentleman who is picky about quality and value  often looking for a delicious new lunch spot  try burger king on a whim  my friends i tell you it was one of the best meals i have had this year the crisp vegetables mixed with the moist and hot broiled burger the cool soda the hot and crunch fries totally blown away  i was able to get a value meal for 599 and they even complimented my shirt they dont let black people touch your food and they also have ice cream
what do you put in your daily smoothies   me  hanfdul of spinach   1 banana  blueberries and raspberries
  colon blow
  spinach is essential for a healthy colon
  not an issue if you are adequately hydrated
  t newfag
  in awe
  200ml 2 milk  500g quark  200g spinach  1 banana  2 kiwis   1 beet    my first piss after breakfast is pink my shit explodes out of my ass and requires barely any wiping
  i used to make comparable smoothies by the gallon for work add some oj dude shit is great
 handful of spinach   handful of kale   avocado   hemp hearts   natural peanut butter   1 raw egg   vanilla whey   mct oil   cloves   nutmeg   cinnamon    stevia    salt
   vanilla extract  forgot an ingredient
  sounds good dont understand why you add an egg and not just add more whey
milk  yogurt  peanut butter  spinach  strawberries  2 bananas  blueberries if not expensive af    thinking of adding avocado to the mix
  sugar so its edible
spinach  coconut milk  oe banana  ice
  huel  kratom  dehydrated fruit and veggie powder  cbd oil
  absolutely disgusting
  egg makes it taste like eggnog      its absolutely delicious you uncultured tasteless swine
  no activated almonds
  having to add spices to your shake  the most you should add to kale/spinach/avocado is lime  youre diluting the taste of the greens to deny youre actually eating them
  almond milk forgot that
  nope wrong you are just stupid
  nice ad hom senpai  ps the alcohol in vanilla extract triggers insulin spikes
whey protein  casein protein  blue corn masa  chia seeds  cacao powder  blueberries  mango  olive oil  water  some minerals like potassium sodium    i mix the dry ingredients in a big batch and split them up then add the other stuff and blend with an immersion blender shits cash
  meh could give a fuck about insulin spikes im in great shape and have constant high energy maybe weaker people have to worry about that sort of stuff but fortunately i do not have the constitution of an aids patient once again you are proving to be a complete fucking moron it appears that insulin spikes arent the only thing my superior smoothie is triggering
  even if that were the case what does it fucking matter you autistic child
americans will defend this
  as a poorfag i support this
as a nigger i support this
  as an american i literally cant go three minutes without defending this
  stupid
  get your hands off her biff
being told to eat reasonable portions of food actually upsets amerifats
  wheres the part about the amerifats
  right here  braaaaaaaaaaaapappslprplallplallp
  reminds me how 21 cheetos is one serving
fries are a fat bomb  starch is healthy  fat is not healthy
  if you want to eat healthy maybe just dont order fries you dumb harvard nigger
  declares  some faggot overpaid teacher is now the final say on nutrition     reported to fbi for illegal levels of retardation
  arent certain fries larger than others wouldnt the difference between baking and frying change the amount in certain circumstances    so many factors play into this even moreso what type of potato is used to make these fries in the first place
thats a lowkey way of saying you shouldnt be eating chips at all btw
six fucking fries jesus i bet this guy only eats a quarter of a burger
  look faggot we didnt become the greatest country in history by listening to this shit
  whats the big stink ab    coughing omg
  should be six  not accounting for variance in style of fries etc  doesnt give you your portions size in grams so its scientifically accurate  hes from harvard  checks out its american academia the click bait of academia
    ive experimented on myself for over a year  i dont eat any fat but loads of starch  and im perfectly healthy never hungry have plenty of energy and dont desire fatty food at all
  thank u skeleton
  listen gayboi no one wants to hear about you experimenting on yourself
bro no one is eating fries to be healthy
  arent some vitamins only fat soluble so you need some fat in you system to absorb them
  you can tell someone is an imbecile when they deride a person with 500 scientific publications to their name as an overpaid teacher  
  everything has a little fat in it so im good
  dailymail yeah ok
six what
  thank you for confirming you are retarded i was unsure at first and was concerned
  
  nice source
  daily mail  its fucking nothing
  number of publications is irrelevant impact factor is
  fats are better for you than sugars welcome to your early fat free grave
  that doesnt really mean anything anymore outside of a few majors universities are basically indoctrination centers now days and a lot of professors are just soy filled hacks
  those types in education have to publish or die quality doesnt matter as much as quantity
whats the most hotdogs you ever ate in one sitting
probably 3 but that was also probably 3 too many
  i binge eat pretty regularly i remember buying an eight pack a little while ago and eating 6 with chili and a bag of doritos finished the last two a couple hours later i know ive done this a few times
10 got a bunch of gas station hot dogs for free sans buns
2
  i was at at vons and i saw a whole pack of dodger dogs for like 1/2 off so i decided to try a pack i had like 4 with kraut and spicy mustard and my gf had like 2
i can fit an entire pack of viennas in my asshole
4
i ate 8 once when i was like fuckin 12  there was a hot dog place in town that had a plaque with anyones name who ate a dirty dozen in one sitting i wanted to be the youngest one on there  didnt work out of course it gets exponentially more difficult didnt help that id load the fuckers up with delicious toppings  good times at big daddys
like 6 at ikea
  proofs
i had 4 chili cheese coneys at sonic once they were good and all but man i was farting like a howitzer the whole day
0
  unironically two
7
maybe 6 i could eat more but hot dogs arent that great
  1 because american food is disgusting
in one sitting and fortunately i didnt eat them with buns i could taste nothing but salt for the next few days
  1
  i made these earlier this week as a late night snack pretty full afterwards
like 2530 or something felt like dying after
  back when i was in uni the cafeteria had a discounted hotdogs from 1 to 050 so i got 6 of them and loaded them up with coleslaw chili cheese and jalapenos i felt like shit afterwards
  thats gay
12 with buns i ate 6 and a said i could have another 6 buddy beat me 40 bucks i couldnt i won im not sure if how bad i felt was worth 40 bucks
ate a whole pack once just the dogs with mustard no buns or other condiments it was a sad dark day
i had five chili dogs from skyline once when i was visiting newport ky for work the diarreah i had at 230 the next morning was some of the most violent i can remember    fuck skyline chili
friday night at walmart  mom buys a pack of hot dogs and buns  stop at blockbuster next door and rent a movie  get home eating hot dogs watching movie  all the lights are off so you cant see well  sneak to kitchen while rest of family is watching movie  eat all the remaining hot dogs  movie over lights on family goes to kitchen  hot dogs are all gone  everyone looks at me with a disappointed face
well your mom can easily eat my hotdog in one sitting lmao rekt
5
  1 because im not a fat fuck
  3
  3 and threw up soon after eating them
  what were on the hotdogs that you threw them up       1 hotdog is a serving for a teenager if youre a grown man eating 1 hotdog youre probably a faggy twink
  three but it wasnt with a bun i chop up turkey dogs for instant ramen
not as many as your mum
  i used to go to hockey games with an all you can eat formula after 10 hotdogs youre kinda disgusted with yourself
  3 one right after another my jaw hurt the morning after
why the fuck isnt my super market re stocking this flavor of arizona  its the only fucking flavor without high fructose nigger syrup beaners niggers and white trash have all the iced tea and mango bulshit they want but noooooo you cant have any white tea i swear to god i will firebomb my supermarket
hfcs apologists need to be put up against a wall and executed arizona black and white tea is the best
first off yikes    second off calm down sperg    third off theres nothing wrong with high fructose corn syrup
  t jew food corp
  hey man you need to calm down this is our place to vent im not op btw    you are correct in high fructose corn syrup however drinks without it are very tasty and different also personally they give me throat irritation
for me its southern style
  honest question why do you think there isnt anything wrong with hfcs it has been proven that it has nothing but negative effects on you so much that some countries completely banned it
  t cletus
  based yikes poster    (((yikes)))
  it has been proven that it has nothing but negative effects on you  nu uh no it wasnt
  my honest answer is this i dont believe hfcs is bad for you in small moderation i rarley have it and love it when its not in a drink like those throw back pepsi mountain dew etc drinks with real sugar cane also jaritos as well as mexican bottled coke i love real sugar which is also bad but not in good moderation    as an american i personally hate so much sugar in everything and try to avoid it as much as possible
  drinking anything is moderation is hard for americans
  i havent enjoyed a arizona sweet tea since my high school weed smoking days
  try a xing tea no hfcs
  hmmm sounds very oriental gook shit you know what im sayin
  i dont believe hfcs is bad for you in small moderation  so what half the can a quarter
  fourth off btw im gay not sure if that matters
looks like the plant from jumanji that almost ate that girl
  youre an autist falling for an obvious placebo about as useful as a fucking nutless monkey
  sometimes      i meant as in not drinking more than one whole giant can per day      no u
  racist and demeaning language is not welcome on this website
  why not make your own tea then stir in your favorite type of organic sugar or other sweetener
  this entire fucking post  holy shit go the fuck back already
i work at dominos ama
  why is brooklyn style the only decent choice
  where do you work
  is your mom hot
  is there a military discount
  why does your pizza give me vomiting and explosive diarrhea bordering on food poisoning every time even when i wasnt drinking also whats that foul powdery salt on the crust
  how do i get free pizza
what is the phone number of your store
  did you ever get to meet domino
  why do they cut the thin crust pizzas into little squares instead of normal triangle shaped slices  also how do they update that pizza tracker do you have to hit a button or something when you start/finish each stage of the order
  is your name shawn and did you fuck up that guys order
  what are the most fresh/least fresh ingredients you guys use
  have you ever seen anyone do anything gross to someones food because they were being a rude costumer or in general
  got any connections/insight on corporate im trying for a summer internship there
and op was never heard from again
  are you shawn 
  its not and its a bitch to make      at dominos        no      because you have a weak digestive system and you would have died in the wild      call and say your order was fucked up they will give you another pizza but you will be an asshole      911      you can ask for it regular cut and the tracker is updated when the order is bumped off the computer after its made then its all automatic by time until the driver clocks it out      nothing is fresh      never thats niggerish behavior
  strangely even this anon who pretends to work for dominos gives the same shitty service as the real life dominos do and their pizzas are trash
  kek
  anon who pretends to work for dominos  its not like its a hard position to obtain why would anyone need to do that
  thinks dominoes is found in the wild  nah dude i eat raw milk and cheese and consume minimally processed food most of the time but whenever im at a friends place and they order it thats what gives me issues theres definitely some weird fucked up preservatives in that shit you still didnt tell me what that nasty crust powder was either so im honing in on that being a likely culprit mom and pop places never have that stuff and they dont make me sick
  garlic oil is put on the crust the powder is remnant cornstarch put on the dough to prevent it from sticking ive never met anyone else with this issue so somethings fucked with your body bud
  hes never heard of the dominos pizza bush that grows dominos pizza fresh in the box for all the wild animals with only the toughest stomachs  also how the hell do you eat milk is raw milk that fucking chunky
  
  theres quite a few people in every dominoes thread with the same complaint    i didnt know satan was an insufferable pedant but i should have guessed
  whats your dominos number i wanna prank call the shit outta your place
  the only reasonable solution i can think of is that you dont eat a lot of fiber or are on some sort of diabetic medication so oily things go right through you that or you have an unknown food allergy
  nah see thats not it at all because when not eating out which is 90 of the time i always eat vegetables legumes and whole wheat products
      50 off the next few days gonna get 2 pizzas tomorrow after work for drunk food whats your fav pizza so i can get it tomorrow
  i always thought pizzas grew under ground
your cinnatwists suck ass
is it true that most dominos employees smoke weed/are complete stoners
  what does ama mean
  bacon pineapple with regular sauce or bacon jalapeno wit garlic parm and barbecue sauce
am i the only guy who orders anchovies    how many anchovy pizzas do you get a day and how do you store them and what brand do you use
  what do you think about this combo bruh  i want to make an italian sub pizza so here are my toppings check it  onions  tomatoes  provolone  banana peppers  salami  olives  finish it with a drizzle of olive oil and vinegar  im just trying to make a pizza that reminds me of a great italian sub
  do you work at dominoes
where does he work
  god i would love to smell my exfarts after she ate this
  we dont have anchovies at all maybe its just my store
  what does op do for work
  are you satisfied with a 2 tip because thats all i give
do you make fun of people who order pizza from you around once a week
hows business been lately did pizza hut starting that 5 dollar deal kill sales for you guys
how do i make a dominos pizza anon
  why are the pizzas crusst on the whole pizza feel and taste like it was fried in oil instead of baked
  they closed the chain in my country a while back because people found some live roaches flourishing at the kitchen   also the cooked dough used to be greasy as fuck in a nonappetizing way   are those situations common
  no military discount    im never eating dominos again cant support this unpatriotic sjw crap
  throw some capicola on that
  first step is to fill out an application so you can work there too
  i used to work at dominoes but when i was putting my dog down my manager tried to get me to come in when i wasnt assigned a shift and got mad when i said i wouldnt come in i was in a weak emotional state and said fuck you on the phone and quit but other than that being a driver was lit i got paid to drive around high listening to music
  the worst part was when i started keeping tracknof who tipped what i realized white people on average over the course of two months tip 4 dollars more than black people gender didnt have an affect except black woman drove the black mans tip average down a dollar and 50 cents  i think nigger women are to blame for the black mans problems
  not op but their pizza is greasy as all hell just look at the bottom of the box when it gets to your door and compare it with any other pizza place they all use the same boxes
how much do you lose on 50 off pizzas  t buying a 30 pizza for 15 today
why is brooklyn style a bitch to make
  ama  fucking redditcancerfaggots cant even figure out what site theyre on anymore
  hes just saying that he works for both dominos and the american medical association
  is there really a difference between the extra cheese and the extra extra cheese option how much difference
  there is extra which is 15 by weight and double is actually double this works with all toppings except pepperoni where extra actually means 8 more pieces theres 30 on a medium 40 on a large by default youre charged for two toppings with both so its best to just get double instead of extra little jewings like this are why dominos doesnt lose too much money with half off pizzas       you take a small dough and stretch it to a large size it rips a lot and makes a super greasy pizza
hey lads im this guy     i know you care i ended up just duplicating my last order because i was at work and have a slow phone and had to order it real quick got 2 large pizzas one with mushrooms and green peppers and the other with italian sausage and pepperoni pretty solid i also ordered it at work as a delayed carryout order and my order was ready on time i ordered it 3 hours prior i was actually impressed    pizza is as expected but for 15 2 large 2 topping pizzas is a great deal also sipping on wild turkey which pairs well i love you all have a great night gentlemen
  if i bring my own cheese from home to your local store and ask for a veggie pizza with no cheese and use the one i bring you can you guys use said cheese on a pizza and heat it in on of your own ovens    can i buy raw dough from you guys
  when someone orders a pizza well done how long do you keep it in extra it never seems enough but i dont wanna be enough of a pain to ask them to put it back in
  wtf thanks for telling me about the double thing bro ill always get double ronis from now on  but brooklyn style is objectively the best pizza just know that when you make it the toil is worthwhile because youre satisfying the cravings of a man with patrician taste
  what do you make or yourself
    tell me the truth    is the noid real and if he is do you avoid him
  um i know the president of this organization   are you a legit doctor i am
  tell me about dr harris why does he wear the mask 
  i was in acep when steven j stack was president now we have a nigger in ama i know stack personally
  he is a big guy
  not op but i also work at dominos no we cant use your cheese on the pizza and no you cant buy our dough    my store typically puts it back in about 3/4ths of the way through the oven its on a conveyor belt sort of thing like those tortilla machines    the noid is a cartoon and i avoid him by living in the current year where dominos does not guarantee 30minute pizzas after half a dozen people literally died because of people driving too fast trying to meet an unreasonable deadline
  okay dude you fucking stink  you stink  you stink  you stink
  nice get not really a big guy just bald   holy fuck georgetown grad how esoteric is this place
  my favorite order when im drunk as fuck is a garlic white sauce pizza with double bacon nothing else is there a better dominoes drunchy option
  why do you feel like youre entitled to a discount just for serving
  they use fuck tons of oil i cant even recycle the boxes because the grease attracts mice and shit so i have to throw it out
  what pisses me off so much ive just stopped ordering delivery pizza because it happens everywhere  pizza is always fucking underdone everywhere  ask for well done  it arrives cooked perfectly two or three times  then the extra well just becomes normal undercooked forever more
  violent diarrhoea after dominos the night before what did you do
  not op but i also work at dominos as a csr    ive personally never seen it happen except for a few times people dropped food and put it back in the box like nothing happened we have cameras and managers in the store watching us so doing that kind of fucked up stuff to peoples food is less likely    however i cant say the same for drivers if you are an asshole to them and they are in a really bad move they will probably be the first ones to do gross shit to your order they are the only employees who are left completely unsupervised with the customers food and can do whatever they want during the delivery
  yes   that or they are huge alcoholics and precription drugs my manager acts like someone who abuses stimulants like adderall and hes always super anxious impatient and talks really fast
  not at all we have that deal going on this week that discounts 50 off all online orders    its been a complete nightmare
managed a dominos for three years heres some useless info     everything but sauce and mushrooms come in frozen or in a giant can even tomatoes    sauce sits out at room temp for hours on end and developes a nasty crust thats just mixed back in     theres a blacklist for ass hat customers yes we save notes in the computer on people who dont tip or complain about stupid shit     bread sticks and the like are just half a medium dough with trans fat buttery goo on it and then dusted with garlic seasoning     deep dish is just a pre made pizza crust     on the topping line its made over grates where toppings can fall through into a removable trough like thing every now and then the toppings are picked out by hand and thrown back into their respective receptacles    it was an ok job
  do they make you run the pizzas out the door to your car or was that only the franchise i worked for
  everything but sauce and mushrooms come in frozen or in a giant can    even the cheese
  yes especially the cheese  its tedious as fuck sometimes we dont even bother and just throw it all away unless the managers complain about it
  deep dish is just a pre made pizza crust  not any more now its pan dough which we stretch out every time the same dough used in bread twists and parm bites  theres a blacklist for ass hat customers yes we save notes in the computer on people who dont tip or complain about stupid shit  my store doesnt really have the time to do all that
  my dominos has a card reader that asks me if i want to tip but since im getting the pizza myself i see no reason to tip is that enough reason for employees to fuck with my food
  is that enough reason for employees to fuck with my food  maybe but not usually  also just an fyi leave a squiggle line on the tip part of your receipt just so you wont get scammed out of extra money by some scum driver    had one guy get caught turning a 100 tip into 700 because the idiot forgot to also change the total of the order so that it would add up  not sure what happened to him afterwards but the managers chewed him for it once they found out after cataloging the receipts for the day i dont think he got fired though
  100 tip  who the fuck would only tip the driver 1 i always give the driver 5 or 6 bucks
  no only like 510 of inside customers tip its the expectation tips when you pick it up go to the people working the line but they make more by default and arent hauling their cars all over creation for you so it works out
  not op but my store would get 1 every couple days they come in little sardine tins interestingly enough that makes them the only topping were allowed to send on the side raw dominos has a touch and go relationship with food handling so only prepackaged or cooked items are allowed out those ebony doors
why do u work at dominos lol
  how come when i eat dominos sober i wake up feeling and looking hungover
  sodium and preservatives
  whens the last time you or anyone else cleaned the equipment
  do you like being choke by mexican boys while you masturbate in the shower
  why do people who work in fast food think that is an interesting fact to others
  why is pizza hut better
how often do u change ur meats
  he cant give out no intfermashun
  dominos gives me violent painful shits the next morning normal pizza doesnt do that to me
  where is the location of the dominos that you work at
  thanks for the update
how big is your cock
  why is your chicken alfredo such fucking garbage
dominos always gives me violent horrific shits
why did you run over my dog
  some weird things happens sometimes feel like twin peaks
  hey man youre welcome i just finished them last night was hungover as shit and ate like a slop last night trying this air fryer out that someone gave me and its surprisingly good for reheating pizza    will report back later today or tomorrow on how my bowels are doing

  get a mcgangbang take a mcdouble and a mcchicken and put them together like so fills you up for 240
you guys grew up around albany right
yes and after moving i still jones daily for a stewarts energy tea also legit miss having lees/later asian supermarket across the road on the bus routes
  nope but freihofers is owned by mexico now by a company called bimbo
im from utica and ive never heard of such a cookie
  from the northeast  never heard of freihofers  you havent been here long or you were born yesterday
  oh no its an albany expression
  excuse me for one second
which one do you select to battle in kitchen stadium    realistically how would you do against an iron chef
  asking about cooking on a fast food board
  i guess bobby flay id get my ass kicked i no idea how to cook in a competition setting and wouldnt be able to hold a candle to any of these guys in terms of improvisation and general skill
  as an amateur i can cook bake brew and cure meat as well or better than them but not fast thats the only difference really between an amateur and pro  speed
  what the fuck is a kitchen stadium
  for kitchen stadium do mean one of those shit hole tv shows where they run around like chickens with their heads chopped off that kind of crap just doesnt interest me
i pick iron chef steve brule on the poster back there
  based
    wuts iron chef  wuts a chairman kaga
    be me   pick bobby flay because duh im tryna win  your secret ingredient is   peppers  fuck
  your secret ingredient is  my ass    what would you do with it haha
  probably spit roast it haha
  how do you roast something in spit isnt roasting a dryheat method
  you ram a sharp rod from mouth to anus and then slowly rotate the carcass over an open flame
  i pick flay because theres a 50/50 chance hes going to fuck something up he got his ass handed to him on throwdown on a very regular basis
  hawt
  god i wish that were me
i only recognize the true iron chefs
american iron chef    is this bait
  realistically how would you do against an iron chef  i do consider myself a far better than average cook but if the ingredient/theme played to the iron chefs strong suit id be fucked     the only chance id have would be if i got lucky and the ingredients played to my strengths and the iron chefs weaknesses      thats true but its risky for me since flay and i have similar strengths if the ingredient was good for me it would be right in his ballpark too and the chances of a fuckup are lower    best chance id have would be for example a bbq battle vs morimoto or a cheese battle vs chen kenichi
mario batali was the best until he grabbed pussy
  not michiba  get the fuck out of here pleb
  on basically every episode of throwdown he was playing to his strengths though he usually challenged established bbq guys or other southwestern cuisine
  theyd destroy me  morimoto is the best btw all of you bobby flay fanboys can fuck right off
  this sakai was a good addition after ishinabe left but nobody ever filled michibas shoes nakamura was a joke and while morimoto was pretty creative he was never as successful with it as michiba and they pushed his american storyline a little too much for my taste s2/s3 was the golden era
  i cant say ive watched throwdown sorry    when you say fuckups were these basic shit like burning food dropping things overseasoning    or were these fuckups more complex or elaborate
  i never liked ishinabe sakai was great michiba was godtier too     they pushed his american storyline a little too much for my taste  agreed
hi bob
  let us not forget the oftoverlooked chen he ended up being my favorite i think because of his tenure and because he grew and developed the most out of any of them i suppose you could argue that might have had something to do with his young age but he made some amazing food and had some ballsy fails
  yeah chen was solid too    i really miss the original iron chef and to a lesser extent the early seasons of iron chef america i just want to see experts cook so i can learn from them i dont give a shit about the competition itself in fact i usually dont even bother to watch the judging the later seasons of ica fucked it up when they started adding silly gimmicks like the 20minute dish and the culinary curveball and dont even get me started on the silly shows like chopped    less theatrics more demonstrations of skilled cooking
  morimoto all day like its not even a question       peppers  bobby flay  more like corn that faggot puts corn in everything
secret ingredient on which our chefs will offer their succulent variations  eggs    who do you battle and what do you make for your 45 dishes
  sous vide the eggs and crack them directly into a flash fried pumpernickel muffinwith hollandaise and a garlic paste or garlic butter
  i choose iron chef sakai  i will prepare the traditional accompaniments to a variety of egg dishes such as the peppers and onions of a denver style omlette the rich cheese sauce of a souffle and the smokey dulche de leche sauce of a flan however instead of eggs themselves i will infuse the essence of eggs into the ingredients by having overweight japanese women who have been on an exclusive 1 month egg diet pass their fragrent wind directly into the judges mouths along with every bite  i feel i have a sporting chance if i can get the drink paring correct
  bobby the fuck up flay  hearty caldo verde with my secret weapon homemade linguica topped with an egg gently poached on top of the soup  a fish dish of bacalhau garlic pirri pirri and potatoes fried crispy on the bottom and topped with a soft boiled egg that will gush a cum fountain of yolk down on top with a prick of a fork  spicy spanish tortilla with hot dry chorizo with a side of fried burgos morcilla  pasteis de nata with ground espresso/cinnamon/powdered sugar garnish    howd i do    best meme answer
  mario raped me
  imagine the smell
  i would most likely take them all on at the same time the two asians as co chefs and the white guys as their souxs   id definitely lay the smack down in half the time allotted no less
  half of the thread is shitting on bobby flay
  and thats a good thing
  show me something youve made
real time uma thread  post everything uma related
the original
why is souls food so good
  it is
because its all fired and uses lard
  because black people historically have had to make the worst parts of the animal taste like that were edible so by comparison modern day soul food is a walk in the park to cook it deliciously
  soul food is just hardy foods made to keep hard working laborers full of course it will be good
poor black slaves  mmm mmmmm dem turnip greens taste gyyyood  is this just white guilt in a different guise

  ive been vegan for a year and feel okay but lost a lot of weight i just wondered if you can show me any healthy vegans to watch     the carnivore guys look so much healthier and energetic compared to the vegans and they age so fast  
i really dont want to eat animal products but i get so paranoid about it most i could do is maybe go vegetarian one day but youre still supporting horrible stuff can you be healthy as a vegetarian sv3rige says otherwise
  still listens to the same record on repeat like a dumb autist
   based and red pilled
  but he isnt a vegan
  meat is murder    i literally dont care and will continue eating meat so what are you going to do about it faggot

  ever since it was 4channel the resident cunny/shit/hugefag poster on /tv/ has been lashing out pretty hard its funny how you can tell its the same person here as there
im gonna to inherit a chinese takeaway in the uk and will be moving there how should i run it what food items do i put in it    first off the restaurant has been in town since the 60s it hasnt renovated since then and is purely a chinese takeaway catering to the local clientele one of the first things im looking to improve is the menu the menu consists of over 100 items and with only 23 chefs they are overworked and forced to prepare way too many items people do not order i notice that theres a lot of frozen foods thats been stuck in there for a long time that isnt used i feel fresh is best     second i notice theres no online ordering system gonna contact justeatcouk or hungryhouse and implement and online takeaway order system     the containers are too hard to handle theyre aluminium foil and burns your fingers as you package the food using paper or plastic easily makes it easier to package and more environmentally friendly i really like the american styled box takeaway boxes and i plan to use those     also im gonna throw in american chinese takeaway classics like crab rangoon wontons general tso egg fu young with sauce orange chicken and probably a few more i cant figure out what i think the best is to make sure the quality of the food is high and the amount of work is less for everyone ive been reading reviews of the place and the family running it are getting old and getting into arguments with the customers which is a bad thing     anyone with experience or suggestions to help me out here
  will the head chef still be there   if its profitable i would recommend going in and shitting on him at all  that will not end well  but congrats anon i hope it goes well
  the family member that runs the place is ruling with an iron fist and giving the head chef a ton of things to work and prepare i hope to help cut down his workload and give him more time to focus on quality he always look tired as hell whenever i visited the place
  dont change a working model too quickly  you gotta improve on the buisness strenght and reduce its weaknesses after understanding their causes  if you still enjoy the benefit of previous clientele dont outpace yourself into innovations where theyr not needed    sometime a classic with a simple twist offer the security of said classic and the exitement from the illusion of trying new things    invite your internet critics post change theyll feel obligated to followup on their previous opinion as they feel the direction change is on their side   also never fight your customers just dont give them reason to complain  taste is subjective  but long waiting time unclean tables impolite delivery staff arnt      godspeed anon good luck in you endeavor
  well hes the one you will need to communicate with most   he will love it if you can reduce his workload but to help him keep the quality high you need him to be happy doing what he does  communicate x100 make sure he is on your side keep customers coming back with his cooking    also you need to think a lot about price point if it hasnt been renovated in 50 fucking years youll need to be cheap as fuck to get the turnover you require   cheap doesnt have to mean shit just budget well
here is what a traditional chinese takeaway menu looks like in the uk i hope i to cut down the menu except for the most popular items and to add new things
  one of the first things im looking to improve is the menu    do not do this if its been there since the 60s and is still trading it obviously has a good reputation in the town regardless of the quality people here have pleb tier taste and judge more on reputation branding and familiarity than actual taste changing the menu will just give them a chance to moan that it isnt what it used to be    getting on justeat is a good idea though
  whats just eat like yelp
  this in fact add 200 more items to the menu more items  better also fire one chef and keep only one he will be more motivated and work harder you will also save money because you wont need to pay two chefs
  been there since the 60s  caters to local clientele  if this is the case then dont change the menu obviously its working for them i know if i had a favorite goto spot and they up and changed the menu on me id be livid    also as far as packaging changed  i wouldnt start making a big shift towards plastic takeout containers as im pretty sure theyre going to be banned very soon look into those brown paper boxes or stick with the aluminum tins
  this is what i thought of when youve got a big menu like  then you have to be real careful you dont get rid of someones favorite thing overnight
  american tastes are different to british i wouldnt come here and try to change everything people here know what they want in a chinese takeaway and all chinese takeaways have similar menus that everyone is familiar with im not saying it cannot or will not work but you are gambling a lot people order what they know they like and what they are used to ordering its only the minority that are willing to try out new things if they cant find their usual order on the menu then theyll likely go elsewhere rather than order something different
  its not even a big menu in the way anons thinking of it just deliberately written to look like theres a huge variety three quarters of it could be replaced with one item  buildyourown stirfry  choose protein chicken/prawn/tofu/duck/pork/charsiu/mushroom/tofu  choose veg mushroom/pineapple/mix/bamboo and chestnut/green pepper/spring onion/corn/broccoli/tomato  choose sauce brown/black pepper/spicy/sweet and sour/black bean/curry/chop suey/make it an omelette 50p    add noodles 20p    take the remaining 15 or so items this doesnt describe and list those and bam way shorter menu    except odds are all the boomers in your town whove kept the place alive over the years will immediately abandon it because their favorite item is no longer on the menu and instead its a millenial hipster buildyourown place where the smug cook is judging them even though its the exact same items    if you want to succeed ask the head chef what he needs and dont be afraid to give him extra staff    also most of the items you want to add are exactly the things that actually are pains in the ass requiring special onedishonly ingredients that dont keep well start with just to general tsos that at least is just existing ingredients in different arrangement
alright /ck/ redpill me on why mcdonalds coffee is great coffee
  mcdonalds uses the same coffee supplier starbucks did when they were first starting
  the same reason all their food is good  theyre artists
  its good
      i agree with you all mcdonalds has very great coffee no wonder why people especially autists were raving about it on social media
  it has a lot of msg in it
taco bells coffee is better but im pretty sure they only sell it in the morning unlike mcds
  i dislike every other drivethrough coffee ive tried starbucks is uncomfortably strong to drink black although i only have had it twice a few years ago so may have changed ive never liked the taste of dunkin coffee
unironically this is true if you talk about both black and nonblack
  their normal coffee is just consistently good black or if im feeling cheeky with one cream starbucks normal coffee just tastes like they burnt the shit of the beans mcdonalds is good in a pinch
    it isnt but its a hell of a lot better than tim hortons coffee and that makes it good enough
well im a coffee pleb  i just like it cause its cheap  plus its better with an egg mcmuffin
  cheap and tastes good its great coffee
  its cheap but nothing special really  i dont get why people hype it up so much
  its not great coffee but it is good and its cheap
  mcdonalds coffee 1 all sizes  tim hortons coffee 2  yeah i think its obvious which one has more quality put into it mcdonalds is literal shit and the only people who buy it are poorfags
is it true 7 eleven taste better than all the other popular shit
mcdonalds is fine in a pinch but in the american southeast some gas stations have our delicious louisiana community coffee its my goto when i dont have time to make coffee before work
would you go to a resturant where you can pick your own waitress and waiter tbh some click better with you then the other
yes but i dont know how such a thing could work without a lot of awkwardness
  it would invariably lead to hiring bimbos and no minorities which is rather problematic in this day and age
  thanks op for remembering my thread it never get the attention it needed
  id rather go to a conveyor belt restaurant i like which watching things go round and round
go to the store for some sherbert  all they have is sorbette  anyone else getting tired of this shit
  eat soft serve like a normal person
  but fruit flavoured ice cream is almost as bad as ice cream flavoured sherbert
  its sorbet you bong
  no because its not 1992 and im not 7
whats a good all around hot sauce to use on everything that needs some spice
tabasco
im going to fucking say it fuck tabasco and fuck sriracha sweet chili thai is highly under appreciated as far as spicy sauces go
i go on a solid rotation of taptatio cholula sriracha taboasco and whatever bottle happens to be on sale when i walk by
daves insanity sauce only pussy whiteboys cant handle it
i like this its called gator hammock hot sauce it has a good vinegar flavor with some heat that builds up pretty well
  tabasco is awful consistency of water absolute garbage
  this shit is my favorite hands down i love the flavor and it has some nice heat
ive been using a lot of gringo bandito lately but also unironically secret aardvark
great taste  clean finish  nevers washes out flavors
marie sharpes
  i think tabasco is good it has a sweet/sour vinegary taste and pairs well with certain foods it definitely has a more dynamic taste than something like texas pete
  franks
  i hate sweet chili thai way too corn syrupy in all the kinds ive tried    my little brother used to eat it on everything as a kid and it grossed me out like on mashed potatoes turkey and stuffing all doused with sweet chili thai
  tapatio
  dude i was super into spicy stuff as a kid when i realized my parents didnt fucking season shit and i put a whole tablespoon of it on some stone wheat thins and ate it all    was in agony for the rest of the day it was hilarious
about to start a job as a cook/pizza maker at a local mom and pops pizzeria ive never worked at one before and im kind of nervous does /ck/ have any advice for me
  nope nobody here knows how to cook shit just talk about fast food and whine about niggers dont think a single person here has cooked anything that didnt have a microwave time under 5 mins
  im a full time line cook and eat fast food almost every day and usually post about it
  dont make intercourse with pizza mans daughter
  can i get some protips and shit then anon  in return babes that i hopefully wont get banned for posting      duly noted
  they will most likely drone you on how to cook the pizza  it will make u look like a good worker if u take notes so u dont have to ask questions if you forget how something is done  if u do forget ask before u ruin the dish
  unless you lied on your resume/interview theyll be aware that you have no experience and train you just dont expect to have your hand held and be prepared to work right off the bat dont stand around like a deer in the headlights    this  is also decent advice when youve been doing something for awhile it becomes second nature and its annoying to have to show someone what to do more than once
    thanks    ive been watching lots of videos on how to stretch dough and it seems like there are dozens of different techniques do you have any tips on how to make sure you dont fuck up the dough
  tell us where anon generally so i know what kind of tier pizza you will be making
  im in upstate ny and its ny style
  smoke weed every day it just werks
  ok long island here so youre in the middle of nowhere so dont worry the expectations are low the pizza is shit up there     if you were in the nyc metro area id tell you to absorb everything you know and think about opening your own place one day but anywhere outside of nyc metro eh just do what they tell you
  id like to make it to the nyc area sometime and try their pizza is it that much better than upstate
  yes    and yes save up your money get down here spend the night in one of the boros and visit different nyc pizza places then go back home it will change your life
the owner will want you to cuck him beware because when you do hell shove his thumb in your but mid stroke
  put in an honest effort dont be afraid to ask questions or admit you dont know how to do something like bosses from other careers his/her way is the only correct way unless you can prove otherwise more than one way to skin a cat etc    if you prove to be capable at not screwing up a damn pizza just be wary if the owners take advantage of your assistance untimely paycheck unreasonable hours cross city delivery and the like mom and pop restaurants pride themselves on the reputation alone wash/rinse your hands at any given opportunity plan your day and you probably dont need to be smoking that many cigarettes good luck anon
  thanks
  always keep it organized when youre done with something put it away when feeling rushed just remember one ticket at a time when you rush you make mistakes and end up spending more time on the dish your down time is your up time
portion control will make your boss love you   always greet customers asap and have a warm welcome even if they are degenerate drunks looking for a slice   always give the best deal pizza places are about turn over repeat customers and high volume dont be like pajeet pizza hut franchise owner where theres a promotion and the customer doesnt know so you charge full price let the customer know you gave them a deal they will be repeat  just be friendly with customers dont be a deadbeat and just hand people their pizza     and finally clean and organize the way the owner wants if they are filthy and dont clean dont go along with it just have good work ethic     oh and the customer is always right unless its an immediate monetary dispute like they cant pay
              anon stop seeking for attention with your shitty pics
  speak for yourself im quite good at cooking
  zishy is great
  what kind of oven do they have
  balls  yikes
  its a double stacked conveyor belt oven
  so thats absolute pleb tier then its gonna be real easy to work there
  balls

whats your favorite foods at walt disney world
  the only things i remember sticking out were a napoleon at the french pavilion and something at the mexican pavilion with a lot of cheese both of course are in epcot i had a decent meal at the rainforest cafe as well    i had a pleasant experience at the pinocchio fast food and the 2 floor saloon with the live show in the magic kingdom but i doubt it was due to the food    just whatever you do if you go to the key west resort dont get their key lime tartlet it was the worst key lime pie i have ever had though the restaurant was nice
  chug it you pussy
throw it in the trash
  make chex mix
  drink it
  no      no      i dont like chex       no i mean what do i put it on i want to use it like the romans used garum but uhh i dont know how to cook jack shit am i just supposed to make durum noodles and put this on them
  you add it to stews or shit like that in small quantities this aint some dipping sauce or something g you drench your food in
  use it with beefy shit  dont use it on chicken    nice on chips too but hendersons is superior
  its main use is in cooking not as a condiment    use in marinades add to savory stews or soups its good in fryups hash browns add to ketchup to make a good tonkatsu sauce etc
  also pork  and how could i forget rarebit  make a thick cheese sauce with nonshit cheese add a nice splash of worcestershire bit of cayenne mustard and a half cup of beer  spread on toast      hendos is way better on hash browns though
make cheese on toast  splash that shit all over the top
  unironically put it on almost everything you eat outside of maybe ice cream its the most abusable condiment in existence and nearly impossible to go wrong with
  lazy fucker      hendos is much better even goes nice on ice cream
  only practical application is to either your meatloaf or your anus
  in what sense is that lazy
  just splash it over the top of cheese on toast  dont spend five minutes making good rarebit
  hendos  no anchovies  whats the point
  were posting on an oriental cartoon enthusiast forum most of us just have microwaves and wouldnt even be able to begin figuring out how to do shit like that if theres an option that just involves dumping a bottle of some condiment onto some ready made food then thats probably the option to go with
  im not really a fan of rarebit i think its the added flour makes it feel a bit too heavy     for me its cheese on toast
nobodys mentioned steak  wtf its steak sauce
  yeah i get that beer balances it out nice      i share an oven with seven other people
its great for adding richness for lack of a better term to things like stew and chilli
  sloppy joes
  wtf is a sloppy joe
  heaven on earth
  never heard of a sloppy joe
  toasted bread  buttered  sharp cheddar cheese shredded on top  turn the broiler on   dash some lea and perrins on the cheese  broil until somewhat gooey then keep going until cheese starts to create a crust   remove     easy snack
  no
  yes
  add in small quantity to dishes when you need a umami booster
  goes great with stews and seafood
  its like a sloppy mcrib
  i dont like chex  how do you not like wheat rice or corn
  i was going to say i sprinkle a little over my steak after its cooked and resting i like the additional umami hit i use it in red meat stews and my super secret beef/venison jerky marinade as well brits nailed that sauce they did
  literally just mince onions and tomatos  so pleb ragu
  sloppy joe beef  mcrib pork  yup same thing
    a sloppy joe is a sandwich consisting of ground beef or pork
  most recipes call for beef since its more common than ground pork
  chug it you fag
  the history of the sauce is pretty funny though some royalty wanted a sauce similar in flavor to all the shit they were getting out of india at the time at the height of colonialism so the 2 guys made worchestishire and it was fucking awful then someone tried it again later after it had set on a shelf for a few years so they really didnt nail it it was a complete accident and it tastes nothing like indian food
  make chex mix
/ck/ im so mad i cant even begin to explain to you my last shred of humanity is gone and i am a shadow of a man     be me earlier today    live with my grandmother    she constantly cock blocks me by being really awkward whenever i bring girls back to the house and hording shit like fucking crazy never throwing anything away   whatever shell be dead soon then the house will be mine and i can throw her shit in a garbage can    i bought this massive slab of lamb it was lean as shit so careful the fuck not to dry it out    grandma fucking sees it    she expects she is the one to prepare it    no grandma youre blind as shit and have no sense of taste i literally just watched you drop a piece of salami on the floor and pick it up covered in carpet particles then eat it   oh ill cook it tonight dear thatll be nice ill do some potatoes and carrots to go with it    nan if you touch that fucking thing i swear to god youre going to a nursing home    get home from work    look in the fucking oven    sweet mother of god what has she done   this old lady put 6 pounds of fresh lamb in the oven turned it up as high as it goes and just let it fucking go all day its literally black to look at i wept a little   she blamed the fucking butcher for it being tough   you should have gone to the other one across town hes the good butcher    old lady its not his fault you decided to plunge it into fucking hellfire for 12 hours     old ladies ruining our food stories go i could use some cheering up

theres a man in my town he reviews things he uh never gives a bad review either its kind of hard to explain but the real benefit of his reviews doesnt have anything to do with how the food tastes i think most people are aware of this so im on the side of the reviewer for once i think its uncouth to point out the apparent pointlessness of his reviews

  theres a restaurant in kc called blue sushi i went there for the first time with a girl i was dating at the time i think i made a reservation on opentable or maybe just looked it up on yelp    one of the more verbose reviews was from some clod who bore the selfappointed title of professional restaurant reviewer or somesuch nonsense    about 80 of his review concerned how classy the place is this impression was staked by the fact that the place serves their table water with a slice of cucumber he went on and on about how he had only seen that before in michelinstar restaurants of which there are none in kc i think he continued about the lighting the decor the furniture the view of rainbow blvd if you know where that is  there really is nothing to see what the staff was wearing and countless other nonfoodrelated observations    he wrapped up the review by telling the readers that hes not really a sushi guy and he just had some appetizers he wrote that he would come back with someone who likes sushi to give their impression of the food    i thought maybe he was trolling but i found several of his other reviews of places that i knew and they were all a little daft    i looked for the review but couldnt find it it was funny
  good story    i laughed i cried
  fuck off funnyjnk
  reddit app
  i dont think you meant to reply to me
  more like arnold derpsen xd
  oh so op is arnold it makes sense now
    more like aknob dicksuck heh
  based and redpilled tuan lieu
  why is it always fags who have clown pictures as their pfps    this nibba got riced
  tuan is too based for edgy clown boy
  no reason to be racist anon that was unnecessarily rude and uncalled for
  this will go over well
  probably drinks faygo by the gallon  has a kitchen stocked with meat cleavers
  edgerton  ton of edge
  unbased and cringepilled
    hey its arnold the faggot derksen
i post reviews on google pretty regularly i dont really eat at many fast food chains so pretty much all my restaurant reviews are for family owned single location sort of places    i think most of my reviews give 4 or 5 stars if i go to a restaurant that i dont like i wont review it i simply wont return to that restaurant  one star reviews can damage businesses and thats bad for the whole community if places shut down and people become unemployed and go on welfare
  seriously the guy just wants to post a nice review of a meal he ate and some edgelord faggot has to be all edgy
  this is all an elaborate ruse you have convinced most others well done my friend heh
  simpsons did it  
the chad tuan  vs  the virgin arnold
  even if his review basically translates to it wasnt shit thats a useful data point in deciding whether to eat there
  edgerton  ton of edge  ton in that sense is town derived from a middle english word for an enclosed group of buildings    so town of edge or town on the edge  which makes way more sense and sounds way edgier to me
honestly pretty pissed at arnold but glad everybody roasted him itt    7/10
this tuan lieu is getting out of control we have to do something
  theres a man in my town he reviews things  why did i start reading this to the tune of the man comes around
  based than dabbing on the overlyemotional manchild who has to bully others to feel adequate
  what kind of retard shits on reviews like this
  virgin arnold and chad tuan
why are people so upset with this hes obviously an i like everything guy this is a burger for someone that isnt a spice freak but enjoys the occasional change of pace   does he need to swear or something i dont understand the problem
i guess someone should now show tuan all the posts arnold has made on here including the one that touches on racism
  but that also creates a system that is rife for exploitation
  who gives a flying fuck arnold   it was a good burger so he posted a review saying it was a good burger whats your damage
  probably because of the copious amounts of dicks in your mouth
  havent you ever been taught that if you dont got anything nice to say then you dont say anything at all tuan seems to have some manners unlike arnold
  seriously fuck arnold imagine being a fastfood review reviewer
  based tuan
i fucking hate arnold
works at jiffylube  criticizes other peoples fast food reviews  browses fast food reviews to begin with  really like edgy clowns  what the hell went wrong in arnolds life
so arnold when you made this thread i bet you werent expecting to get rekt so hard were you faggot
 itt arnold unequivocally btfo
tfw a man thinks that hes cool for bullying an innocent man making a post about a hamburger
spooky clown profile pic  edgerton  in the current year of our lord  jfc arnold did he become maturity stunted in 2006 or some shit
  reviewing local fast food franchises is a service to the community  one he didnt do he just paid lip service to a fucking burger he got just like he paid lip service to every single other thing he ever posted about he literally doesnt review anything
  this is how bitches fight tuan lieu  if they have even a remotely accurate point to cling to they will consistently screech muh changing argument to anyone that tries to elaborate on a point  tuan lieu is a nigger fag queerbag and you cockmunching dildosleeves can fuck the fuck off
  t arnold
    arnold you need to change your profile picture its hard to take you seriously
  hey arnold
  are you aware that your post says based and redpilled ive been seeing a lot of this recently and im wondering if there is a word filter again
  based and redpilled
  dildosleeves  tryhard insult not as funny as you think  i actually think this really could be arnold now because it seems like something someone with that whole hot topic aesthetic would say
  you read as someone that has the same mental processing as arnold     you are complaining about what other people do with their life   think about it what you are doing even if its just for a few minutes a day which im inclined to think its not the case could be seen as sitting down reading some social media post about someone you do not know personally and about stuff you claim you do not care about take it personally for some reason or other and proceed to post a few lines that only come out as a rant   and in the case of arnold those lines are not posted in his own social media but clings to the post of another person in order to in my opinion leech atention     some people might see that as pathetic     im not critizing you btw only making an observation
  bullied  lol can you post the continuation
  the lady doth protest too much
  doesnt look like its there anymore knowing you guys your harassment probably made him think it was wise to delete it
unironically siding with any of these two losers  i wish i could bully all of you at the same time
    the madman actually said it
  food was tasty  beer was cold  thats a pointless review brings no important information at all and any dingus can do such type of reviews
  a blizzard isnt beer ivan
  not russian and it doesnt change what i said though the guy in ops thread is pretty much pic related tier food reviewer
  not russian  sure thing vladimir
  artem
  why is arnold reading reviews of dq then what useful information does he expect to find
  he should really focus less on who enjoys what and more on why he went to welding school and yet works at jiffy lube and changing that avatar
arnold is a fucking retard like preparation differences do not exist
    holy fuck based
    get him fired
    this post is just as bad
  no better or different than any other  the ingredients maybe the preparation and presentation are hugely variant depending on the store and whos working there    for me if a fast food place has hot food thick shakes and doesnt serve me cold/soggy fries its an a servicewise the food quality is up to the company and thats a different story
  how quickly his clown mask slipped hes just on a crusade against fast food
  what do you do if a local business becomes a successful national corporation
  tfw no matter how bad things get youll never be as faggy as arnold
  tuan more like twat
sign me up for teamtuan 3
  a moron toothe amount that the bun is toasted the amount of sauce used and the temperature at which the food was served is dependent on whatever the employees are doing at the time
  bet you have no friends lole
  based tuan btfos arnold
  its slave morality
  arnold has a point
  this arnold fella i mean uh this guy is a real jerk
is arnold a child or simply a faggot
  lol
  stop liking things made by corporations youre giving them free advertizing  why not advertize my small business so i profit instead  arnold is being a bit of a dick tbqh
  most of these places are franchises anyway arnold is being a retard
  studied welding  used to work in an oilfield  now works at jiffylube    where did it all go wrong for arnold
damn we really do be living in a society where people eat at fast food establishments
  ahem    fuck jannies and fuck arnold
have never seen a man btfo so hard in my entire life
  youre not even using the right slur arnold
i like that this thread is being kept alive
does arnold an hero yet
  seems like both
  theyre trying to say based and bluepilled but it keeps turning into red because of shills
riced
  if you dont got anything nice to say then you dont say anything at all  sounds fascist i have the right to voice my opinion regardless of your feelings
  lol nobodys saying you shouldnt have that right its just a warning that if you do it youll look like a whiny faggot like arnold
arnold gets btfo itt  arnold shows up to defend himself  gets btfo again  arnold is a jerk and a retard it seems
  what does this mean
  theres a guy in my town who does the same shit posts on our local page constantly nobody gives a fuck about your trip to east sides faggot
buy two chicken breasts for a good price  start cooking them  notice the sticker on the packaging  extra lean  like chewing on rubber  ffffuuuuuuuuuu
  ops status  x trolled epic style
why dont you just buy the whole chicken / buy cheaper parts like the leg or the thigh
  the breast is probably the worst cut of the chicken flavor wise but its most versatile
extra lean chicken tastes great when you add fat
  ignoring the samefagging  all chicken breasts are extra lean you nigger faggot
  extra lean  chicken breast  no shit how the fuck did you cook them
  thats a weird drawing you did for your post its strangely appealing despite being awful but it has nothing to do with food and cooking
  unironically i boiled them but its for a specific dish where ive always boiled them and they never come out like this
  when poaching chicken dont leave it on the burner bring it to the boil boil for about five minutes then remove from the heat and leave it in the hot water for about half an hour tender chicken every time and you can use the water for soup later on or you can shred the chicken and have chicken soup right now
  thanks for the tip ill try that next time
foods only you like    for me its canned mackerel
  how do you prepare it
  take out the bones    put some oil in a pan  soften up some chopped onions and tomatos in there  add the mackerel and the sauce it came in  cook that shit up    sometimes i add those things asian noodles in them if im feeling fancy then i eat it with rice    i eat the leftovers cold with hot rice and its still good    wife thinks its disgusting that i even buy it
  i love that shit so much where are you from the shit i used to get had bones that were edible because they were so soft from the cooking it was precooked
  so how do you eat it ive got a can of that stuff i dont know what to do with
  only i like smoked salmon  fuck off
  on toast how can you be so retarded
  canned fish always has edible bones its not even cooked before its canned the canning process is what cooks the stupid fish  i wish the bones were hard theyd be easier to remove they make the back of my throat scratchy
  whats with the weirdass shaped can
  probably my homecanned salmon everyone is paranoid to eat it although i followed the ak university guidelines for canning smoked salmon tastes goat af too so theyre missing out on a treat
jizzus has returned

it looks pretty shite but heres my red beef stew
  looks better than any meal ive had for the last 2 years
  that looks good   whats your recipeh
looks good to me why didnt you chop those potatoes a bit though especially considering how you chopped the carrots
  not him but all stews and braises folllw the exact same procedure its up to you to decide how you want it to taste
peppers   thats gonna be a yikes from me
  beef steak cut into small bites braised with onions and garlic tomato paste carrots broccoli and cauliflower with small sausages and bell peppers i added a cup of beef stock for good measure
  forgot to say i had some leftover buttered potatoes to go with it with bay leaves for good measure
    not sure about the use of bay leaves there but it sounds pretty good honestly
  8/10 would be better if you added some cooking wine with the beef
  cooking wine  if you wouldnt drink it dont cook with it
  nice one
  unfortunately i only have sake vodka and jd with me and i didnt wanna use any of them not much of a wine person to be honest
  looks pretty shit  european style stews should not just be chunks of stuff in a thin liquid the liquid should be thick and as much a feature as the solids it might be tasty but it fails at being a stew the beef also doesnt look tender   3/10 apply yourself
  when it comes to stews sometimes i like to pan sear my chuck and use some red wine to deglaze the pan before i put in my stock n veggies
  implying anyone here unironically wants european recipes
  best stew uses like 75 red wine and 25 water or stock
  hes right thought after your stew come to a simmer in your dutch oven cover it and put it in a 300 degree oven for 3 hours check / stir it every 30 minutes or so
  looks good anon
  tough times
  looks good anon would eat
  i see your also from kingston university
  looks fine to me bro

thoughts on arbys they serve sandwiches among other things but most people know them for their beefs just a hint put your curly fries on top of the beef beneath the top bun with your choice of sauce it makes the sandwich 20 percent cooler
  tbqhwyfam i love arbys but dont go much because the closest one is a half hour away the one in my town closed when i lived in other places id go a lot and when i was commuting past it i would often stop there after work on the way home roast beef is unparalleled but more recently i would also have their gyros and italian sub and pepperoni rolls never disappointed once definitely a step above most other fast food
that pecan chicken salad sandwich is sex
who makes the best bread in the world and why is it uzbeks
  why    1 good weather to maintain yeast growth  2 efficient tandoori style oven  3 hole in the middle on loaves of bread for better baking
  no one asked why though
  why is it uzbeks    i know reading one whole sentence is hard
  no one asked  why is it uzbeks  how did you manage to pass 2nd grade does your mom give good head
  wow i was literally thinking about thjs question 3 days ago and i also decided on the uzbeks a lepyoshka fresh out of the tandoor is literally the best bread in the world and the uzbeks do jt better than any other central asian country
  ah yes the im legitimately retarded bait i am familiar with this tactic
the flatbread made by tajiks kazakhs and kyrgyz is essentially the same central asian bread making is just top notch i wish i had this kind of bread around here _
imagine eating crappy loafers of bread  this post was graciously offered by altamura gang
wood smoke infused cancer bread  no thanks
  bread baked in woodfired ovens causes cancer  all bread until the mid 20th century was baked in woodfired ovens and cancer rates were much lower  really makes you think
  salentino schifoso
  swedish crispbread best bread
imagine belonging to such a failed culture that you dont actually rise your bread properly lol you just take a mash of grain let it sit out until it rots and ferments and then bake it and you call it culture lol      im going to throw flatbreads right into the same vein as any culture that doesnt appreciate dogs is a failed culture among nigger tier
  and cancer rates were much lower  because people died of other things before the cancer got em     makes you think  it does
  people died of other things before the cancer got em  yeah thats kind of the meaning of cancer rates being much lower unless youre implying people didnt live as long because thats false life expectancies in the past were lower due to high rates of infant mortality people who made it past 30 lived just as long as today
  not just as long as today once you made it to 20 your life expectancy was still 6570 or so a good 1520 years shorter than now even then most of that 1015 years we gained from germ theory and basic sanitation its not even until recently that we could reliably fight cancer
  life expectancies in the past were lower due to high rates of infant mortality  thats certainly a big factor but its not the only one    there are countless diseases or conditions that would have been a death sentence even as recent as 100 years ago yet today we can treat with no problem
  6570 or so a good 1520 years shorter than now  us avg is  78 actually declined the last 2 years so it wasnt that much longer
    only tastelets consider personal tastes objective
  looks like a slop o shit
  pane veramente merdoso
  uzbek non is not flatbread sir
    i heard somewhere that timur the local genocidal idol who built awesome shit in the area used to have bread beeing brought to him personally from bukhara wherever he was massmurdering/pillaging even thousands of km away if the bread wasnt good enough hed have the baker executed too lazy to factcheck though
  looks real nice
  holy shit kill yourself
