post the most just animals you can find
literally any kind of stork stupid ugly giraffebirds
  when sebulba fucks camel joe
  what is that
this dog is fucked
  whats this frog called been desperate to know for years
  bill
  good to know
  rhinophrynus dorsalis
  thanks man that really helps
  its weird that these things were only discovered a few years ago
  this one is actually just because its dying in agony
  i think that fish actually looks normal in deep ocean because of water pressure its just looks fucked near the surface and probably dead/dying
  dont be fooled by our data collection stuff there is still a lot of leg work to do in the wild even if we are destroying it
  yeah they look a lot different under water
  release
  j u s t
  probably already dead most abyssopelagic animals do not survive the rapid pressure change getting fished up
kill me please
  not that fucked the babies are just glued onto the back using some type of mucus the real justs are pipas which rear the eggs under their skin
  looks like a fucking demon
  dios mio la creatura
  el chupacabras
  la luz extinguido
  el camello zordo vuelador
  this made it worse
  for fucks sake
  wolf eel
  now thats a real rare frog
    never notice me or my son again
  is this real or shopped why do they do this
  male frogs hang out on female frogs backs when they mate so they can jizz on the eggs as soon as she releases them its called amplexus
  that picture is straight shota
  me
  actually this looks sleek as fuck with that color combination and smooth shape
  how does its appearance change so much just from pressure change
  more like giantess    but its true that males are generally younger than females in almost every animal
  for one its so delicate that the net completely ripped off all of the skin the rest is that its head is really flabby and jellylike gravity isnt kind to that type of material
  die the most horrific death imaginable   get laughed at for years on the internet and named the worlds ugliest animal on buzzfeed or some shit  about as just as it gets
    s m a s h e d  l  a  m  m  e  d
  its lived its entire life and has evolved to live in extreme pressures compared to our above water atmosphere  its basically boiling
  i remember looking up shit about the giant huntsman spider and was really surprised to find such a huge spider wasnt discovered/named or whatever until 2001 and apparently other spiders in the same family have been found in recent years too and are also pretty big  wwf even said some of these species really have no business being recently discovered
  cute
sun bear
  well i sure as fuck wouldnt keep it
le monke omege
  wtf is this
  dog
  thats an insect infected with cordyceps fungi as indicated by the picture name
  looks like an angry old man telling kids to stay off his lawn
  anime  multilple holes  holes with stuff in them    ugh my stomach
  tfw yourre mustard
  what are those things for
  pheremone glands on a male sphynx moth
  mfw i mentally sum up efforts i have exerted in my life to better my dominance
  looks like me and my blimp of a girlfriend in bed
  it makes me angry when i see people holding bats like this its incredibly uncomfortable to them and probably painful as fuck      hammerheaded bat its a type of fruit bat
so basically i am never looking up naked bear without safe search on ever fucking again
  the boys eyes were bigger than his stomach
  thats horrifying
  arapaimas are actually chads
i hate these dainty bois

why do indian elephants all look like malnourished underdeveloped versions of african elephants
  because theyre indian dumbass
  was thinking this stupid dog
  hikki chimp
  everything on the subcontinent looks like shit for some reason
  theyre also beta cowards who let humans walk all over them you try getting an african elephant to haul wood for bananas
  indian elephants are closer relatives to mammoths than to african elephants
  youre retarded theyre the most bro of all spider species and actaully eat other more irritating ones
  finally clone the mammoth  its just some shitty indian elephant with literal just hair

  can anyone give me a quick rundown on this fish
  scientific name is t bogdanicthys
  please remove this picture of me
  thats an asian sheepshead wrasse and its ugly as hell    pretty smart though one individual has been visiting a diver who goes to see it for 25 years
  chupacabra
  someones been throwing bog pills into the ocean
  its a baby swan
  such a big boi
  kek
  looks like a halo brute  bears are most closely related to wolves arent they
    is that a fucking jersey devil
  indians  everything is suddenly shit  not even once
  jersey devil
  all the dissolved oxygen in its blood comes out of solution in large volumes when the pressure drops and completely fucks all tissues
  virgin indian living forklift vs chad african thunderfoot
  then how come ones alive in an aquarium right now
  maybe they caught it in a pressure vessel and brought it up that way
  gradual pressure reduction rather than fast come on anon you know this up your game bucko
    they caught it in a gill net nets come up pretty fast as far as im aware
  to be fair the asiatic lions are very inbred since people bottlenecked the shit out of them
  most dog breeds and most bear breeds shared a common ancestor a long time ago
  this reminds me of anderson cooper
  this fucks me up i wonder how long the pigeon was conscious for
  dude what are they ive always wondered
    fuck this is my first time coming here in years and the first thing i see is that

    thank goodness for complex human immune systems
  ive never seen this before and it has to be the most terrifying animal to exist holy shit it definitely reminds me of the jersey devil
  immunelets get fucked up by fungi often
  imagine if that picture was taken from inside of a hospital room
  im pretty certain those are its penis the same way snakes have a y shaped penis
  get my penis off the internet
  thanking your immune system    yeah sure hes all good and all except when he isnt
  what do you want smoothskin
  immunerelated diseases are the worst fucking thing that exists i was diagnosed with one last year and ive pretty much had to accept that im fucked for life
  thats just like your opinion man
  its not that vertebrates are just too big and complicated for stuff like cordyceps to work on
  an insect infected by a cordyceps fungus which is a genus of fungus with a particular reproductive strategy each specific species infects a specific insect and grows inside their body until the fungus is ready then they burst out and spread their spores so the cycle can begin again  i dont know if all cordyceps do the following but at least some of them even use biochemical trickery to puppeteer their host into a favourable position to infect as many new hosts as possible for example a cordyceps that infects ants might force its host to climb up a stalk of grass hanging over an ant trail
  seems like a doggu to me
  underrated
  actually warm bloodedness is one of the large factors that helps against fungi  reptiles have lots of problems with fungus too
  its actually the fact we are warmblooded that most fungal pathogens have a hard time       i cultivate cordyceps militaris
  is that an independence day reference

  i met a traveller from an antique land  who saidtwo vast and trunkless legs of stone  stand in the desert    near them on the sand  half sunk a shattered visage lies whose frown  and wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command  tell that its sculptor well those passions read  which yet survive stamped on these lifeless things  the hand that mocked them and the heart that fed  and on the pedestal these words appear  my name is ozymandias king of kings  look on my works ye mighty and despair  nothing beside remains round the decay  of that colossal wreck boundless and bare  the lone and level sands stretch far away
  wow look at those muscles

    indian wildlife elephants in particular are harrassed by various members of the pokeverse
  with the orange spots and racing stripe that slick finish and that strong tank build i dont think so he looks pretty good to me i think youre just jealous
  he cute
  im angry angry about elves

  its been almost a week and i cant stop laughing at this
  pige
  do they sound how they look
  this thing is a fictional rare species fourtunately but hes freaky and repulsive as shit and unfortunately to add fuel to the fire they paired this little ugly shit with a fucking foxan underage one
  for some reason im feel dirty for just looking at this thing he looks like the result of a threesome between freddie freaker gurgi and sid from ice age
  its evolved to survive the pressure at the bottom of the ocean if i recall correctly the end result is that this fish has almost no muscles because the pressure kind of fills that role but it also exerts pressure outwards so when we fish it up here where the pressure is much much less the blobfishs own pressure kind of causes it to spill out
  and unfortunately to add fuel to the fire they paired this little ugly shit with a fucking foxan underage one  like for real these assholes hadnt even attempted to make it subtle in the slightest are we seriously supposed to be heartwarmed by this nightmare 
  do you know what fictional means
  yes but i dont give a shit that thing is bizzare and hes also a shitty character
  thats not very current year of you anon
2883930  2883936  2883948  i thought youd either killed yourself or got permabanned i was hoping for the former

  it can fly and it can fuck in fact thats how it flies
  because indian elephants do all that gay shit wheras african elephants are like nah miss me wit that gay shit nigga cut that shit out of my life son
  theyre always smiling through all the pain they feel
  these arent that bad when they get exercise and arent feed table scraps people are just assholes and dont do research before buying that lol cute little teacup piggy only get 5 pounds 
  so why do the parents keep feeding the cuckoo does it threaten them with aggression
  nope vietnamese pigs are supposed to be fat thats how they were originally bread the vietnamese keep them for fatty spare ribs and use them to cover their tunnels if they dont look like rush limbaugh you are underfeeding it if i see a pig thats too skinny i might mistake it for a hog and magdump into it with my ar15
    what a collection of units  in awe at the size of these snorters
  in this case id have to agree with the wwf
whats the name of that retarded wolf that looks like a bad photoshop
  the one with the wide head tibetan fox
  ive been looking for this animals name for like a year thank you
  glad i could help theyre bizarre looking
  wild boars are peak aestethic those just look like us minorities
  so xenomrophs basically
  those long nipples are physically painful to look at why do monkeys have such fucking weird bodies
  birbs can be dumb as hell anon
  damn they curved just in fucking time
  tfw too fat to see
    why
more than 75 percent decline over 27 years in total flying insect biomass in protected areas  without pollinators our food supply will collapse is this the end  
  no just the end of overpop just as planned
  i hope so
  i love how everyone keeps trying to pretend we dont know gmo crops and associated overuse of herbicides and pesticides is the cause
  fuck bugs
  fuck humans
  fuck niggers/kikes
  gmos usually result in less use of herbicides    not saying its not all herbicides and pesticides that are responsible but this had to have been an ongoing trend before gmos were introduced
  stop shilling to us bayer  gmos need more herbicides  this is a fact
  incorrect gmo doesnt need more herbicides but it does allow more indiscriminate use of herbicide to create increased yields
  gmos usually result in less use of herbicides  literally the absolute fucking opposite of reality particularly roundup ready crops encourage farmers to absolutely spamblast herbicides fucking everywhere
  are we all going to die    that was inevitable regardless of any manmade ecological catastrophe or did you think you would live forever
  in other words it encourages excessive use which is enough to make it happen
  we refers to humanity not any individual human in this context
  had birds fully recovered from ddt use in germany by 1990    where i live i saw steady increases in bird numbers and decreases in arthropod numbers for the last 20 years including bald eagles and bluebirds going from something you were excited to see to being something you saw every day and garden orb web spiders going from something we had many of every year to being something it was exciting to find
  ahem
  is there much agriculture around where you live by any chance
  these things are why i got into environmental science but also why i got out its just too much man  just a fucking massive burden
  its like being a nurse at a hospice at this point
  without pollinators our food supply will collapse  most of our food crops dont require pollination    when we do need something pollinated by insects we use domestic insects not wild ones    so no basically nothing youre saying is true loss of insect diversity is a problem in a lot of ways but not that one
  my statement still applies
  technically although youre purposefully missing the point
  most ecologists and entomologists ive seen commenting on this topic have said that losing insects would lead to a collapse of ecosystems and the end of human life
  yes thats true    however youd have to lose all insects and thats not happening we arent even losing the ones we count on to feed us
  we dont have nearly enough data but there are plenty of studies all over that suggest were losing insects in massive numbers especially flying insects
  we dont have nearly enough data  this problem was mentioned in the first edition of silent spring and it cited science from the 1930s this is not some new concern    we dont count on wild insects for food so the loss of insects has no affect on that you could wipe them all out and wed still be pollinating crops with domesticated honeybees
  and then some other bugs will replace them and all of you will go wow im shock and find some other reason to claim doomsday is upon us
  yes but losing wild insects will cause our ecosystems to collapse
  agreed but it wont cause our food supply to collapse
  i guess it is climate related issue which wasnt caused by human activity btw  in moscow it looks like summer and winter had became shorter and this caused increase of insects hornets appeared which were extremely rare
  they also say that humans cannot survive if it collapses
  also  loss of wild pollinators serious threat to crop yields study finds  
  probably way too many things are going wrong too fast at the same time weve fucked with too many things we didnt/dont fully understand and that hubris will be our downfall
  care to give me a list of the things youre aware of
  you are incorrect gmo crops were engineered specifically to resist certain pesticides that eliminate all native flora     even the newest monsantos banger coated seeds are sold to farmers advertising less spraying but the seeds themselves inundate the soil just after a few seasons in the ground     sorry mike thats a no from me
  its mostly pasturage and hay but there is some rowcropping
  rowcropping  not sure about bird numbers related to ddt but there is this  
  it is if the human population is not reduced drastically and very soon this world will face an extinction event that may compare to the endcretaceous
  i guess it is climate related issue which wasnt caused by human activity btw  one sentence and two falsehoods phenomenal use of your conservashit powers to do great evil here
  im starting to wonder if i should be working on being completely self sufficient and being able to support myself plus a few other people not that it wouldnt be anything short of a fulltime job to even attempt it
  overpopulation isnt the core issue though the ones fucking everything over are at the very top and people from developed countries consume vastly more resources than those from developing countries
  people from developed countries consume vastly more resources than those from developing countries  were doing our damn best to develop those developing counties and bring their living standards up to our levels this is happening everywhere now and its going to be an absolutely incredible disaster   just look at china for instance they pump out about a third of all co2 now over twice as much as the us and its only set to rise now there is some hope on that front since solar and wind power are actually cheaper now than fossil fuels in many places but that would only be solving one out of a whole host of issues
  but those from developing countries strive to use as many resources as middle class americans and do when given the oppirtunity would it be better if we were all dirt poor and had nothing just think how many more people we could jam onto the planet
get rid of dandelions so we can grow nice yards of grass  where are the bees going
  overpopulation isnt the core issue though  it absolutely is there is no way in hell this world can sustain several billion greedy human maws and an intact healthy biosphere
  a planet with a third world reproduction rate combined with a first world consumption rate is exactly what the capitalists want and the socialists have been frightened into supporting also    and it will absolutely destroy this world
  actually its all the pesticides and herbicides farmers are pumping into the environment who knew filling the world with poison was a bad idea
    its both pesticides habitat loss and climate change are stated as contributing to the issue
  climate change is not the issue it never is thats just something nustems insist on throwing into their stories literally any time anything happens climate change will destroy humans not nature
  climate change will destroy humans not nature  what utter nonsense of course its going to disrupt ecosystems it already is
  no its not human activities are this is a common and deceitful claim its easy to bitch about climate change and maybe get some carbon credit bullshit passed its impossible to attack the actual fucking problem which is that there are too fucking many humans on this planet capitalism is not sustainable in any form and that pollution agriculture sprawl logging and fishing are what are actually fucking everything up if you think a mildly warming climate is wiping out animals that prospered when the climate was multiple degrees celsius warmer then youre exactly the target audience for these fucking odious lies
  oh youre one of these lunatics who thinks that scientists and governments all over the world are conspiring in the most elaborate conspiracy ever in order to make us believe that the gases were putting out which demonstrably absorb radiation are absorbing radiation and causing the climate to change just to they can get more tax revenue yep that totally makes sense and isnt fucking retarded
  see  
  no you dipshit its just typical human laziness and rejection of responsibility for fixing anything every single one of these assholes screaming about global warming believes that green capitalism will fix it at the behest of some moron like elon musk the only way to fix it is get rid of humans youre a fucking plague and 100 of issues nuscientists claim are due to global warming are always fucking due to humans just trashing the fucking planet coral reefs dying is mostly due to agricultural runoff and siltation not global warming reefs without human presence almost completely recover after bleaching those near humans do not the golden toad is said to have been partly  its always partly because its never true killed off by global warming ignore the fact that fucking human termites destroyed all the rainforest it needed to live then spread a literal fucking fungal plague that wiped it out because theyre too lazy to take care of their pets and throw them into the nearest body of water yes its global warming killing off all the insects not the solar fucking metric fuckton of pesticides we fill the world with nope has nothing to do with anything    fixing     sprawl   overpopulation   agriculture   hunting/fishing   pollution    actually requires fucking work and hard choices which no pampered fucking western white parasite can cope with theyd rather live in fantasy land that technology will magically fix everything    it wont and youll die
  reefs without human presence almost completely recover after bleaching  can you point me to some examples
  ever heard of the honey bee mate     yea     well look into what they are doing to the native wild life
  hurrrr overpopulation is not the issue    when will this meme die
  good post    inb4 why dont you start by killing yourself then1    nice no u comeback faggots
  when we will stop being racist and stop help humanlike species
  its not about muh animals you fucking retarded faggot the best way to help the humanlike species is precisely by preserving the fucking planet we live in    nice bait tho
  you know we have this shit quite periodically so it is not human caused period is like 30 years or so 30 years of hot summer and extremely cold winter and 30 years or meh weather year round  furthermore there is no factories in russia left working and automobile meme is not as popular as in us    meh conditions when it is wet all year round causes more insects dryer and colder climate kills them
  i mean stop helping nmans they arent thankful for vaccines and shit at all and they fuck without stopping which exactly caused over pop  while europoors have 2 children at best they have 9000
    i cant find it now but there was a report a few years ago about the drastic difference in recovery between the average coral reef near human inhabited pig sties and reefs with an absence of human activity those reefs without human presence of pollution overfishing etc basically fully recovered in near absolute contrast to other reefs also modern aragonitebased coral reefs have been the norm since the end of the permian and the genus acropora  probably the dominant reefbuilding coral genus on earth  evolved in the late paleocene when this was going on      temperatures rose sharply during the paleoceneeocene thermal maximum the climate became warm and humid worldwide towards the eocene boundary with subtropical vegetation growing in greenland and patagonia crocodilians swimming off the coast of greenland and early primates evolving in the tropical palm forests of northern wyoming5 the earths poles were cool and temperate    they also survived the petm which was one of the hottest points in earths history outside of the hadean eon not to mention were in one of the coolest points in the entire cenozoic era during which this genus has exclusively existed    but no they couldnt possibly survive half a degree of warming for a bit now no everything is going to die due to less warming than the difference between the wisconsinan glaciation and the early pliocene epoch absolute bullshit keep in mind the same assholes who chant shit like this also are convinced climate change killed the mammoths it didnt it was just humans      never because both capitalists and socialists require the propaganda of eternal growth cancer for the survival of their systems humans are a disease      westerners waste more resources than anyone if were going to focus on whos destroying the environment the most whiteys ass is grass
  thats exactly it environmental work is palliative care
  im not saying apis mellifera is good for north america im saying spraying poison all over the planet incessantly is fucking retarded and has widespread consequences      hes just being /pol/ cancer his brain is empty of anything but memes from the 60s      white males are the worst cancer the world ever spawned you do the exact same shit as anyone you rail against except exponentially worse but its always okay when you do it perfect example    blacks are criminals who literally kill people  submits statistics that show slightly elevated felony rates among blacks compared to whites  meanwhile whites literally are     literally erasing the biosphere   kill millions of people every year through their forprofit wars for billionaires   literally are turning the entire world into a polluted fascist hellscape    and think this is all fine but no blacks are the problem because the rap music whites are absolute fucking cancer i mean how many fucking times has germany destroyed the world alone
  westerners waste more resources than anyone if were going to focus on whos destroying the environment the most whiteys ass is grass  on top of that were encouraging the rest of the world to aspire to our decadence
  it doesnt have to be it shouldnt be the core issues simply must be attacked humans need removed from land and ways must be found to do just that and any capitalist interests must be literally napalmed if ranchers dont like a nature preserve nuke their ranches from orbit if hunters dont like not being allowed to fuck up entire species then start issuing hunter hunting licenses humans need a serious fucking spanking from an angry god      and thats the absolute worst part its not sustainable you can not have a planet with a third world reproduction rate and a first world consumption rate we cant even sustain just what we have no for probably another 30 years and its ramping up literally every year
found some details on the coral reef recovery i was talking about        scott reef a remote coral system in the indian ocean has largely recovered from a catastrophic mass bleaching event in 1998 according to the study published in science today    the study challenges conventional wisdom that suggested isolated reefs were more vulnerable to disturbance because they were thought to depend on recolonisation from other reefs instead the scientists found that the isolation of reefs allowed surviving corals to rapidly grow and propagate in the absence of human interference    and another        most of the reefs around inhabited islands had been colonized by smothering macroalgae and fleshy algae  big seaweeds whose growth was likely spurred by the absence of fish natures lawnmowers and the presence of fertilizer runoff in the water these reefs were less complex less colorful less developed  a monotonous suburban subdivision to a healthy reefs thriving city    but another discovery surprised them if the reefs existed around uninhabited islands  away from localized problems like overfishing and pollution  they were often able to bounce back from global stressors relatively unscathed they were covered with healthy populations of coral and coralline algae    this is actually two entirely different oceans showing the same results global warming somehow isnt killing the reefs where humans are absent hmmm i fucking wonder why
  not that anon but im game    1 hunting fishing logging agriculture overpopulation and sprawl hunting has resulted in a mass extinction event since the pleistocene all on its own yes humans did it no global warming didnt)))  2 fucking insane amounts of pollution  primarily water pollution which is destroying the entire biospheres ability to support life  3 introduction of nonnative species which is spreading diseases and wiping out native species around the world    those are the top three but there are further implications removing all the forests wetlands and grasslands results in increasing aridity and decreasing precipitation leading to desertification and more extreme weather it also results in less ground and surface waters many rivers have halved in their average depth because all the forests near them have been logged for sprawl this results ironically in both more and worse droughts and more and worse flooding    thats just a sliver of the examples humans are fucking wrecking the shit out of this world if you had a child that did to your house what humans are doing to this planet youd beat them to death with a saucepan
  we have less and less westerners declining birth rate  and niggers breed as rabbits chinks too 
  there are over a billion westerners far too fucking many and regardless of birth rates americans specifically use many times as many resources as africans
    btw shit like this is exactly what ive been talking about humans especially white male humans are obsessed with shirking responsibility for their own actions everything is something or someone elses fault whites have done more damage to this world than the combination of all other races but it must be africas problem because fuck hiphop when africa is literally the only continent other than antarctica left on earth that has most of its megafauna intact    whites are fucking cancer
  youre definitely right about agricultural runoff and fishing practices killing reefs   remote coral reefs can be tougher than they look western australias scott reef has recovered from mass bleaching    prospects for the reef looked gloomy when in 1998 it suffered catastrophic mass bleaching losing around 80 of its coral cover the study shows that it took just 12 years to recover    that said your example of past climate change misses the point pic related its something that happened over millions of years giving life plenty of time to adapt now its happening over decades   the point is that were screwing life over in a whole host of ways climate change being just one of many
  yes i had a feeling someone would say that however refer again to the reefs that are far from humans theyre fine
  westerners waste more resources than anyone if were going to focus on whos destroying the environment the most whiteys ass is grass  not anymore china is responsible for the most pollution by far theyre pumping out roughly a third of all co2 now theyre dumping huge amount of plastic into the ocean just about all their rivers and lakes are horribly polluted their cities are chocked with cancer causing smog theyre building entire cities that stay empty just to push the growth of their economy
  white males are the worst cancer the world ever spawned  oh for fucks sake why are there always racist douches spewing their bullshit on every issue why dont you pull your head out of your ass and look at the pollution pumped out by china more than twice the co2 as the us
  thats no excuse for your consumption the us alone still consumes more oil and meat than any other country if you include the entire west they beat china on most metrics stop looking for others to blame based on the convenience of your smallminded tribalism    theyre pumping out roughly a third of all co2 now  who cares we need more    theyre dumping huge amount of plastic into the ocean  now there you are right and that needs to stop so fucking do something about it    just about all their rivers and lakes are horribly polluted  american rivers were so polluted they burst into flames until almost 1970 you have zero room to talk america in the 1900s probably looked worse than china does now    their cities are chocked with cancer causing smog  yeah same with america    theyre building entire cities that stay empty just to push the growth of their economy  americans wouldnt possibly ever do some retarded shit to prop up a ponzi economy though right fuck neonazis they get the bullet first      white males have been the overwhelming driving force behind the destruction of the environment in recorded history you did a pretty bangup job in the stone age too    sorry sweaty facts dont care about your feelings    china more than twice the co2 as the us  good more burn humans
  and ps global warming is actually good for earth its bad for humans let me let you in on a little secret which will become much less of a secret in the coming decade  there are 2 reasons humans keep screaming that global warming will destroy the world    1 global warming will destroy humans and humans know this it will end human civilization and probably the species as well but earth will benefit from a more tropical environment and the removal of the pestilent ape so long and thanks for all the carbon dont let the door from earth to the pit of hell hit you on your ass on your way out    2 however humans are still in the phase where they care about appearances and want to view themselves as not being the bad guy within the next 2 or 3 decades that mask will drop and humans will be honest about only caring about themselves being alive on this planet so they project global warming onto the planet as its problem when it never really was the planets true problem is humans but admitting this carries grave consequences for humanity and babybrained humans would rather ignore problems than fix them thing is you can ignore it all you want youre still going to die from it and the only solution is to remove about 90 of your number from existence and the remainder can not be allowed to sin ever again under penalty of death
  sure but were only really at the beginning of climate change we know that the ph levels of oceans are dropping and we know what thats going to do to calcium carbonate shells and exoskeletons before long  its just that near human populations youve got climate change related issues  pollution and fishing related issues
  sure but were only really at the beginning of climate change  good    we know that the ph levels of oceans are dropping  this is more bullshit the buffering capacity of the world ocean is far greater than the minute  of co2 in the atmosphere again this is fucking humans trying to spin the very obvious to all senses freshwater pollution being dumped directly onto coral reefs into global warming done it now human offshore waters are acidifying but thats what happens when you turn them into rancid toilets    its just that near human populations youve got climate change related issues  pollution and fishing related issues  and just what happens when you remove the pollution part the problem basically goes away innit take desertification its literally only possibly when humans tear up all the sod and log all the forests and drain all the wetlands sure global warming can increase the potency of it but this planet could be a fucking ice cube and wed still be having all the problems we are now global warming is not the problem it never was most of the history of life on this planet has experience significantly warmer temperatures than we currently languish in
  your consumption  what are you doing telling me all this on a computer how much are you consuming while telling me about my crimes    white males have been the overwhelming driving force behind the destruction of the environment in recorded history  fucking kek so white females must really just be along for the ride then i guess  no technology has just about every nation that has become technologically advanced is doing the same shit china does way more now than any western nation but you downplay this because youre a racist piece of shit who wants to blame the white male devil cunts like you are one of the reasons why nothing will ever get better you sow hate and division and prevent us from actually working together at least theres a silver lining in the fact that humanity is fucked pieces of disgusting selfrighteous shit like you will die along with the rest of us
  what are you doing telling me all this on a computer  youre against capitalism on on iphone sweaty  god /pol/ was a mistake
  doesnt understand what a massive racist and sexist hypocrite he is
  fuck white people your death would save this world im sorry if youre too weak to deal with the truth
  continues to ignore china being the greatest polluter  pretends to speak truth and tells people that facts dont care about their feelings while using selective facts to fuel his racist hate  ive never seen such projection
  birds that were once rare and had protective programs are doing btter but a shitload of normal birds are doing worse   even most seed eaters need to feed insects to their young and with modern agriculture robotic lawnmowers and everyone wanting to have pretty gardens and streets without dead trees weeds high grass or piles of leaves this is what you get
  china is not the greatest polluter it produces the most plastic in the oceans but thats new and theyre not the largest consumer of resources either unless were talking about rice    /pol/ needs to learn that simply repeating bullshit over and over again doesnt make it true
  they are like the fat kid that is eating cookies 3 at a time and ate already half of the yar sreaming at the 5 other kids that just came and start to take a cookie each that 5 cookies is too damn much
  whats it matter if its new its happening on ever larger scales and thats the problem   and im not arguing to ignore the problems of the us you are the one thats ignoring other problems to feed your racist fever dreams   its fucking hilarious that youre the racist in a conversation with someone you think is a /pol/tard youre every bit as disgusting as someone who goes on about terrible niggers are
  yep literally all propaganda neonazi shitheads use has always been projection they call everyone pedophiles because they wont stop fucking kids they call everyone lazy because they all just inherit wealth and dont do shit they claim everyone else is using too many resources after gobbling up the world      whats it matter if its new  because its very new like headlines new    its happening on ever larger scales and thats the problem  it is but lets dont pretend you give a flying shit about any of that what you care about is you think you have an out to blame a group that isnt yours for problems youre mostly responsible for and always have been the chinese are no friend of the environment but they pale in comparison to the history of destruction whites have caused    and im not arguing to ignore the problems of the us  thats exactly what youre doing like all neonazi dipshits i guarantee you support rightist nonsense that helps destroy the environment with every step you just want to outsource the blame go fuck yourself nobody is interested in your 1950s era retard subhuman opinions    its fucking hilarious that youre the racist in a conversation with someone you think is a /pol/tard  pic related you    now piss off you little genetic dead end
  and im not arguing to ignore the problems of the us  what you care about is you think you have an out to blame a group that isnt yours  youre literally insane and ignoring reality for the sake of your own delusions     you dont give two shits about the future pic related all you care about is assigning blame and feeding your racist fantasies youre the worst kind of retard an arrogant selfrighteous racist idiot who ignores real problems because they dont fit his hateful narrative
i live in russia and theres a shit ton of insects during summer during soviet times there were a lot less in city areas
  you keep bitching about c02 when ive stated multiple times fucking good    you dont give two shits about the future pic related  of humans no you have no future you die everyone celebrates good bye
  co2 is good because i say so despite all the scientists warning is about how disastrous it is  facts dont care about your feelings sweetie  imagine being this deranged
  all the human scientists which global warming will kill humans scream about their own destruction news at 11 i dont care about humans die
  youre probably insane to believe that youre not human and that you arent as responsible as the average person around you
  why would you pay extra for seeds that allow for the indiscriminate use of herbicides unless you intended to use herbicides indiscriminately
  the only race that notices pollution and its problems is to blame  the only race that takes active action to mitigate pollution is to blame  reminds me of somethingoh wait i remember  the only race that ever attempted to end slavery worldwide is the most evil for owning slaves at one point    either youre some woefully ignorant self hating fuck or one of ((()))
  co2 wont just kill humans though fuckbrains last time co2 climbed like this the permian extinction turned the earth in to a world wide desert and wiped out 999 of everything so yeah bye bye humans but also fuck everything else eh
  that comic is obviously a parody of the stance youre taking but youre arguing too vehemently for your post to be satirical so do you really think the comic is on your side
  yeah why not a clean slate for the remaining 01 to evolve into a new ecosystem its exciting desu
  i imagine to bypass the weed herbicide tolerance which is becoming more and more of a problem nowadays  basically you increase the herbicide tolerance threshold of your crop variety so you can up the dose and wipe all weeds  it doesnt directly increase yield though
  i actually do quite a bit to reverse the trend i practice what i preach      everyone notices pollution youre nobodys savior youre just greedy destructive apes get dead      no the permian was an entirely different event continentsized lava fields consumed the world      no sweaty its of yours every single one of you doubledigit iq lowbread suburban white males every belief you have is far right but everyone else is the nazi im glad youll never have sex there are too many of you as is
  lowbred
oh no insects too but insects are like the one thing that cant be stopped
        youd best wake up every day and thank the good lord himself that whitey decided to stop killing everyone at will     and if you think you can fucking stop us from spreading throughout the galaxy youd best remember that we built the world you live in if you think some sort of environmental mass extinction is going to stop us youd better think again we massextinction ourselves every couple decades and were stronger than ever
  are we all going to die  i fucking hope so
  fuck whitey youll all be extinct soon good riddance you absolute fucking subhuman filth nobody is thankful you wrecked the only planet we all have to live on die already    and if you think you can fucking stop us from spreading throughout the galaxy  youre not going anywhere you fat stupid virgin youll colonize the oceans depths before you colonize even mars and youre sure as fuck not leaving the solar system youre dead and you have nobody to blame but yourself get fucking rekt
  always amusing when someone uses a white invention or several to whinge about how mean white people are hypocrite
  youre against capitalism and yet iphone  a lot of wind coming from a dumbshit who owes his literal existence to a planet hes destroying
  quite a lot of generalization there champ what exactly are you doing for the planet that gives you the right to judge everyone sitting on your fat ass like all the other armchair ecologists you done anything of value or you just another consumer fuck off and play in the forest and stop making a carbon footprint right now you total hypocrite
  quite a lot of generalization there champ  oh so everyone who disagrees with you is a nazi lol didnt even read the rest of your comment
  generalization  calling me a nazi  clutching at straws much and yeah you did read it youre just too much of a dipshit to refute it everyone can see youre the retard here
  no i really didnt read it im sure it was retarded only read about half of this comment too your shit opinions revealed everything you know and think on the topic with your first post now get ass cancer
  four minutes between replies    yeah im sure i didnt get under your skin  if you do read that slow you really are a shitskin
  boy you sure triggered me that means youre right and good vote trump    lol what a fucking brainlet triggering duh libs owned is a little past due kiddie
this has probably been the most entertaining thread i have been on in years thanks op you fucking cuck
  ah yes all these rich jews eating 20 million times more than the average person
what are some animals you reckon you could take in a 1on1 fight  i think my chances would be pretty good against a gorilla if i can just dodge its initial swings and go for an eyepoke itd be helpless against any followups
  i think id be able to beat the fuck out of kangaroo just one or two quick wallops to the face see how willing he is to fight after that maybe an ostrich too and is totally he able to beat a wolf to death

  but i luv the lil burbs
  pretty sure bears are a meme
i heard a story on a radio station where a 12 year old kid ran up to a bear and hugged it putting him so close it couldnt bite him and then he stabbed it for a 1hko    im going to try this technique and will let /an/ know how effective it is
  no kidding    ive been practicing mma for 6 years simultaneousely with boxing for 7 years as well as bodybuilding for 4 years 62 for 190 lbs     i have a crazy velocity and reflexes equal to my speed i just have to wait for it to charge me and then dodge and bitchslap it in the head i wont let it go at the slightest mistake that gorillas over youll always have virgins to think that is impossible but nothing is impossible with willingness my friends and secondly its not with your wobbly carcasses that youll ever be doing anything     any man with a minimum of training can defeat a gorilla with a knife with barehands its not necessarily more complicated it only demands skill    yeah but if he touch you yur dead
  the gorilla is gonna frail around like a fucking monkey and knock the fucker on his butt
  youre a delusional sperg
  that was rude of him imagine the betrayal the bear felt in its last moment
  where did the gorilla get the knife
  190lbs
  go to bed 10 brock lesnars
  real life isnt like a fighting game you neckbeard
  could a person beat any muscly primate maybe a bonobo or a baboon i dont mean lemurs and gibbons and whatnot
  im pretty sure i could take on a whale he first needs to swallow me where i would climb into his intestines and pull out my knife to fuck shit up    whale 0    me 1
i want to die fighting a grizzly bear with a sword heres why    if i lose im known as the crazy mother fucker who fought a bear with a sword and died however if i win im the guy who killed a bear with a god damn sword id literally drown in pussy and would never have to pay for another drink in my life there is no better way to go than fighting a bear with a sword
  its possible just really unlikely definitely not a gorilla and baboons would be one of the worst they have those huge bladelike teeth and can gash something to death faster than even much larger apes and shit can
my friends boxer is a fucking idiot
  nice pic but not threadworthy
  he ate an entire leather glove and now hes puking and shitting all day so dumb but i a good dog
  i a good dog  b u s t e d
  i mean he
  theres another version of that sort of pic thats cropped and posted kek
if an injured animal has kind of cloudy glossy eyes that have lost their color does it mean theyre dead and its too late to rescue them i found my neighbors dog in the middle of the street this morning breathing very shallowly and with most the color faded from her eyes i alerted my neighbor who rushed the dog to a hospital and i couldnt figure out what happened because i had to go to work im really anxious to hear if she maybe made it but im pretty sure she didnt anyone know the answer
  impossibru to tell you cant make a declaration of death by looking at the color / cloudiness of the eyes  btw good job op
if humans can have a vegan diet can animals too
  oh here we go
  obviously but why bother
  that is a very unhappy looking cat
i drop my guppy flakes and he ignores it but then when i drop the corydoras their pellet he goes after it and takes it from them wtf guppy eat vegan food
for the love of god someone with digital editing skills please photoshop that crying cat face onto the op pic
  my cat loves cooked meat ham and chesse  thankfully the chesse doesnt make her puke though
  kek
  for some maybe not all though cats for example are obligate carnivores     veganism is a lifestyle choice for humans because we are omnivores and can subsist on a diet free from animal products if we must     i suppose if you gave your supplements for the vitamins theyd be missing out on it might work idk im not a vet but like  said why bother you wouldnt feed meat to a horse why try and make natural predators into vegans
  no i feed my rabbit nothing but meat because veganism is a mental disease
  i set a live trap to catch a feral cat in my yard with ham i got a rabbit
    lmao
  with a carefully controlled diet dogs can be  cats cannot be there are certain enzymes their digestive system can only absorb from meat
    amazing
  source
  dogs sort of cats absolutely not unless its under veterinary advice for certain conditions and allergies cats should always be fed a mainly meat based diet cats dont do well with artificial taurine unlike dogs as such a lot of these vegan can foods have added taurine from animal sources anyway with the added benefit of being absolute shit for your cat    imagine feeding someone white bread for every meal and just mashing in some vitamines and suppliments    dogs arent obligate carnivores so they do better but it isnt whats best for them youll still be doing it to satisfy your own moral standards rather then whats best for the dog    so can i feed my pet vegan    sure as long as it isnt a cat its wellfare isnt your primary concern or if its a rabbit
  vegan cat foods
why do vegans even get carnivores as pets  rabbits are wonderful creatures even though mine never missed an opportunity to steal the dogs kibble
  so they can get attention by feeding it something retarded
  its the same reason supporters of alternative medicine will rub echinacea on their fatally ill child before taking it to an actual hospital theyre hoping to set an example that will prove all of their critics wrong to the point that they lose all sight of the fact that they might be causing suffering in their crusade to be right  even when they end up causing harm through their actions theyre in so deep that admitting to themselves the level of damage that theyve caused would be too personally devastating to deal with    so even in the recent case of the child that died of meningitis after parents tried to treat him with home remedies or that woman who was watching her pet fox go blind and have seizures due to feeding it vegan in both cases neither party would admit they were wrong admitting they were wrong would mean taking responsibility for having caused inconceivable suffering    so instead of having to deal with the crushing weight of the consequences of their actions they justify it to themselves as having been due to totally unrelated causes    the fox lady blamed her foxs slow and painful decline as being due to allergies the parents just chalked it up to the kid being really ill anyway and that nothing would have saved him and that they just did what they thought was best and that home remedies are still totally valid and not deadly and theyre still the victims somehow    its also something that typically spoiled people do where they want a thing even though they cant/wont accommodate for that thing     but get it anyway and mistreat it to suit themselves simply because they refuse not to have it    vegans would be much better getting a pet that would suit them but to that sort of person it isnt the point they want to prove you wrong and are so butthurt that their choices might mean that they cant have something theyll get it anyway even if it means destroying that thing in the process
  yes guinea pigs for example do very well under a vegan diet
  these are too overdone but this ones good
  well said anon
  duckduckgocom  dog omnivore vegan  cat carnivore vegan
  most rodents can thrive on a vegan diet get a mouse
  are cats omnivores
a vegan cat is like a transgender child we all know whos calling the shots
  depends on the pet for example a pet goat or cow or chicken can easily survive without meat or animal products but carnivorous animals like cats cannot
hello everyone i have a dachshund type dog who is scared of loud noises like firecrackers so i was basically hoping you guy can help with tips on how to help my dog
feed it treats while screaming at the top of your lungs
blast an airhorn at random intervals throughout the day to desensitise it
  get him a pitbull friend
give it weirdly shaped earmuffs with very strong glue on them glue earmuffs onto dogs ears
  hunters have to deal with this because you know shooting a firearm is loud and the dog shouldnt get spooked by it    maybe look up how hunters do it
  peeing toilet
  he just wants to solve mysteries with his uncle scooby lmao
heres something you can do that is good for calming them in the moment you can also use it on cats but you need a wider bandage what will cover the chest    make sure you only use it for short sessions tie it offcenter so it doesnt hurt the spine and also make sure that you can slip two fingers underneath the bandages at any point
  thanks will try
contriving an edition   old thread 
can someone explain to me the sleep times of horses do they ever sleep one hour in one piece or do they just slumber several times a day/night
is an horse a athlete
  back when that meme was fresh they were but sadly decades went by
hoers
daily reminder these are just feral horses and there is no good reason you shouldnt be able to have one   there are domestic horse and donkey breeds rare than muh grugg lookin dun
are the stories about fucking horses true
  mine is
    theyre for hug not for fug you absolute degenerates
    seriously how do you fuck a mare without worrying about her taking a shit on you
  i doubt anyone degenerate enough to try would really care
  how do you fuck a woman without worrying about her taking a shit on you
  someone show this fool a webm or a gif of a horse shitting
  okay
  unf
  hm they seem to have put lots of love into details
they have amazing braking capabilities
  lucky the horses were so small
  jokes aside the nonfat miniature horses that seem to have big horse proportions while actually being microscopic are kinda freaky
tongue dispenser
  they would make perfect wives
  you already have your does dont even dare to take our horses
    calm your horses everyone we dont need a deer thread vs horse general civil war
  the warhas already begun
  bring it on
guys guys we should think about all this lets dont make a big mistake now
  i think theyre great id like to get miniature saddle bags and have them carry my stuff on long walks
  deploy the marines
  the time for thinking is over
big guy standing by
gory gory what a helluva way to die
  rip we will never forget him
  big
  why are they cheering
  in honor of their brave sacrifice
hey guys whats your favorite breed and why  pre here just think they have the nicest proportions also the perfect mix between beefy and elegance
  whatever rides the best into battle
  wearing makeup and lipstick and having nails like that while handling a horse  flags are being raised
  not only the flags i guess
    fags
anyone got a link to that documentary where they hang the horses upside down in a warehouse by their hooves when theyre done with them was run by that guy with the really long beard and gyno
hello sir   which one will it be today
    i need like a breeding herd of 300500 of these caballo perros for my mad equine science experiments and not selling xxxsmall mail order horsewives  i could probably use surrogate mares to carry 100 pure falabella embryos i could crossbreed broodmares with falabella stallions too   brb checking the most cost efficient way to do this
living with your stallion buddies  female comes along  fight to the death  why do females have to ruin everything
  they love the attention
  what males of a species arent like that
  the ones with nintendo switches
ayy
  what are those flaps of skin for down at the horse leg
  theyre part otter so they can better swim with these
there should be some sort of equine booru for horse picture depository
  thats a weird dog
  its actually a tiny collar
  i know of three such boorus
  link
  arent muslim women banned from driving cars and riding horses
  tfw i see more pointless interspecies fighting   why cant they all just be friends lads
  the dog is actually the coach the horse desperately needs more muscle and the dog took the job and makes a real champ out of him
  me outside the photo frame
  i remember that horse bank failed in less than a week because they just ate the money
  the fuck were they thinking
  who knows the atms were a total nightmare
ahem  fuck the yellow vests  gonna kick you so hard
  wrong horses would wear them too
  horses tend to buck real hard the ones who treat them like shit in fact they would have worn the vests even years earlier
  blocks your path  heh nothing personnel statist
  half transparent mesh  kinky
like nothing at all
i love horses but why do horse people have to be the worst literally worse than pibble owners
  why do horse people have to be the worst  you most likely only know the ones who just own them while letting barn personnel do the dirty work  horse people i know who do everything and shovel crap for hours a day are good people and the women are hot and responsible persons
  this people who actually live on the farm and tend to the animals therein are much better than those who visit for a couple hours 3 times a week
  they rest standing up but when they need rem sleep they lie down and sleep for about two hours babby horses need more of course
  i wish i could do that
  i could probably use surrogate mares to carry 100 pure falabella embryos  if you use draft mares you could probably fit two or three in one go
    yeah i used to think ranch girls werent cancer too but i didnt actually know ranch girls i have a couple good ranch bro friends but horse girls are horse girls regardless of where theyre from
  horses are not designed to nourish two fetuses and produce viable twin foals double pregnancies put the mare and both foals at risk and good outcomes are rare
  farm girls are always better than city girls if im going to be cucked i prefer it to be by a horse
  farm girls are always better than city girls  theyre literally just girls
  yeah youre right cultural surrounds in your formative years have absolutely no impact whatsoever on personality everything is predestined
  if im going to be cucked i prefer it to be by a horse  thats when you have angry revenge sex with one of her favorite mares
  horse dust is like pepper spray dont know what makes it so potent

mycology anon checking in after a hiatus from /an/ fun story i was hospitalized for awhile following a trip to illinois after contracting a fungal infection completely unrelated to the work i do as a mycologist getting an unrelated fungal infection is a big fuckyou since everyone immediately assumes it is related to working with fungi   goddamn farmers kicking up dust thankfully it is only histoplasmosis and it should selfresolve    i specialize in fungal sex morchella ecology/mating/cultivation ethanol production using fungi and fungal genetics if anyone has questions     on the topic of puffballs here is a great photo one of my students captured of a geastrum probably saccatum species releasing spores when squeezed       fungi dont really do all that much in terms of constantly watching and maintaining something i dont know that many would fit into the category of pet cultivation of any species is a lot of fun you get to watch mycelium grow and eat and eventually produce mushrooms the easiest thing for a beginner to do is find a stick or small log with mycena on it and bring it indoors keeping it humid will provide a relatively constant show of mushrooms fruiting     slime molds make better pets because they move around and actively eat a little harder to find and maintain though they also arent fungi theyre amoebas
  whats the most convoluted mating strategy youve encountered  also is the traditional s cerevisiae fermentation different than s pombe or other types of ethanol production regarding fungi im talking more along the byproducts they might produce and how they could aid in certain beverage/foodstuff production
bampin
going to prep my sab and seed jars this weekend for g2g transfer   should be fun
since liberty cap season is over in my area im gonna try growing cubensis can i get in trouble for ordering spores in eastern europe
  depends on countries but in most places spores are not illegal i believe poland only makes psilocybin illegal and no particular mushroom so spores should be fine
  thanks ill probably risk it  do you have any experience with growing shrooms i mostly understand everything but im not sure whether i should purchase a pressure cooker or not and will it work on induction stove
  specialized in fungal sex  has fungal infection
  different species often produce drastically different metabolites during fermentation ethanol is a common one but there is a whole range of other alcohols i am pretty sure that s pombe also produces ethanol during fermentation because it is also used for brewing if you are talking about other metabolites aside from alcohols it is even more variable they both produce a huge variety of oils and nonalcoholic fungal metabolites polysaccharides volatiles and more      good luck what species are you working with      pressure cooker is pretty essential to growing in any real quantity some pcs work with induction and others will be destroyed or ruin your stove you have to check with the manufacturer of a given model      yeah atleast they arent having sex in my lungs it is probably all asexual
  ordered some basic oysters   i also want to try cloning and growing from spores on agar   ive found guide on shroomery where guys uses small plastic cups with air tight lids and i have everything ready except for those small plastic cups the brand he uses is us only and im having hard time finding local equivalent every store here sells the same 5 types of plastic containers and all of them are useless
most delicious cultivated mushroom eryngi king oyster large size good texture amazing flavor     debate me
  theyre doing the phalanx formation
  which mycoanon is this
  i know which one you are talking about find any plastic container that will fit in your pressure cooker that uses polypropylene it is also called plastic 5 or there will be a small 5 ina recycling symbol on the bottom
  probably the pnw morel guy
what are these how can you tell
  works with fungus and shit  getts knocked down by some gay ass yeast infection  wew lad
  could be a wild enokitake/velvet stem they are winter mushrooms so they grow bellow freezing temperature a telltale sign is the stem getting darker towards the base it can be hard to tell from the older ones you should check the young ones make sure its a velvet stem if you plan to eat them
where can i find auricularia auriculajudae in central europe  how do i eat it
  they grow on hollunder trees so know how to identify them    they are popular in asian cuisine like fried noodles
  well there are a lot of them in poland but ive never seen one    the only tree mushrooms i see are those shitty pic rel
  damn dude ive been hearing more and more about cases like these its more than a little concerning given the nature of the field work and the exposure it leads to but hey at least you didnt come down with something worse like sporotrichosis or blastomycosis or cryptococcosis pic related and im not really eager to expand my medical mycology folder
  on general principle i would advise against eating any lignicolous brown mushrooms without a much more thorough analysis than can be done over an image board
  fuck roasties
  maybe this is more your speed
  ahh much better
tell me about the time period when fungus ruled the earth
  in a social vacuum how can one even begin to do an analysis and learn this stuff
  ok it was a long time ago in a galaxy far far away
i did my first sab work today  i tried to g2g transfer of bought oyster seeds to my own jars  i tried to be super careful no sudden or quick movement but who knows i hope i didnt fuck up
  if you live on the west coast pick up a copy of mushrooms demystified its extremely beginner friendly and is a must have if you enjoy foraging in the pacific northwest
  east coast 
i wish my school had undergrad courses on fungi im a math major with a minor in biology but fungi are so interesting i focused on genetics to learn more about gene sequencing but all they taught me about is autism i dont care about autism thats for early childhood development people to worry about
who here puffball consumer
some fungi on a leaf
  whats your opinion on ethanol production by fungi is there a reason to believe that it could be a renewable sources of fuel in the future
stumbled upon a stump in someones yard that was growing reishi mushrooms he said he always chop the mushrooms off and throw them away but they keep growing back he told me i was welcome to take the stump out if i want it if i take that stump whats the best way to promote future growth on it ive never grown any fun guys just foraging    autistic duck pic unrelated
    yeah pnw morel guy      i would agree with flammulina species maybe not f velutipes but something in that genus      it is a mold with a yeastform at human body temperature it is badass though even being the person infected i can still appreciate how cool it is    in the alveoli macrophages ingest these microconidia they survive inside the phagosome as the fungus is thermally dimorphic these microconidia are transformed into yeast they grow and multiply inside the phagosome the macrophages travel in lymphatic circulation and spread the disease to different organs      they grow on a different tree in every region in my experience just explore many different forests and check dead wood in some areas they are dirt common and in others super rare      yeah i was actually pretty happy to hear it was histoplasma one of the better species i couldve hope for when we first found nodules but didnt know the species it was seriously concerning my deep fear is antifungalresistant aspergillosis moldy graygreen fungus balls in the lungs makes me shudder      a simple spore print will instantly rule out galerina when trying to id flammulina unnecessary to deter with such a wide blanket      absolutely i mean it is obvious that fungi are already how virtually all ethanol on earth is produced the major thing i focus on is how to integrate other species i think ethanol has great promise as a future source of renewable fuel especially when you look at coculture with algae to produce biodiesel the carbon capture is ridiculous     what i specialize in is how to utilize nonyeast filamentous fungi to saccharify celluloserich substrates to create sugars for feeding to yeast this is basically a method for turning something like sawdust or sugarcane waste into ethanol
  just keep the stump moist thats about it happy growing it might take them awhile to bounce back after the trauma of chopping the stump out   you could also just get new logs or stumps and inoculate them with the fruitbodies of the preexisting stump
  how can you tell by spore print  last thread i found these   nobody here knew what they were so i asked some dude on reddit and he told me they are either kuehneromyces mutabilis or galerinas and that i cant be because i didnt take picture of the stem  the spore print was brown and top of them was little slimy when fresh
  if they had a ring on their stem they probably were galerinas
wtf never ben on /an/ before and i love it  photo is lepiota naucina nice and tasty
  last week my garden was full of these
  looks like a death cap    rip
  thanks hes gonna get rid of the stump eventually so i may as well do the service of removing it for him and claiming the shrooms
  no vulva you idiot
  galerina have a rusty brown spore print while two common edible lignicolous fungi flammulina and armillaria both have white  you can rule out most of the toxic woodloving species by using prints they really only help a beginner though the species dont look very similar once you have experience      armillaria and khueneromyces both have rings on their stem as well and galerina rarely do except when young       nice they are slowly gaining popularity for awhile people were scared because they looked like amanita but the similarities are only superficial
whats everyones favorite growing method for indoor for grainlovers so far have tried  pf tek  monotubs  making little trays of spawn  coir/verm and putting them in an sgfc    also how have i never been here before just gave a speech at school about cordyceps and turkey tail mushrooms mycology seems awesome
could someone identify this thing u find in the woods a few weeks ago on the side of a tree in southeast pennsylvania
  lions mane
spotted an inky cap the other day and made me very happy
    hericium erinaceus edible delicious and all around very good for you
  also how have i never been here before  its the slowest general on one of the slowest 4chan boards not surprising weve flown under the radar /out/ has more regular foraging threads where fungus discussion is common as well
    thanks
  just in terms of easiness or in terms of yield in relation to effort  tubs are probably the highest yield for the time put in indoors greenhouse beds are absolutely the best but take space outside
this mushroom kinda looks like popcorn
  like those ones that look kinda like brain
  can help me id  took the pics this summer  nw mexico
  thats some kind of puffball mushroom as far as i know they are all edible if they havent fully matured yet you need to cut it to make sure it should be all white on the inside if its gone black or brown its too old to eat sometimes an amanita can imposter a puffball mushroom so always cut it in half it shouldnt look like there is a developing mushroom inside with gills if its a puffball it should be one even surface
  they are all edible if they havent fully matured yet  unlike humans  i like pic rel kinda smell like pepper
found this and many more 2 weeks ago also found some amanita cesaria
  pseudohydnum gelatinosum cats tongue      beautiful boletus probably fibrillosus      love these wish they occurred in my region
  gonna share a few more pics  all these are from nw mexico  its mostly desert here but i got the chance to go to the highlands for a weekend  im not good at taking pics tho
  ill continue later
it has been about week since i bought oyster seeds and did g2g in sab with them and there are still no signs of life absolutely no spreading  is it normal or did i fuck up somewhere
  are they soft or as hard as the tree  i see only those hard as fuck and they say its edible
  ive also seen only the hard ones  i dont know if true turkey tail is hard or not but i found out the one i saw was just look a like  top looked exactly the same but bottom was different it was flat instead of little tubes  if you type turkey tail underside in google images there are bunch of good examples
  you made me remember this bad boy soo good
  what do you mean by oyster seeds are you talking about the scams online where it is dried grains with mycelium on them they are basically a trick that isnt how mushrooms work      turkey tail wouldnt really be considered edible too woody to eat they are medicinal
  i need to culture polyporales genera irpex and trametopsis for food for a specific invertebrate can you tell me how to do this please

what is the price for a euthanasia for a cat  i got told around 50
free if you do it yourself
  this i was only nine when i had to shoot my first dog when he went lame part of becoming a man
  how much gas does it take you to get to the river a goodwill pillowcase is under 5 and a rock is free so transit cost 5
    what i get from you is that its unreasonable to pay 50 is that it  sadly guns arent a normal thing where i live maybe i should ask how much would be an injection to make it sleep so i can kill it
  not meming 50 isnt out of line
  pink juice aint cheap anon
okay story time i guess because why not  my little sister started feeding this sick stray cat skinny with a cold the usual shit but in fact it wasnt that bad when she found it we even thought maybe it had an asshole of a keeper like weve met many in our third world suburb we only let her give it food outside we werent adopting it  the thing is maybe a week ago it got this huge swelling on its face and after a few days it blew up dripping pus and shit  it left a really nasty abscess my sister started treating
  but now it dropped even more skin and the cat is basically without a considerable part of its face    but the important part is that i wanted to know if i can post pics of the cat to get your opinion since i dont know if its an usual thing to post pets wounds  its to see if its worth trying to save it since i think its gonna take more than 50 to get it better
  go on lets see the kitten
  put it out of its misery it sounds like an infection and antibiotics arent cheap and it will cost considerably more than 50 to treat the cat
  ok here goes one when the abscess was small though it isnt visible its right beside the wet part
  rip kitters 
  wait i havent posted how its now im doing this so i can convince my sister that the cat is beyond help any experienced opinion is welcome
  here it is
just strangle it lol
  one of my cats had that happen vet just had me occasionally swab it with peroxide and put a cone on him he was fine took a while to heal and he had a huge scar on the side of his neck though
  fuck you thats inhumane    op around 75 but some can reach about 200  im sorry about your cat
  this  its nothing
  if you constrict blood flow to the brain you will pass out in under 1 minute i dont see how thats inhumane
    wow so theres hope were giving it some antibiotics and disinfectant on the wound but i thought it was gonna be useless  the plan was getting it on a better shape so we can give it to one of those pet adoption groups on facebook  but if the cat gets worse i think putting it down is the most humane thing after all
    thanks for the info    i should mention that we have a cat of our own and that im not willing to adopt another cat for a lot of reasons
hold one hand firmly at the base of its neck pressing into the chest and another at the top of the neck sharply and simultaneously push at the base and pull at the head if done correctly you will feel a pop and the cats suffering will be over
  a garbage bag to put the cat inside it and a handful of brick should cost less than 50 dollars
  doesnt seem beyond help would you say a person is beyond help if it had somethint like that nope  it can heal if taken well care of dont just kill the cat because youre lazy or stingy
a large paving stone costs like 5
  why arent you taking it to the vet
  just put a cone on it and let it go about its life
  just strangle it lol  were on to you detective wagenbach
  animals heal their skin much more efficiently than human beings even in a human that wound wouldnt be fatal

how do i convince my family to stop free feeding the cat
self bump because im desperate
  tell them stop free feeding the cat clearly
  this is op 12 years old or something
whats wrong with free feeding
  ls the cat actually overweight if yes then keep pointing out that without calorie restriction its not going to lose weight and that hurts the cats health if no theres nothing actually wrong with free feeding
  what have you already tried to get them to stop op  the first step would be  but i can imagine that youre asking here because you already tried that
  feeding your cat completely destroy the whole point of the cats existence they are supposed to hunt their food feed it once a day and then let it kill the rats birds snakes or any other plague around your house let the fucking animal do the job it was born to do
  what in the actual fuck
  step 1 give cat antifreeze   step 2    step 3 profit
  why would you feed it once then numbnuts just lock your cat outside and when it wants to come in just remind it that its an animal

can raccoons be trained my vetfag cousin got one last week and after some beers weve discussed the potential of their thumbs and what they could do with them
  anything which learns is potentially trainable and raccoons are very good learners i would imagine the discipline aspect will be the tough part though
    yes just look up melanie raccoon and look at the tricks she can do
    hey cant you read
  please its cold and rainy outside
    i wonder if you could train them to hold something and shake it up and down repeatedly

  when i was a lad the highlight of trick or treating for me was going to a friend of my aunts house who had a raccoon they had a gumball machine that they had put some kind of treats in and you could give the coon a quarter and he would put it in the machine and crank it until a treat came out

possums are basically raccoons  so my question is i found a possum sleeping under a pizza box in my garbage can today    it can live there until tuesday but thats when the truck comes how do i evict him if he hasnt found a new house by then
  if i know anything about opossums and i do the trick is to lure him out with more pizzas and promise of government assistance

getting sick of my faggot dog refusing to come inside after i let her out in the yard to pee she used to pee run around then follow me back indoors but now she pees runs around then runs away when i open the door    i really dont want to have to put her on a leash so i dont spend 45 minutes trying to catch her every time i take her out at night whats the best method to teach her when play time is over
  youd have to go over the dogs whole routine    sounds like not enough exercise
  she wants therefore needs more exercise stop being a shitty dog owner and let give you dog some exercise  minimum would be 30min walk and 15 of hard running if your dog cant do that amount of running then you need to do like 2 walks totaling 90min
  this and you want to make her want to come to you treats and praise when she does   dont chase your dog they think its a game if you have to leash her for a bedtime piss do it reward her for going back inside
  shes a literal shih tzu and gets an hour of free roaming in the yard when i get home from work  minimum 20 min walks from the wife 2x a day during the yard roam im not just standing there i run around with her to the point of her own exhaustion how much more exercise could she need if thats not counting the 1520 mins i let her out for at night    she never used to ignore me before when i called her back in
  get angry as fuck when she does it grip her by the scruff of the neck like a mother does to her pups and drag her dipshit ass inside
  this its the only way they learn if you ever have children do the same thing
  wait i need clarification on this you mean shes a literal unironic shih tzu
  weird i thought all shih tzus were metaphorical
    dipshits    how to make your dog come inside problem even worse more like
    well i meant it in the sense in that shes a shihtzu in body but shes a german shepherd at heart
why do people hate them so much
among african cultures hyenas were the primary beast servant of witches they smell bad and have a creepy laugh in the night in african fables they are mean crude and stupid creatures the lion king exacerbated the issue     still its not all bad among the mande speaking peoples such as the bambara the hyena is a sacred animal and spirit of ultimate wisdom men in secret societies spend decades unlocking the secrets of the hyena to gain a closer connection to the sacred signs god used to create the cosmos
  because of the lion king unironically     hyenas are actually the good guys in some african cultures people in the city of harar believe the hyenas eat malevolent spirits some even believe they are the spirit of the witch doctor yeah some africans believe they are witch servants but others will lock you in a hut with a hungry hyena if they suspect you of being a witch
  that pseudopenis this is so freaking weird i can never look at hyenas the same way again after i learned that uhuh no thank you sorry if this offends anybody hoping to get a ftm operation sorry if that apology is unnecessary
  the africans fear the superior cold steel of the werehyenas
  only a matter of time before the werehyenas send homo sapiens back to the trees where they belong
  doesnt want that lady yeen peen  you gay or something
post cute hyenas
these guys are real fluffy
  nobody in current year hates them you just want to feel superior for some reason in your knowledge of hyenas
    cause dogfags found out theyre closer related to felines than canines
  how did you become the hyena general
people dont like scavengers in general
  not sure but i think theyre badass this hyena is the most fucking metal nature picture ever
  did his intestines get shopped out of his mouth
  looks orcish
nigeria has the hyena boys drocking silly
  because theyre using this one easy trick
  lmao    its crazy how theyre freaking feliforms i thought they were related to dogs all my life
because they kept stealing cheetahs prey thats why
fun fact both male and female hyenas have penises
  pseudopenises
    rip hyena
  what a revelation
ive literally never heard of anyone hating hyenas wtf are you all even talking about
  do you think theyve ever done it
    hyenas are the closest well ever get irl to futa catgirls
  lesbian sex with fem peen  very likely
    so do some lemurs
  they did used to prey on our ancestors
  hyenas are not the problem their fan base are edgy furfags/vorefags obsess over them and losers with no personality fantasize with owning them
  not the same hyena
  very cute
its the lion king  its because of african fables    nice 80 iq posts but you should probably consider that no animal with a tendency to snag kill and eat human infants has ever had a good reputation youre straight up retarded if you think their bad reputation comes from any place else or is in any way or form undeserved as far as the humans actually living around them goes
  a tendency to snag kill and eat human infants  plenty of other predators do this but hyenas still tend to be hated more   compare them to how people view wolves bears and lions
  no not really  name one other predator that does this that is not either hated like dingoes or hunted to extinction like wolves in parts of europe
    
  most people hate strong female leaders
lion kang
    gnollposters and hermfurries
  these animals tend to kill adults alike not comparable  hyenas wont attack grown men
  tranny furfags too because of the feminine penisses
  its funny cause humans evolved from scavengers
  i dont think so
  hyenas have attacked grown men as well though  
  a drunk defenseless man entirely possible he blacked out
  there are quite a few other cases too                    
  because theyre fucking ugly and the males get a shit deal for no reason other than the females are a bunch of fucking bitches
sup me n my wife checking in
hyena domestication experiment when  weve already been working on foxes for the last 4050 years i believe why not hyenas
  at some point you have to ask not why not you have to ask why  you know those domesticated foxes will never be viable because the gene pool those scientists work with is way too small to ever turn it into an alternative to dogs thats because theres no real need for it its just an experiment people can already get cute dogs if they want cute dogs people can already get watch dogs if they want watch dogs people can already get hunting dogs if they want hunting dogs people can already get shepherd dogs if they want shepherd dogs the reason the gene pools on these arent limited is because dogs have been domesticated over the course of a couple thousand years in symbiotic evolution with humans     there is quite literally no reason to domesticate anymore animals outside of behavorial science experiments like the fox thing
im a hyena please ama
no questions fine ill answer some first spotted female hyenas dont have a penis as you sickos wish they did im looking at you furries they have a retractable tube that they urinategive birth and mate through its not a giant clitoris this is due to high testosterone levels
  youre straight up retarded if you think their bad reputation comes from any place else  not anyone knows that though
  everyone
  what are you
  a hyena ask questions sweetie
ugly weird looking animals that have extremely nasty habits when hunting/eating  females are the true alphas and have odd genitals   main rival to a global fucking symbol seen as strong willed aesthetic and noble   they never had a chance
they are cool
  shits on furries  pretends to be an animal  but i can understand hyenas are based
  its funny that lions have that reputation since they are lazy and stupid
  hyenas rock
  please dont reproduce
  they are excellent garden guests in fact they are used as nanny pets currently in africa
  do you enjoy having things shoved into your masculine clitoris
  in africa
  lions arent stupid at all they just dont have as much of a complex social hierarchy also lions arent lazy stupid bang wagon tier meme where its believe since lionesses hunt small to medium game for cubs that the males dont do it males hunt buffalo and are literally spending 90 of their time defending their pride from other prime males
  yes i do
  we evolved from apes who would eat fruit insects and probably our own shit in the trees
  excellent where is your enclosure we should meet up some time i think we have a lot in common 
    the first successful bipedal apes ate carrion
  why do all lions have pot bellies
  dude when i said lions are lazy i meant in general not just males anyway its their looks that won them that reputation
  illicit steroid use to cheat their way to the top of the kingdom of life
  i mean what about personal preferences or aesthetic purposes id much rather have a hyena than a cat or dog same with a fox really anything other than a cat or dog
  dadbod
  shiiton muresomething good manga
  no we didnt uncultured faggot
  i was excited until i saw it was another animal ears on a human animal bummer
  growth hormones cause that not roids
  no animal with a tendency to snag kill and eat human infants has ever had a good reputation  any number of big cats and canids will do it and yet societies as a whole adore and glorify lions and wolves any opportunistic predator is willing to snatch a kid if they think they have a chance at getting away with it perhaps the lion king crowd arent the only low iq people here
  coyotes hate them
  nasty catdogs with retarded looking faces and laughter    they lack the elegance of big cats and the charisma of wild dogs and wolves    they hunt brutishly with no grace ripping their prey apart while still alive     they are just ugly as hell    also females are the stong sex
  i dont know i rather like the way they look
  hyenas are the niggers of africa
  i dont know probably because theyre scavengers
  hyenas kill over 80 of their food  whut they dont scavenge meals any more than other predators

  they dont lions are literally the most packed terrestrial animal on earth when it comes to muscle

i think my red sided california garter snake is dead    i just got back home from work and he is motionless and not reacting to my touch and he is a flighty snake    i came back on lunch break and he was being sluggish but was still moving around    to clarify he seemed to have went into brumation about a month and a half ago as a month ago he completely started refusing foods and he has been an excellent eater since i got him in february he is 11 months old about    so ive been keeping his cage heat off most of the time but he would still perch here and there and id turn on his bulb hoping he would go out of brumation as i didnt want to brumate him so his enclosure was mostly kept at low 70s    im not sure im in shock right now and im hoping he is just passed out or something

ripped out most plants and put another level of terrain in there i might get a mossy frog theloderma corticale or pygmy newts triturus pygmaeus soon for this enclosure not sure yet its probably too small     any plant ideas especially in the back it looks very open now no hiding space for my crabs except the little cave on the top
  get some wandering jew or creeping jenny in the back also do you have a false bottom in that tank everytime i tried to make a paludarium i couldnt figure out how to make the seam between the water and land area look natural all the rocks or whatever i put looked obviously manmade and looked like shit
  no false bottom or drainage layer or anything no just this stone wall thing pic related two of those the space behind i simply filled with dirt and put moss sheets on top

how are your plants doing
we have a compacted ball python at work hes been to our shitty vet three times just came back today again this time they descaled a portion near the side and top of his vent our instructions once again are to keep soaking him but now use an ointment on the wound     we weigh our snakes make charts of feeding sheddingdefecation when we can is skinning a portion of a snake normal for this condition he just gets worse and we cant feed him due to it
  bump because some retard just created another /herp/    some retard created this one when the other one wasnt anywhere near bump limit then didnt bother to post in the old thread that they had made a new one old thread just about to hit bump limit i make new one apparently this one was made four days ago
  but anon hes my babby id breed him to sell off the offspring but i can never find a fucking female at the local shows to breed him to these days have a new pic he just finished shedding a few hours ago
also as is customary whenever i post pics of my animals heres a new shot of my sumatran for my blood anons
    sweet
  shes always that cool combination of spooky and impressive
recommended snek for a reptile virgin  dont have too much space
  i will breed with him
  just google beginner snakes corns kings milks rosy boas etc
  also what kind of setup do you have her in
  thelypteris palustris
  as a temporary set up i have her in a large sterilite tub with some drilled in holes and a uth on a thermostat until i can get hold of/ find the time to build a proper pvc enclosure its not ideal but it holds humidity and heat nicely and she seems more comfortable hanging around on the surface of her substrate since its relatively dark in the tub come 2019 though i intend to get everyone in a proper new enclosure    anon please dont breed with reptiles
  h o g g e r  o  g  g  e  r
  yes hognose snakes are great
  wasnt anywhere near bump limit  created at 306 posts  ok retard
sup guys my boa lousiel crapped just a while ago and i looked in and most of it was normal but two pieces were green should i be worried i get her the same frozen rodents all the time so im not too worried just asking
  i looked in and most of it was normal but two pieces were green  i wouldnt worry just keep an eye on future poops snake looks really good though
  why did they descale that area i have never once heard of a vet doing this    what is his humidity like what makes you think hes compacted usually called impacted afaik bps can hold on to poops for months at a time without any ill effects to their health its pretty normal for them to go a long time without defecating
      im going to rain on the hoggins parade just a little as beginner snake recommend they are semiprone to feeding issues that makes them ever so slightly more challenging than the colubrids rosy boa childrens/spotted pythons hogs are easier than ball pythons though
i apologize for ass quality  pic of luigi after shedding and eating i love him so much
    that disapproving look is so good
  hes cool tried handling him yet
    i dont think they are available where i live  denmark 
  does denmark have many native herps i imagine its far too dark and freezing all year for many
  american here youre a fucking retard
  germany has a gigantic herp community and the biggest expos in the world im sure there are sellers who would ship one
  no youre a retard
  did he dead
  i imagine its far too dark and freezing all year for many  its denmark not fucking northern siberia
  its denmark not fucking northern siberia  its the same thing basically look at this shit the average high during the summer is just above 70f in copenhagen im pretty sure all danes are penguins
  overcast 50 of the year  dark and freezing just like i said
  yeah he passed
  non reddit discord  thats an oxymoron if i ever heard one
  is /herp/ no longer using /an/cord what did i miss
    or you can just google reptiles in denmark and get this list   as for the climate its more comparable to england than what you were suggesting
  for the climate its more comparable to england  yes dark and frozen
  no just two discords fighting each other as reddit as it gets desu
  no fighting just a new place that is a lot less strict and more fun
  a lot less strict  will i get banned if i say dirty kike spic fucker nigger chink son of bitch bastard
  it would be better if you all would stop shilling reddit chatcords here
  nope actually its encouraged please stop by senpai
  the new one aint reddit its freedom
    dubs of truth /an/cord is ran by autists
  god those are beautiful
  its more dark and wet but yeah
  stop shilling and stop averting traffic from this already slow general
    yeah the whole set of thamnophis sirtalis garters are all lovely the puget sound garter is one of my favorite color patterns of any wild snake
    speaking of garters i want to give a shill to steven bol from the netherlands hes a garter breeder and has one of the most informative sites about the species out there both in english and dutch languages    stevenbolgartersnakescom
  i havent heard of it either we were super pissed when we got him back like that because we didnt get an answer just the note on his card to apply ointment over it after soaking didnt even tell us to switch bedding but we have him on paper towels     our tanks dont hold humidity well so we are constantly manually doing it but its been good i know they might not defecate for awhile i also own snakes but hes so constipated it looks like he could burst i honestly expected them to cut him open to manually remove it or something
  put a little xlax in his next rat
  put a little xlax in his next rat    do not do this
  dont worry i wont im even worried about touching the area at all hes obviously been hungry too despite he has been getting lethargic
anyone else hoping domestic or even genetically engineered reptiles exist in the future
  you have to be 18 years old to post on 4chan
  if it gives you the same freedom youd get here then why the fuck should we join discord in my experience its only ever done because some faggot wants to put a name to their comments discord is an autistic circle jerk as a whole let us post here without shilling
  fuck off with your discord shit
  i have he just wants to move around though so i dont keep him out for too long absolutely incredible snake
i need some advice guys    so ive had snakes for quite some years now and like anyone who even remotely takes care of their snakes not really any problems related to shedding    3 weeks ago i took in 3 small 15 y/o boa imperators the owner some old guy apparently died about half a year ago and since his son took care of the boas however he neither had any idea about how to care for them not the desire to even google a basic caresheet and never touched them or even looked at them closer  one of the snakes apparently had problems shedding the tip of the tail and the dude just didnt notice so it was severely constricted already by old skin when i got the boas after a bath i got most of the skin off i wasnt really sure if i had gotten absolutely everything off the constricted part under the old skin measures about 1cm from the very top and i didnt want to hurt it anymore by scratching so decided to wait for the next shedding as it wouldnt be too far off in the future  that happened yesterday the snake shed in one continuous piece without a problem except for the tip of the tail again where i could see some skin still being stuck under even older skin from before so there must have been another layer that i didnt scrape off before after another bath i finally got every layer of old skin off the tail but now i dont really know what to do    pic related you can see that the tip of the tail is very shiny pink in color and feels a little wet like a wound   i put on a tiny bit of wound lotion on and there doesnt seem to be any necrosis     is there anything else i need to do
  id put it in a container with news paper on the ground for a while no soil the wound needs to dry out put some wound powder on it
  and since his son took care of the boas however he neither had any idea about how to care for them not the desire to even google a basic caresheet and never touched them or even looked at them closer  then why the fuck would he keep them long enough for problems to occur if he wasnt interested in doing the bare minimum amount of research then he shouldve sold them earlier
  most non herp people dont seem to see them like they would a regular pet it probably seemed like more trouble to give it away that just ignore it
  thanks for the suggestion but sadly i dont have a second container handy for this  however all these 3 boas love sitting high up in their branchleafsvine nest so the wound stayed clean      im not sure i think he actually had problems finding someone that wanted them  but i agree its ridiculous he kept them in a meshtop aquarium with only a small heating mat and apparently simply dropped live mice in there to feed them no idea how he made sure they all got their food im actually surprised theyre in as good of a shape as they are
  sadly i dont have a second container handy for this  buy a plastic tub at a hardware store like 10 bucks max
  if i get off work before the store closes ill have a look deal i need a bigger box to feed them in anyways
  i need a bigger box to feed them in anyways  is that an issue with boas feeding them in something separate that is
  i do that with all my snakes so theyre easier to handle they only get into feedingmode when in their box
  are they not tricky to get back into their main tanks mine always seem fairly frisky after eating so i just leave them alone for 48 hrs or so
  works fine i dont know i can easily pick them up and put them back in their tank and then i of course leave them alone for a few days
    cute
  well he died the vet had not only descaled the area but also apparently gave him an enmea the vet had him scheduled to go back for another and he died a few hours later it all sounds really fucked up ive never heard of descaling ot an enmea for a constipated snake so going to try and get it looked into up higher because this vet is consistency awful
    bummer and that is very strange treatment procedure normally for snakes you first go regular soaks and administer small amounts of mineral oil orally possibly other medications if thats no go the next step is surgery never heard of using an enema
  we soaked as soon as we saw we check every animal multiple times a day hes been to the vet multiple times vet kept clearing him for sale so we had to raise a bit of hell about it to keep him off of it its a petstore but im thankful im not the only one who tries im trying for a necropsy what the vet did seems odd and wrong i get not everything can be saved but its becoming a problem when it comes to herps
  jesus these are beautiful
  thats adorable
my girlfriend and i got in a fight i keep a rough skinned newt as a pet and she said i was paying more attention to it than her weve had a rough spot for a while now so this issue kind of blew up while i was at work she sent me a pic of the newt close up he looked distressed she sent another pic i could see he was inside of her vagina with only his tiny head poking out she said if youre not gonna fuck me ill fuck him i know the rough skinned newt is extremely poisonous could the mucus membranes in her pussy pick up the poison through his skin i hate this bitch with a deep fury and would love if my boy would kill her i know for a fact she intends to keep him there until he dies please help im not sure how to respond to her texts thanks in advance
  please tell me this is real  i hope she fucking dies    save the photos somewhere to prove later she killed a vertebrate on purpose and made it suffer should be against the law right   post them on facebook later as well
  i want this to be real just because of how fucking hilarious it would be for someone to die from rage fucking a poisonous newt
  where are the pics
  he was probably so unqualified that he had no idea how wrong it could go  thats still his fault for not even google searching but i assume that thats what happened
  where did you buy a rough skinned newt i always wanted one cause theyre one of the only newts native to the usa
  retard
  as long as it doesnt get necrotic its likely fine if it stays otherwise healthy to the next shed i would see how it sheds off if the sheds continue getting stuck to the tail id have a vet amputate to prevent any future necrosis from permanent bad sheds in that area if youre comfortable i may even go ahead and do it as im not sure how savable that tip is      i mean hes already in an enclosure right just keep him on paper towels in his current enclosure    if theyre all in one enclosure however i would separate asap or you risk cannibalization injury stress or further illness never keep solitary reptiles in groups ever some people may be willing to face the risks but it isnt recommended      i mean when theyre housed together yeah      not recommended large adult boas could send you to the hospital if you handle them in feeding mode and snakes will go into feeding mode no matter where you feed them theyre opportunistic i was actually bit more by my first boa feeding him out of his enclosure than ive ever been bit by him feeding him in his enclosure the past 45 years it actually got to the point i was moving him midswallow just so he would be preoccupied boas are ravenous youre better off getting some gloves and a hook and just practicing cancelling cues      thats awful sorry anon i would leave a review or report that vet if they arent an independent practice this sounds like the vet at least had a hand in its death its possible whatever was causing him to get backed up was lethal but the vet at least did a very questionable procedure without even discussing it with you
  if theyre all in one enclosure however i would separate asap  is this really an issue i keep my cornsnakes all together in one big tank and theyre all chill a king snake has a tank by itself an adult boa constrictor has its own tank and these 3 imperators are all in one big tank for now theyll definitely getting separated once they get closer to sexual maturity since im not really feeling babies   i have papers for them from the original breeder and these 3 boas are siblings and they seem to know each other and get along sometimes they like to be in different parts of the tank but usually they actually seek each other out and go out of their way to hang out in different spots together doesnt seem llike theyre being stressed yet
    also i forgot to add i obviously dont have a separate container to feed my big adult boa in only the smaller snakes the adult boa is being fed in her normal enclosure
  very cool
i havent really done anything yet but i decided im going to reuse an old piece so thats one third down    my thoughts so far is to have a hide to the right of the stairs with 3 entrances/exists some sort of elevated walkway with pillars in the middle and then on the opposite side the moist hide with another dry hide on top
  exits im still waking up over here
cypruss mulch or coco fiber/chips for my ball python    im leaning more towards coco chips but are their major differences between the three subtrates i listed
  some anon had a link with good descriptions of different substrates but i lost it i think you could probably do any of those and have good results coco fiber alone is kinda messy and results in gnats laying eggs in it blending it with cyprus would probably work pretty well could so cyprus mulch by itself too i dont know much about coco chips
  my leopard gecko had problem with sheding probably because it did not have humidity in his box which was supposed to be humid  and now she has remainings of old skin in her fingers  i tried soaking them and taking old skin off with tweezers but i did not succeed  the gecko has also old skin in its tail but i did not really try to take it off because i did not want her to lose her tail  now she has humidity in her box  will she lose the old skin 
got a new substrate for her a month or 2 ago working out really well far better then i anticipated  i was looking for a digging substrate for my bd but wanted to avoid sand because of many reasons at first i tried setting up a digging box but in the end she just avoided it and at night or sometimes during the day i could hear her digging on tiles i didnt want to deny her to dig  so i got recommended corbo by someone i trust and picked up a bag its sort of like a semi popped corn  she really likes to dig in it and halfsubmerge herself and constantly moves it around so so far its done exactly its job as a digging substrate  the biggest thing i was worried about is her starting to see it as food/eating it but this doesnt seem to be the case i always have fresh greens she can nibble on laid out but she actively tries to spit it out
  but she actively tries to spit it out  the corbo that is she has nice poops too
  whats it like owning a bd theyre really common but i dont know anybody who owns one
  i got her since she was about 3 months old shes about 78 now she grew immensely and i estimate her of growing at least twice the size she is now when reaching fullgrown  besides having 6 set things to do every day its actually not hard at all  turning on lights in the morning  first feed  second feed  turning off lights  spotclean poop every time  clean cage every week unless its dirty    its also my first reptile so there was a fuckup at the start   sometimes i ran out of feeder insects too fast and the stores were closed so she had to wait an entire day without food but she didnt seem too bothered and did fine on greens not saying you shouldnt feed it during the growth peroid just saying that i fucked up on feeders and she could survive a day and be fine  i hand feed her too much but its all good its a lot of fun when i release locusts or crickets into the terarrium though she hunts and jumps around i didnt even know they could rather high and fast  i was also extremely worried about the humidity at the start but theyre really resilient just keep it steady between 2035 and spray/bathe her 34 times a week and you should be fine they thrive in dry land after all    id say avoid sand or keep it max 1/3rd of your enclosure as sort of a digging spot if you do want sand i got free colored sand when i bought my terarrium and decided to get rid of it after the first week it completely discolored my bd and her entire belly was red    all in all extremely easy to handle really robust quite expensive the first year of insect feeders if you dont have a farm yourself but it should taper off over time fun to watch her hunt if you release feeder insects into the enclosure apparently theres also a smell but nobody has been bothered by it so far  re not saying you should go for secondrate animal husbandry because the creature is resilient just saying she can take it when it does go wrong unless its something with heat/uvb i guess
  i forgot to add  their shit smells absolutely disgusting it will reek throughout the whole room the enclosure is in so youll know and want to spotclean it regardless
  lights on and off  get a 10 dollar wifi outlet thing and automate that
  i thought they were usually rather expensive got any suggestions what are they called
  i bought this one the 1 pack is 17 but 4 pack is like 35 theres an app that goes with them and you can use it to set schedules this also has a web api if youre interested in that theres probably others that have these too this is just what i use       
  ah an actual wifi timed contact thats a good idea  i was thinking in terms of those extremely expensive reptile light timers that mimic day/night cycle based on season
  extremely expensive reptile light timers that mimic day/night cycle based on season  ah nah i guess you could write some code to get what time the sun will set/rise that day and use those times but i just do 8am8pm
    the stuck skin will most likely come off on the next shed if you see her starting to get pale and looking like another shed is coming soon give her one or two more soaks and put a moist hide in that should do the trick       cypress mulch works better for ground dwelling snakes like bps coco fiber gets too muddy and the surface doesnt dry out fast enough it can be a scale rot risk for that reason if by coco chips you mean coco husk the kind with bigger solid chunks in it that would work as well as cypress mulch i think       never heard of corbo before but after doing a quick read up on it here i believe it should be safe even if your beardie ingests it there shouldnt be any impaction risk       i should look in to use i use ordinary lamp timers they cost about 7 each for the mechanical ones and maybe 12 each for the digital recommend digital as the mechanical ones makes an annoying noise that adds up if you use several
  never heard of corbo before but after doing a quick read up on it here i believe it should be safe even if your beardie ingests it there shouldnt be any impaction risk  yea it is she has been living on it for the past 2 months and theres been no problems at all its odorless very easy to clean and to remove poop from you just scoop it up odorless and doesnt really get dirty or contain water for long periods of time she doesnt seem to want to eat it either  its perfect for a bd
  recommend digital as the mechanical ones makes an annoying noise that adds up if you use several  ah yea that would be annoying i like those ones i used them in my diy tank temp/humidity control and recording system
  she has moist box in all the time but it used to be dried because my stupid mother did not put water into it i could not do it because i was in another city studying i cannot have pets in a dorm unfortunately    give her one or two more soaks  what do you mean her moist box has 1cm of water and she spend some hours there but to no avail  my male gecko licks his fingers to get rid of the skin but girls dont seem to do it 
  where did you buy the corbo from im trying to look into it and i cant find anything
    no sometimes stuck shed wont come off like that im saying it will come off when your gecko has its next shed    also there shouldnt be standing water in your moist hide moist paper towel or sphagnum moss not soaking wet
  love the new renekton skin
does this stool look okmy bd has been taking 12 weeks to go to the bathroom and the vet i went to said they were knowledgeable but didnt really adress the issue or want to take the stool sample since it was 18 hours old to retest for parasites since i did that a month ago croccidia and worms were found but i already did the treatment the month before
  local reptile store they sell them in huge bags its like 15 for 25l
  also the side of the stomach has a small bit of wrinkles but i give bathes so im unsure if thats from dehydration
  its looks really dark but that could be due to something its eaten or how it feels  the only real sign that i take of it if its extremely runny to the point where it collapses on itself or if for longer periods of time multiple stools do not retain their cylinder shape    could also be due to underfeeding or after its let out a stool
  hell eat 25 large super worms without stopping and i feed collard green with carrots normally every other day
  that stool looks good to me anon
  okthanks its just been two weeks since  this stool and that one was a week and a half agonatural probiotics isnt working and ive tried mineral oil and that worked he went those two times this started when i stopped giving him canned snails from zoo med nothing else in his diet has changed
  oh lawd he comin
  if youre worried about your bd always look at how it acts  is it active and lazy does it respond to food being picked up and does it hunt or just sluggish/lethargic  does the stool come with a bit of white is it holding shape/is it cylindrical is it not runny  does it have excessive stress marks on its belly/black beard in combination of the above  these are the biggest signs of knowing if your bd is in rapid decline or simply just has an off day/shitty week
  hes been laying down later in the evening and awake early mornings since winter i work morning to evening and hasnt hissed at me or any stress marks at allhis stool has always been formed with no extra liquid and the urate being white just this past two months hes been taking longer to go but in large amounts and ive been told 27 weeks is normal but its now been 23 weeks for a stool and i had use mineral oil last two times so i dont want that to be a common thing while doing a bath 12 times a day
  it might be brumation google it
  i live in the us and havent seen ithopefully i can find something similar since or go bioactive
  ive got alot of mixed info for brumation but if you believe it is affecting itthat helps alot
  im just trying to think along with you here my bd has yet to enter brumation you could always call the vet and tell them you were unsatisfied and didnt get any information to help you decide your next move im sure theyll give you some tips on what to do  if you are bothered by it it might just bring you peace of mind as well to get a second opinion its the pricey way but at least youll be safe perhaps you have a local reptile/bd group online and could ask if anyone wants to give it a look for a coffee or something
any recommendations for a uth thermometer/temp controller do they all work with one another or are certain brand uth only compatible with certain temp regs
  dont you just set the thermostat on the substrate
  what amterials did you use to make that hide it looks nice
  third world poorfag here    woke up today to change the water of my red eared sliders and found one of them with its eyes completely chut by whiter stuff  changed the water of the plastic enclosure and then i gave them some antibiotic drops i had around    would that be enough i have to leave this sunday for a family meeting and im wondering if the turtle would be back to normal before that
anyone here has experience with theloderma corticale mossy frog whats the minimum enclosure size for a pair could they be kept alone too i guess my fluval edge is too small for them
  i got an old german magazine lying around here with a report on them apparently they like hiding a lot of the time in small cavities in nature the report talks about keeping t gordoni in a 40cm cube and breeding group of three t horridum in a 30x30x40cm i guess this could apply to t corticale as well
  interesting i have no cavities in this enclosure just a small cave in the back but i could build a back wall with cavities i will visit terraristika this week so if i end up finding one i will just ask the seller
  are you aware about their specific demands regarding the water you need to put in oak leafs bark pieces and such so that they emit tannines and other substances that are vital to them the water part looks a bit small for a species that is so heavily bound to water
  yes i read about it i will make sure the tank is prepared before i get the frogs i agree the water part is currently too small but its bigger than it looks on the picture i will extend it quite a bit still i think i will only get one single frog if at all
how long can you keep rats frozen before they go bad
  no sometimes stuck shed wont come off like that im saying it will come off when your gecko has its next shed  are you sure   people in a forum wrote that geckos can get necrosis of fingers because of it 
  good question im also interested if any one had an exact number i keep mine vacuum sealed i figure theyll last a year at least but idk for sure
anyone here with dartfrogs    i need some help deciding between d tinctorius and d auratus    are auratus really that shy
    a fluvial edge is too small even for one t corticale too small in general and far too low    all in all not suited for the species you like  t corticale is not too easy to keep also    i suggest you buy books about this species first think about if you really want to keep/are able to keep this species then build a suitable terrarium    also this  
  they can but it takes a while
  so it happens only when there are at least 2 consegutive happyendless sheddings
      general rule o thumb is 1 year its the same number used for meat for human consumption
  never kept dart frogs but have a buddy who has tinctorius is the best begginner dart frog so is the bumblebee both of these get large meaning they can eat pinhead or even medium crickets and arent as sensitive i wouldnt go with auratus unless youre fine with feeding fruit flies and all that disgusting tiny animals
  man what a fascinating color and pattern
  thank you    i wouldnt go with auratus unless youre fine with feeding fruit flies and all that disgusting tiny animals  i already have drosophila melanogaster and funebris at home for other animals  i find crickets far more disgusting so that wouldnt be a problem    the only thing im worried about is their activity level i heard auratus are pretty shy and i want to be able to observe them without them shitting their pants and hiding all the time
  cuddling is a dominant behavior in snakes unless you have something like a 68 cage for all 3 babies the tank is too small for each snake you must combine the minimum floor space for their length into one cage so for simplicitys sake a 6x2 would allow for 3 25 boas an 8x2 would allow for 3 boas just over 3    but even with enough room you arent guaranteeing one wont harm the other as long as they have access to each other they can harm each other stress hunger dominance illness etc can all lead to cannibalization    if youre going to separate them later im not sure why you dont just do it now babies are more likely to eat each other than adults unless you have a breeding season female she will not hesitate to eat a male if shes irritated though adults are more likely to actually get into fights      vacuumsealed id say at least 13 years if they stay frozen unsealed i keep them 68 months
three days ago found that my hamster lost a small patch of fur around his neck area thought maybe his diet wasnt right but today found blood exactly where he had lost his fur anyone has any clue what this could be pic not related
might be fleas animals can scratch their fur and skin off if theyre constantly itching
  nope not fleas looked into how to search for fleas found none any other clues anon
its always cancer hamster cancer
  did you check for rashes what kind of bedding and food do you give them mst likely something is irritating the skin
    could be mites too no way to check for that other than by symptoms ivermectin works for that   or could be cancer
  has no rashes just a neck without fur and a scab wound i use carefresh as for food i vary it ive given him johnsons hamster and gerbil mix lately vitakrafts loftys and party rollis ive also given him slightly too much dried mealworms intended for rabbits not long ago before realizing it should be a more rare treat     additionally hes had these to chew on          but he seems to barely touch them he mostly chews on these      all these best friend things are temporary chews i got as a one time try since he rarely chewed anything else  im thinking maybe i should freeze all his food in the futute perhaps      i bought a flea  tick spray but i was told its used for mites too its organic so it wouldnt poison the hamster its called bb so ill use it and see if that works any clue is to how i should clean his cage during this period if he has mites how often
i hope hes okay anon
  for mites you shouldnt have to clean the cage beyond what you normally do i think their whole life cycle is on the animal i am the guy who suggested it could be mites and i am actually an insecticide expert of sorts and have doubts that that product you mentioned would control skin mites you would need something woth persistance and probably systemic activity because a lot of the mites lifecycle is buried inside the skin and organic products almost never have good persistance or systemic activity ivermectin is safe if you use the correct amount which admittedly can be hard to figure out unless you get it prescribed by a vet you can buy it otc as a sheep drench but you have to dillute it and figure out how much to use
  heres the product    you would need something woth persistance  shit cant hamsters die from this though isnt cat frontline also good anyway a rat breeder told me shes used it on baby rats before and they were fine
bump
so feral cats have taken to invading my house and shitting right in front of my door ive treied shit like vinegar and citrus but it did nothing and im tired of cleaning cat shit and diarrhea every other day or of the fucking late night fights and yelling i cant have a pet so no dogs to ward them off either  im thinking of using poisoned bait what would work well for that
why use poison when you can shoot them
  maybe he lives in nonfree commie shithole
try pouring water on them or soapy water
  call up animal control to borrow live traps you can use or buy your own then just drop off the little shits at the shelter the ones that have cat aids get put down and the owners of the pet cats get a fine unless you live in an area that does tnr then youre screwed  dont go with poisoned bait it never works as well as youd like and you end up killing other things that eat the dead cats or bait as well
  i live in a shithole animal control is useless to nonexistent authorities only intervene when its things like trafficking of rare species as for poisoning other things the most that would get poisoned here is other feral cats bugs rats and maybe a feral dog none of which i particularly care about       i dont have a gun even if i did they only come very late at night when im asleep and bolt at the first sign of danger/movement which makes  a rather unviable option too once they go over the edge into other buildings its impossible to even chase them
  one thing i failed to mention is that there is blood in the feces and sometimes its diarrhea so i believe its sick and since it eats trash it probably has parasites too
  at night when im asleep and bolt at the first sign of danger/movement which makes   a rather unviable option too  water hose what sort of house you have maybe you can give them a shower from above    i hope you use some sort of clorine to clean    most humane thing is to set a trap catch them and drive somewhere or kill but i didnt recommend this
  youre really better off just calling animal control or something
  see   animal control is useless to nonexistent
id on this little one  found in my driveway

this thread
  hes crossing the street because he saw a friendly neighborhood pibble approaching
  hes off to skyrim 2 now
  realizing that linux is not worth it
i think hes searching for nirvana
  now why would he be afraid of that
i have a shiba inu thats just about a year old he loves to play bite my hands which im fine with he never bites hard enough to ever inflict pain or anything like that but is it good to encourage this kind of playing for him with people in the long run
  there are two schools of thought  biting is bad because they can bite hard so train them to never bite  train them to know that their bite hurts when they bite hard so they dont bite hard when playing  i guess it would depend on how smart your dog is and how much you trust it  i have always had very large dogs and trained them the second way they only ever played with their teeth with me never my wife or kids
  i raised a kitten once and she used to playfully bite one time she bit too hard and i manhandled her a bit and got visibly and audibly upset to let her know that it hurt i didnt hurt her just forced her onto her back and held her there for a couple seconds and said no loudly i could tell she understood by her expression  ever since then she still nips playfully but she knows there is a limit dont try to play some game with the dog just be honest with it about its behaviour
  whichever you decide matters less than your ability to be consistent about it
lmao
dude lol
why is that cat outside
  why does it look like that
  inbreeding
  because it finally had the confidence to pee in a bush but it turned around to find someone walking near it

hahaha epic xd   1000 internetz for you 
wtff thats me xd
fuuuuuuuuuuuuu you got me bro
  please blink mother pleaser
  epic as fuck
  woah haha literally me
that is from my hoa                            etc etc
i think its really funny when people like op try this hard to justify being lazy when just getting up and raking would have been faster
  its an hoa not an ecogroup leaves are unsightly and they want them removed for that reason primarily it doesnt matter whatever the fuck else they said
hoa    you deserve it
  that is from my hoa  not even once
hoa  i will concede there are some nice things about having them i hate that some of my neighbors leave their garbage cans at the curb all the time or may let their grass get a bit long in the long run though its so nice not having to worry if i paint my house the wrong color my fence being too tall or adding planters to my garden the fees are also atrocious for very little benefit in most cases
  its just pointing out how retarded hoas are but good job grasping for a reason to insult someone on the internet your wit and bravery is commendable
  i still dont understand how hoas are legal ive researched it before and still dont understand it no one should have that much power over your property and residence on it except the government the idea that nosey neighbors can drag you into court and evict you from your property for not mowing your lawn is absolutely insane
  because its a legal way to keep blacks out regardless of what anyone says that is their primary goal good or bad
  leaves are unsightly  so basically hoas have shit taste
  dont you pay exorbitant hoa dues for them to hire leaf rakers
  not evict but put a lien on it cities will do the same thing to you as well the legality of it is that you signed a contract when you bought the house agreeing to become a member of the association and to only sell it others that will become members    some are better or worse than others
  but the idea that youd have to be forced to sign that sort contract in order to live somewhere is what strikes me as having to be illegal im not the other poster
  no more illegal than any other contract you sign when living somewhere eg a lease or rental agreement

  raising your arm to shoot a dog   the overcompensating manlet meme is real after all
  i wouldnt even let my cute harmless lab runt lay down with an infant never mind a pit bull that could snap any second the dog could see something out the window and spring up off that couch and knock the baby on the floor or step on it with clawed feet or you name it never fucking mind a fucking pitnigger hellmaw thats gonna be hungry in a few minutes
why are dog owners retarded
  people who are happy with the ny times are smart
  i thought everyone already knew that pigs and crows are smarter than dogs
  dog bred for killing and fighting  he wouldnt harm a fly xd
  if your sample size comes from dog owners who read the new york times then of course theyll be retarded everyone who reads the new york times is retarded
  you ever play an online video game and someone says over the mic dude dont shoot me im friendly and then they proceed to murder you when your back is turned this dog is that but irl
  that act should be called pitbulling
    1 for trigger dicipline 9 for edge heres your you
nigger doggo bad
  you
  i never play online video games for exactly this reason
  the npc meme is funny because npcs dont use it correctly and its easy to identify them
  t npc
  new studies over the past few decades have shown many more animals are more intelligent than we once assumed  shoot even lowly pigeons are at least as capable of adaptation and learning as an intelligent breed of dog  this is very important information we need to spread the word on how even common pest species can feel emotional trauma and thus should be dealt with in more dignified ways than some are today  but how will we advertise this information   your dog is a retard click here to read about new study showing how dumb you and your dog are
  exactly this  i can tell its an npc using the meme when they use it to mock a common opinion i subscribe to
  a broken clock is right twice a day you know

  let my wifes son play with the pibble while i relax using my handheld switch and drinking my pumpkin spice frappe with basedmilk
children are worthless anyway were overpopulated if a pitbull kills a kid itll get euthanised win/win
  were overpopulated    unless you live in some shithole like india or china no youre not good job drinking the kool aid you fucking cattle
  its not really an objective quantifiable matter you can argue theres still space enough for food production etc but thats far from everything that matters unless you want to become increasingly insignificant
  dogs are not meant to be intelligent they are meant to obey   we do the thinking for them that is why man and dog rules the world
  not him but think of it this way the only countries that give two shits about the planet animals and other humans are developed countries which are also the countries with the under population problem   you want to leave this world for the chinese then be my guest and not have children

  rights are a meme
  rights are a meme though you think for a second that if the government wanted to fuck your shit up they couldnt
    fuck nigbulls and fuck you redd 4channelers
  rights are for niggers lmao
    kek
  words can never hurt me xd      i make so much money i literally cannot find enough bullshit to spend it on guns are just one thing ive wasted a few grand on shallposting is just another diversion i understand your poverty having slept in a car before and i cum in your general direction    i hit the dab
  owns guns  no real estate  poorfags
  im going to start calling it that
  good point i dont own any real estate part of why i have so much disposable capital  how much should i buy what qualities should i look for and what should i use it for
  under population problem    literally the only one who could have an under population problem are (((business owners))) because suddenly they might be forced to actually properly pay and compensate the people working for them instead of relying on hordes fighting over minimum wage positions    you want to leave this world for the chinese then be my guest and not have children  so your solution to fighting overpopulated shitholes is to also become an overpopulated shithole i mean you sound more retarded than idiots who think printing money will solve poverty  i mean why fight globalization and strive for quality over quantity lets turn the entire world into a rat colony with designated shitting steets
  what are pensions  what is the social security system  what is birth rates varying based on ethnicity and culture  what is the replacementrate to maintain a stable population
  they couldnt even win against a bunch of starving gooks and goat fuckers      good point

      i honestly didnt think my asking if you were upset would rile you up enough to have you post more and im thankful that i checked /an/ today because i havent laughed this hard in a while     you remind me of those guys that used to post pictures of themselves with their fleamarketbought swords i didnt mean to hurt your feelings this badly dude
  have some more phatty
  weak people should not own strong dogs
  implying you could detach a pitbull barehanded
everyone knows dogs and wolves for that matter are pretty stupid mammals
  its okay  it clearly says friendly on the harness  he simply wants a friend 
  lol
  cute pibble 
  t npc
what an amazing pupper
wow
  thats it meet me by the dumpster motherfucker
/an/ i need your help theres a frog near where i live who croaks really loud thing is this particular one is croaking nonstop regardless of time be it at night morning afternoon evening rain or no rain it just keeps on croaking on and on nonstop somehow this frog is somewhere in one of those big ass drains covered with metal grates but the problem is that theres a motorcycle parking area nearby which means that theres always people there and if i try to do anything funny they will definitely notice     what i want to know is why does it croak continuously day and night dont frogs usually only croak during the night why does other frogs keep quiet during the day while this particular one goes on and on anyway is it because of mating season or something health problems birth defect and whats the best possible solution you guys have to make it go away its driving me fucking insane with its endless croaking    for reference i currently live in southeast asia the frog croaks at every five to ten second interval with two to three very short croaks during each interval
bump
he must be stuck go save him
probably just his territory and hes signalling other frogs not to fuck with him catch some female frogs and put them in the drain so hes occupied with something
i cant imagine what mentality leads to hating natural sounds so much people dont care about cars but frogs bother them what a world
  people dont care about cars  nice conjecture you got there you think i wont hate cars if they made blaring noises nonstop 24 hours a day and hating natural sounds crickets birds machines car engines monkeys alarm bells thunderstorms frat boys shouting in the middle of the night these are all the things i have to live with natural or not but all of them stop making noises after a certain amount of time except this frog it keeps on croaking hour after hour day and night and i want to know why and that is the main topic of this thread
how do you know its same frog
  voice always comes from the same spot have the same pitch and there were never two croaking voices overlapping at once though now that you mention it thats not enough evidence to be completely sure that its just one frog
lets have a nice thread about the comfiest continent
whats hidden in these dead wastes
nobody wants to be in my comfy antarctica thread
  might as well have a thread about how dead and lifeless the moon is
  post animals from antarctica you husk of a human
whats up with antarctica and why is it surrounded by secrecy
  i love it the empty ice deserts of antarctica are very relaxing and mysterious to me      seals are super comfy just lying around and relaxing
penguins are great
whats to stop us from colonizing antarctica once climate change kicks into overdrive
  the extinction of humanity and the utter lack of soil there will probably slow things down a bit
  robohitler      (((they))) are planning to turn it into neozion that is of course unless someone were to place the brain of an antisemetic world leader into a titanium body fuled by nuclear fission and fury not that anyones doing that haha
doesnt get comfier than this
can common bums such as myself go to antarctica or is it scientists only
  are there pitbulls in antarctica
  yes you can just take your own ship there no one will stop you
  they hire a lot of common bums and the pay is extraordinarily good     you have to pass extensive background and psychological tests though
  climate change is a fraudits just a way for the evil unetcto make money
  seems like itd be cool to do for a season or a year      sounds like a good way to disappear
  i think they do year long contracts which is the reason for all the testing they arent going to take you home just because you decide you dont like it
    anyways if youre interested i think /out/ does threads about it    they used to have a regular or two that lived down there before
  oh yeah thats completely understandable i was a sailor so im used to being away from home for extended periods in cramped quarters i was looking at a website and there are multiple openings for moving cargo around and operating vehicles which seem interesting      thanks for the heads up
i think weddell seals are my new favorite animals    
  that looks cool
  a lot of unique fossils to be sure its almost difficult to believe this continent once flourished with life
  climate change denial is a delusion purported by industry leaders of our archaic energy paradigm so they can make even more money before they die in ten years and dont have to deal with this problem like the rest of the world has to
antarctica is fucking scary imagine what we can find under the ice like fish from thousands of years ago that are virtually undamaged because of no decomposition
  a bunch of africans dying is a bad thing
  some fossils maybe thats about it maybe coal or oil deposits
  when they start flooding into civilized countries it is
  they are flooding in our countries because of climate change and not because our elites want to forcefully transform the population

can pug breeders ever be stopped why do people think a dog born with respiratory problems constantly struggling to breathe is cute
its a pyramid skeem
  mixing them actually fixes them though    its kennelfaggots that need to be stopped
  almost as bad as pitbulls
  pug with a working respiratory system and somewhat resized eyes/chihuaha that doesnt look like a vibrating sewer rat  sounds like an improvement to both breeds desu
    wonder what breed of dog would be best to mix with a pug to get an optimal health    same with pitbulls just something with a long muzzle maybe
  what if somebody were to breed a pitbull with a pug
  the last thing they heard as they were savagely mauled to death is the sound of an asthmatic wheeze
  hookjpg
  instead of a maul reflex it just collapses form asphyxiation when it snaps
  cursed image
  please never post this again
  wonder what breed of dog would be best to mix with a pug to get an optimal health    min pins and beagles generally come out alright
  based pyramid skeem poster
realistically what would it take to stop the demand for pugs and other abominations awareness campaigns protesting     also what if the whole thing is an agreement between breeders and vets more health problems more money
  what would it take to stop the demand for pugs  nothing you need to change the breed standards there is nothing wrong with a dog have a shorter face but when it gets so smashed like pugs and some bull dogs it fucks with their ability to live  the breed standard needs to change like they are doing with the gsd and the sloping back just remove or change the criteria of the skull and face shape from the judging and make it a negative if they have it  pic is what pugs looked like when they were originally exported from china
who got fucked worse pugs or horses    one has to live 12 years never being able to breathe and with their eyes randomly popping out of the socket    the other literally dies if you feed it too late or too early
  ironically the dog in your picture is probably a hundred times healthier than the average pug
  pugs  only a few horse breeds are pug tier and they arent really pug tier
nothing will stop pugs because people are too stupid to educate themselves on their animals or frankly dont care
  unfortunately this is why catfaggotry is a thing also
how close are you to your pets
  he jerry le monke pepnis
so were dealing with a very bad flea problem in a house with 1 dog smol and 3 cats just got done treating them all with these hartz ultraguard flea drop things and now im reading online that these products kill them    hoping that it wont but apart from this how else can i deal with this our dog is practically going insane from these fleas
you need to keep your dog separate from your cats until the product dries     its pretty rare that any dog flea meds are safe for cats to be around either find one or get committed to keeping your animals separated
  im reading online that these products kill them  only if you are a mouth breathing retard  you just put a topical poison to the skin and fur of your dog if your dog or cat grooms themselves it need to be applied in a place where they cant clean it off if your animals clean eachother then you need to seperate them all from each other for the day  i dont know about hartz but frontline never worked for me so i used advantix and it worked very well    its pretty rare that any dog flea meds are safe for cats to be around  its all the same poison just different doses i would buy the extra large dog one and split it up using a syringe and give doses to all my animals from 1 dose xlrg dog because it ended being half the cost
  its all the same poison just different doses   not true permethrin is reasonably safe for dogs but will kill cats cats probably get a spinosad formula while dogs get permethrin   anyway op do your homework you cant just treat your pets amd think job done youll need to clean the house very well vacuum every day wash all your clothes and sheets and keep doing it for at least two weeks if its very cold out where you are you can just put clothes and blankets and stuff outside overnight rugs too fleas are easier than bed bugs at least
does anyone else think about what their pet would do to them if they were shrunk to mouse size    pretty sure my cat would kill me even if it recognizes me just by trying to play
it wouldnt think even a second before ripping you in half
i think my dog would look at me sideways smell me real close and smack me around with his paws
  wow i would be able to fly a parrot nice
wow cubivore is a spirit nice
  the only reason housecats dont hunt us is because were too big
  herbivorous   smart     parrot would be your best hope if survival really    why dont they hunt ferrets then
  fucking wish there was a sequel
is there a more magical animal than the sea otter
  fpbp
the ocean is full of magic
they are rapists
  i love seeing sea otters they look like theyre having a grand old time like 99 of the time    they also hold hands when they sleep so they dont drift apart
  humans they found a way to walk on the moon by melting rocks and burning chemicals
  whyd you post a view from a mountain
  goddamn being reincarnated as a wild sea otter would be based   literal sushi buffet everyday
  even the way they sleep is adorable
the manatee  pic related
  goats but instead of good magic its evil magic
  naughty is not evil goats are just having fun
my baby yuri
shit its been turned on the wrong side anyway another picture of the boy
i got to rub the belly of a sea otter once when one surfaced right next to me sitting on my surfboard it was one of those never forget moments
  so is the caravan you want let in
  the ermine
  shit its been turned on the wrong side  yes the cats inside seems to be out for some reason
borzoi aka forest spirits
this lil nigga right here
yes the north american river otter  the asian smallclawed otter is also good
  beat it nerd
  what is that
  fishercat
  weasel bear also called a fisher handsome creatures with a bad reputation
  otters are based one got into a garden in vancouver and managed to eat 11 koi while evading capture over the course of multiple days they drained the pond to save the remaining fish and couldnt catch the otter in the end    living the dream
  the first one to be seen in my state in 150 years was shot by some douchebag as soon as it was reported bastard went out specifically for it
      those things kill cats in the middle of the night around here and they sound like crying children i love them
  tfw otters destroy your highly prized fish stock and your whole livelihood along with it  cant do anything because hurting them is a serious crime  the virgin fisher vs the chad otter
  i love seals especially sea lions
dont know that much about sea otters but river otters are fucking ridiculous animals  
  this is why i hate people
  please tell me he was lambasted by both the locals and the media
      i cant find anything on the fisher that was spotted in iowa being shot but if it was shot its really the state of iowas damn fault for not anticipating fishers returning and thus protecting them or even regulating their take    i bet the muh pelts culture is strong with iowa too i know it is in michigan and minnesota
  i read a report about a sea otter that was observed drowning another otter before having sex with it
  i love the way it eats and the way its little fingers are and the way it moves and even the little sounds it makes but that face is pretty ugly _  gotta sacrifice something to be hydrodynamic i guess
  i did that once but with a hot girl who kept snubbing me not an otter
  ddid you just call me ugly anonsan
  flat and wide face  otherwise theyre a cute
my female crestie is getting to big for the 10 gal   i have a terrarium thats plenty big for 2 geckos but the other gecko is male  hes very docile so i really dont think hed hurt her but i dont want baby geckos     how likely is it that theyll breed  and if they will breed what would be a space efficient home for her
they will breed eventually   take a 20 gallon long and put it in its end thats plenty of space   or an 18x24 exo terra  or a 60 litre sterilite tub has plenty of room
be me 12 years old   living in shithole slav home country at the time  visit a friends house from school  nice house big garden and a rotweiler mix locked in a tiny little crate in the corner of the garden where all it can do is turn around  ask friend why the dog is locked in there  he bites  but surely you let him out at least sometimes no  used to let him out at night but hed trample down the flowerbeds so now we dont any more  the poor animal is circling in the crate in a pool of its own shit and piss  next to a water bowl covered in layers of grime and muddy water  i am really quiet the whole time i am over  ignore that girl at school from that day on and pretty much never speak to her again  the whole thing still pisses me off to this day when i think about it guess they got the dog because it was cute as a puppy didnt train or socialize it at allstarted being afraid of it when it got bigger and locked it in that miserable crate where it slowly went insane
  meant to write experiences in the threads caption but i am tired after work fuck
a thing in the small town i grew up in was to toss kittens in the air and blast them with a shotgun
  i used to know a kid who did pretty much the same and would brag about it   i am quite sure had we lived in the usa he wouldve shot up the school or something     having grown up in a 2nd world country while caring about animals was honestly terrible i seen things that made my blood boil daily
have hyper religious neighbors growing up  literal holier than thou attitudes to boot  still occasionally hang out after school because whynot i guess  their mom is a no fun allowed cunt and dad is allergic to animals despite living next to a massive horse stable owned by wifes parents  kids being kids want pets  their parents bite  erect bigass rabbit hutch thing right near our property line big yards pretty much a half acre away from their house and garage  hutch is just a complex of cages with a roof thing on top but   cages otherwise exposed to the elements  michigan btw  they get like 5 or more rabbits and put them in the cages and proceed to only feed them semi regularly and otherwise ignore them because they are mean  outside 24/7  winter too  next year  do virtually the same thing but with goats  dad spends a month building a roughly guessing 20x20 pen for goats  again like the rabbits they quickly become ignored because all 3 neighbor kids lose interest after the novelty is gone like 2 weeks  at some point in here they also added a dog that surprise surprise gets a doghouse with super small fenced in area for it to live in that again never gets let out or played with after like a month  rinse and repeat with cats that eventually breed into a sizable feral population  grandparents saw my sister pet one and became hellbent on accusing us of stealing them there on out as they would often wander into our yard as stray cats do   they also were to fucking lazy to feed even the initial cats and insisted that they could survive off of dry dog food and field mice  one summer they were also gifted horses to use for riding  shock and awe that when the horse wasnt automatically hyper obedient cuddly and show ready after a month of ownership they were left to barn sour at the stable next to their yard  yet all the while they kept super high and mighty attitudes over us because we only went to church maybe 2 sundays out of the month
  cont  thats kinda the just of it most winters we took to having to shelter their cats and shit in our back poll barn because otherwise they would sit out on our porch and freeze at night because they knew if they snuck in they could get into our indoor cats food bowls tired in to the theft accusation we pretty much told the grandmother to keep hers/their/whoevers fucking barncats in their own yard we stopped going to their church as a result of their neglecting animals dumping them on others and pointing fingers
    i am phone posting from work had no idea how fucking grammatically dicked this was hopefully its somewhat legible
  hardcore christfags getting things on a whim ruining/neglecting them and dumping them on others   i am not even surprised tbqh  you have to be borderline retarded to become a bible thumping idiot to begin with anyway  really wonder why are they so much more prevalent in the usa compared to other first world countries  though
  sounds less to do with their religion and more that they were spoiled rich cunts
  i think youre mainly right but their whole church was for the most part a pretty bad example of the religion the neighbor dad ran it funny enough he was the one cool guy in that house but the whole church community mainly pulled in by his cunt wife who was a long time local were super super holier than thou types i would go to after school bible study on wednesdays almost every week and put up with the narcissists in the bunch until i had to skip a few weeks was busy going though a rough patch in my life and they all out stopped picking up my sister and i after that not that we were a burden either they literally had a couple econoline vans that they bought and used solely as a pseudo bus route for the church on those wednesdays and sundays
  whats weird though is the pastor was a smart dude highly educated and worked as a sucessful state farm agent before he felt called to the church lived mainly off of what he had saved and quite nicely as well
be me  2 yo  tried to flash a cat into a toilet
  why would you even think the cat would go down the toilet to begin with
  bible thumpers are typically happier longer lived more charitable etc at least when we measure for religiosity in studies of the general public    the self righteous dickhole kind here are the ones that burn themselves into our memory though probably because its juicy and maddening being made to feel inferior by someone so hypocritical
    good fuck cats
  dunno that is the thing i liked doing for some reason  also this  be me  5 yo  catch crown somehow  parents shouted to trow it back   trow on ground  good thing that it flew away but i believe it hit ground hard
i must tell this story before of this board but its relevant on here so i will now sorry for my english   when my brother and i are about nine of years old we will go down to a river nearby of my house and there is always cats here when one day there is a cat that is sitting by there down the small cliff and we pushed the boulder rock down the side the boulder rolls from down off of there to harm this cat greatly the cat begins on screaming this sound is the sound of a man that is been yelling not the sound of a cat my mother was telling us always we are one day to meet this spirit residing on the forest and river that is called jasper   the cat was yelling this manner and that so we begin to know it is been protected by jasper and we will run when we are running we can still listen of this cat that is screaming in a voice of a mans then we determine of how it will stop so my mother can never listen to it then we must have to go back to return of the whole area and decide on murder of this cat fully but when we go back to return the cat has gone away and can not be seen elsewhere also it was this very spooky experience and i do have regret on this a lot
  forgive english i am russia    i come to study clothing and fashion at american university i am here little time and i am very hard stress i am gay also and this very difficult for me i am very religion person i never act to be gay with other men before but after i am in america 6 weeks i am my friend together he is gay also he was show me american fashion and then we are kiss    we sex together i never before now am tell my mother about gay because i am very shame as i fock this american boy it is very good to me but also i am feel so guilty i feel extreme guilty as i begin orgasm i feel so guilty that i pick up my telephone and call mother in russia i awaken her it too late for stopping so i am cumming sex i am very upset and guilty and crying so i yell her i am cum from sex in russia she say what i say i am cum from sex and she say you boy do not marry american girl and i say no i am cum from sex with man i am in ass i cum in ass and my mother very angry me she not get scared though    i hang up phone and am very embarrass my friend also he is very embarrass i am guilt and feel very stupid i wonder why do i gay with man but i continue because when it spurt it feel very good in american ass
  i dont get it even my redneck cousins at least keep dogs on long leashes to let their dogs have some freedom however my cousin kept her pet rats one rat at a time in a small cage intended for dwarf hamsters and mice it was even below the minimum average size according to the danish hamster foundation the worlds second smallest legal minimum cage requirement meaning pretty much no pet rodent should be housed in there especially not a giant rat it was more of a carrier size also all their dogs were free since they got them from dog shelters and all of them got tumors within 1 or 2 years living with them due to shit food theyd give the dogs     the only good thing about my redneck half slav half baltic/scandi cousins is that they got me extremely interested in various pet rodents from an early age hence why i now only stick to those types of pets its creepy how something you see as a small child can forever affect you and become a part of you otherwise i probably would of never wanted mice and pet rats
my cousin  had single female rat  zero space in cage  very docile no signs of anger  long life lived all 3 years  died from tumor and respitory infection  she never cleaned her room which suffocate their rat probably    white chick lesbian classmate of mine   had one rat  claimed the rat shockingly never showed aggression towards her always was docile  retard lesbo once let her rat out loose on a table and she dropped his cage on him breaking his leg  kept him alive anyway  still shocked the rat didnt bite her face off after that  also extremely small cage    i keep hearing stories that rats turn aggresive and will bite your fingers off if you keep them alone in a cage but i know so many people who keep single pet rats who always stay docile i only ever heard one story where a rat became aggresive and depressed due to living alone and attacked his owned i dont know if these people arent educated or just dont give a shit about their pets
  go friends house  he uses tsk tsk tsk to call his cat over instead of clicking the tip of his tongue against his gums
  
my ex used to grab my pet finches out of their cage shake them until they stopped moving and then throw them i used to beg him not to do it but he just laughed and said hed kill them if i made him angry he also kept making jokes about pouring acid in my fishtank or buying me a pet rat just to kill it and dissect it  he also had a parrot that he and his crackhead whore mother abused and neglected into severe mental illness
  sounds like its your fault for enabling him
grow up on a carribean island    hey anon come do lizard fight with us  wat  we capture lizards by the neck with strings choke them make them fight cause theyre pissed until they turn grey and die and then we laugh our ass off cause their bodies go limp and they die  ahah no thanks  hey anon lets use our moms nurse stuff to inject cocacola in the lizards  wat  come on its fun it makes bubbles and they stumble and they make funny noises  ahah no thanks  hey anon lets throw iguanas on crushed glass  wat  come on its fun cause they run on the glass and bleed out and we hunt them with sticks  ahah no thanks    its only a sample and its true of course it wasnt actual dialogue but you get the idea these kids had so much free time on their hands the critters were the first victims roaches rats moths lizards turtles little birds kittens puppies anything clumsy was fun to play with    i want off this ride i dont want to remember anymore
  im going to hope they are either foreigners descendants of colonizers or haitians because i dont want to hate my own people
  not gonna deny it i was 15 years old and retarded
  guy sounds like a real shithead cant believe i have to share a planet with these people
  if youre gonna date openly abusive shitheads at least do the world a favor and not blame your degenerate taste on all men being the same please
  where in her post did she blame guys
  meet some people online  they invite me to their home  its a big house but smells like 24 cats live there  its only 2 but they arent neutered and nobody cleans after them at all  their sands is filled to the bring with cat shit  theres a small yard behind  its surrounded by buildings so barely any light reaches  find out that they have a dog in there  it spends the day there alone  the place is filled with its shit and piss because they never take him out for a walk even though three different people live there and at least one doesnt work at all  saddest looking dog ive ever seen  doesnt even interact with people at all he looks at you like a cow looks at the horizon  tell them that a dog cannot live under these conditions  yeah we should take him out every now and then i guess  they literally never do it  tell them about neutering the cats  yeah we should do that sooner or later i guess  they never do it  some days later they have adopted two kitten    i cant even bring it to the police because they give zero fucks about animals but i was seething the whole time its been 10 years now and still sometimes think about the poor dog
  kek show me exactly where i blame guys  speaking in very broad terms i trust men more than i trust women because apart from 23 cunts that i was drawn to with my retarded teenage hormones ive only known great men my current bf loves all animals
  they were white people and carribean stop judging people based on their ethnicity origin or anything everyones a cunt when left idle for fucks sake  some of the worst people regarding animal rights are blond blue eyed people and some other are litteral niggers  were all cunts when we have too much time on our hands
  im not white though i just didnt want to imagine fellow tainos doing that stuff  was it a dutchowned island by the way
  guadeloupe so french  some kids were white and some creoles  generally creoles arent cool with animals in my 20 years long experience
    its nice to see such sociopathic behaviour getting rewarded with 15yo pussy  maybe if ill be a sociopath i can get 15yo pussy too      not really abuse bit was walking through the woods yesterday and a couple with two smallish dogs was walking by the dogs crowded around me and barked a little  after i walked on a bit and the dogs already lost interest in me the guy took one of the dogs roughly by the collar dragged him over to me and all but shouted see this this is no this is no whilst pointing at me and still holding the dog roughly by the collar dogs front legs off the ground
    incels like you belong on reddit
  phew not one of our islands  that one was actually inhabited by the literal cannibals we were constanty fighting off which could only manage to capture the lesser antilles making our capital right next to them for a better concentration of manpower is what kept our control of the greater antilles in the longrun  anyways since theyre caribs again actual cannibals it completely explains their treatment of animals
  be me  walking to park with some friends  see big white alsatian sniffing another dog being friendly  owner gets impatient and wants to move on starts pulling the dog but the alsatian wont move  owner has one of those tennis ball throwers he decides to smack the dog with it  dog then moves  how unnecessary     also minor shout to someone i know who has no idea how to pick up a guinea pig safely just grabs them round their back ends and lifts them head dangling to the floor and their legs kicking ive told her my pig is super skittish just so she doesnt try to grab him
  still fucked him  sympathy for your finches but not for you roastie
    i never fucked him after he started abusing my finches though
  that post is so wrong it hurts to read go to fucking school the aborigenes were all killed during the colonization nowadays in the french indies at least there are creoles white people some middle easterners and indian people  anyways since theyre caribs again actual cannibals it completely explains their treatment of animals  how can you be this stupid    are you trying yo say animal cruelty made by idle kids isnt something that can be found in all places on earth you moron
  treating garbage like garbage  thats abuse
  my uncle in mexico has a dog locked in his backyard all day people in 3rd world countries dont treat animals right
  caribbean people are not civilized
  the aborigines were all killed during the colonization  they might as well have not been because you fuckers gave us a totally new problem to replace them  aka haitians
  its almost as if breeding slaves and cannibals is a bad idea
  they dont even treat people right
  cringe
  cat protected by some spooky spirit  decide to go back and try kill it again  were you worried it was gonna go around screaming like a man all the time
  seething
  i hate christfags so much not all of them but the american conservative ones that are all over the south and midwest
  i think youre on the wrong board
    fuck i think i popped a blood vessel
  go back to tumblr
these threads just make me upset im gonna go feed my fish and hug my cat
my uncle40 and cousin20 are the most irresponsible adults ive ever seen in my life they parasite my grandparents and never pay any of their bills get in trouble all the time smoke weed buy stolen shit blackmail my aunt to make her their servant    they decide to have a female cat  refuse to feed the cat  never neutered her  because of that she had kittens after kittens and with her small body that was clearly taking a toll on her  her only salvation was my grandfather who would go and feed her  she got a tumor in her belly that started to infect and become worse and worse  they both ignore her  i tell them to treat her they refuse to spend money on a cat while spending tons on weed i tell to at least take the cat to the vet so he can end her pain  they shrug it off and ignore me  at some point the cat was in so much pain that they had to lock her under the house so she would scream and bleed there alone  sometimes she would escape and bleed everywhere  they wouldnt even clean it so my grandfather had to go there and do it  the cat eventually died  when i confronted them about it in a family meeting they just laughed as it was funny  break my uncle nose and throw hot coffee at my cousins face  get kicked out of the meeting    and this is how i never talked to them again and told them if they step in my house theyll leave in a bag and to this day i dont know what they did with all the kittens and id rather not know  the only thing im grateful is that my dad was not there the day they talked about the cat or he would be in jail now when i told him he was foaming with anger
  cant say they didnt deserve it
  my biggest regret is not resisting being kicked out they deserved a few more punches and kicks and i knew they wouldnt hit me back because they arent stupid enough to hit a cop even if its family
   i confronted them about it in a family meeting they just laughed as it was funny   my uncle nose and throw hot coffee at my cousins face    who has family meetings good for you though
  its common here  fuck i hate this thread got so angry writing this shit
  you did good
  you are responsible
  everyones a cunt when left idle  this is untrue and is just pushed so that good people dont have to hate most of humanity
  the amount of kids that will behave that way definitely changes depending on what group theyre from and not all kids will ever behave that way many children even at fucking 3 are highly empathetic to animals  please stop excusing evil
  this is why i have trouble having sympathy for humans as a species we are trash
aunt bought a male eclectus parrot because she thought it looked cool  parrot needed some kind of minor surgery  vet told her not to feed it before  like a retard she fed it a bunch of treats to calm it down  parrot choked and died during surgery  she bought a new male and female eclectus  never actually loved them or cared for them only reason she bought them was to not be lonely after losing the first  in 21 years she didnt once take them out of their tiny cages  the only contact she had with them was yelling and throwing things at them whenever they started screaming which was just about all the time  female parrot plucked out every feather it could reach  thank fuck she stopped being retarded and gave them away to a bird sanctuary a few years ago
  be me  12 yo boy  third world country  my yard  rabbits escape from their cage  dad calls me  hey look at the dog anon  wtf dad he is going to kill our rabbits  i give 2 steps and my dad grabs my shoulder  hes a big guy  thats what they deserve let the dog have fun  ook dad dont hit me for trying to protect the poor retard rabbits  poor guys the dog finished 5 or 8 in a few seconds of brutal chase

mother cousin and i all get bearded dragons at the same time from the same breeder  my mother and i take our beardies home set up enviroments etc   keep in touch with cousin ask her how the lizard is doing she responds positively each time  almost a year later mother and i visit cousins house  lizard is absolutely emaciated  looks like it was just liberated from auschwitz  ask cousin wtf  she says it hasnt wanted to eat for many months now  hasnt done anything about this  realize lizards lack of hunger is actually just cousin being too lazy too feed it  it eats the food i give it  lazy bitch has just been leaving this animal starve in her bedroom for almost a full year  mother takes lizard home way too late for it to recover  mother has to watch lizard die    several years later    cousins gets a new beardie  has it barely a week  it injures its eye in her shitty set up  eye gets infected from lack of vet care  infection spreads  cousin sends almost dead lizard to my moms house  mom has to watch second lizard die on the way to vets    i fucking hate my cousin she bought an adult bearded dragon a few days ago and is already saying she wants to get rid on it because it stinks    pic is her second victim
  i dont trust young women who get reptiles usually its all for im not like other girls points and they dont actually give a fuck
  she is very much that type of person shes had tons of quirky pets that shes gotten rid of    shes also one of those horse girls also im pretty sure she contributed to the death of her horse too
long story short i stayed with some shady people who regularly abuse their dog   goes from yelping reluctantly at any attempt at affection to following me around and jumping on my lap after i finally gain her trust   the other people who lived there probably went back to beating the shit out of her after i left   hope is a bitch innit
  i hate those people so much living creatures arent fucking pokemon cards to collect
  anecdotal claims of animal abuse in an unspecified region and and to an unspecified extent exist  humans are such trash
  shes pregnate now too shes mental smashed all the windows in the car her mom bought her after her mom got upset that she wrote a big rant on fb about how horrible a mother she supposedly is according to my cousin its wrong for a mother to be upset upon walking in on her teenage daughter having sex in the living room     the horse that she had was down right skeletal her father punched it in the face once so i guess thats where she gets her love for animals from
  cats are trash also so it balances out
  was 11 walking my retriever  guy drives on sidewalk and hits my dog kills it instantly almost nailed me  later tries and sue family because it broke headlight  guy was a veteran remember because of his bumper sticker saying so  have hated veterans ever since
not straight up pet abuse but i work at a pet store and the amount of stupid fat middle aged women that bring in their untrained overweight aggressive dogs used to really get to me im used to it now sadly we cant tell them to leave because theyll make a big scene and well get written up

i dont think ive ever seen someone so triggered by use of the enter key     on topic one of my relatives good friends lived with her mother who was an animal hoarder the whole house was filled with cats bowls litter boxes and empty containers of food and litter the kitchen couldnt be reached but hey at least they all seemed fed and relatively healthy
    a man is known by the company he keeps
  i genuinely think weak incapable people who arent skilled or talented enough to make it among humans get off on dominating animals since they can easily get away with it
always keep shortlived pets like rats so i can stop owning pets within a couple years if i ever want or need to  current rats pass away within a week of each other  well that seems like a fair point to stop pet owning til i get out of college and have a stable house  just a month into nonownership dipshit cousin tells me basically that either i take her redeared slider terrapin or she releases it in some random creek  fine whatever i dont want this asshole to have animals anyway  how long do these things live anyway  internet says 30 years  fuck well at least its gonna come with an aquarium right  it shows up at my house in a fucking fish bowl with no light or filter  fuck oh well at least its tiny  internet says they can get to the size of a shoebox  fuck okay ill just give it away as soon as i can turtles are valuable right   every overweight latino is competing to sell res babies for a dime a dozen    what asshole dumps the responsibility of a longliving largegrowing aquatic animal that rips up any decoration on someone else this is why pet sales should be banned from flea markets its been three years and my turt is bigger and happier in her big aquarium but to be honest i was looking forward to not cleaning and feeding a pet all the time but now because some tool decided to get an exotic on a whim i may not know that feeling til im in my 50s
  what asshole dumps the responsibility of a longliving largegrowing aquatic animal that rips up any decoration on someone else  your cousin apparently

probably the worst is my friends family     his sister got another kitten   first one got out and ran away later discovered she dumped it because it bit her   doesnt care about it new cat anymore as with every other pet she got and then immediately neglects   visit them   ohshe keeps the kitten in the garage  wtf   go in garage   smells like absolute shit   literally blackout dark and freezing because no windows in garage in winter   turn on light   little frail kitten immediately rubs all over my legs meowing  whyd you have the light off  oh i dunno  put food in empty bowl and kitten acts like it hasnt eaten in days     they literally just forgot it was in there while they fucked off and went about their lives i cant believe i contained my anger not only at his sister but at him for enabling it
  ive heard something similar but in this case they put several cats in a box and dropped them from a bridge onto the highway the guy thought it was funny suffice to say that im from a third world country
so my dad is a diagnosed psychopath  be me  all stories are when im 14 and younger and too scared to confront him    buried charlie my first girl cat up to her neck and ran her head over with a lean mower    locked my hunter dog in the shed with my cat   luckily cat climbed up to the roof and held on for dear life    wraps plastic bags around their heads and killed jace because of this    always putting cats in the dryer freezer etc    never forget the day my dog lincoln barked not even bit my young sister 3 for pulling his hair and poking his eyes  dad grabs poker for fire wood and swings down with both hands on it   hears it smash lincoln 3 time looked away after the first  can still hear his poor yelps    he also burned down our barn and lives with his dad now    ive been seriously contemplating killing him for a while he doesnt even try me anymore because i rage on him whenever he tries anything     i on the other hand have a pit bull yes i know most you hate them and a chiwawa poodle mix as well as two floofy chonk cats i love animals so much i just hate people especially danny i dont even wanna call him dad    pic is all the cats final revenge
  i dont think this is true a person willing to do this would be willing to kill the animal and why would they spend money on its food when they could just kill it
    kill your friend and his sister
  kill your friend and bang his sister  ftfy
  descendants of colonizers  lol jesus christ

sophomore year of high school  funny quirky kid in class whos pretty book smart and asks questions  fast forward close to december the kid goes quiet asks less questions hates being called on now  i still try to engage with him like before  not as responsive  school shooter in the makingpng  big test in history class hes not there  kid posts to his social media of catching a bird some pigeon with his hands by the river  plucks its feathers and decapitates it while screaming like a maniac about killing and blood  freaks out other students  campus security finds out and does not let him back on school grounds   hes gone mentalwebm   i never knew what happened to this dude the whole class figured he had some rough shit at home and took it out on the bird
  found the newfag
  i wish i had the balls to do the same as you    my aunt and her husband have two dogs a lab and a weimaraner   they live on a farm the dogs are kept in the inner yard all year round and they pretty much never go on walks with them  her husband as well as his fucking father who lives with them on the farm beat both dogs regularly  despite all that both dogs are really sweet    most of my family members dont care about the situation wich angers me even more    every time i see these cunts i think about beating the shit out of both of them
my sister in law is probably the worst dog owner ive ever met   yells at her brother my bf for taking the dog on walks  yells at brother for bathing the dog because it stinks its an old labmix  recently me and my bf have noticed that the dog is covered in dry blood so we asked her about it  yeah hes been like biting himself at that spot lately idk why lol   we tell her to get him to the vet to have it checked only to get im not gonna take him to the fucking vet you guys do it and pay for it if youre that worried  i feel bad for this dog because he doesnt get walks at all his toiletbreaks are just getting let out back
be 13  visit moms friend  expect it to be a shitty experience based off past experiences  friend lives on a shitty excuse for a horse farm   had two bratty kids now can only have one at a time due to some bullshit that was the moms fault with one kid getting a major head injury  currently the friend has her daughter with her  friend has a couple pets including one cat a couple dogs and the daughters hamster  we frequently see the cat until one day where shes gone   thefuckjpg  we come to find out the friends been locking the cat in her basement because her stupid ass daughter was afraid the cat would eat her hamster and wasnt feeding her for days on end  eventually me and my family took the cat away where she lives now  pic related her today she started as a malnourished bone thin thing and now shes a chubby fuzzball full of love
be me around 10 y/o playing inside my room  hear a screech outside  look through the window where the sound was coming from  see one neighbor kid and his parents and grandpa standing behind the kid and laughing  kid is crouching   while drowning a kitten  in a puddle of slurry from cow shit they own a farm  cry and run to my parents    another thing about these neighbors mainly the grandpa who is the main owner of the farm is that hes been caught multiple times trying to shot local cats/dogs with pneumatic gun strong enough to kill a pigeon with one shot  not to mention times theyve poisoned/hurt many of my outside pets even thought ive got a fence they werent safe their farm animals havent seen sunlight or tasted actual grass in definitely more than 6 years the worst thing that without any nonanecdotal evidence i can only hope for the best or just keep fish    the good thing about this whole situation is that the karma got at least to the grandpa guy slipped on a frozen puddle of slurry hit his head popped a vein or some brain tumor and died in less than a week after the accident
  her stupid ass daughter was afraid the cat would eat her hamster and wasnt feeding her for days on end  the cat would play with it to death she shouldnt have gotten a cat anyways cats are serial killer vermin
  maybe irresponsible owners shouldnt let their pets free roam
  wild hares do deserve to fucking die tho
  you should
  malice and lack of empathy for a creature that is clearly suffering are the same thing
  i just didnt want to imagine fellow tainos doing that stuff  get over yourself nigger
  y tho
  victim  victim of what exactly you retarded whiteknight was it her choice to associate with that person or not
  yells at her brother my bf for taking the dog on walks    wat ive heard of people being too lazy to walk their dog but why waste energy enforcing misery on the poor thing
  out of all the abuse and neglect stories here this feels the worst because that dog was denied a good life and a loving family for no fucking reason     im so sorry anon i hope whatever crackhead stole him and dumped him odd and choked on their own vomit
visit moms friend who lives in the countryside   has two large dogs who are tied all day and night with a chain and are never allowed to roam free  one has open wounds all over his face and ears full of flies burying in them the other one is in a grassless zone and completely covered in mud  notice something moving in a wood pile  theres like ten kittens all with eyes so covered in mucus they cant even open them  confront moms friend and her husband about it  meh you really should mind your own business  visit again after two weeks  notice there are only two kittens  moms friend casually says that the rest are all dead  these people are going to be my neighbours soon  i hope i can at least convince the husband to bring the infested dog to the vet he seems like a semidecent guy
get a call from my dad and step mother  theyre at a bird convention   they talk about wanting to get a bird for my little brother  they already have a macaw rescue that they took in   the macaw is of course untamed and they just have it in a medium size not too small but definitely not big enough  try my absolute hardest to make a bird seem as unappealing as possible loud poop seed husks everywhere etc  they get a green cheek conure anyways   things are actually pretty good for a time  step mom starts getting annoyed at seed husks mess  she just had my latest baby brother and was afraid of diseases or some dumb mexican myth shit   they put the conure outside in some small house thing with the macaw  they absolutely dont let the birds out of their cages their only socialization is with each other and all they do is scream at each other  their food bowls arent filled nearly enough nor is the water ever fucking cleaned   macaw literally cant take baths because there is no shower bowl   no fucking toys no fucking anything in their cages  every time i visist try my hardest to bring treats like millets clean their bowls etc  finally i take the green cheek away from them and have been slowly gaining his trust over the year  i still feel fucking awful every time i see the macaw when i visit it must be at least /somewhat/ content with its life because he hasnt plucked himself or anything i still try to bring him toys and treats too
  why did you get new animals was it him or your mothers idea
  got a happy ending for you all here posted about my brothers turtles awhile back sort of an update    have adult brother  is autistic has hoarding issues   idiot charity worker gets involved  thinks pets will do him good despite his flat basically being a landfill site  she drives him to pet shop to get rats  visit two weeks later  see the rats  drive those rats to an rspca shelter  brother has a meltdown  never fully recover his trust    one month later he has a turtle    things are fine for precisely six months  gets another turtle  bullied by the bigger turtle and never gets to eat  for some reason his autistic brain decides that the best way to provide them with a natural lifestyle is to buy a betta and put it in the tank for them to hunt   probably saw some shit on youtube  freak out on him  he stops answering my calls  dont know what happened to that poor fucking fish  eventually stops feeding them and cleaning turtles    by this time weve been fighting for nearly three years to get him in some sort of supported living because hes in real danger of killing himself via his own filth    crunch day    his useless fuck of a doctor was of the care in the community mindset and had been insisting he had full capacity hence why we couldnt just have him forcibly removed from his flat for all this time    old doc has been moved on for unrelated reasons  new doc comes to his flat with social workers  face immediately turns white  hes in a psychiatric ward the next day  turtle tank is still in there buried within all the filth  water looks like actual sewage  has condensed down in to a thin brown gravy  turtles are still somehow alive  long suffering social worker has friend who keeps turtles and other reptiles  friend agrees to take them  turtles now live a happy life  brother is in supported living and is getting better  rats got adopted immediately by a nice family and have a happy life      apart from the poor fucking fish all is well that ends well
  those type of doctors and their mindset are fucking cancer im a medfag and dealing with them is like bashing my head against the wall
  i work all throughout the caribbean and you people are some of the worst ive seen when it comes to the treatment of animals stop lying to yourself mate people were yelling at me just for giving these dogs some food
    go back to tumblr you fucking faggots
  ugh you poor bastard cant imagine what its like to have to try to work with these sorts of cotton minded time wasters people end up living in misery for years or dying because apparently thats better then taking someones freedom to make their own choices    yes well theyre unwell and the choices theyve been making arent good for them otherwise mental health wouldnt be involved
  whats wrong with feeding them live fish
night of the long claws when
  im not a turtle expert but im pretty sure dumping a random fish in with them isnt how you go about it they didnt seem interested in it and i think it just died from poor water quality and starvation in the end
be me visit friend who bought his own house at 18  lives with girlfriend and their two pit bulls  hes a good working guy not well educated  goes to work at 5am doesnt come back until 9pm sometimes  girlfriend does not let the dogs out when shes home alone  dogs are constantly locked in a room  shit on themselves piss on themselves constantly  now the story gets darker  never got the dogs spayed/neutered   of course rosie gets pregnant   weeks go by each time i see her she is more thin  when she gives birth she is skin and bone  holocaust victim level her teats sagging down make it worse  i have no idea how she survived so thin while feeding the puppies  he keeps one of the boy puppies for himself  sells the rest 300500 each  all friends are telling him to use that money to spay her  he insists that he is going to spay her  dont see him for maybe 6 months go over again  rosie is pregnant again this time from her son  same exact thing even worse  entire basement of their house dedicated to puppies  whole floor is not cleaned once  ammonia  shit smell at toxic levels  rosie is even more thin than before  you could see every individual rib organs  year and a half later rosie dies suddenly age 5  facebook posts of shock and sadness that she died  fin
  beyond that being horrible in itself it gets worse  because the second pregnancy was from her son / because of the malnutrition literally 2/3 of the puppies from the second litter that they sold died within 6 months imagine 6 people buying a puppy and it dies within 6 months all of the lives that were affected
  did the dog recognize you
  wow these are the guys women decide to reward with sex and live with instead of you probably had a nice jawbone or something
  do you eat meat
  cuck the troops anon its the only way  theyre overseas they cant fuck you up until theyre home and by then theyre crippled either by ptsd or literally
  im a young woman and my beard is fat and happy i just helped her get better after my cousins came over and decided to see how much she could eat needless to say he is no longer allowed to feed her i want to share a pic but i dont know how
  
friend and her brother get siberian husky puppy for free and want to keep it and maybe breed it because its rare despite living in socal where dog breeds in general are abundant  friend claims she will take care of puppy and take it to vet etc despite being the most irresponsible person i know  doubtpng  puppy shits and pisses all over their microhouse which somehow manages to be smaller than most apartments ive seen  friend refuses to take any of my advice despite the fact i used to puppy raise for guide dogs and own dogs  its been 45 months now and puppy is still not housebroken and is largely left in the hands of her mother house smells like death  said mother is usually gone from the house because she works multiple jobs puppy is tied to doorknob with standard sized leash to control its shitting radius  because friend only took the puppy to the vet one time puppy develops parvo after its 34 short walks in its whole lifetime  nearly dies from parvo  friend congratulates herself for saving puppys life when it developing parvo was easily preventable  no plans to neuter it because its rare and speshul and could be  for breeding  puppy jumps upon everyone no one does anything  puppy barks incessantly no one does anything  puppy jumps up on tables and eats food no one does anything  friend thinks shes a good owner because the puppy knows sit  overall pupper is getting majorly fucked over the larger and larger it gets    this person that has a complex where they refuse to follow advice if its from another person and following that they also refuse to give up with dog despite the fact it is completely out of control they also are one of those retards who will believe theyre a competent owner for the dumbest shit like   anon i put the dog in a harness not a collar most people dont know thats abuse to put a dog in a collar  when its like yeah its only because you keep it tied to a doorknob indoors all the time
  contd    i know harnesses are ideal for smaller dogs but in a siberian husky i dont think it matters so much when they have so much thick floof     i cant stand it that people seeing owning a shitstained dog because its a certain breed as some proof of responsibility or as a status symbol     also shes one of those poorfags who got a desk job and has a complex about how amazing her life is why do so many poor people not notice basic stuff like their dog crapping everywhere as a problem to be attended to
this is where the iguana lives they say he has a heating rock for when its cold but that seems to be it they let it roam the house too apparently but that cage is his terrarium why do people even fucking bother having pets they cant afford or care about properly i will never understand
  raises glass  hear hear
  bible thumpers are the self righteous dickholes by definition it doesnt just mean being dedicated to your religion
  i never heard this before care to explain
  christfag is common here because truth is treated as objective thats also how we do war crimes only 1 of us know about
  shake the macaw thats the last straw  take my bird from his home youre sleeping alone
  i told my brother in law to watch my pet love bird mr cheeky while i was on vacation he ended up getting bitten and threw mr cheeky killing him
  honestly at 15 its more her parents fault than hers
be me 20 years old  get diagnosed with youngonset parkinsons  dropped out of dentistry  contemplating suicide  meets a stray cat outside on the staircase of my dorm  we become friends i feed him everynight inside my room but he would never stay he would eat play for a while take a 30min nap then he would scratch the door lightly when he wanted to leave  i never took him home coz i was allergic to cats i could never keep him  leave for home  come back to visit him  couldnt find him  ask the custodian  he says that he mustve been the cat that got runover by a motorcycle outside the dorm  the cat was waiting for me to get back like he always did  i miss you buddy ill see you soon
  i love you anon youre a good person rip to the cat but have you thought of getting a dog also i dont smoke or do drugs but i heard/saw weed helps alleviate parkinsons syndrome shaking have you tried anything like that
i knew some guy who kept a tortoise in a tiny shoebox under his bed all that tortoise ever knew was the cold pitch black shoebox
  that bites anon life can be shakey sometimes
  well im going off on a limb and conclude that these types of people have no self reflection and see any impulses that indicate that theyre doing something wrongthe animals getting unhappy as a form of attack on them rather than them themselves being the cause how could they be they are god fearing christians right
  true america had that whole great awakening thing going on and the crazy only snowballed from there prosperity gospel nonsense and all
  i think he means hes not being neglectful out of any illwill to his animals hes just borderline retarded and cant be trusted to do much of anything right he probably doesnt realize what hes doing and that perhaps makes him more dangerous than a genuine abuser
go to relatives house for new years  two batty children with two shitty parents who think yelling and beating is all it takes to discipline a child and then letting them do whatever they want  they have a tiny cat still few months old  legit looks terrified  poor cat constantly thrown around pushed and pulled abused  for a while im chilling in a spot where the kids arent around with this kitten  it warms up to me when i approach it very gently though  it falls asleep finally in a moment of peace  brats come in again making a ruckus  constantly telling the fucking spawns of satan to stop they laugh in my face  at one point they throw one of those huge exercise balls right at the cat  lose it  fucking shout my lungs out at them  they start crying  family glares at me and looks down on me but whatever  if anything to this day still hate myself that i couldnt stand up for the poor kot and speak to those fucking parents    my pops goes over to take care of those kids sometimes and he makes sure to take care of that poor cat as well last i heard the cat is ok thankfully if anything hes a very clingy affectionate fella
  im a young woman and my beard is fat and happy
  not many 15 year olds fully grasped the concept of having choices but feel entrapped to endure any situation theyre put in theyre still experiencing many firsts and may not know how to handle such situations
  yeah speaking as a religious person the devils greatest helpers have been massive assholes claiming that they represent god    my sister is guilty of whim petting the difference being i was usually able to take up care of the animal myself and give them a few years for some of the trickier ones i always wonder if i did something wrong when they did die i have no idea how old that bearded dragon was when we got her we had her for three years before she died to our cats sadness as they were friends
  a bible thumper by default is a shitty person youre probably thinking of vanilla religious people    bible thumpers hardly ever donate or do any sort of charitable work and if they do its usually a shitty job and done just to get brownie points
  why is it always women who get these pets on a fucking whim
  as a man on the high functioning side of the spectrum i constantly fear fucking up and needing to be put into care i want to have a semblance of dignity in my life but if i had to i like to think id be able to swallow my pride and accept help i just hate being a burden
i was the retard    be me like 10 or something  go to local fair  one of the stalls has pet turtles as prizes  your standard shitty small cage with no filter decoration or anything other than water  win one because im an idiot kid that wants a pet turtle  buy those food pellets for the turtle  i dont realize the turtle needs more than just that to live because of fucking course  turtle dies in the winter because again retard here didnt buy a proper setup and the poor thing froze    i havent owned a pet since then i dont even know what i was thinking i barely even took care of my fucking neopets
  the fact that you have selfreflection on this means youre better then any of the horror stories here maybe try a simpler pet with a well known set up that you can work with also dont listen to pet shops they dont give a shit they just want you to buy the animal and animal accessories reguardless if they work together or not
  ive been thinking about it for a while the climate in my city is pretty extreme and my family is riddled with allergies myself included so those are my main concerns whenever i think about owning a pet
  i offer a few practice items digimon tamagochi neopets etc
  kek nice    ive been wondering if theyre gonna rerelease the digimon tamagochis
  its been 5 years since you fed your neopets
    for real tho in middle school my season two digivice and neopets filled an honest to god gap in my life
  i spent way too much time as a kid trying to train up my neopets and wasting np on food instead of just using the free omelettes
okay so i unironically downloaded the tamagotchi app because of this thread and because of general interest    i thought that when it went to sleep it would kind of stay since it takes long but i have already had to wake it up twice because it needed to shit and eat    its gonna be fun
when i was really young we had this kitten that i liked and played with but one day being a dumb kid i put it in one of those containers you put food and drinks in and somehow managed to forget it and went out all day with my parents only when we came back i remembered about the kitten and it was dead by then when i think about it makes me feel terrible
    10th grade drama class  teacher isnt there so we just start talking about whats going on in our lives  one of us is this spoiled bratty faggot who acts like hes tough  he starts talking about how he and his friends tried to kill the cat of his dads russian girlfriend with golf clubs  everyone is giving him a look of disgust/ shock while hes chuckling about it  literally seething on the inside fantasizing about knocking his teeth out  looking back i should of reported this fuck for signs of sociopathy    i fucking hate cucks who act like this  hehehehe i can beat a defenseless house pet so im badass as shit lol
  this is hands down the most rddit post ever made on this website congratulations and may you burn in hell
  retarded peers of mine  be me vet student  we have to sacrifice some animals for biopsy practice  as those tas are lazy shits we had to kill rats with our hands  you should push rats head to table and pull its body quite harsh  class proceeds to sacrifice after getting a rat  actually rats in labs are quite cute  some peers cannot do sacrifice right thanks to that  one of my peers didnt pull hard enough to kill the poor thing  he paniced as the rat twitches and seeks help with what do i do attitude  i intervened and ended the misery  that peer does not talk to me anymore  still cannot understand that retard  moral of the story rats r cute
                      this is 4channel now and your mysogynistic and homophoboc incel crap will no longer be tolerated here  go back to your containment board and do not return virgin losers
  not your finest bait /pol/
  you dont even need to smoke it its certain oils extracted from the plants it doesnt even get you high
  you are able to see that you made a mistake also you were 10 and probably assumed that because the guy sold them in those tiny cages with food pellets that that was what you were supposed to do  just be sure not to make that mistake again and im sure youd be a fine pet owner
  why did they make you do that i assume that they do those practices regularly enough to buy some sort of machine that kills rats maybe a box that fills itself with carbon monoxide or something
  as a species we are trash  you dont get to become the top species of your planet by being nice to other animals
  it takes time as you should get an approval  i told you it was teaching assistant  also you need fresh corpse to sample lymph node or liver
  oh is he vegan then
  sounds like your lab is a shithole why dont you have have some way to humanely euthanize    also fuck thats terrible why cant you source preeuthanized animals from vets and shelters theres fucking tons of them that just get incinerated every day trainee doctors dont have the luxury of mashing a convict over the head anymore
  i would eat that shit up parents wouldnt let me have one as a kid and now they go for insane prices on ebay     tried various knock off apps on my phone all underwhelming
  it is illegal to use those  also corpse should be 1hr after death  neck dislocation was used to be treated as one of the humane way to kill animals    using equipment for euthenesiaco2 infusing box is easy but using it at the right time is hard  i cannot blame tas lazyness that much as i know those procedures to use those equipments at the right time could be pain in the ass  i just blame muh panicking retard
  not all heroes wear capes
  illegal to use those    weird seems like a waste guessing it would be a legislative nightmare tho    must be less then one hour after death    probably a moron question but why if the body had been propperly stored then how would that be too much different    either way your story is still pretty fucked dont blame anyone for freaking out over being responsible for literally executing another live creature especially if theyre a student and just left to get on with it
  that fucked me up a bit
  i thought it was intentionally redditish as satire i hope im right
  lowqualitybaitjpg
     i used to have this best friend in high school that i did everything with he was really cool and we had a lot in common but the guy was downright crazy and not in the cutesy sense either like he would probably kill a person in a fistfight and not think twice about it      i visited his house all the time and his family who mind you were all equally fucking crazy as he was had a lot of animals like five dogs and eventually got two cats     whenever i went over and we were with his animals the guy had zero reservations about kicking or hitting the dogs for even the most minor lapses in behaviour like full on slaps and shit     there was even this one dog that he openly hated and picked on whenever he got the chance with the cats he would manhandle them and shake them while they were still young and in heat      i havent talked to him in years but the last i heard from him he became a drug dealer
  that isnt bait if you torture someone then stab them in the neck or pay for someone else to do it then you dont love them so saying he loves all animals is retarded maybe they meant to say loves some animals
  already told you that it have to be fresh if one wants to sample liver or lymph node  cells just melts and not usable for practicing
  professionally diagnosed autism  pretty sure thats not a license to threaten random people with rocks  if your retarded retard daddy really did shit like this he needs to be put away for the public safety
  shut up you fucking nigger you deserve to be shot enmass by cops
  yeah animal cruelty isnt a crime and totally isnt the mark of a sociopath /pol/intellect at work
cat comes home after 4 days with broken back spleen and bladder  parents wait 3 weeks to put her down
  i know people who use pst pst instead of nnt nnt
  da fuq
  a lot of vets have issues but there are many good ones out there same as cops we just tend to remember the bad ones more
  im really sensitive about my animals getting fat we give them lots of treats as in like chicken thigh from our plates but would stop if they ever gained weight
  my husbands exwife has had like 5 dogs die in the past decade a few they ran over others just ran away and another fell off the bathroom counter and broke its skull im beginning to think its intentional and shes a serial dog killer
  f
  cats are easy as shit to take care of if you ever wanted one most of them you can set up auto feeders for food and water so you barely have to do anything until they run low plus you scoop their shit once a day and thats it the rest is playing and enjoying them dogs are like having a toddler forever so i wouldnt recommend that for you    oh and i never took care of my neopets why would i feed something thats not real and never actually dies
  thing is i have to look for things that dont have fur because im allergic to cats and most furry pets and moms pretty much deadly allergic to them too its a shame too since we all really love animals    maybe once i get my own apartment ill look into getting shots because i do really love those little fellows dogs too i dont mind them because im good with kids but yeah theyre pretty high maintenance    i feel like virtual pets are all good exercises however most virtual pet sites put emphasis on focusing on other things that are not related to taking care of your pet especially neopets    i mean yes you feed them and all but the reason most people never bother is because theres no penalty for not caring for them if they turned into the ghost color everytime you let them starve i assure you most people would put in at least the effort of feeding them
  if its just the hair i have a hairless cat thats awesome they are like 800 to 1800 but totally worth it
  your ex is absolutely based to be completely honest
how nutritious is wood and why do so few animals eat it
  because they cant digest it
  some can and with it being literally fucking everywhere its a wonder why more cant
ever heard of a beaver hombre
  you just answered your own question dummy
  why do so few animals eat it  because youre literally blind to the thousands of species of animals that eat it    because theyre not cute and furry    its a common problem here people are unaware of 999 of animal species and this board doesnt do anything to help with that
its really hard on the teeth
  ask your mom shes been eating my wood for years now that filthy animal
  hurr
  wood and other plant material is very nutritious the issue is that so few organisms are capable of breaking down the cellulose thats containing all that nutrition even those animals that can extract some need to feed on large quantities because even they cant break it down very efficiently    on the other hand some organisms have evolved the ability to effeciently break down cellulose these are the saprobic organisms that keep dead plant material from pulling up theyre almost entirely microbes a bunch of different bacteria and fungi    theres hardly a resource available that life hasnt taken advantage of it all just comes down to evolution some evolved to access certain resources even the most difficult ones
why can so few animals eat wood is a flawed question to begin with as evolution consists of random mistakes if they are beneficial or neutral they might stay theres no deity that thinks hmm theres all this wood out there i should totally evolve to digest it it just happens if it happens like it did in some beetles fungi etc
  not very  because its not very nutritious
  beavers dont actually eat wood anon they eat leaves and the underbark
  this big brain post anon
  the underbark  isnt that were the dark dogs live
  hardly nutritious very difficult to digestand most of them are arthropods anyway so thats why there are thousands like  points out but considering there are like millions of insects species alone that proportion of wood eating species becomes almost insignificant  to illustrate my point one of the reaons carboniferous trees were normally fossilized and eventually turned into coal was that there wasnt that many lifeforms adapted to degrade ligninenot even microorganism iirc
  if theres some massive source of nutrients somewhere you bet your butt that animals will evolve to eat it
  based
  it yields very little nutrition so animals that eat it wouyld need to eat tons of it compared to their body weight just to stay alive  thats why the animals that eat it tend to be small insects like termites and wood beetles    think pandas bamboo has little nutrition so pandas need to eat like 30 pounds of it a day wood has even less nutrition than bamboo and its harder to chew and digest so the sheer amount of wood any large bodied animal would need to eat to survive wouldnt be worth the effort
  its a common problem here people are unaware of 999 of animal species and this board doesnt do anything to help with that  you just did  conrgatulations you found out how a community works
  this makes a lot of sense why would organisms evolve to have to bring down trees to eat them when those organisms could evolve to eat the dead trees that are already down and have lost all their faculties of resistance
  think pandas bamboo has little nutrition so pandas need to eat like 30 pounds of it a day wood has even less nutrition than bamboo and its harder to chew and digest so the sheer amount of wood any large bodied animal would need to eat to survive wouldnt be worth the effort  bad example pandas are really bad at digesting bamboo
other than crested geckos what are some small lizards that dont require live feeders
  rhacodactylus leachianus  pretty much a giant crested gecko  uromastyx  eats veggies and some fruit

why do budgies have big cheeks
  for punching    thats what you were looking for right you can /thread me now thanks
  /thread
    i meant it in a serious way but whatever
feathers
the blue part of their cheeks reflects ultraviolet light which they find sexually attractive
  so they pretty much have boobs on their face
  boobs  if youre a pleb like that
  punch him harder those pin feathers wont fall out by themselves and are proof youre not punching hard enough
  how about this
  a vulgar display of power
  yaaaaaaaaas
    
  the better to beep you with
  more surface area to snuggle your nose and lips against
  what a devastating blow
  boobs are patrician only a nigger likes ass more that tits
  do not inhale car exhaust
  t homo
  hes into asses  calls others homo for literally not being into asses
  because it makes them cuter
how are budgies as a pet
  very good i am very pleased with my pet budgies after they got used to me they are friendly and cheerful little guys one likes to sit on my finger while i play video games
  ive noticed that theyre really cheap to buy is it because they dont live long
  they can live up to ten years
  they are viewed as disposable pets they are not and are very rewarding try to rescue one or get one from a breeder for a healthier pet you dont have to but it is good to not support pet stores
  to poke
  one of mine is 10 and still very healthy and active another one is 9 and has arthritis but well hes half english so maybe its because hes bigger  the others are 5 and 2 still very active the 5 year old has a fat tumor but doesnt seem to bother him too much
they were bred that way they dont look as chubby in the wild
  if they do you are not treating them as they deserve
  why was i humming guiles theme before it started
  can someone show me the original punching budgies thread
  because guiles theme goes with punching budgies
anyone got a download for her videos      funsizedasian
what kind of animals does she keep
as my cat i hate you all
  why
  i had an asshole cat who looked just like that when i was a kid lol he only really liked my dad since he was the one who found him outside in the snow as an abandoned kitten before i was born sometimes he would let me pet him but most of the time he would only let you approach if you showed him you had his brush in your hand lol then he died and we got a new cat who is sweet af and lets me do shit like pic related but shes pretty old now and probably doesnt have more than a few years left max
  anonymous 11/30/18fri012113 no2882144  cats often die of kidney failure make sure to keep her hydrated sorry about the blog post but i always make sure my cats have a bowl of fresh lactose free milk cats dont digest lactose very well and feeding them regular milk can dehydrate them
  the toxo in them
would you still love your pet if all the sudden it changed species for example your dog turning into a cat would you still love it
yeah who cares
  i would love it but i would have to give it up i cant fit a dog into my schedule
  im so important and so busy i cant put aside an hour a day  maybe youre just lazy
  if it was literally just taking your pet and giving it a body swap yes
  thinks dogs only need an hour of care a day    typical dog owner
filename   what
depends if it will be still a bird  probably if not  id not get rid of it but i would not enjoy as much since i like bird behaviour and changing body would defiantly change it
  if my female cat suddenly turned into homo sapiens sapiens i would love it real goood if you know what i mean
  yes but i would prefer my cat not to turn into a newfoundland or ill have a space problem
  only if it turned into a pitbull
better question what would you do if your pet became 84 solar masses
whats a good all natural canned cat food brand for my cat is purina really all natural whenever i see something mainstream i assume its all lies and clever wording and not actually healthy
  kittens love eating this 
  i dont know
  natural is used as a stupid buzzword of course everything and anything is natural  you probably want to instead look at all meat canned food and less processed food and look up what additives to avoid
  memes aside purina/fancy feast/iams/friskys is all shit go with merrick taste of the wild tiki cat soulistic or whole hearted etc stay away from anything with excessive ingredientsscience diet or with fillers/malnutritious brandsthe first 3 i mentioned
  dont take food advice from the hacks on /an/    theyve been pushing grain free foods for years and now we find out those foods are linked to heart disease and heavy metals poisoning    the idiots here just follow whatever hipster trend is currently killing your pet cats need filler in their food even a natural diet is mostly just filler
  just buy cheap meat and feed it to your cat you retard include organ meats thats where carnivores get most of their vitamins
how can i stop my yorkie from being such an asshole bros he does the worst shit hell  wake me up at night barking at nothing   bark at me and my girl when were sitting on the couch  bark literally the whole time when were in the car literally the whole time even if its a three hour drive  steal my socks and hide them  jump on guests when the get in  pick up garbage and forces me to chase him around to get it  i hate this glorified rat so much
grab by rear legs  lift up with a swinging motion    fucking slam it into nearest wall
  i sometimes fantasize about this the dog belongs to my girlfriend though and the dog is from her childhood so it would fuck her up
  i was going to suggest maybe taking some training classes to learn how to make the dog listen to you but looking at those eyes staring in different directions and assuming that tongue is permanently stuck out i dont have high hopes
ahh yorkies absolute shit tier dog
  you need to assert dominance dab on that motherfucker
  thats actually a leaf hes trying to get me to chase him around
  it might just be bored and want to play  have you tried feeder toys a stuffed/frozen kong might help
  thanks for the recommendation ill try that we also walk him at least three times a day
  we also walk him at least three times a day    try playing at the dog park/big yard for a change these small dogs are quite agile and athletic oftentimes spend quaity time with the dog once its tired training is much more effective
  theres hope then   one of the easier ways to teach a dog to shut up is to teach it to bark on command once he knows that its easier to teach him to be quiet on command  another thing to google is teaching drop it or how to trade for something better i like using a flirt pole because a small dog cant just speed off with the lure but theres enough length that youre not just playing tug either its also good for burning off energy if hes the type that likes to chase
  stage an accident or say it got loose and ran away
  go to a dog park sooner or later a big dog will have enough of his bullshit and maul him
you need to actually train it and give it enough exercise and mental stimulation      thats why any decent dog park will be segregated into small dog and large dog sections
  the first step of training dogs is exercise i can tell by those fucking sausage fingers of your that you need some too take the dog for a jog until it cant stand this should fix most problems by itself but if not you d the training when you are done with the run and its tired
  good old meatball with razor blades trick will solve your issues
i live in a mobile home and its in the surrounded by grass so i have a mouse problem for reasons i dont want to explain i cant be botherd to find however many entry points there are and seal them im also to fucking broke for an exterminator what are the chances they will fuck off after winter ends dont they ever jump on peoples beds when they sleep
  for reasons i dont want to explain  youre lazy and stupid we get it  what are the chances they will fuck off after winter ends   none once they establish that a place is a good source of food/shelter they will never leave
  i work six days a week and for the past three months ive not had my car or a single dollar to spend for myself on anything other than bills
  i will admit to being stupid though i forgot to say  not lazy just a complete brainlet with money problems since his fiance left three month ago
work six days a week  live in the cheapest housing known to modern man  no money for anything other than bills  id ask how the fuck that works but i dont really care starting to understand why your fiance left you thiugh
  get a cat maybe a friend would let you borrow theirs for a week or two
i have lost all hope why do people go this far

jesus christ get a hold on your breedbigotry /an/ stop oppressing pitbull owners  
ththeyre not dangerous  has to keep them muzzled
  things not to say to dangerous dog owners   and what are they gonna do if i do say it sic their dog on me
  things not to say to dangerous dog owners and their dogs  is that a threat
does it bite  wtf this is the first question you should ask before interacting with anybodys dog
also i think its funny that these people have 0 control of the dogs or their training in the video even when they give commands the dogs blatantly ignore them these people should not be owning a highenergy breed anyway
  are all british people this disgusting looking
bbc  reminder that pitbulls are actually illegal in the uk  you need a court order to get one and if you dont have that the police euthanise the shitbull
if they wherent dangerous they wouldnt need those heavy leashes for them
  oi m8 do u have a loicense for that pooch of peace  to be expected bongland is cucked to the core anyway
  why dont you put that dog on a lead   how is this an inappropriate question if youre out in public
  banning pugs is wrong    because it hurts their feels
  wtf i love the uk now
why do pitbulls get all of the hate pretty much all terriers are just as bad
  because they are the niggers of the dog word look up how many people they kill compared to all the other breeds
  pitbull lovers always argue that theyre not naturally violent and it depends on the owner    i must disagree with this sentiment just like some dogs are smarter some dogs like to talk some dogs are faster some dogs are stronger the sole purpose for the pitbull breed is dogfighting only the stronger and most ferocious ones were the ones people breed to make angrier and stronger dogs    sure you can train a pitbull to be well behaved but it will naturally be more aggressive than any other race and the stats clearly show  now im not saying we should kill all the pitbulls but they should atleast be spayed unless the owner is a certified dog trainer or something
rather than killing them why not just stop breeding them why are pit lovers not okay with that unless they want to keep on buying pitbull
  this is british m8 you americans may not have a polite bone in your body but brits live and die by lack of offense    you dont ask does it bite you ask is he friendly    ive owned two bull terriers and cared for a halfdozen rescues as a foster theyre sweet sweet animals most of the time but the prey drive is real and theyre 100 muscle i have had to wrestle one to the ground to prevent it from killing a cat it had known and been fine with for years because it moved the wrong way and triggered his prey drive    considering how much stronger pits are i would never ever be brave enough to own one and have it around people or animals that i love
  dont confuse aggression and prey drive aggression implies a constant and stable pattern of aggressive behavior at all times  most bully breeds ive ever known have been quite loving and sweet  95 of the time    if that prey drive is triggered and their kill instinct kicks in theres not much you can do but try to hold them back with a leash because their minds are gone in that moment and thats what makes them dangerous the sweetest bully in the world playing with its most favoritest person in the world is one mental trigger away from gnawing their face off in a frenzy
  im a herder breeds guy myself but the fighting dos ive seen so far irl were some of the most affectionate and loveable dogs ive come across      my as frequently runs against and wrestles pits/amstaffs and wins
  my as frequently runs against and wrestles pits/amstaffs and wins  thats nice  i genuinely hope none of the pits every get their prey drive triggered around her i wouldnt be willing to have my own animal play with a bully but only out of an abundance of caution ive known too many people who dont understand prey drive and tell me they just snapped    i also dont trust owners  one foster straight up lied to us about his experience with dogs and what he was going to do to foster the dog and wound up degloved hours later
  an aggressive or simply crazy terrier is unlikely to kill you but a pitbull might
  same reason why other small dog breeds and cats get a pass even though a lot of them are pretty fucking shitty even at their shittiest theyre simply an annoyance     this guys got it
    yeah im not a fan of yippy asshole terriers but im far less inclined to be worried about maulings when i could reasonably explode the things internal organs with a kick
  um pitbulls are terriers dumbass that is one of the problems terriers are super motivated to get what they want and what they really want is the kill kill killlllllllllllll that is pretty much the case across all terriers the problem with pits is they are lot larger and stronger than most other terriers
  terriers generally dont have massive jaws
  because other terriers are just assholes they are hard to train high energy strong prey drive for smaller animals etc they arent however human aggressive and arent known to just snap
  i dont see anything wrong with this
  thats how they get you
hey guys did you heard about what happened in the oklahoma school recently    jeez golly
  word so were basing our opinions of them off their character not the breed aaaand nothing changes
  if everyone was that honest we wouldnt have this problem
  it is not in the uk it is very valid  if you own a banned breed such as pitbulls you must go to court to get permission to keep it if you succeed you must follow these guidelines     your dog must be   neutered  microchipped  kept on a lead and muzzled at all times when in public  kept in a secure place so it cant escape  take out insurance against your dog injuring other people  controlled by someone aged over 16  show the certificate of exemption when asked by a police officer or council dog warden either at the time or within 5 days  let the ied know if you change address or your dog dies    it seems like a lot of hassle to own a dog of peace id imagine breaking that law would cause your dog be taken and destroyed    in ireland we have something similar but not as extreme we have a dangerous breed list  american pit bull terrier  english bull terrier  staffordshire bull terrier  bull mastiff  dobermann pinscher  german shepherd alsatian  rhodesian ridgeback  rottweiler  japanese akita  japanese tosa  bandog  the rules in ireland are  be kept on a short strong lead by a person over 16 years who is capable of controlling them  be muzzled whenever they are in a public place  wear a collar bearing the name and address of their owner at all times  plus all dogs must be licensed and dogs born after a certain year must be micro chipped
  yes breaking the law leads to euthanisation    afaik how a pitbull is determined isnt even specifically on breed alone though pbts tosas dogo argentinos etc are specifically bnnd but also based on certain characteristics    when first viewing the dog it should appear square from the side and its height to the top of  its shoulders should be the same distance as from the front of its shoulder to the rear point of  its hip   its height to weight ratio should be in proportion   its coat should be short and bristled single coated   its head should appear to be wedge shaped when viewed from the side and top but rounded  when viewed from the front the head should be around 2/3 width of shoulders and 25 per  cent wider at cheeks than at the base of the skull this is due to the cheek muscles   the distance from the back of the head to between the eyes should be about equal to the  distance from between the eyes to the tip of its nose   the dog should have a good depth from the top of head to bottom of jaw and a straight  boxlike muzzle   its eyes should be small and deepset triangular when viewed from the side and elliptical  from front   its shoulders should be wider than the rib cage at the eighth rib   its elbows should be flat with its front legs running parallel to the spine   its forelegs should be heavy and solid and nearly twice the thickness of the hind legs just below  the hock   the rib cage should be deep and spring straight out from the spine it should be elliptical in  cross section tapering at the bottom and not barrel chested   it should have a tail that hangs down like an old fashioned pump handle to around the hock   it should have a broad hip that allows good attachment of muscles in the hindquarters and  hind legs   its knee joint should be in the upper third of the dogs rear leg and the bones below that  should appear light fine and springy    so yeah the question is entirely valid
    that said unfortunately a lot of dog shelters at least local to me still have apbts/apbt crosses for adoption even though they legally speaking should probably be put down    so i wouldnt be surprised if a fair amount of people get a pitbull by error
    i am not against dangerous breeds but i agree there should be strict regulations on them and be only allowed to owned competent owners and required to undergo obedience classes     i own a gsd and in ireland they are on the dangerous breed list and i follow the rules but i would consider myself a competent dog owner  i trained him and socialized him well he would my first dog that i own by myself and not the family pet   he is the first dog in my life that likes the postman if you come to my house at 9 am you will see a large black gsd puppy with his fore legs on the gate getting pats from my postman
  kek i like that they did this instead of outright banning them because this way we can still laugh at pitmommies who went through all of that just to have their special snowflake breed of peace
  you can get dangerous breeds here just by court order instead of usastyle get whatever    the list is surprisingly generous akitas huskies gsds rottweilers even staffies are all dogs youre fully allowed to own and it seems to work out mostly fine    though every now and then theres still a pitbull mauling because even if rare the fucks cant resist mauling people    course you still get documentaries and all that every now and then going wont someone think of the poor pitbulls    i find it funny actually how they always defend pitbulls never dogo argie or tosas
  why in the fuck would any white person own a pitbull
  yes
why are 2 of them muzzled
  they have to be muzzled under uk law  in the uk pitbulls dogo argentinos and some others are illegal to own without a court order and must be muzzled etc in public
  was your nitpicking supposed to be a defense of shit bulls because what you said here is a great argument for why they should bloody well be exterminated    the sweetest bully in the world playing with its most favoritest person in the world is one mental trigger away from gnawing their face off in a frenzy
  i find it funny actually how they always defend pitbulls never dogo argie or tosas  there is no vitue signaling credit for those
  its about not putting the dog in a situation whereby it could be dangerous  how about you get a dog breed thats less capable of ripping someones guts out
  seeing as you are a pedo it seems i hope they do
  t sadist
  dude what
  was your nitpicking supposed to be a defense of shit bulls  no you fucking retard
  you americans may not have a polite bone in your body but brits live and die by lack of offense    you say right after being rude as shit    sorry not everyone like being some sy chugging yuroshite numale who beats around the bush
why do pitbulls get so much propaganda and push made for them anyway theres so many other dog breeds of a similar size or bigger to own
  pitmommies are mentally ill
  some drug dealer will take it
  because of a few reasons  first theyre bred to fight and will do so unless properly trained which nobody really does no matter how much they pretend making them shit outside is proper training  secondly many pitts are acquired privately and dont get neutered which makes any dog more aggressive  thirdly theyre mostly gotten by women who are often incapable of showing themselves dominant to the dog and black people who encourage the dog to be aggressive
  speaking of anecdotal evidence i used to work at animal clinics and boarding facilities and nearly every single pitbull i met was super sweet and actually not aggressive but even i support the overwhelming evidence against the breed   im always weary of meeting a new one and i feel ive been lucky in my life not to meet a loose cannon yet hell my most memorable ones were owned by one of those big black ladies and one pit bull was so cucked that it refused to eat unless you hand fed it lol
pitbulls can be great dogs if you actually know what the hell youre doing but too many people who have no damned idea what theyre doing seem attracted to the breed    theres also the fact that pitbulls are still the most common breed used in dog fighting meaning that people still breed them for aggression doesnt help that incompetent owners seem drawn to the breed for some reason    my thoughts exactly retardation and attempting to train a breed that can be somewhat difficult to train is a disaster waiting to happen
genuinely remove this filth from the earth if my poor baby got mauled by one of these leashed niggers i would go on a fucking crusade
  many dog owners are hypersensitive and overprotective about anything bad happening to their pets and will lash out at so much as criticism of their pets valuing their dog above most people theres more criticism of pit bulls than other breeds so pit bull owners lash out and more often than owners of other breeds furthermore breed specific laws make them feel like people will be mean to them for having something thats on the bad list since stereotypically more pit bull owners are black and dog fighting is a part of ghetto culture since restrictions on pitbulls is perceived as acting against their owners because thats how the laws are enforced obviously breed specific legislation is racist because it disproportionately affects ghetto trash     between this and huffington paints pitbull week that happens for god knows why and the general culture of entitlement to things like respect theres enough dog owners terrified of people not liking them and people who just want to virtue signal to throw 65 million dollars or so a year at pro pitbull lobbying groups
  
  too bad theyre still the dog breed that turns on their owners with the most severe results even if the person attacked was experienced with pits or training dogs  no one ever hears about the 2030 standard poodles per year who maul their owners
i was bit on the leg by a jack russel terrier it bit through my jeans and pierced the skin and drew blood  they are extremely aggressive dominating and vicious dogs  why isnt anything done about them
  jack russell terriers have topped the list of dogs most likely to attack humans  merseyside police found more reports of canine attacks on humans involving jack russells than any other breed in 2015  the terriers were found to be more aggressive than other breeds of dogs that are perceived to be aggressive like pit bulls or bull terriers    last year jack russells were responsible for six of 71 dog attacks in liverpool nearly double the number of attacks in 2014        these dogs are a dangerous menace /an/ when is something going to be done about it
  because nipping your ankle or leg is the worst they can do and defending yourself is just a matter of a swift kick pitbulls are much larger and stronger terriers who can take a huge chunk out of your neck like that one lady who died and was basically nearly decapitated after an attack
  it  drew  blood
  i se palarell to rapefugee  not all of them rape just like not all pits maul
  council dog warden
  large dogs are dangerous unless theyve been properly trained or breed to be borderline retarded pitbulls and breeds like are descended from mastiffs which were used for war and to hunt large predators bears lions etc theyre not family dogs theyre dogs can and will fuck somebody up unless specifically told not to    imho pet licenses should require that people train their dog if they cant then too bad the dog should be taken away for adoption if possible or destroyed
  a lot of large dog breeds are not dangerous or borderline retards sure any dog can be trained or abused into being dangerous but plenty of breeds large or smallare naturally good natured such as poodles retrievers various herding dogs etc
  i liked this breed of canine until i viewed the image that you posted
  how the fuck do people find pitbulls cute are these same mentally ill people who find tigers or bears cute
  so does your cunt every month in fact yet unfortunately you dont seem to die
  yeah we should stop animal bigotry all species are equal
  this my retarded friend has a fat cunt wife who i fucked but thats another story who is an absolute pit bull fag and fosters them all the time i think shes had 3 together at a time plus her two dogs well she has one dead pomeranian and two dead cats but still loves pit bulls i remember her telling me the story saying how this is a weird occurance and pit bull stereotypes are offensive and yet two out of the 4 pits shes kept have killed 3 of her non/foster pets like holy shit wake the fuck up you psycho i would never let my pets near a fucking pitbull
  because they are incapable of killing people
    all anime posters are pedos ya simp
  kek holy shit are you sure you arent a pit bull anon because that was straight vicious
  and you just sat there and took it pussy ass bitch just give him a quick jab to the face well see how keen he is on attacking you again
  be vet tech  dread every time a pit bull comes in becausesurprise its an overly active and aggressive dog who sure as fuck doesnt want us touching it  the vets are always going on about how the breed is fine and its how you raise them  while they sure as fuck put that muzzle on sand have three techs hold them down because again surprise its freaking the fuck out and trying to mail us because we dare touch its feet or just be near it  this isnt even going into all the retards here who adopt the abandoned ones from owners who realized how insane the breed is and how fucking broken and nuts these dogs are
how dependent would lions leopards and hyenas become on being fed by humans if some asshole just dumped a hill of meat on an african savannah everyday would they still have any interest in hunting would their offspring even learn
dependent doesnt especially mean they cant hunt it means you end up with way more than the natural population would be because of the huge food source
did someone say food
  ok but why hunt when free food
  because most animals will kill shit anyway its like how dogs/cats will kill stuff even if they have a bowl of food somewhere
  ywn feed that smile
  instinct  also plenty animals prefer live prey compared to carcasses
    so every and all predatory animals would in the area would still hunt and kill despite having a fresh supply of food dumped in the same spot for years predators have such a hard time making a kill as is
  he doesnt know about feeding the hyenas of harar
  probably would kill shit less but yes  would you feel comfortable going near a lion or huge crocodile if it had a huge pile of meat nearby
  probably would kill shit less but yes  why do i doubt this   i honestly wouldnt feel comfortable going near a lion or crocodile in any situation but   
  predatory instincts not even memeing our local aquarium had a sand tiger shark which was fed every single day and still some days ago it just killed another fucking fish the worst part is that the previous week its behaviour according to a worker there was too playful
  yeah but were not talking about sharks homie
  if sharks and even elephants who arent even carnivorous can have this destructive urge to rip and tear why couldnt other predators
  ripping and tearing apart a tree is playful behavior compared to ripping and tearing apart a large wild animal that is very much alive and has flight or fight instincts the former is actual work and can even take coordinated effort to execute   i cant tell if youre triggered by the idea of lions taking a handout instead of risking their lives for a meal or if you actually think theyre awesomebro killing machines that couldnt possibly ever fail at hunting when they statistically do all the time
  the latter is actual work   oobs second time this has happened to me tonight
  why do i doubt this   youre free to it just shows you dont know anything about animal behavior      its entertaining have you really never seen a dog or cat kill/chase something just because they felt like it     a lion pride might not go hunt huge male buffalos every day if theres a constant pile of meat there but they arent going to just forget how to hunt maybe if you did this for thousands of years and killed off the aggressive ones
  maybe if you did this for thousands of years and killed off the aggressive ones  it didnt take us thousands of years to domesticate rats it didnt even take us hundreds of years to domesticate foxes
  also yeah im well aware dogs and cats like to kill easy prey that get into their suburban yard but domestic animals are literally retard brainlets
  ripping and tearing apart a tree is playful behavior compared to ripping and tearing apart a large wild animal that is very much alive and has flight or fight instincts  anon elephants do that as well thats why i used them as example besides their intelligence
  male elephants dont just rip and tear apart other animals for fun theyre either incels or in musth or both
  because animals are not niggers and actually better than them
  both domestic rats and foxes will kill the shit out of something they think is prey
  if only we could implement the instinct to work into niggers
  what i feel about it is no evidence one way or the other my sister is scared of dragonflies that doesnt mean theyre going to hurt her
would they still have an interest in hunting    the large family of moles completely massacred by my well fed cat would say yes
  ok but were not really talking about domestic animals
  lions arent retarded murderbeasts like house cats though ive seen birds and rabbits within paw distance of a lion at the zoo lions really dont give a fuck maybe a really young lion would think chasing is fun
would an african american get a job when hes on welfare
lets talk about lemurs
why didnt other primates ever invade madagascar did they fear the lemurid warrior
i like them not sure why though
  how did they get to the island in the first place
  carried by two swallows with a strand of creeper held under the dorsal guiding feathers
only sort of primates i like because they dont look monkey like
  lemurs look 95 like monkeys except for their muzzles though
  except for their muzzles though  thats the important part
  came here to post this im also cool with galagos and lorises though
mouse lemurs permanently look like that crying cat meme
    yeah pretty sure thats exactly whay he meant    i agree too makes them look like some kind of apecanid scale most lemurs up and youve basically get a more agile werewolf with a sweet tail and interesting coloration
  theyre apparently aggressive little bastards that conservationists have trouble working with
i wish we still had lemur gorillas around
  beaver looking fuck

i remember watching zaboomafoo alot when i was little got me into animals
  am i the only fag that was born liking animals steve irwin nor zaboomafoo got me into liking animals i already liked animals
  i liked animals as a kid but i didnt know what lemurs were until i saw zoboomafoo
  
mammals were a mistake and shouldve never evolved
mfw scalies   
snake poop stinks
  agreed  
  lets just say placentalia were a mistake
reptiles were a mistake too birds are much more based and selfheating
  florida man  of course he is shirtless and fat emptying an entire magazine in a python
  lmao based croc
  those comments  whats up with youtube retards having a boner for animal torture
  florida man is the hero we dont deserve
  cant be surprised youtube commenters are the most retarded userbase on the internet
  this
birds  not evil  fish  not dumb  reptiles  not dumb as fuck and also evil  insects  not mindless brutal death machines    face it mammals are the protagonists of earths life
be dominant species  decide to take a bit of time off learning to fly  mammals sneak up and become dominant species  just
  you forgot  mammals  not disgusting   they dont called them the glanded species for nothing no reptile will ever be as gross as any mammal disgusting cretins
  t dinosaur
  true we fucking suck  neocarboniferous when
  they like to see animals get killed so they can make a point about their beliefs or a quip or something and feel superior to you very briefly  omg westerners get mad when i torture this dog but eat cow haha im glad this happened so i could make a point about it i am so intelligent
  shit on cock every time cloaca suckin tard
    burmese pythons are invasive species though
  yeah youd definitely never see jokes like that on a wholesome site like 4channel
  i remember someone cut up a baby lizard jacked off onto it and posted it here a day or two ago
    posting my /an/ related florida mans
  if mammals never took over wed probably have birds and reptiles evolve into neo dinosaurs to take up the ecological niches that mammals took over today
  stay mad cuck thats what you get for leading adam and eve to sin

  oh dude thats a het leprosy nightsky cyclops nightmare mythical terror those are super rare puts it into garbage bin
    anyone have a link to that video
    kek
  
  dude you know how ball pythons are really popular because they are small come in cool patterns and colors and have an even temperment  yeah why  lets make 30ft snakes that live for a super long time and are known for being bitey that popular too  i never understood the push to make retics popular didnt they learn how fucked up it is with the burmese pythons
haha imagine the taste and nutrients that grasshopper has
  burmese made sense because they were similar to ball pythons but double the size they along with boas are what i believe to be the largest snake a normal pet owner should have i truly dont get the huge push for rect other than to build up the breeder pool due to import restrictions
  completely normal picture of an animal  cursed
  look at the hand
  haha wow thanks for the png friend
  the fuck is even going on in this image
  burms are okay but retics are too big  are you retarded the size difference between the average burm and retic is almost nonexistent burms arent even inherently calmer
  hey we get those grasshoppers sometimes in florida
  imagine the smell
  do you believe in gravity
  dunno if it is the same species but found this at a state park      im pretty sure they autohaemorrhage when they get stressed out and it smells really awful
  the tortoise is not deterred
  scavengers boy

  python is clearly equal to size if not slightly larger than the cobra  cobra thought it could manhandle an animal built to kill using pure muscle power  kills the python but not before the python takes its ass on a one way trip to snap city  cobra was a fucking dumbass

  if they were to hed just be basting her cloaca
  its someones left hand whats the big deal
  btw how birds do fuck
aaaaaaanon why dont you take me out for walks anymore
  this reminds me of something ive never understood about animals  how can they just eat one another whole    when i imagine something like a bullfrog gulping down a rodent i cant see it working out its not like the prey would instantly die  wouldnt it bite and scratch the inside of the predator like all hell    ive had unpleasant experiences with only moderately hostile tortilla chips how can something with claws or teeth go down so easily
  you underestimate how strong these guys are for their size if youre a mouse inside a bullfrogs mouth youre just getting squished together and suffocate quickly from the panic
  so she killed her last two cellmates and now he has to be her bitch
  i imagine they would be squished yeah like the lizard in the picture i replied to what im surprised by is that they dont seem to be injured by even spasmodic scratching i would have thought that even occasional lacerations would be significant sources of infection or put the predator in a continual state of pain such that it might not hunt effectively
  i think theres something wrong with your dog
  whichever animals do this kind of shit are robust enough to take it  humans dont do it and thats why humans arent robust enough to take it    its all evolution baby
  ywn eat a small animal whole feeling it squirm going down your throat feeling its death throws in your stomach  why even live
  you could just swallow a goldfish
  those tony hawk video games were fun
anyone got the video of the horse screwing the donkey and they both jizz    haha

  this reminds me of that weird claymation movie where its the distant future and humans evolve into subterranean fucked up animals and robots are left to rule

hi /an/ is this board great place for finding name of plants and maybe from where they originally came from my son bought some plants from internet and i would like to tell what exactly they are but he doesnt want to tell me i would just upload pictures but all i see there are mostly animal threads so are there any people experienced with growing exotic plans
  thats stevia your son is into natural sweeteners you should be proud of him
  looks like weed
  thanks thats exactly the plant from what i searched it is supposed to be healthier alternative to sugar right i dont really know why he have that plant because he dont ever drink tea propably has something to do with the school project he told me about have a nice day
  no it doesnt but thats pretty much what i was most worried about because i found weed and some seeds in his room that he planned to sell so obviously i was worried if he didnt found an alternative even tho this doesnt look anyhow like weed one can never be 100 sure
how do middle aged moms even find this site
hey so instead of 5 new shitbull threads a day why not just one shitbull general     we get all the buy the pibble become the kibble posts we want all in one convenient thread while the bluehaired pibblemommies get the containment they wanted
  congratulations you just created the third pitbull thread
another pibble thread nice
cute doggo
  not good enough i personally think there should be a /pit/ board and it should be on 4chan because 4channel doesnt allow for the gory images that a true /pit/ board requires
imagine being such a retard that you cant just filter out pibble threads and instead waste time to complain about people making pibble threads such retards deserve to get mauled
  6 pitbull threads
  ahem
  kek
  how about we just shut up about pitbulls because its fucking boring and theres only so many ways to say youre a massive vagina who shits their pants anytime they see a medium sized dog owned by anyone darker then their ownn funguspale basement tan    /an/ successfully proves that they are such pussies a common shitmutt sends them in to a screaming panic    this is fucking worse then when bugguy kept starting all of those outdoor cat threads just to prove what a lonely little cunt he was
  i miss bugguy he at least kept it to one pit bull thread at a time
  alas he was the biggest vagina of all i still think about him sometimes and hope that he found purpose in life and didnt just eventually neck himself
whats wrong with horse people
traditionally women would get their first orgasm from a horse saddle not on purpose it was just a happy coincidence
  horse girls are usually uncircumcised and therefore experience sexual pleasure thanks feminism
  now learning to trot makes more sense
  uncircumcised  what disgusting savages
  inshallah
  haha i get it its so barbaric to chop off part of a babies genitals glad we arent barbarians here in america
whats wrong with faggot ops having disgusting thoughts 24/7
  the most recent post in the horse general was literally beastiality
  meanwhile it was just ruled that some muslim docs and nurses chopping off baby clits like it was going outta style was okay    think it was detroit chicago or pittsburgh it happened in
  muslims chopping off what nature put there  next crusade when 
  no it wasnt dumbass it was the for you horse gif and before that is a horse fighting a dog over a towel
  go look up the archive
  why do horse owners do this though
  horses are pretty clever i wouldnt be surprised if they give their female riders a little extra bounce
this thread is retarded      male circumcision is unnecessary and arguably cruel and its a dying practice in female circumcision they will completely remove the clitoris with the goal that the female wont enjoy sex they often cut off the entire external organs and sew the vagina shut so it heals that way making a kinda of leatherface superhymen that is painful and dangerous to break this would be more like cutting off the entire penis and leaving the testicles male circumcision is bad female circumcision is worse    and for the rest of you fags do you cuddle your dogs do you hug them and pet them and tell them theyre good boys do some of you autists feel a special connection because that is your best friend its no different for girls building a bond with their horses doesnt mean they fuck them ive heard riding can be uncomfortable not pleasurable similar to men hitting their testes but obviously not as bad most girls who love horses like to fuck them is a meme i hope
  and this is the most retarded post of all why would a horse want to make its female rider cum even if it understood that bouncing could cause this i get that this is a hot scenario but it belongs on /d/ not /an/
  be quiet chopping off the female equivalent of the penis is totally equivalent of removing a bit of skin from the end of a males penis stop being a feminist shill you cuck
    youre really pissing and moaning over some dumb innocuous attempt at humor are you female
  wait until someone like that actually posts youre parodying a strawman and thinking youre being cute
  i love my dog and i fuck it every now and then what was your point again
  its in their interest for the owner to be in a good mood a dog or horse could easily make this causal connection
  the majority of people who cant orgasm or experience sexual pleasure cope by intense emotional closeness and intimacy cicumcision is the best thing for women and it be cruel to not circumcise your daughter
  if female circumcision is wrong why do feminists love niggers and muslims so much serious question     idfk i love horses very much but horse people are genuinely the worst literally worse than pibble owners every cunt with a horse thinks shes something extra spectral and that their horse is a literal unicorn theyll go as far as to tell you that conformation doesnt really matter anyway and that their horse is just for advanced riders only and not really a spoiled pos
  bawwtism detected
  because niggers and muslims hate western men
  horses have a strong instinct for human emotion and get satisfaction from pleasing owners thats why theyre considered good therapy for many types of mental health patients they evolved alongside human civilization
honestly thinks fugging horses is even rev remotely common  you spend too much time online
  i didnt think about it until i saw a performance of equus now ive seen three productions and done some research its surprising how common it is actually
  thats quite a sample size keep youre fetish on /trash/
  i dont like penn and teller i think they are intellectually dishonest
  maybe for the people in that group but theyre hardly the norm
  i want to commit a crime and its not beastiality

adorable with 4channel edition    copypasta    join the cat conversation at /an/cords cat section      food  nutrition        outside enrichment      behavioral problems        kitten care      old thread 
  this is my grandmas cat she loves me very much shes all white with two different colored eyes she lost her mother at a young age and didnt have any surviving littermates so she doesnt really know how play without hurting her playmate although she loves to play and she doesnt know how to clean her butt  she is the only cat i know that isnt afraid of the vacuum because shes deaf however she is terrified of the ceiling fan whenever im holding her and she passes under it
  discord is a government data collection tool
  most white cats are deaf
  i know it is sad
  nah youre thinking of 4channel
  go away /aq/
tonkinese   great cats always up for a chat or a cuddle il have a hard time getting any other kind after these guys this is squeak
  sideways   i never could into phones     anyway her brother pip
  a friend of mines family only has tonkinese they are very social
  onahole  
cat yawns  gently put my finger in her mouth so it closes on it    is this animal cruelty and/or deviant
is there any way i can convince my cat to sit with me rather than on me she literally follows me around all the time waiting for me to sit down so she can jump on
i adopted this amputated little boy a month and a half ago and hes the sweetest thing ever  also very goofy         i do this too
  goes to paw with his nub  poor guy at least he seems happy since he gave ya a little kiss at the end
  oh hes fine dont worry he gets in as much trouble and runs around like a normal cat to the point i often forget which arm hes missing     but he truly hasnt realized the range of his nub he to this day keeps trying to cover his shit in the litter box with it  but hes loved and plays and plays and plays and plays
today i buried my 17year old cat im 32 so she was with me for over half of my life    you know the drill too old deaf and when i took her to the vet guess what cancer got some meds to ease her pain took her back a month and a half watching her wither at my side i brought everything she liked and needed to my room she was already smelling bad because she couldnt process waste in the past two days she didnt eat or drink anythingstill she was with me to the last moments    yesterday i noticed that her front legs stiffened so she just lied in her little throne spent a good time petting her with her purring before going to sleep i knew she wouldnt last the night and she did too    when i woke up there she was dead with eyes wide open    well at least shes now free of the prison that her body became     always cherish your cats guys because when the time comes if youre a chronic depressive like me you wont be able to stop thinking of what you couldve done better
  im sorry to hear that anon is that her in the picture
    no that cat just looks like her her face wasnt so dark and her tail was slightly more puffy than that
heres a picture of my cats     i used to work at a hotel and there was a stray cat that would wander around and i would feed it during night shifts then one day when i went into the pool shed there was a whole litter of kittens there the hotel staff mostly maids decided to adopt the litter these two were the first ones i grabbed as they tried to scatter and hide and i decided to adopt them they were incredibly mangy and flearidden but totally healthy and they turned out to be the most wellbehaved cats ive ever had
        all blue eyed cats are special
  god dont read this if you have a tender heart but    somehow when i was switching meds i came across a youtube channel for a blind cat sanctuary and it just absolutely shattered my soul what hurt the most besides the low amount of views was seeing these cats just kinda sitting there and being startled by almost everything a lot of them seemed really really happy but i kept thinking about how they must be terrified constantly and it broke my like a bitch im glad you adopted that kitter anon
hey    my cat gets lit when i open the window  i know other cats have been spraying literally on and next to our windows   does she want to get out and explore or is she pissed off at the other cats  should i just leave the window closed  ive thought about taking her outside but last time i tried to put a harness on her she wasnt into it
ive thought about adopting a cat and having one in my dorm i have experience with caring for cats but my biggest concern is the cats wellbeing in a dorm  would it be too confining if a cat lived primarily in a dorm room i feel like they wouldnt enjoy it
  if you rescue one im sure a dorm would be heavenly compared to the alternative
  this
  both i guess all the noise and smell from outside is just really really interesting you could get a cat net for that window and leave it open from time to time as some ort of television for your cat getting used to a harness takes some time and most hate it at first      depends on the cat id say itd be shitty for a young one but there are lots of older cats that dont need or want much action anymore and that are currently suffering in a overfilled room or tiny enclosure in a shelter
  
so ive had two cats in the past and have a lot of friends with cats so i know how litter smells and have changed it from time to time however recently my mom got two new cats and the litterbox is across the room from my pc and it started smelling unbearably terrible through the whole basement minutes after one of them took a shit i decided to change it myself and i literally convulsed and vomitted from the smell never had problems with my old cats i think my moms using the same food and everything so any ideas i did notice the poop wasnt as covered with the litter as it normally is could there be something up with the litter weve had them for a few days so far and this is the first time its been really bad
hello can someone post pics like this for my collection please thank you very much
  theres nothing you could have done better at least not for your kot
  what happens when school ends can you take the cat with you to wherever you go next     wait until you have your own place before you get a cat
look at my cute idiot
theres a little miss stray cat that comes around evening every night for food and has a fear of people taking small steps and/or bending down when i kneel to dump her food out she retreats until i walk at least 15 feet away  what do you think i could do to build its trust more to the point of adoption and petting
  i could take my cat home but at home my parents have one thats lived there for all his life 7 years and i dont know if that would work out the cat at home is declawed in the front and neutered but i dont know if he would take well to it
  really nice mittens im gonna get a pair soon
  good idea keep warm this winter
get new kitten  other cat is scared  sister goes to pet our other cat that weve had for years  accepts pets but then sniffs her hand and hisses  what do we do /an/ is it too late
i really wish we had gotten 2 boys because lately this dude is meowing at us non stop hes a chatty breed by nature but im wondering if we could ever play with him enough probably not i dont think anything is wrong health wise but he will seriously carry on all day we are home he doesnt do it when we sleep though bless his heart
    why do you let that disgusting slop build up in its eyes
i think i have the most tsundere cat ever  she just gave me a leg massage and didnt even let me scratch her behind her ears
how do i pick a cat to adopt from the shelter    also thoughts on males vs female cat personalities heard females are bitchy
i wish my cat were a human so i could try to get her to suck my dick  shed be a hot bitch
my cat just had a brief seizure for about two minutes an hour ago but he calmed down in my hands and has been walking around and behaving normally since    any advice besides taking him to a vet checkup i would prefer to take him in the daytime to avoid the massive emergency bills
  when males sit upward their chest is big so their paws are far from each other   females have small chests so they sit upward in a very cute way where their paws are touching and their tails curl around to cover them  females are friendlier but they will get kinda bored and not play around as much as they grow older   males are more standoffish but will not get bored as they grow older  females have mews  males have mrrrrow
  thats just how her eyes look and always have looked
  some former stray cats have trouble getting used to being indoors 24/7 mine was essentially wild for a long time so even today many years later she insists on going out for at least an hour a day
  but just like with people stereotypes can be very wrong when it comes down to a particular cat my family has had three cats the male was the most touchyfeely but didnt play at all the females were more standoffish mischievous and one of them is still as playful as a kitten even though shes 15
  my advice is to go mingle with the cats youll know when you find one youll enjoy 3
i want to buy a ragdoll cat next year it will be my first own cat i want to raise a healthy beautiful cat to pet and love him but also want him to know his boundaries in my house conspros
5 months ago i decided to buy a cat sadly a shitty breeder sold me a 25 months old maine coon with panleukopenia my bad on not gathering enough information about buying a cat and all that i know poor guy died 6 days after i brought him home    i want to buy another cat but every vet ive talked to gave me different information about panleukopenia  some say you have to wait 1 year some say around 23 years do you guys know any good source i can read about the disease maybe some of you been in the same situation as i did i hope not
  god bless you anon
  i am so sorry anoni know your pain be strong
  these are some very smug kots you have here
    very cute they look somewhat related to siamese cats dont they
does my cat look overweight
  no thats just winter fur
  idk use a scale
posting my flamepoint siamese  he gets really wigged out by shadows and its fun to shine a flashlight at the wall and watch him chase your shadowpuppets
is sunflower oil harmful to cats
  youre right  thanks
  cons/pros specific to ragdoll cats or dos/donts for raising cats in general to love you but also not be faggots
  thanks they are smug and totally spoiled rotten though they deserve it for being little angels
  bless you anon and your nubbin kitty hes very cute
  yep iirc tonkinese is a burmese siamese mix the siamese shows through most in the darker faced girl both looks and act she will often meow walking down the hallway with a toy in her mouth going mow mow mow looking to play and is generally more vocal
i dont mean to bring down the mood but id like to say that my cat passed away today and reading these posts have lightened my mood and i wanna say thankyou
  in awe
    my cats getting close seeing other anons share their grief has helped me feel a little better about the inevitable im gonna give mine extra love from you guys
  many of us are grieving here youre in good company
im in bed rn with my laptop on my stomach and my cat on my lap peak comfy
    i just adopted the little shitass hes perfectly healthy and missing an arm isnt hindering him at all  the real heroes are the people i adopted it from he was born on a crazy feedalltheferalcatsbutneuternoneofthem cat ladys land she then ran his arm over as he was sleeping on her car tire giving him radial paralysis in his front left arm   then a coworkers brother accidentally hit him with a weedeater doing the ladys lawn as he couldnt move the brother bought it to my coworker and nursed him back to health and paid for the vet to give him his shots and surgery   the black cat juan had a friend until last december when he passed from kidney failure hes just slept around the bed a lot simon the orange cat is now his best friend and gets juan moving during the day   bless this cat and bless the people that found him
found out that one of my cats is having total kidney failure and only has a few days  realize my other cat is 16 and am now worried about him  away from home at uni so all i can do is worry cant even say goodbye to pic related  im not doing great bros
  my cat passed from kidney failure in december  it was hard up until the point the vet told me he wasnt breathing anymore   after that it was pretty easy to handle things as he wasnt hurting anymore
  back to 4chan poltard
15 year old boy has terminal mouth cancer lads conflicted on whether i should put him down or just try to keep him happy and comfortable in his final days    what would you guys do
  def the latter
  please refer tinfoil hat retards off their meds to /x/ we dont want them    t /pol/
  you can both get back to /pol/ incels
  mfw im white married a successful professional and i post in /kot/
i had to put my cats on a wet food diet because one of them has some fucked up tooth resorption going on the other one though started losing hair on her legs when i changed their food shes about 4 years old so not aging related i changed them to a new brand of wet food when i noticed but theyve been through almost a whole box of the new food and she still looks like this how long should i give it to grow back before i try yet another brand/flavor dont know how quickly issues like this guessing hormonal issues due to food allergies resolve once the cause is gone
  another pic where you can see the back legs better
    looks pretty extensive i would recommend changing the brand immediately or switching to raw or homecooked
my two girl they hate each other normally but squirrel and bird watching windows are neutral territory
  nice vhs hardware fren
  i think i probably need to find something not chicken flavored since both of the wet brands i tried had that but the other one is allergic to salmon and neither will eat rabbit or duck flavors suppose ill try to find turkey
that feel when youre scratching your cats neck and it puts its chin up  that feel when you hear it meowing outside so you open the front door and it rushes inside with its tail raised fresh and vocal  that feel when it wants you to pet it and lays on its side and stretches into a c shape  that feel when youre nodding off on your couch with it curled up on your lap  that feel when purrrreow  that feel when it presses its nose against yours  that feel when you return home and hear the pitterpatter of its paws  that feel when youre petting it and it presses its head against your hand  tfw cats      see a vet changing flavors isnt going to do jack
my cat isnt very affectionate i have to play bird videos on my second monitor to get her to chill next to me i play with her a lot and she likes to follow me around she likes to fuck off when she chills its not even that shes hyperactive shes lazy af she does like to play though usually in like 20 minutes sessions shes 1 year old and ive only had her for about a month even though ive known her since she was a wee little kitten got her from friends thanks for reading my blog rate comment and subslurb
  im pretty much on the same boat trying to win the heart of my tabby unit
  tabbies are absolutely based
  this is rascal
my boys do everything together they share one food bowl everyday even though theres one for each they also poop in the same box until it is full and then move to the next one
  thanks unfortunately tge wife donated most of our old vhs tapes
  based and bropilled
  give it time my dude some take longer than others and they almost always get more affectionate when they reach adulthood young cats just do their own thing a lot
if a cat ignores 90 of their toys are they just lazy or are the toys not really effective theres only one toy i can get her to engage with meaningfully a mouse toy with jingly bells that gets her into hunting mode where well play a game of her running off behind something and pouncing when i throw or let the toy go for a few seconds every other toy shell just smack at but its literally no difference between those toys and just dangling a string in front of her im not sure if shes just a lazy cunt or if the living environment is too boring for her but im probably overthinking this way too hard
  they need regular brushing if you dont want fur all over your house otherwise theyre a great companion cat very friendly
my cat doesnt meow yet should i make an audio collection of garys meows to teach her how to meow cutely or just be blessed by her silence    
  kek that cat looks fun
my cat fucking loves fresh taco bell bags
  my cat fucking loves string   she also loves a small stuffed animal you can use as puppet bait she even carries it around its cute as heck  its just big enough that i can play fight her with it without her going for my hands
  need more close ups
  yes   chicken as it comes in cat food is often an allergen
why does my cat want to eat my christmas tree
can you please rate my cat
  0/10 wouldnt bang
  what about beef also flavoured doesnt sound like thats the only meat in it      1 year  just you wait another 5 to 10 years shell love cuddles      i guess if the living environment would be too boring shed play more with these things because there wouldnt be better alternatives   try slowly moving a stick under some unimportant piece of cloth thats the most effective game i know
anyone knows what kind of cat is this
  you should donate most of her old clothes
  this looks german as heck
    or so i think
  cats from the abyss  cute
  thats a fucking weird looking cat    its normal its a weird tree they dont really understand at all just make sure your damageable ornaments are on the higher parts of the tree
  100/10 would give all my love and affection  cross eyed siamese are a gift from god
is it true that cat owners have 10 iq points over retarded dog owners why are cats the master race of pets

  what cat owners actually look like
hey it looks like were kinda talking about cats with food allergies neat what kinds of reactions were you getting from your cat as you were figuring out if they were allergic to something you guys  heres the long story of my problem though  so back in august my cat started puking a lot like multiple times a day plus lethargy and zero appetite anything he ate would inevitably come back up i took him to the vet after a couple days of this and xrays found nothing blocking his system up by the third visit they cleaned his ears up really well and hes always had a chronic issue of just having gunk in one ear despite my best efforts to keep it clean we got home from that visit and its like a switch had flipped he was totally better so all i could assume was that idk his equilibrium was thrown off from an ear infection so he was nauseous and thus all the puking i never got a resolution to this aside from cool hes back to normal  so cue yesterday and hes puking again just like last time only hes gone straight to not eating hes skipped dinner and breakfast by this point in rapid googling i came to find out that chronic ear issues can be indicative of a food allergy and my cat is about a week in to a new brand of food chicken based im super hopeful that this is the problem but he hasnt broken out in any kind of rash like youd expect his belly and inner thighs have pretty fine sparse fur which i always assumed was just his growth pattern but i cant help but wonder if that could indicate an allergy at work too  i had left over ear wash and medicine from last time and i started him up on those this morning in case it does have to do with his ear    but im just curious what signs people had that their cat had a food allergy pic related its my goober
  nice russian blue you have there
  to answer your question russian blies are notorious for getting stressed if their litter box isnt kept clean or there is too much chaos in their schedule they like a rigid schedule to keep things in order if your schedule is chaotic and youre not keep the litter box clean it could be causing him to be over stressed     also they seem to be prone to ear infections mine gets them too     try feeding him fancy feast wet in the morning and dry purina one for sensitive systems at night ive heard of a cat getting an allergy because of an ear infection also make sure your keeping the food fresh and not just leaving it out all day and night
  ive never heard of an allergy coming from an ear infection before i meant to say
    thanks for the input i appreciate it his litter box is clean and my personal schedule hasnt fluctuated lately i did post in the last cat general that my other cat had to be unexpectedly put down two weeks ago they were literal soul mates so maybe the absence of the other cat is catching up to him   and sorry  maybe i misphrased it ear issues can apparently arise as a symptom of an active food allergy i wasnt aware that russian blues were prone to ear issues though so ill definitely keep up with the flushingmedicine and do some reading into that  its just hard to see my usually very playful and very food motivated cat slow down into nothing and totally ignore food hopefully he comes around by the end of the day
  it might just be a rb issue all around mine will do the same thing act energetic one day and them next act like he is sick after going to the vet several times only to be told theres nothing wrong with him i just ignore it now or moreso watch but not worry     i suppose its possible he is missing his mate cats are harder to figure out than dogs    heres another interesting fact about rbs they are typically shy of strangers and dislike loud noises supposedly back in the day according to legend they were hunted for their fur and thus developed a strong mistrust of humans anyway fun fact about the world of russian blues they typically grow really attached to one family member and dont do exceptional well in a house full of kids
  when your cat acts sick is he just being lethargic or does he puke and other undesirable things its a little reassuring to know that this could just be my cat being dumb but after some reading just now im kind of leaning towards him having an ear infection the vomiting and not eating line up with nausea that would be caused by an ear infection and even though hes just been laying around since ive been home from work he looks pretty cozy not totally miserable you know pic related again i turned on the heater for him he purrs a bit if i pet him or get close like i said its just hard to watch when i know hes super playful and likes to follow me everywhere his ears are oily looking from his medicine
  the tell tale signs of an ear infection if he twitches his head side to side as if a gnat had crawled into his ear or if he is constantly scratching at his cheek or the side of his head mine was quite lethargic during his infections but never vomited     mine will act sick now and again for no apparent reason hell throw up and load around ignoring everything the next day or two has right back to normal     have you had blood work done most people refuse it due to the cost but having blood work done every couple of years is a good idea
  he always kinds of fidgets with his ears and he wasnt receptive towards be touching them earlier no head flicking back and forth though i dont think i had bloodwork done back in august i went ahead and set up a vet appointment for tomorrow for his ears and if that doesnt lead anywhere ill get some bloodwork done but thanks for the input i really do appreciate it
  no problem keep us up to date im curious too how it turns out dont forget to try fancy feast if you havent already its a quilt food for them
  quality    damm phone
  that is a cat brand cat
  kit tay
  what breed is that
  there is only one race the cat race
one of my cats is such a picky eater despite being fatter than my other cat  sprat  no good  chicken breast  no good  boiled chicken breast  no good  pork loin  on a good day  ham  no good
guys i have a problem with a cat ive never had before i rescued a 6 month old kitten with a busted eye and since then weve been best buddies hes a good boy hes almost 8 months now but hes so clingy    he does things like constantly barrage me for pets and nuzzles but what im worried about is when i leave for the day i cant stay at home 24/7 and even when im gone for like 20 minutes he freaks out he gets sad and hell freak out sometimes he goes to tear apart the house     how can i train this cat to be more independent he has toys he has plenty of space plenty of vision outside theres even another cat in the house he gets along with hes a sweet boy and hes my best friend but i just need him to not go into panic mode when i leave for even a short walk around town    pic related
  i hope you named him colonel tigh
  nah its reggie man
  never met a single cat owner like this    t dog cuck
  10/10 would pet
    oh thats a 10/10 m8
  you are all he has atm perhaps a brother/sister would ease the clingeyness you have to go to work for hours on end you cant just stay in your house all day this way he wont be sad/scared/lonely when you leave for the day
  god i wish that were me
my parents cat of 21 years has started to have seizures pees all over when it happens they took her to the vet to have her put to sleep since they figured its her time soon and they dont want to spend money on the vet bills for diagnosing the issue however the vets dont belive the cat is as old as they were told becuase shes in very good health and want to keep her for blood tests and obvervation im just feeling frustrated that theres nothing i can do and that although i love that cat my parents might have a difficult time with the bills idk
  wait the cat is 21 years old or theyve had it for 21 years because cats usually die around the 14 year mark that is astounding
  your bar is set very low
what breed is the blini kot
  cat
  lynx point siamese i think
  yep 21 her sister lived to 20 our other cats were over 15 when they went thankfully the regular vet came in today and agreed that it was time for her to go so shes at rest now
is he /our guy/    
  cats usually die around the 14 year mark  no 1820 years is old but pretty normal this is what you should plan for if you get one
tfw bought some fancy german made canned food for the kitten  ingredients are duck turkey broth and thats it   never actually tried neither duck nor turkey myself   holy fuck its great   tfw eat cat food   it cant hurt me right i mean its complete so has all these added vitamins but its pretty expensive and looks and tastes like human grade canned meat
  if you dont trust it for your own consumption why would you trust it for your cat youre fine i try dog treats at work all the time so i promise im not judging you
  squish that cat  kek
  i tried cheaper foods too felix with fish tasted weird as fuck kinda like something between onions and a squid
  i mean the ingredients look pretty good dont they
  i meant s o y obvs
chill guy has a cool day  whats with this rotation
  claudias facial expression doesnt corraborate anything he says
  tfw no shoulder cat  feels bad bros
i own a cat with separation anxiety hes very needy and follows me around everywhere likes being held wont eat unless youre with him is just generally up my ass all the time im usually home so he spends a lot of time with me i left home for two days once and came back to him refusing to look at me he avoided my hand when i tried to pet him struggled out of my arms and didnt even whine for food that entire evening i had to leave again the next morning though and then he climbed into my lap looking all sad as i was putting on my shoes    no please im sorry for being upset dont go
  dat pic  jesus this legitimately upset me did he grow up with another kitten or was he the only cat in the household
  he was born with us in a litter of three what had happened is my dad is an asshole and drops unwanted cats out of town because he doesnt want to be seen going to shelters this guy was the only one to make it back home he was perfectly fine and happy before that now i refuse to let the poor boy be abandoned a second time under my watch im actually kind of afraid to leave him for long too because i fear my dad will try to dump him again it was pure fucking luck he found his way back
  wow
    i wish i could have said something more thoughtful but im lost for words all i can say is that i hope youll be able to move out soon
  your dads on the list for dotr no offense    youre cool tho
  have you considered a second cat
  i plan on moving out soon just because of the cat honestly my dad keeps threatening to get rid of him and recently he threatened to kick me out recently anyway because i refuse to let the cat go the man even admits the cat is well behaved and i do a good job at making sure his needs are met he just wants to be a dick about me owning a cat he tried to toss
  it wasnt really my intention to own a pet to start with so no my partner however owns a cat and the two of us intend on moving in together within a year or so       oh my whole family is a shit show when it comes to pets which is why i didnt really want to own any i dont think i can give them the proper attention and care i love this cat to death but i have a hard time with things like keeping him from being over weight
  make sure you introduce them first before moving to make sure they get along needy cats are cool but can be tough to manage some times there are also meds you vet can prescribe for when youre out of town
this is my cat hes a big boy
  oh yes we plan on doing a slow introduction with cages and keeping them in separate rooms where they can get use to the fact another cat exists in their area and yeah i found it cute at first but he can be a real pain in the rear ill see about medicine if i cant gradually ease his worries hes gotten a bit better over time
one of my kots
  thats a fantastic picture bro    look at that little paw
  thanks
  hey so our vet visit yesterday went pretty well i guess i did have bloodwork done on him in august as the vet told me it looked really good then but we did more to be safe this was a big repeat of last time though nothing too terrible was removed from his ears but theyre testing the swabs anyway to make sure its not overly yeasty or anything while in the office he got some subq fluids an injection of cerenia for the antinausea properties mostly and a dose of some form of advantage sorry  away from the paperwork right now that not only targets fleas but ear mites and other parasites he might have just to rule those out should his symptoms continue but we got home and he chowed down on a bunch of wet food he was clearly pretty tired last night from the day but he woke me up an hour ago for some routine cuddles and purrs so im pretty confident were back on track all i can assume is that he gets caught in a loop of nausea for whatever reason  nauseous wont eat cant recover because he has no food on board continue nausea wont eat etc etc we have a recheck in a week where hell get some vaccine updates too and ill talk to the vet about what to do to hopefully prevent this in the future    oh and thanks for the food recommendation i think were definitely going to switch him over
  no my cat is the most tsundere  i can never take her to me or sleep next to her however when i pretend that im sleeping or when i go to sleep she always jumps into my bed and lays down next to me on my pillow or on my leg when i wake up or just move when im pretending to sleep so that she comes over she jumps off and makes a weird mrrurrrryiiuu sound for a few seconds and then stays close but faces away from me its really cute
  shes a swede
my cat stares at the screen whenever im using the computer when hes around and hes watching me type rn lmao he jumped on the couch when he heard me play youtube videos and we were watching joe rogan a minute ago thats what i get for showing him bird videos

  i dont think its panic mode its just energy make sure before you leave hes all tired out from play and make sure to leave for a while let him get used to you not being there
is caturday still a thing on 4channel lads
  make sure and take lots of pics of her while you can anon    my old girl started going downhill around this time last year she lasted a couple months in rough condition blind and in renal failure i didnt want to take pictures of her in the miserable state she was in and i regret that so much id give anything to go back and just take a picture of her little pink paw pads the few photos i have are from her much younger days pic
  sorry to hear that anon how old was she
anyone here make a cat tree before they look really easy to construct and i dont want to pay 150 for something i could build for 50
  15 found her hanging around our house as a stray we think she was about a year old never knew for sure
  thats a beautiful cat a beautiful name and a beautiful garden
  jesus that is one sad looking cat
  theyre easy to make dont stress anon and cats love them
    my mistake i thought you were thinking of buying one anyway i think theyre a good investment if youre worried about making one
  just got a new cat hes a good boy weve named him cousteau
  pics or it didnt happen
our old tuxedo had been suffering from kidney failure for a couple months now made the decision today to giver her the long nap she could barely walk couldnt get up to go to the bathroom hadnt eaten in days    i miss her so much you guys
  heres a pic
i have 2 cats and 2 litter boxes set up is it weird that they only shit in one box and piss in the other
  shes in a better place anon had a similar thing happen to my tabby about a year back over the course of a few days she went from healthy to unable to walk before passing its better that theyre not in pain and remember the time you had with them
  sounds like you have very refined cats
  if youre worried about making one  im not worried about making one i was just curious if anyone here had made one before but it is probably way far out of the league of your typical cat owner
  take care of your boy no matter what he/she loves you so at a level of unconditionalnes we humans cant begin to appretiate he chose you to love give him the same in return
we live in a world of cruelty where we take pleasure in the destruction of another most of your are young and arrogant as such well never mind love your pets give them the same love they give you
flea collar legit or meme 
  yes
tfw kot plays fetch and drops the mouse at your feet each time
  meme i assume youre an underaged faggot who lives comfortably in the convenience of white suburbia football practice opps soccer practice when
  piece of shit brand get seresto instead very good collar lasts a few months ive gone 6 before but they are kind of expensive
  mine dont play fetch but they definitely play soccer we through little balls around them and they love to reach out and swat them out of the air like theyre defending a goal its the most adorable thing ever
  anyone who puts a flea collar on their pet is a faggot do you like to suck dick
  im guess youre probably 16 maybe 14 im sure you just finished a round of fortnite maybe cod share with us your wisdom on why flea collars are based please im all ears
no answer hmmm go back to /pol/ and ask them what your underaged ass should believe right
    when my cats and dog had fleas yes i used flea collars i spent close to 300 on collars and treatment for my house to get rid of the fleas they dont have fleas anymore so they dont have any collars  you can use drops edible medicine or collars for flea control this is common knowledge
  jesus forgive me for taking your taking your name in vainthis idiot this retard can barely for a human sentence
  barely for a human sentence  ok
  getting a regular unbreeded kitten today healthy active what should i know

give your cat the gift of knowledge and freedom this holiday season
  almost all cats prefer to pee and poop in different places if they can its normal       they work theyre also famous for triggering violent reactions in some cases so id go the safe route an only use them in the vacuum cleaner      be ready for 5 hours playtime a day and dont let it go hungry healthy and active kittens eat a lot
tfw no cat loving gf
  be ready for 5 hours playtime a day and dont let it go hungry healthy and active kittens eat a lot  okay    whats your opinion on packaged cat food and dry food is giving home cooked boiled meat and fish better
  proper raw feeding read about it its way more than just some meat seems a little complicated but should be the best option if you want to know exactly what goes in it   id always feed canned food at least one day a week because youll never know what might happens in the future and if the cat mabe has to be fed with it for some time so its better if its used to it    i feed different brands of canned food as main meals and dry food as snacks during playtime its really great to throw around   also some raw boney meat like chicken necks or wings once a week to clean the teeth and for fun    raw or cooked meat without seasoning is also alright as a snack only be careful to only give cooked chicken without bones they can injure the cat because they tend to splinter    do you know your new friends sex or name yet
  she looks like she fucks black guys    which means im in luck 
  hm okay yeah my new friend has arrived female about 2 months old name is undecided
porch mama has brought her kittens to live in my front yard im drowning in cats so these ones cant come live inside guess these ones are going to the shelter in about two weeks once theyre a little bigger hopefully in time for a christmas adoption

  stop buying cats and fucking adopt you mongoloid

had a cat years ago named grey  fat kot but loved him with all my heart  tragically died and i was devastated  got him cremated  have his box  but that rainbow bridge paper with his paw print on it  but they spelled his name greg  dont know what to do about it
  take some white out to the top part of the g
my cat is so fluffy and sweet she doesnt do much but still makes my heart melt
  i dont know maybe ill get a plaque or something for him  dont even know where any photos of him are
  black cats in general the short haired ones usually look like little panthers though if youre thinking about adopting one  i know they go unadopted because of superstition but ive also lately heard that people dont want black cats because they dont photograph for social media as well as other colors people are dumb
tfw eating the kibble that hasnt been touched by anyone for 56 years at least since i stopped giving cat any kibble at that point   it tastes pretty interesting i gotta admit pretty sure it would go down nicely with beer its dr clauders i think

my cat keeps losing his collars when i let him go outside this didnt used to happen he had his first collar for a little over a year until he lost it somewhere and now he keeps on losing them i was considering getting him one with a buckle until i realized it might not be a good idea since i dont know exactly how hes losing them dont want him to hang himself on accident hes microchipped but i dont want him to get into any trouble    if there something i can do ive tried not letting him out when hes not wearing a collar but i dont think hes gets the hint
  cat collars are breakaway by design they will quickly twist themselves up and choke to death if they get hung up because theyre absolute spazzes best thing is for the collar to separate so the cat doesnt die not really anything you can do about it if you insist on letting him roam free outside
  expires discord link
my cat has bad breath because shes a picky eater and wont eat chicken bones i suspect gingivitis  is there anything i can do besides holding her down for a manual brushing a few times a week
  good kot anon    reminds me of when mine snuggled in bed with me
  chicken bones  see  
how do i keep a kitten entertained my kot loses interest in anything real quick switching around toys isnt even really an option since he gets tired of them in literal minutes i tried setting up some puzzles with treats but it takes him seconds to solve or just gives up if he thinks he cant solve it    so far the best solution i have is throwing treats around but thats proving to be way too expensive
guys please help i just noticed something is wrong with my cat and the closest veterinary is closed turns out my cat is not in his usal energetic and annoying mood he looks tired and if i try to grab his legs it kind of pains him the previous owner of my cat says his mother showed the same symptoms and it may be because of the change of weather im not really sure about that i do leave him in my backyard all nights and it gets cold but i always thought that doesnt bother cats thank to their fur im still taking him to the vet tomorrow but i wanna know what you guys think
  i wanna also add that when my cat gets super annoying i throw water at him from a hose or from a cup and i do that quite often i dont know if that has something to do
here is a picture of my cats  say something nice about the white one
reminder canned tuna flea collars  smoking increase a cats risk of getting oral cancer
probably the best place to ask ive had this handsome man for about 3 years now he came from the home of a hoarder when the mother got too hot to feed the kittens he is the only survivor of a litter of 6 raised him from 3 weeks on while he was extremely loving early on he eventually got very stand offish growling if you get him for a few too many seconds hissing when passing the other cats taken him to the vets several times yet nothing seems to be causing issue save for a slight dent in one side of his nose that leads to sneezing fits sometimes anyway to bring him back to that lovey dovey state or will he forever be in the rebel phase
  if you get him for a few too many seconds  quit fucking with him by all means play with him but dont be an ass hell settle down in a couple of years

  the efficacy of breakaway collars is marginal if youre that worried about your cat getting killed outside spoilerdont let it outside/spoiler
just bought a small table topper christmas tree not sure if its fir or spruce but should i be worried about my roommates cat eating it and dying or something he doesnt chew on my other plants i have floating around so i dont know what might draw him to that but just curious
  i mean youre not wrong im with you in the dont leave them outside and especially overnight crowd
    do you live alone sometimes cats get unsocialized and moody if they arent in contact with multiple people or other cats after a few months
    spruce or fir isnt toxic to cats if thats what youre worried about worst thing that could occur is probably digestive blockage or damage if the needles get dry and sharp id imagine your cat would probably leave it alone if it leaves your other plants alone but it couldnt hurt to keep an eye out
  heres a picture of my 1214 year old calico her name is cassie short for casablanca
  lol kitty
a picture of my cat viktor when he was a kitten he was put down recently because of leukemia he was a sweet boy
ive had a cat for 2 years that has always been sort of a loner and a scared boy its always been a sore spot for my gf and i because weve been so affectionate and loving but he doesnt really show any back he likes to always have his eyes on us but he makes sure to sit far enough away so we cant pet him he hates to be left out like if i close the bathroom door he meows and pounds on it and when i open it he just sits there and looks at me and makes sure i cant pet him     so we decided we wanted to get him a friend and maybe get a cat that was more affectionate and we did shes super affectionate and loving and already has slept on my chest he fucking hates her though ive read that its pretty normal for the previous cat to not really accept the new cat for up to a few weeks but is there anything you can do to help with that were not sure how to go about sleeping she keeps waking us up and we dont want them fighting in the night
  youre supposed to introduce them slowly she is in his territory  
  shes doing her best
  rip hope he had a great life and enjoyed his time there
  i have had this one cat for about 8 or 9 years now she is a sweetheart but we recently back in may got a new kitten she still hasnt taken to him yet when we first brought him home she was so pissed she refused to come inside for at least two weeks then she would come in but hiss at him growl etc she still hasnt come around but at least she has stopped being outright mean to him the point i am trying to make is that it just takes time could be a few weeks or it could be a few months   you can try brushing both of the cats with the same cat brush and then letting him sniff it that will mingle their scents a bit and help him get used to her even if they do fight it probably wont be anything serious
  very nice anon he looks like a good boy indeed

girl who literally calls her cat her son and my child    like i can understand calling yourself mommy when talking in the third person about it but holy fuck dont actually start referring to it as your child that shits weird
  this whole trend of replacing human children with animals is so dumb
  well its more affordable and in this economy etc
  i think its because of the mistaken belief that the pet thinks the owner is their parent really however pets think of the owner as the social leader or in the case of cats food source
  calling yourself mommy is even more disturbing im on a rat group on fb to help me find good breeders advice etc but the large amount of single women in their 20s calling themselves rat mommies is just flat out eerie  ive even seen women go as far as to call themselves turtle moms turtles dont give a shit about you they have reptile brains not mammal ones they likely arent social animals even i am not into turtles so excuse me if im a bit wrong though i only had one as a pet forced onto me
  are you telling me there exist women or even men stupid enough to think this how bad are educational systems getting
  america has the world education system of any first world country
  what did he mean by this
  enlightened reasoning
  my dog isnt an asshole for 7 years of its life
    it is becoming a weird trend but i kind of see why its happening yeah when most people were farmers more kids mean more working hands and security for the future now theyre huge upfront money sinks especially in the kid years and if you want to even partially support them through college that cost can be a huge burden as well marriage in general to create an optimal environment to raise kids is also slowly becoming more exclusive to the wealthier
  its ironic you literal autist
  your own kid who youre raising who if you raise properly and doty spoil him/her he can grow up to be friendly obedient clean shit for you and literally be your wage slave around the house a literal maid  i saw one kid who was spoiled and loud and stupid means all kids are this   anon no by the age 4 they arent little shits anymore they will behave if raised right and will work around the house and do chores for a decade or more dont see dogs doing that for you anytime soon let alone coming to you when youre old and dying and lonely and helping you avoid those garbage retirement homes
  what are trade schools what is them looking after you when you get older what is them paying taxes so your retirement home wont be shit and wont hire gypsies to secretly hurt you what is them taking in the work force for you      marriage in general to create an optimal environment to raise kids is also slowly becoming more exclusive to the wealthier  stop over spending money on two cars five story houses overpriced animal products stop owning 70 pets stop buying nintendo switch games pc games maybe just maybe kids wont be expensive anymore
    want to know one of the main reasons the economy is so shit because our own parents didnt have enough kids the more people the less shit the economy is us selfishly having no kids will lead to an even shittier economy in the futute so have fun with that world when youre 75 and still cant retire
  american culture has a stigma against trade schools for some reason and i suspect its partly why families are willing to pay out the nose for college especially a prestigious one for ego value  that said declining birthrates and pets acting as surrogates for kids is happening in other developed nations as well in japan having a kid is even more prohibitively expensive compared to average wage even though the whole keeping up with the jones culture isnt as strong
  it couldnt be the west has flooded itself with non productive low iq peoples with no attachment to the societies that spawned it while allow legal structures to form that shuffle wealth from the productive classes to non productive parasitic global elite with no sense of patriotism
  im not even saying that having kids is bad and that people who want kids shouldnt you retard its just true that less people on average are inclined to do something on purpose the higher the barrier to entry is and the less incentives they see even if it would be better in the long run
  boomers bought into the media propaganda in america nice thats shitty how they got scared and tricked into buying for the college meme the over saturation of college degrees leads to only a few people getting the job they studied for tons of the people who finished the same thing wont get any jobs thats scary americans need to stop believing in colleges trade schools will guarantee you jobs much easier
  it is my child though i treat them like i would treat my actual child   pets are family and if you think anything less of your own animals you dont deserve them
  kind of true the people we have flooded ourselves with does make products slightly cheaper but not long term the upcoming consequences with this wont be good either       thats not the sole reason we have less children now why do poor muslims still get 4 to 6 kids despite living in europe my grandmother had 10 kids despite living in total communism where the economy was even shittier than now it is not an excuse its the economy slightly getting worse nowhere near as bad as communistic baltic country economy was combined with tons of media worship of singlehood or forfeiting having children women being told extremist feminism is good and that men are shit men getting fed up by women and end up thinking all women are crazy depression due to us sitting all day on our phones and computers etc all these add up and kill off our desire to have kids
personally i dont mind people treating pets as practice children as long as they remember that theyre animals not humans and have different needs treating a dog like a baby is no better than treating a child like a dog  unfortunately people with any sense or resources arent having children because there are no incentives to do so for various reasons and the ones who are having children are welfare leeches and morons who couldnt care for a potted plant
  taking a metaphor and heavily misinterpreting it in a literal sense  the absolute fucking state of /an/ons  dont ever grow over emotional feelings towards your pet you can have good times with your pet and care for it and feel joy together but growing this emotionally attached to a being that isnt even human is not only pathetic but will worsen your life and your future relationships with others as much as i am close to my pets i never would let myself get too autistic and attached to it because i know the outcome would not be good theres a reason such behaviour is called immature theres a reason cat ladies are social outcasts and arent happy    this is coming from someone who was autistic about animals since they learned to read about them who constantly draws animals and likes talking about them there should be boundaries for everything obsession just isnt healthy
  i feel bad for your pets knowing that you would choose other people over them do them a favor and give them up to somebody who would actually care for them
  id rather not give my pets to mentally ill people   a hamsters life is more valuable than a humans  rats too  man that animal that lives 2 to 4 years sure needs his life saved over a humans in a fire incident i totally agree anon as much as i adore my pet rodents feed them the best food mixes i can make/buy give them as much attention as they need i still am sane and know its immature to start anthropomorphizing an animal and obsessing over them and that a human child would be more valuable to save in a fire than my pet rodents whod sadly would not and should never be priority over a human ironcially enough people overly crazy about their pets like you often tend to be very emotionally unstable illogical rude and have other issues and also often end up harming the animals health via overfeeding them tasty snacks or suffocating them with tanks like how some rats died due to people shoving their rats into glass walls thinking they were better than others i remember a woman who thinks just like you had a dog that developed severe pains and had to be out down but she instead chose to give it meds to keep him alive which his physical pains continued from because she viewed him like a literal family member another retarded mentality people like you have is i must belittle everyone and show of how much of a better pet owner i am its as if you guys are deeply insecure
  i meant teenagers
  yeah those teens were raised by boomers probably one of the worst parents to have lived in the last 200 years theyre too lazy to look after and raise their kid properly which isnt even that hard to do mind you so they let them play on their ipad all day then grow up and become retarded teens who spout memes all day and are too lazy to get jobs raise your kid right and he will be a good responsible teen
  stop having children you filthy gntile
  go back to /pol/ you grand master cuck
  rentfree
  not him but even though /pol/ is a total meme youd have to be equally stupid not to find those magazines as a huge redflag
talk about cryptozoology shit here if your a skeptic please explain your evidence
  if your a skeptic please explain your evidence  this reminds me of the youtube commenters who were calling joe rogan a shill for saying he doesnt believe in bigfoot
  i meant that you should provide some evidence on why you think a certain cryptid isnt real
  prove a negative    how about you prove they exist first
  cryptids have been proven real before      
      prove that something unrecognized by science doesnt exist   anon     gorillas okapis and giant squid come to mind
  dont argue with retards             is that way faggots
  dont argue with retards  this right here i was struggling to type up a suitable response to ops retardation but i figured it was best to get out while i still could and chalk this guy up as a failure of the us school system
  go discuss undiscovered and possibly still extant prehistoric animals elsewhere this is a pibbles board
  your mental illness is not an animal nor a feature of the natural world  
  coelacanths are a mental illness
  by this logic i can say that gryphons exist if you tell me they dont all i have to say is that you havent looked hard enough or believed hard enough do you see how fucking retarded that is
  yeah i do thats why i was making fun of op
  wwhat do you mmean that three headed penis whale dragons arent real look at this fish we didnt know existed because we didnt have technology back then ttake that
  sad thread/k/ has had some good crypto threads
  yeah this could have been a good thread but op is fucking retarded and has no critical thinking or reasoning abilities
  ningen just look like weird giant belugas
  listen there are some serious holes in cryptozoology first off its inherently a pseudoscience because cryptozoology is just the practice of purposely trying to prove something true instead of disproving it and realizing why these animals are unrecognized by science instead they make desperate excuses for lack of evidence   but that doesnt make the discussion of cryptids irrelevant to the discussion of nature  animals especially when theres been plenty of former cryptids with latin names that you can even go see yourself at the city zoo you may as well  the speculative biology threads while youre at it because astrobiology is a straight up branch of cryptozoology
    this
  astrobiology is a straight up branch of cryptozoology  paleontology doesnt strictly deal with real animals either but good luck convincing the fanboys of that
  only children should unironically believe in cryptids
  paleontology doesnt strictly deal with real animals either   haha holy fuck based people think believing in sasquatch is a mental illness while they give and receive phds in animals only known from bone fragments or even just impressions like footprints
  paleontology is inferring past animal life from mineralized impressions of their bodies/bones or in rare cases with amber preserved bodies/ parts yes strictly speaking what you study isnt the animal itself but they were real
  if your a skeptic please explain your evidence    i think youve got that the wrong way around the burden of proof is on you because you are the one making a claim skepticism is just the default setting for any unproven claim    provide evidence rule out any possible other explanations and then set about testing and proving your claim    the default setting for the existence of bigfoot for example should be skepticism even for those studying the possibility of its existence otherwise if you set out with your mind made up that its already real youll keep generating false positives which is exactly what has happened time and time again for bigfoot from mislabeled bear fur to a scalp that turned out to be made from goat hide    even if there possibly is a bigfoot cryptozoologists have done such a good job of discrediting themselves and muddying the waters with so much false data that they have actually made it much harder to objectively explore the possibility of bigfoot    also cryptozoology is mixed up with so much unsavoury baggage that any mention of it in relation to any supposed new findings throws up instant red flags aside from the usual fame gold and glory types there are a lot of religious groups that are eager to use proof of certain cryptids to disprove scientific theory in some way or another mostly dinosaurs fire breathing dinosaurs    lastly new species are discovered scientifically catalogued and named all the damn time time but noone is ever interested because its usually some form of south american beetle and not some big monster from popular culture
imagine actually believing that bigfoot the loch ness monster and santa claus exist  imagine being that fucking stupid
  this at least you have some hard physical evidence of their existence    youd have to come up with some pretty revolutionary explanations as to what those fossils otherwise were and how they formed    asking some desperate tourist trap in buttfuck nowhere if their dried yeti testicle is really definately from a yeti and not from trapper bobs pile of dead wolverines however is an order of magnitude less ironclad evidence
  but they were real  i didnt say they werent real  i said they arent real
  i want so badly to believe we go all the time not seeing large animals for literal decades that i could possibly buy that in remote areas    but between the fact that apparently the niggas are more common than black bears based on sightings maps and the fact that 95 of the supposed witnesses seem like they just want attention i cant    also something weve learned recently is that if black bears are in an unfamiliar area theyll walk around on hind legs to get a better vantage looking for landmarks and if pennsylvanias black bear season is any indication 8ft tall 600lb black bears are unusual but not uncommon
  if your a skeptic please explain your evidence  im a skeptic because there is a lack of credible or scientific evidence for cryptids see thats how evidence works you retard you can not prove a negative therefore proof is required for the positive claim i bet you also think the earth is flat and gravity is cause by us accelerating through space
  imagine being this reddit
  impying reddit fags arent the biggest cryptid dorks
  i dont have to explain being a skeptic the fact is that you have no evidence if youre making claims then its up to you to prove out those claims not for me to disprove them  do you often see flying saucers and lizard people and when were you last probed by space aliens
orcas fighting a ningen or something
  we dont take kindly to fake animals round these parts
  trunko not ningen  
  what is a ningen it looks like an ugly whale    honestly were discovering new species every day species also go extinct every day it is not unbelievable that a few straggling members of a dying species thought to already be extinct or species never properly documented could make appearances in the modern day stranger things have happened     you know what blows my mind how much natural history was lost when we introduced disease to the native american populations some tribes reported seeing mammoths rarely even when the europeans showed up unscientific but crazy to think about the lack of written natural history on this half of the planet is heartbreaking imagine the species we missed maybe some hunted to extinction by desperate natives trying to escape the changing face of their land so much time was spent in continentwide chaos not even counting how disorganized and war ridden some parts of north america were before the invasion     anyone have good stories or theories about preeuropean north american cryptids
  that just looks like the decayed to shit whales ive seen on the beach
  100200 years ago we didnt know that such widely known animals as gorillas and komodo dragons existed   what the fuck i feel like my whole worldview was just shaken
  the people who lived there knew they existed but that used be wild territory it took westerners a while to get around to documenting them in english still kind of a mind fuck but not as wild
bump
  there are accounts of explorers encountering gorillas long before they were documented by zoology but they seemed to think they were just really ugly brutish human natives    this account was written by hanno the navigator in 500 bc    in its inmost recess was an island similar to that formerly described which contained in like manner a lake with another island inhabited by a rude description of people the females were much more numerous than the males and had rough skins our interpreters called them gorillae we pursued but could take none of the males they all escaped to the top of precipices which they mounted with ease and threw down stones we took three of the females but they made such violent struggles biting and tearing their captors that we killed them and stripped off the skins which we carried to carthage being out of provisions we could go no further
  i remember reading some book by jules verne as a kid in which he claimed that gorillas use fire crazy how recently this myth of gorillas being just like primitive humans persisted
  its odd because its not like people didnt know what monkeys and apes were barbary macaques were well known to people living in the mediterranean seems odd they looked at gorillas and went those are some ugly ass niggers damn and not thats the biggest fucking monkey ive ever seen
  those sentences mean the same thing though
  when i was a young anon with a penchant for the devils lettuce i hypothesized that legends about stuff like bigfoot and the yeti descended from early homo sapien sapiens coexisting with other pre humans that have since gone extinct similar to hss and neanderthals in europe to my stoned mind that seemed like the most likely scenario of course theres absolutely no archeological or paleontological evidence of prehumans in na so i wont claim it as anything other than a fun hypothesis  as for the endurance of bigfoot as an idea i think its an enticing idea because its something thats so close to human but isnt quite human the idea that we might be able to communicate with it that it might have a basic society etc  i cant take most cryptidfags seriously though because they seem to think that the absence of evidence is license for wild speculation and a lot of popular cryptids become increasingly implausible the more when expand our knowledge of the natural world
    early explorers to australia described bizarre creatures never before seen by europeans they wrote of creatures with heads like deer that stood upright like men and hopped like frogs the creatures sometimes sported two heads  one on their shoulders and one on the stomach such accounts were understandably disregarded and ridiculed by fellow colleagues  i understand their frame of reference back then was a lot more limited than it is today but couldnt they possibly put a handdrawn sketch in their letters it still looks stupid if you dont know what youre looking at but at least it brings some visual context instead of being all comparations with animals they already knew    also where does that description come from both the article and the wikipedia page for kangaroo use the exact same leaping biped deer trivia but it says citation needed is it from a book
  daily reminder all cryptids are fake as fuck except for some small unremarkable animal that humans have nearly driven to extinction which accounts for far less than 1 of cryptids    every cryptid account goes like this    1 whoa dude me and my bros found this mermaid skeleton look at this shit  hands photo  oh wow can i see it  aw nah man we lost it    or    2 we had a picture of a pterosaur  holy shit i have to see this  we lost it    literally every single fucking time nearly without exception except when someone is making a big deal over something that probably isnt even a thing like the kabomani tapir
    did you know in the past people didnt know about animals theyd never seen  wow no shit this means bigfoot is real
are there any recommendations for small children friendly nature shows my kids like zooboomafoo and have watched it to death theyre only 3 so id like to avoid shows with animals fucking or getting eviscerated
just show them national geographic the earlier they are desensitized to the truths of wildlife the better
  just show them all the normie stuff from bbc planet earth i  ii blue planet i  ii life etc
  the kratt brothers made a new animated show on pbs called the wild kratts  midway through my typing i realized zaboomafoo was also with those two i bet your kids will love it when they see them two again talking about some other kind of animal and then they transform into the animated world its a little out there flying turtle ship minute time travel to see the dodo and the tazmanian tiger among others and other scifi type things but the base and substance of the show is to help out animals whenever you can  theres another one called doki i havent been able to find it in years but my kids used to watch it we had a digital antenna and got one of those weird channels it used to come in on that that ones more about exploring the world and what different people and cultures have all done with animals though animated as well  ill monitor this thread in case i remember any others we watch/used to watch and other good ideas too
  island of lemurs lemurs with john cleese and      the kratts also did a more mature special on lemurs

how do i train an animal any animal apparently centipedes can be trained
  severely beat them when they dont do what you want eventually they will learn to do what you want if they dont understand just get more mad
  this
  apparently centipedes can be trained  reptiles can hardly be trained what makes you believe a fucking arthropod can are you correlating this with that one video of a guy petting a large pede whilst it moves around on a wall that thing was most if not 100 sure to have been thrown in a cold environment freezer making its sense of touch basically nonexistant
can someone teach me to train my pitbull
  i wagged my finger at my betta fish o put my hand in the water and he got scared and hid
  my two ferrets come to me when i whistle or squeak a toy i trained them the way you can train dogs   make the noise give them a treat when they come repeat
  yes

  sempervivum
im the anon from last thread who was planting wintergreen and lily seeds my set up was quick with big hopes and it probably sucks the seeds are unscarified and are in unclean garden soil i give them a little water every other day and check if the soil is dry im trying to follow the directions from the package i was given which was prepare a garden bed and plant in fall these native plants should come up easily to the left are the wood lilies the middle are various seeds iris hibiscus americanaster more lilies and wintergreen and the right is wintergreen this is my first time planting seeds ive been told that these wont survive over the winter id really appreciate some advice also how would i extract the seeds if i would need to move them to a new container
  i forgot my picture sorry
my tulips are down now all i have to do is wait til march im so excited bros
  my favorites are the more succulent member of the family asclepiadaceae so stapelia huernia caralluma ceropegia cynanchum etc  couldnt really pick an absolute favorite species though    for cacti it might be the genus ariocarpus
  they should have been planted in a clear area outdoors
  more something like this argentine cactus
growing some nardello peppers a heirloom annum allegedly the best tasting and sweetest variety 38 days or so since first starter leaves i just topped them a couple days ago there were easily 10 buds on each   they are growing extremely fast and prolific and also germinated in 3 to 5 days i recommend growing these for sure
  so somebody got the webm
anyone collect rain water for their plants ive got a container filling up outside for the first time
  shapoorji pallonji biotech park
anyone else with an aerogarden its an automated hydroponic unit for basic stuff like basil and parsley sure its a bit overpriced but i enjoy mine quite a bit i bought it with the intent of growing interesting flowers from seed not herbs    from clockwise the right half is a jewel nasturtium that grew like a compact shrub extremely fast but due to the nature of nasturtiums and fertilizer it hasnt produced any blooms just sending out exponential foliage the roots are super crazy  then i have wild violas johnnyjumpup which grew slow at first with very small roots and i almost got rid of it but after a couple weeks rocketed in growth every day more flower buds rise up from the stems which are edible and the plants send off runners the stems when bruised or cut have a wintergreen smell and taste like the gum and green toothpaste  then i have 2 colors of phlox drummondii summer flame the flowers smell very strong and unique i want to grow an entire field of phlox this plant is awesome and theres so many buds of flowers popping up on the stems  then an experiment with an extra germinated nardello pepper same as a couple posts above which is an absolute monster and im going to let the first flowers fruit to purposely stunt the plant because its grown far too big too quick
  another of the phlox this shit smelt like some tangy candy or something
  repost because i trimmed it recently and it looks pretty sad right now
  looking good
  pepper bonsai  i didnt know it was even possible
  anythings possible with imagination most woody stemmed plants are suitable for bonsai
  check out fatalii bonchi on fb if youre interested  
anyone with silurian / devonian fossil plant knowledge mind identifying a couple of fossils
  
  they were selling little pepper plants in grocery stores here but they were just decoration strand not for eating and that made me sad
  second post best post
  thats the third post you toast
  i cannot count and you cannot make me learn how to count i will not be stopped
  you can eat all peppers its just that the decoration kind are usually all heat and no flavor
help me anons one of my nepenthes is growing weird    it skipped one leaf it never developed and the next one came all deformed    the last one seems to be growing normally but im scared of losing my lil boi    what could be the cause of this
    ey those look pretty neat    speaking of peppers im still collecting some but they mature so slowly now that i pick them a bit green and let them ripe inside the house
  cold maybe post a pic pls
  why wont my tomentosa turn brown at the edges
  opuntia tomentosa
  these things do a really bad job of oxygenating the root zone you can build your own for cheaper and it will be more effective
just bought a couple epidendrum stems would it be recommended to take cuttings of these stems or just pot the whole stem up there are roots in a few places of each stem so i think potting it up as it itll be able to root in from the base ive planted them in a pretty perlite heavy mix burying about 10cm of stem with some roots on them
  not enough light   also older leaves dont tend to change once they have grown so you will need to wait for new growth before you see any increase in brown edges  i bought one earlier this year that had almost no brown at all and actually looked really cool i thought it was a different variety  but since its grown on my sunny windowsill the new leaves all have brown tips
  thanks anon but it just aint wooly enough  i have an espostoa though and he is pretty wooly
  what varieties did you plant  tulips are great the parrot varieties are very interesting  in an old garden i planted drifts of tall white tulips with shorter black ones in front
  parrot  not that guy but i placed some of those last week lets see how theyll do
  good quality tulip bulbs are usually pretty reliable and easy to grow  but keeping them flowering year after year needs a warm sunny climate so in the uk for example and aside from a few varieties they only last for a year or two
  cleistocactus and monkey tail and rat tail cactus
  just that variety in special im in germany so just a bit more continental climatewise have regular tulips in the garden mostly full sun and theyve kept coming back for years  i think the most important thing is to not remove the foliage as soon as the flowers are done but waiting until it naturally turns yellow around june/july
  not just parrot varieties but most fancy hybrid tulips tend to be shortlived especially without a long hot summer  the most reliable tulips here in the uk tend to be the simpler varieties and unaltered species like tulipa sylvestris or t whittallii which will even selfseed
  yeah sylvestris has been naturalised here too for centuries you sometimes see them in vineyards around
    newsuccfag here again shud i get some growlights i cant hibernate and theyre not getting enough light up here in the north    any eu company/site i can order from customs and postal are being faggots for noneu packages
what are some easy beginner orchids  and wheres a good place to buy them you see phalaenopsis literally everywhere but i wouldnt trust supermarket plants as far as i could throw them
  calopogon tuberosus is easy if youve got a small bog pot you could put flytraps or sundew next to it if you got the space in the pot not hard if you have very clean water
  dont have experience with bog plants only just recently bought my first drosera  any recommendations for epiphyte orchids for newbies
  i only know a bit about terrestrial orchids the only epiphyte i know is phalaenopsis and another one thats a vine epiphytic and terrestrial vanilla i dont know if vanillas very easy to grow
  you might also want a look at epiphyte ferns like elkhorn ferns theyre quite interesting
  i wouldnt trust supermarket plants  thats a bit over the top imo  supermarkets and homeware stores often sell some very high quality plants  the trouble is that many of these stores dont look after the plants so once theyve been in store unsold for a few weeks they can look a bit sad  but if you see a plant at the store that looks nice and healthy there isnt any reason not to buy from there  one exception i would make is bonsai cheap readymade bonsai are invariably poor quality  but if you want a beginner orchid phalaenopsis is the way to go there is a reason its so popular
have any of you bought cheap seeds from aliexpress or similar stores have you managed to get anything to grow were the seeds what was promised did you have problems with customs     im somewhat tempted to buy cheap seeds in bulk and try to get them to grow
  its always celosia plumosa for some reason
should i do something with this kalanchoe
  looks healthy   trim it down by 50 or more if you want it to be bushier but wait until the spring as it needs all the leaves it has to last through the winter   you can also root the pieces you remove to get more plants
hello /an/onsitos my plant is sick _
  why is there a fern in your aloe  its all wrong
  no idea my cousin who moved recently gave it to me like that i live in a tropical place maybe is different here  can you explain me why is wrong
  thanks this is a north facing window btw so im a bit surprised  it started off as a tried out cutting cus i forgot it when i went on vacation for over 2 weeks a few years ago so its a hardy mofo
  aloe are desert plants ferns like moist forest floors  theyre obviously doing ok though the fern probably seeded itself there a few years ago
  give it more light if you can or it will keep growing elongated like that
  im about to do a really nice import order of neps from thailand amps bicals raffs hookeriana veitchii lots of sweet hybrids im excited to start planning my aquarium conversion to a lowland nep viv a lot of work but itll be incredible when complete
  to be honest most orchids are easy as fuck if you have half a brain just make sure its suited to your conditions most beginner orchids are things like cattleya phalaenopsis oncidium some dendrobiums i find bulbophyllums really easy too     where are you at what window do you want to put them in windowsill or terrarium what are the temperatures in your house whats the humidity    theres nothing wrong with supermarket plants other than them being boring really just look carefully at your prospective purchase make sure there are no signs of pests or disease any weird spots on leaves look at the roots if the pot is transparent for large majority of orchids they should be green or white anything that looks brown or mushy is rotten i actually had worse experience with buying plants online from good nurseries  couldnt take a look at them so they came with rotten roots disease smaller than i thought they would be or even mislabeled its easy to get a refund but still really disappointing best option would be to look for local orchidspecialized nurseries that you can visit but its really not necessary
    just got this growlight my mom had in the basement   think ill put it under the top consoles and get some small spotlights for the top shelf bois    what are some lowlight plants i can put in my northfacing window or should i just get another light for that window aswell
  sansevieria is ideal for a northwindowsill with lots of interesting species  if you have a bit more space that just a sill spathiphyllum aspidistra and monstera are both good for northfacing window areas  some orchids too like phalaenopsis as well as a lot of ferns but they might need some extra humidity
  this one is working pretty well for me  
  theyre not ideal they will merely survive
  i grew a bunch for years on a north facing windowsill and they grew very well but they will indeed do even better with some sunlight  anyway when i say ideal i mean for anon not ideal for the plant
hi beginner here does anyone know what plant this is supermarkets honestly suck at putting proper names for plants or details on care
  kalanchoe blossfeldiana
  those are a bit big for my windows but might work if i ever get benches was thinking something like this with a clip or one that i can hang in the window light a regular small window light      theres not much room on the north window sill and no room near it cus of kitchen furniture and room layout  sansevieria seems pretty cool how do they handle lack of water  already have a peace lily that i can barely keep the leaves standing on cus of my irregular watering  actually been thinking of getting a monstera but have to wait until i move around my furniture and make some space in my living room as a big floor piece and aspidistra would also do that nicely  do you think they would be ok with indirect maybe an hour or two of direct light from a southfacing window my living room is long and narrow with just one big south window
    guess ill get a phal then  maybe ill look at some flowershops id trust them more than bunnings or maybe i should just buy some cheap thing in case i kill it with my retardation
  get a big cfl bulb then i used these too in the beginning perfect for just a few plants  note the color codes
  sansevieria handles drought very well and grows well in bright light but tolerates shade well  aspidistra doesnt like too much direct sun especially if its midday sun other than that its a supertough plant
are moisture meters like this any useful id think so but i dont know shit theyre like 3 off aliexpress
  they are for idiots who cant tell the difference between wet and dry with their own senses
    also i have one just like that but for ph  its pretty innacurate though better off using the strips
  well its not really a case of whether you can tell the difference between dry or moist or not im just thinking its more convenient to stick that into the dirt than your finger and you can get it deeper in to the ground
  both the threeway meters that are floating around ebay/amazon these days and ph strips are pretty useless for testing soil the former because theyre super inaccurate to begin with the latter because ionic strength/concentration in soil extracts is usually very low so the effect that the chemicals in the strip have often outweighs it gotta invest in a dedicated digital ph meter with electrode theyre not that expensive bought one for 60 a few years ago and its usually just up to 005 off compared to buffer solutions which is accurate enough for soil testing
  i got one when i first started out i dont use it any more since once you have a watering schedule its pretty useless i mean for 3 theres no harm in getting one    its useful to check for soil drainage though sometimes the top feels dry but the bottom is soaking wet
  many thanks    also just put out the light looks a bit janky with the metal wires but its a very light fixture  hope this stops the bois in square pots from deteriorating more
  thank you 
whats a cute and small cactus i could grow on my windowsill
  when you grow plants for long enough you can see when they are thirsty without even needing to look at the soil
  its useful to check for soil drainage though sometimes the top feels dry but the bottom is soaking wet  clay pots
  id lower it
  was wondering about that ill need to find a better way to mount it
look at this shit horrific orchid abuse
  what even is that painton frost
  conditions  south american cacti are generally more fond of cold
  uk since it will be indoors i dont suppose the amount of rain will matter but the air is typically pretty humid here 92 right now    as for seasonal temperatures since were an island it can vary a lot and really depends on where the winds are blowing in from summer temperatures can creep over 30c during heatwaves lots of hot dry air being blown in from north africa etc but usually stay in the midhigh 20s otherwise in winter it can get a couple of degrees below 0 particularly at night time but most of the time temperatures are just slightly above 0c right now though just a few days from the beginning of winter its mild enough that im sitting here with my window open because were getting some warm southern air at the moment thats outdoor temperatures though indoors it will rarely get that cold because we have central heating though we have no air conditioning so it can get very hot indoors during the summer especially as our houses are designed to keep in the heat    actually out of curiosity is there any cactus which could survive outdoors in the uk i dont think heat would be a problem but it would need at least some resistance to sub0 temperatures and would definitely need to be able to tolerate temperatures of 12c for extended periods
  found this in some gardening store told them its retarded and they said the german supplier did it they also had cacti with hotglued fucking fake flowers ontop
  actually out of curiosity is there any cactus which could survive outdoors in the uk  ive seen a fair few prickly pears growing here on the south coast in peoples gardens of course not wild  also not cacti but i see a lot of agave here as well as loads of other tender plants  go just 50 miles inland and the winters are too harsh for them  but most cacti wont tolerate much below 10c
    this is typical of the shit that gets sold around christmas althought its getting worse every year  pic related these abominations have been sold for decades and i consider them to be the root of all evil
  im in a harsher climate poland and i have some opuntia howeyi fragilis furry variety of polyacantha and some noid ones escobaria and echinocereus viridiflorus last winter had some 20c weather and they all survived without any issues they need to be kept dry thoug mine are on an incline and covered with transparent plastic for winter i tried agave last year and it survived too but with some damage
  if you still only keep babbytier plants thats true
  what do you grow that requires such autistic watering
  but the air is typically pretty humid here 92 right now  keep in mind that this only goes for outdoors  if you take some 0c air with 100rh and heat it up to 20c itll only be 28rh of course in reality its a bit higher because of sweating/breathing cooking washing indoors but it can still be bad in winter for many tropical stuff usually not cactus though especially near a radiator
  its easy just check the potting mix out when you get it after the first bloom     if you really want a head start on growing it give it sun tea instead of tap water  dont believe them about the ice cube scam theyre trying to sell you orchids    it needs drainage and to go through cycles of wet then dry then wet then dry then wet     if you trim roots use sterilized scissors  use gloves for sphagnum moss if you are a wuss     water culture is awesome if you know what you are doing
      maybe stuff with dry season dieback or dormancy     though thats still noticable if you get a good relationship with the plant in question
  there are some cactus cultivars from the high mountains that can take 10 to 20 f temps but get killed by the damp wet of snow and freezing rain
  what a stupid post
  thats a great point anon although we often measure a plants hardiness in terms of temperature moisture is an equally important factor imo  case in point lavender is very common in temperate zones and quite hardy in freezing temperatures but its real weakness is moisture  the uk has very wet winters so regardless of the temperature which can vary from around 0c on the south to 20c in the north moisture is a much more important factor in considering which plants you will be able to grow outdoors  indeed many tropical plants thrive in our humid albeit mild summers
imagine sticking your dick in this plant haha
  bunny ears/opuntia microdasys
  they get huge pic related is mine i bought it about 3 years ago at home depot and it started off as a tiny little thing
  i agree only a fucking moron would make that post
  furthermore zones are a bit limited too i may be 8a here in western europe but the summers are really cool compared to a north texas 8a  thats mostly an issue for annuals though here for example watermelons only ripen well enough if you choose special cultivars and you usually have to prestart them indoors instead of direct sowing stuff like rice and peanuts you can forget about completely
      i genuinely dont understand the point of this  why would you buy this instead of a much cheaper plastic plant
  if you really want a head start on growing it give it sun tea instead of tap water  dont believe them about the ice cube scam theyre trying to sell you orchids  what the fuck did you even just say here
  because these ones are real buying them enables conservation of the species however this is not always true as a lot of the time the species are hunted and stolen from the wild breaking ecosystems and theyre real so they can reproduce and be resold its also like having something grow up
  and removal of a plant instead of taking its fruit from its natural habitat gives it a large chance of death and no reason to collect it in the first place
bamp
  looks like a strawberry
  australian strawberry with organic needles
  i wanna eat it
  because these ones are real buying them enables conservation of the species  what the fuck are you talking about an echeveria painted all over with fucking glitter is going to fucking die 100 of the time
can someone identify my new succs home depot names them as  left echeveria lime n chile  mid golden sedum  right graptopetalum murasaki  last time mine were not the same as the tag described so thats why i wanted to make sure
people with cats how do you keep them from eating your plants moving them out of reach isnt an option i read that misting the plants with water mixed with some lemon juice should do the trick any experiences
      while i was at home depot getting those succulent in the previous post i saw painted aloes and echevarias literally pastel painted like easter not even christmas
  surround them with cacti
  dont mist the plants because on certain succulents like echeveria it washes off their farina which is necessary for their health surround them with cacti or find some way to cat proof the area certain succulents like euphorbia can even be toxic to cats
  these arent succulents im talking about its a ficus plant which im already misting with water on a regular basis because i read online its something itll benefit from
  oops my bad in that case yes misting them with any kind of citrus juice will be fine diluted white vinegar works too but depending on the cat sometimes they ignore the citrus/vinegar entirely and will still eat what they can
    cats eating plants  is this really a thing my cat shows exactly zero interest in the plants in my house in something like 8 years of having her she has never tried to eat any of them
    theyre on sale right now on amazon and i am debating buying one
  the orchid would take serious experience to save as well i would give it a 95 chance of dying within a season
soon
  what are this looks like a lupin
  theyre accurate golden sedum could mean a number of species but yours is sedum nussbaumerianum    i have three cats and ive never had a problem with them eating any plants dont mist anything with lemon juice thats retarded and will damage your plants    echeveria painted all over with fucking glitter is going to fucking die 100 of the time    thats not actually true housewives on gardening forums buy these abominations to save them for some reason the plant just quickly puts out new growth to survive that phal is 100 dead though
    i have two cats and both of them like eating the leaves off my plants though one of them is more into eating them straight of the plant while the other one prefers eating dead leaves off the ground looking online it doesnt seem to be that uncommon of a problem with cats    dont mist anything with lemon juice thats retarded and will damage your plants  im not talking about spraying them with pure lemon juice but water mixed with a little lemon juice id assume a small amount of lemon juice wouldnt do any harm since rain water itself is slightly acidic anyway probably more so than tap water with a tiny bit of lemon juice in it    ill probably also try growing them some cat grass if they get to eat that theyll maybe be less interested in my plants theyre indoor cats so one reason why theyre after my plants could be that they dont have a chance to eat grass outside
  what are this  plant
anyone have any experiences selling plants id love to hear
  you guessed right im surprised not many plants have this arrangement of leaves i suppose
do all cacti have a hard time properly fucking rooting themselves into soil why are all of the containerized cacti i see at houses around me seem to be ready to fucking fall out if the wind picks up
  normies rotting their roots i presume    mine are rock hard
  how do they recover them
  assume  microbiologist here citric acid contains citrate which can act as a carbon source for fungi which can start an opportunistic infection there are also trace minerals in lemon juice which compounds the issue    rain water is acidic from inorganic acids and doesnt do that so if you want to spray your plant with an acid that wont cause rot you could use dilute seltzer water the carbonate is acidic
  cacti are essentialy water tanks they can survive months without roots they just grow new ones
  is there any way to expedite their root reestablishment
  you could unpot remove any dead roots repot in nice free draining soil and dust with rooting hormone or just fertilize with potassium and phosphorus also keep in mind that unless youre in the southern hemisphere your cacti should be dormant now
  if i want to fix the cactus right now could i pull it out of dormancy with grow lights how long can a plant go without dormancy
  so you have it in lower temps then its not dormant unless the temperatures are below 14c or so    unless you grow weed for a living you dont have lights strong enough to satisfy any cactus just leave it be until spring its going to be fine    they can go on forever without dormancy they will just get etiolated from low light and wont ever bloom
  not worth it its just a shitty cactus
  rude
i got this as a gift is it an echeveria blue star
  bullshit energy density in the modern day is huge back up your stupid points    its practice
  i saw one at the salvation army one day and they wanted like 15 for it which i thought was a fortune it seems kind of a gimmick but yours looks good i like the johnny jump up there is a guy near me that has them growing through all the bricks in his walkway they just seed out its pretty cool
  african violets do great if you have a african violet club near you then you can get some great ones streptocarpus are pretty cool and they do great there too those are harder to buy and mostly traded around
  this guy still uses strips and not a soil slurry sitting for 24 hours with a digital ph meter
  ive had problems but its very dependent on your cat and some plants have way more appeal than others google pet corrector it works and not just on cats just about any random animal in your yard will run in terror
  i like this plant
  energy density  sure drop 80 bucks on a lamp for your shit cactus and then more on your electricity bill if thats what youre into you could also make one yourself from cheap chink electronics if youre not a retard but why do all this shit if you can just wait 3 months instead and the cactus wont be any worse
  jus let it sleep for the winter dude dormancy is actually healthy and encourages flowering
another year another dormancy
  do pitcher plants go dormant what should i do mine is still growing but the traps are etiolated
  which ones sarrs and darlingtonia do neps dont if you dont provide them with dormancy they will struggle and then die within two years or so
someone tell me which tree in britland this is from
  i dont know the species but its about two years old now and i am worrying
  sambucus nigra
i have a question about two plants the first on is what type of plant is this saw it grwoing in the backyard
  second question is what type of flower is this i was inspecting one of the flowers and it had no leaves which i thought was odd
  take a picture
  well is it a tube or a leaf with a dangly bit at the end
  this kind
  a sarracenia hybrid yes they go dormant
  whats the procedure
  put it somewhere in low temperatures 512c would be alright if you live in a climate where temperatures dont stay below freezling for extended periods of time you can just leave them outside and keep the soil moist dont stand it in water
finally got around to buying a larger planter to free up some smaller pots im looking forward to see how there fill out
  i just bought two of these i live in zone 8a ive read that i can just leave them outside for my hardiness zone and they will naturally go dormant if thats true whats the best way to do so while keeping them from getting wind/nature damage its windy where i am
  thanks
  if thats true whats the best way to do so while keeping them from getting wind/nature damage its windy where i am  they die back almost completely to the roots save a few traps when they go dormant so thats no concern really    the wind doesnt matter anyway it some petioles get snapped because of it it will just adapt by growing stronger ones in future same thing happens with sunlight if you move one outside after being inside for a long time it may get sunburnt as a result but any leaves it grows in the future will be adapted to tolerate the strength of sunlight it now faces
i have a plant here and its the first plant i ever really tried to take care of i was given it by a friend now i am not really sure what i am doing wrong i open my curtain in my apartment when its sunny out to let it get some light but i live in a area that doesnt allow much direct sunlight to shine in    i actually dont even know what kind of plant this is or even if i am watering it right i have been watering it with tap water though which apparently may hurt plants also the pot its in doesnt have any drainage holes which is apparently bad i actually thought about it getting moldy in there and what not but does that happen     any beginning plant pointers would be nice thank you how often should i even water it i noticed that tips are turning brown
  is that a top dressing or gravel throughout
  thats all top dressing the soil itself is about half pumice half cactus soil mix
omg theres so many succfags here this is great this rarely happens     these are great choices    do your pots have drainage whats your lighting like they need a south facing window no matter what    family cactaceae including nonsucc cacti genus/genera pic related
  im surprised you didnt stick to 100 pumice imho it looks great and works best for succs
  those dying tips are from too much water most plants will just keep taking up water until their cells burst which leads to the dead tips and edges  take it out of that pot and put it in somethign with drainage you can just put it into a plastic pot and then place that inside your current pot thats the purpose of the nondraining pots to be decorative  water it sparingly maybe once a fortnight in summer once a month in winter dracaena are highly water hardy and can go months without water if needed tap water is fine unless you have really hard water in your city only specialist highly sensitive plants have real problems with soft tap water    overall a few spots is harmless as long as you address what is causing them youre not going to kill it that quickly just fix its conditions
  most plants will just keep taking up water until their cells burst which leads to the dead tips and edges  false
all my portulacaria afras started dropping a fuckton of leaves i have a couple so i tried watering them not watering them room temperature southern window sill room temperature under lights and cold basement with north windows theyre all acting the same any ideas last winter i put them under very strong lights and they recovered but this year i have lots of plants i care about more and no space there would they be fine leafless in that basement until spring or would they die
  specific flower club in a tinyass town in tinyass sweden  yeah doubt that      do your pots have drainage  yes  whats your lighting like  shit  they need a south facing window no matter what  it is    white woolyboi senecio flopped over i think he wont make it
  thats what you get for skipping the aloe test lad
    i put up this  grow light recently someone suggesting lowering it but i havent tried that yet cus i dont have any good way of attaching it      implying
  do you live somewhere very far north   i live in the south of england and while the amount of light my succs get in winter south facing windowsill isnt ideal they still manage to get by until the spring  they only get watered maybe once per month during this period as well  all this talk of grow lights seems very peculiar to me so i can only assume you live in the arctic or something
  i live in the middle of sweden and dont get many hours of daylight during winter
  how did he feed them his own piss without causing root burn i could understand with pitchers but how does it work with sundews
  feeding as in dropping some onto the leaf as if it were a fly not watering the soil with his pee
  where i live i dont have to worry too much about drainage or the weather all my succulents i have outside the only plants i have in pure pumice are my mesembs
    they are orbea variegata now not stapelia
  indeed but the illustration is from the 19th century
  hey burgers have you seen sarracenia in wild
  yes i know i just wanted to mention it in case the other anon wanted to look for one    also do you have more old illustrations of ascleps
newfag on carnivorous plants/plants in general can i keep common dionaea muscipula in a terrarium/aquarium 200 liters big aquarium setup with another species ex nepenthes thats maybe lowlandtype species that needs higher temp and moisture does flytrap suffer from the conditions or should i place it on another home/container/terra  i have not yet to decided what species im going to get and im just planning/researching about this  these plants have always been fascinating
    dionaea does not need nor enjoy high humidity and low air flow grow them the fuck outside    theyre temperate plants    if you want to grow tropicals nepenthes and droseras are your best choice but keep in mind neps will outgrow any terrarium in no time
  okay dude thank you for clearing that up
  if you want to set up a highland terrarium 20 c day 5 c at night you can try heliamphora they wont outgrow the terrarium and theres something charming about how primitive they are
  also do you have more old illustrations of ascleps  just this gem
  lol
    these are quite lovely plants     tbh im not sure if your plants are suffering from lack of light low light makes many plants stretch and grow out in an attempt to reach light your plants would be noodley and pale green the brown colours indicate its something else is that a top dressing or do you use gravel throughout your pot if its a top dressing then you should be aware that it inhibits evaporation of water and your soil below may still be moist lots of succulents require their soil or mediums to be extremely dry when they go into dormancy or they will get root rot
  its top dressing  drainage and moist should not be a problem because i use equal parts cacti mix leca perlite and pumice and theres a heating radiator below the window sill    i had the roots on my aloe rot before but theyre doing fine now with this soil mix    i cant make them go dormant because it never goes below 20c anywhere in my apartment
  also all the other bois are doing fine except the choco soldier and the lithop    heres the senecio
  and the rest
  also quite sure im not over watering them as i try to wait at least 2 weeks
      woolyboi looks like it rotted  im not over watering them as i try to wait at least 2 weeks  if i was watering my succs ever two weeks this time of year they would surely die  i dont really time between waterings i just give water when the plant looks thirsty   look for wrinkling of the leaves which usually starts with the older leaves and works its way up  if the plant looks fine dont water  this time of year my plants only get water once a month or so possibly even less  all said most of your plants look fine keep the watering to a minimum and just be patient until the spring  lastly as im typing this i cant help but think those glazed pots are part of the problem all of your other plants look fine its just those three in the square glazed pots do they have holes unglazed is ideal plastic and glazed are to be avoided especially if the bottom is also glazed
  i drilled holes in them the other panda kalanchoe is having a little same thing as the chocolate boi in clay but not not as much so i dont think its a problem with the pots    ur prob right about senecio rotting tho as i gave it a small drink cus it was wrinkling and then it flopped over even more
it is normal for a pinguicula to branch  i got one a few weeks ago my first carnivorous plant along with a drossera and since i got it the growth points have started to split and its got two growth points on the top of the rosette and a couple kind of pups forming from the base of the rosette  is this something that happens normally im not worried about it but ive never seen picture of clumping pinguiculas like this kind of hoped itd stay in that photogenic flat rosette form but i still like it like this its actually doing way better than i thought at eating my fungus gnats theres dozens on it  oh and that reminds me is it a good idea to periodically wash off the prey on the leaves im wondering if they arent adapted to occasional rainfall removing the husks from their leaves i dont mind the look of the gnats there it just shows the plant is doing its thing im just wondering if its recommended to leave all the dead insects on the plant forever
  i dont understand how people have trouble with succulents the only succs ive ever killed were small echeveria types that were too tiny to neglect and i left them alone in the hot glasshouse for weeks without remembering or the mealybug infestation that you ignore and it combines with the frost to kill them  how can you kill these things on a fucking windowsill
  because its fucking winter and we get like 3 hours of sunlight and half of them dont even reach above the fucking edge of my window    go fuck yourself faggot
    im going to guess that sweden isnt ideal for succs even indoors  i came across this article its an interesting read and might have some useful tips for your situation  
  i dont know the answer to your question but heres a comfy illustration for you
  nothing people here havent told me already    main problem i believe is lack of light which is why i got that light i noticed some of the shorter ones were stretching a bit and i think this will help prevent that aswell
  low light  warm temperatures is a tricky combo for plants that should be dormant  at least you will learn which specimens can tolerate it best its all experience
i got two cacti today not sure of the exact types since the labels dont say but the genus are eriocactus and mammillaria but ive never owned one before and im not sure what exactly to do about watering them    the label is quite vague in that it only uses pictures but i think it suggests watering about half as much in the winter as you do in summer though it doesnt tell you how much/often to water in summer so that isnt very helpful online ive seen one site saying dont water them at all in winter and another which makes no mention of winter and just recommends watering them somewhere in the region of once every 14 weeks    can anyone clarify what exactly i should be doing
  by the way they are in pots and being kept indoors in case that matters    speaking of which i bought these cacti because they were nice and small and could fit on my windowsill but they will stay small right theyre not going to suddenly become enormous monstrosities in a few years time are they because i have no idea where indoors i could put them if that happened and trying to keep them alive outdoors in the climate here seems like it would take a lot of work
need help  my cats are fucking up my shit when im not at home or asleep    i want to prevent them going to my things or walking around the kitchen    any effective catdeterrents you know of
i have found it easier to adjust my things away from my cats versus trying to get them to stop they wont like my cats wont stop fucking around with my shoes shoes go into a closed closet cats wont stay off a stack of books books go up on a shelf they cant get to  as for your kitchen  unless a room has a door to close youre not keeping a cat out
  ive seen cat repelents being sold or try to spray your stuff with lemon juice they shouldnt like that but idk i dont even own cat i just heard the lemon thing from friend
  google pet corrector
  go to dollar store and get plastic placemats and some doublesided tape put tape on top of mats and before you leave set mats on wherever you dont want cats to go cat freaks out when stuck and eventually learns to avoid counters or passing certain rooms
  lol that sounds hilarious gonna bamboozle my cats next time i get bored
ssscat on amazon
dont have cats  theyre trash
  anyone got good experiences with electrical mats

are crocodiles the scariest animals
  human
  damn you right
    grow the fuck up humans arent scary
  whales are fucking terrifying
  requesting the webm of that woman getting dragged down like 100ft by a whale
  
  fish are scary
  this
  humans are niggers
  theyre pretty up there
  that post has so much madeup shit in it christ pure larping
  from an animals point of view humans must be absolutely terrifying liek a force of nature
  killed more animals than any other animal in history
  more like niggers are nigggers
  i have nightmares about seeing a loved one snatched by a crocodile and being helpless as they are dragged into the murky depths glad to fuck my ma is in the og wales not the faggy new one
  deinosuchus sarcosuchus and other giant crocs long extinct could have been that smart
  nigga do you think i give a fuck what cows or other dumbshit animals think     mosquitoes are scarier than giant squid then right
  yes
squids are terrifying not only are they intelligent as hell they have small razors on their suckers which could do a lot of damage even if the animal isnt being malicious but squid are also aggressive and will not hesitate to fuck you up at least octopuses and cuttlefish are curious and friendly
  every time i see this i just cringe
  humans kill us more than crocodiles do
  there was a horror film about giant squid i saw as a kid that made me terrified of going near water i even used to imagine tentacles coming out the toilet
  flying machines that spin pieces of metal really fast above them to fly  other flying machines fashioned into interesting shapes that breath fire out of their asses to go so fast they make booms as they fly faster than any flying creature and leaves death and destruction in their wake  enormous metal boxes that can travel far faster than any horse and can blow down walls miles away without even having to ram into them  handheld devices that make loud popping noises and kill anything near or far going through any kind of armor  can call down explosive doom from unknown sources  can release odorless tasteless gasses that cause all your muscles to contract making you unable to breath and die extremely painfully  weapons that could literally vaporize entire cities around them and then making anyone who enters those areas for many years sick and have their skin fall off and puke out their insides or worse    face it animals aint got shit on us
  the beast that was a top tier b horror movie i loved it
  and crocodiles arent either if you are on solid ground since all their range of movement is lateral
  mosquitoes are scarier than giant squid then right  of course they are mosquitoes that carry diseases are easily encountered in many parts of the world while only a few people will ever get anywhere close to a giant squid in the wild
    god stop the underage fantasy there  animals dont give a fuck about us most of the time and even if they did they cannot come close to understanding our level of technology and power  fuck you all you childish cunts
  if you had to enter either a room with a mosquito or a room with a giant squid which would you choose  choose carefully your argument is on the line
  why are you scared of sharks they cant even walk
  to be fair on the other anon most animals have a general instinctive understanding that humans arent the best animal to mess around with if only because were largish animals ourselves and occasionally accompanied by fire and/or loud sticks that hurt you from afar the only animals that dont really give two shits about us are the handful that see us as viable prey without needing to be sick before hand crocs komodos the rare python/anaconda large enough to snag a small child or pygmy and the ones that live in areas where human interaction may never occur in their lives
  squid suction cups look like fucking shark mouths
  theyre the collest cuz theyre actually related to dinosaurs and look like dinosaurs unlike those shitty birds that look more like faggosaurs    crocodile uprising on land when
  they are up there
  they combine the fear of drowning with the fear of being eaten in a sleek timeless package
  not the dude youre replying to but id choose the room with the squid at least i could sleep at night without the fear of getting malarya
  no we must save the aminals
  mad cunt is mad
  people actually believe this bullshit crocs are fucking retarded reptiles are extremely low iq and do not have the capabilities to pull shit like this off they are also generally lazy
i dream about a salt water croc given massive wings borne aloft on hell powers
  based but bluepilled
  unlike dinoshits they survived with their dignity intact so id say theyre pretty up there
  crocs are fucking retarded  educate yourself
  black people are human too you racist prick
  
  crocodile  smart  stopped reading there
  they are excellent house guests in fact they were used as nanny reptiles in the 1900s
  i agree not all animal deaths are caused by crocs i mean lizards and turtles bite people too in fact turtles bite more people those croc attack statistics are biased its all about how they are treated
  animals  think
  reptiles are extremely low iq  monitor lizards are smarter than most mammals king cobras are also very intelligent from reports of animals trainers that work with them
  lol why did they stone it
  niggers
  tunisia  they prob tried to fuck it and it wouldnt let them so they stoned it for being gay
  is this shooped
  uhhh wait a minute my arm
  every reptile is retarded at feeding time
  it probably ate pork stupid crocodile infidel
  for fun probably like in chinks zoos
  all mammals are smarter than reptiles even a mouse is smarter than any lizard
  koala isnt
  if orcas did not treat us like gods and waged systematic war against us we would need to wipe them out
  those are blind
  varanids and king cobras specifically are considered smart although a vast majority of reptiles are absolutely retarded  crocodilians seem to be a bit more clever than was once assumed but not necessarily genius alligators in florida have some pretty unique behaviors and can be kind of ingenious with how they expand territory getting through fences peoples pools weird florida shit like that   all mammals are smarter than reptiles  this is in general true there are serious exceptions tho and i urge you to research the animals already stated also some mammals are really stupid     this is true koalas are beyond retardedly primitive
  this croc owners suck they abuse them and use them fo crocfighting
      you sound like one of those sub 80 iq retards that just learned about the internet and figured out how to use it you should probably stick to boards like /b/ or /s4s/
  getting this mad that his screencap of literal factless unproven hysteric garbage is being rightly called out for being dumb and worthless
  mad  nah just tired  factless unproven hysteric garbage  there is some truth to what was posted about crocs and false information being said but the posts calling all of it factless unproven garbage still makes them come off as stupid uneducated faggots plus the way they were written honestly look like posts that would come straight from a ravenous shitposter that contributes nothing to the board
  even a mouse is smarter than any lizard  no
  no
  mice are not smarter than water monitors nice bait though
damn a crocodile thread and no hippofag showed up to say how the fat sacks of shit kill crocs when theyre in a huge group the cowards
  bottom left  did he just rip off and eat his buddies arm what the fuck and the now 3 legged gator isnt even reacting
  look at this guy    many crocodiles lose their limbs to other crocodiles and some continue to live being apex predators like nothing had happened
  whould you choose a room with a giant squid or an infestation of mosquitos
  no butterfiles drink tears to absorb sodium
  indeed
  thuman
  ask me how i know you dont understand what iq is anon
  sperm whales can make your guts rupture if you swim too close to them when they vocalize at max volume
  your guts rupture if you swim too close to them  yeah i know all of those freedivers keep dying from exploding guts i dont know why freedivers keep going out there with them maybe think a little before you write stupid shit
  this is exactly what they want you to think you know
  no
  yeah for real me and my brother in law went to china and we decided to the zoo and it was basically like an exhibition of torture chambers with animals in them you would put money into a touch screen machine and for example we saw a chink select electrify floors and they would all laugh as the animals jumped around
  you go for a nightwalk through a pavement jungle than i can assure you your mortality rate would be much higher than camping next to a river full of crocodiles
  if you live in a shitty mutt city yes
  and what are you contributing just bumping the supposed thread full of retards
  i know chinks arent kind to animals but this sounds fake as fuck anon have you got any proof or even other examples
  more than you faggot
  butterfiles drink tears
  not since the days of the essex have sperm whales had the motive and opportunity to use their loudest hunting calls against humans whale hunters used to listen through the hull for these hunting calls to find whales and then travel for miles to locate them
sharks are kawaii  bullet ants are terryfying
  tunisia is still africa and tunisians are still niggers so yeah
confess your sins /an/ what is the worst youve done to your pets
i have a single rat  dogs are also social yet you rarely see people house more than one dog anyway  all several of my cousins had solo rats and they lived 34 years had no health issues never acted strange and still groomed themselves   all my classmates also had solo rats with no issue   only ever heard one case of a solo rat being sad and not grooming but his owner was also a 10 year old so it could of been more than one reason     i know its kind of morally questionable having solo rats but literally every single person in my homeland does this and you never hear solo rats act any different from rats who have cagemates they claim solo rats will have health issues due to stress of being solo but this has never happened in my or my cousins experiences besides i aim for feeder rats who already have been mistreated and usually are antisocial     inb4 predictable replies that go youre still cruel and selfish and evil like some communist   yeah i guess youre right wont even deny anyone saying this im kind of giving into indulgence and committing one of the 7 sins everyone does dirty selfish things throughout life at least once
  get a chicken  yes a chicken  try to find her some chicken friends  dont for like 2 months  eventually gfs family helps me buy some baby chicks  they keep em in their house until they get big enough to bring over  dont have a chicken coop but its summer so make a cage out of shelving stuff and plywood  give chickens a box to sleep in  they get bigger  animal control comes over to tell me i need to get a real coop  check on chickens  my favourite one died because they got too big for the box and she suffocated    f
when iwas10 i put a week old chicken in a barrel full of rain water to see if i could swim surprisingly it could swim quite wellbut got a nasty cold thankfully my grandma healed it by feeding ot tiny bits of aspirin along with really strong plum brandy from a pipette
  if it could swim
 me 12 years old   3 chicks as pets   them for 23 months   get very big and dont fit in the box   anymore   father gives away 2 and kills 1 to eat for dinner
  i would fast my dog once a week but i used to fast myself as well
when i was a teen i made a bad decision and decided to fuck dads dog i regretted it ever since but afterward she started hanging around me more she never really hung around me before since she liked my dad best she seemed to want my affection all the time and would lay on the floor next to my room when i was in there because i would keep my door closed my parents would laugh and comment on how much closer she had gotten to me which was really embarrassing considering what i had done i seriously didnt think a dog could act this way before anyway being so embarrassed about the whole thing i started avoiding her and stopped petting her i would stay all day in my room and sometimes she would scratch at the door and whimper before finally giving up eventually my dad ended up giving the dog away to my uncle when he was talking about getting a dog for his kids after that i didnt see her anymore so far as i know the dog ended up getting lost or running away because one of the fuckwit sons left their gate open none of us have seen the dog since
    hungarian
when i was 4 or 5 i threw our cat over the banister and onto the stairs he obviously landed on his feet but still dropped like 67 feet lel    one of the few times i actually got spanked as a kid 100 deserved
   youre still cruel and selfish and evil like some communist   implying communists confess to the crimes of their ideology
  worm farm  sounds interesting you got more on this
i push my dog out of my bed when it takes up too much space
  haha the dog fell in love with you after your one night stand
  as in one day a week without food very good for the dog as long as it isnt working particularly hard or recovering from illness or injury i bet that dog lived for a long time
  that alcohol could have killed the chicken it does not have a restorative effect your grandmother did not heal it it just happened to recover
i realized way too late that my cat got sick cancer
i choke my cat from time to time he just sits there quietly and takes it until i let go the urge is strong but i feel like shit every time afterwards whats wrong with me
  jesus maybe you should seek help beyond 4channel
  sometimes if i have too much to drink ill chase the sheep around up the hill and pin them for a while i just like to catch them and im not hurting them
was taking me old cat to the vet in the morning because he claws were getting so thick i wasnt sure how to cut the things without hurting her plus she was drinking lots of water and being really fussy about her food    i figure i should see if i can cut some of her mats out and comb her through before we go since she is getting to the point where she wasnt bothering to clean herself so i settle her down get her comfy go to snip off a fairly conservative part of one large mat she jumps out of nowhere and im there holding a clump of hair with a bit of cat at the end    didnt bleed was just this little circle of red where id snipped off maybe the first couple of layers of skin she didnt even seem to notice five god damn staples i felt like such a piece of shit this is all after i went months forgetting that she was supposed to be taking meds for her thyroid because issues at work i just was so tired i plum forgot about it    never felt like such a piece of shit in all my life
  have you ever thought about slipping it in when you catch one just the tip
  nah
  not milking them dry
be me  have 3 fat cats  one day one of them brought me a tiny bird  itsaliveexe  the bird had no wounds  i took the bird with me while my cat was angry as fuck  went to the wasteland near my house where my cat probably caught that bird  the tiny flies from my hand to the ground and run near a tree where its parents probably are  wild cat appears  wild cat is a feral cat that hates humans  caught the tiny bird and run away of me  mfw my cat probably fought against that cat to get that bird and give it to me  mfw i betrayed my cat    im sorry lulu
  you just need to get laid my dude  do you have aquaglide and differently sized buttplugs at hand how large is your cats butthole
  when it takes up too much space  does your dog vary a lot in size
  you monster  not for fucking the dog but for breaking her heart like that 
  t dogfucker
i once put my maltese terrier in a school bag zipped it up and put it in a drawer in my desk for about 30 seconds  i honestly dont know why
  when i was really little like 4 or 5 i thought it would be a good idea to teach my cat how to swim because of how hot it was  he wouldnt let me put him into the swimming pool so instead i put him into a cooler partially filled with water and closed the lid i thought he had realized the water wasnt bad because he stopped struggling but when i opened the lid he wasnt moving  i panicked and started shaking and thankfully he managed to regain consciousness and cough up the water  30 years later and even though hes been dead for a good 15ish years i still feel guilty for hurting him
  look into autoasphyxiation i think youll find it more rewarding then hurting an animal
  that dog is still alive he doesnt fast anymore my boomer parents think its cruel
  poured ghost shrimp on the lawn to make room for a sick fish to quarantine in their tank it was fucked and he didnt even make it anyway
a few years ago a girl stood me up we were meant to be meeting for a date at the park  i got mad about it and went to the pond where there were some ducks i was drunk so i took a picture of the girl on my phone and added some poop emojis then tried to strap it to the duck so it would fly the phone to her and humiliate her when it wouldnt do it i kicked it in the head
  tell us how it went down
  i have drowned a lot of snails  i know i am sorry i was trying to make them come out of their shell/trying to make them into fossils/    i also peed on earthworms as a kid    forgive me for my atrocities little ones    but i am still planning to genocide every disgusting lizard from this planet
bump
i fucked my dog for 2 years straight when i was 1416 i stopped one day because i was literally 5 seconds from getting caught
  fucking kill yourself degenerate scumbag
when i was   like 10 yrs old i used to detonate firecrackers in ants nest it was oddly satisfying
  no but im one of those up and down dieters
  when i was 3 i used to put the cat under a pillow and then jump on the pillow because it made a funny sound  i was a real asshole as a kid
  its cruel in the same way that making a human do a job he doesnt like for money is cruel it doesnt gratify the dog but has a positive epigenetic effect wolves were driven by occasional hunger
id open the fridge to pretend like im gonna give my cat something to eat then he runs over in delight meowing then i grab him and take him outside
    hah your meany
  thats nice of you to not want to genocide any lizards
  yeah youre mentally ill
  sometimes i dont walk the dog as much as i should
  repent of your sins and then commit suicide you monster
  i just thought i was doing our digestive systems a favor by not constantly clogging them
  do you think your cat is adorable are you a male you might just have cute aggression literally just your testosterone shooting through the roof in response to seeing an animal thats kawaii af i think of doing horrendous shit to cute and small animals all the time and it feels awful but i just giggle knowing that fact and also dont act on those urges
ive posted this story before but there was a gully near my house and a bunch of rocks bricks and concrete blocks lodged into the soil of the ravine walls there there was a coon cat that was there frequently i think he would catch fish we used to playfully throw stuff at him when we saw him but one day we took it too far and rolled a concrete block down the side of the gully toward him and just by luck of the draw it nailed him he didnt die right away and the way he was yelling legitimately sounded just like a human man we got scared and ran off he definitely died we never meant to take it that far but we had hit him with dirt clods and rocks before and never harmed him very much so i guess we just stopped considering the consequences

/bun/ bunny general  but with added guinea and pig
grainy pic of sleepy boi
big bune
  bugs easy on the carrots
  i had a guinea pig when i was a kid  had it for 6 or 7 days  kept it in the garage  gipsy woman saw me playing with it  she asked me if i eat them  i said ffuck no  asked me if i wanted to sell it  i said no  he got stolen that same night    
  guinea pigs are so adorably silly looking
full house
  i approve
  i can just imagine the soft warm weight of this fattie in my arms
tired boi
  hungry girl
  giant buns are best buns
  yes food
post pics of cute snuggle buns
im running an experiment when i offer a treat to my pigs will it take the larger one piece of fruit or veggie the smaller one or whichever is closer or random   they know they each get a piece if i give just one pig a treat the other wont try to steal it hell just reach towards me anxiously and wait for his piece so when i offer one pig two pieces of veg say two slices of pepper he knows he gets one and the other pig gets the other   what do you predict theyll do what would a dog do go for the bigger one
took bun to vet yesterday for checkup but thar stressed her and she hasnt eaten since before going around 24 hours now except small bits of hay but she is drinking and seemingly acting normally besides being pissed off for being taken to the vet in the first place should i go to vet again asap
  you can make a hay paste by putting it in a blender with water and force feed her easy way to do it is get a feeding syringe and just get it behind the incissors and push the paste into her mouth they cant spit it out so they swallow it that should hopefully get her appetite going again failing that yeah maybe have to go back to the vet theyll probably do the same thing   oh yeah a liquid b vitamin supplement can help b12 with b6 should make her feel better
  hay paste by putting it in a blender  theres a product oxbows critical care thats the same thing but better they put licorice vitamins and chemicals that make it mix better in pricey stuff but worth it if youre not doing it forever ive used it on my guinea pigs from time to time
bun just sliced my mouse cable 
tfw seen some shit
is there any off the shelf pinworm medication i can buy for my bun i know theres stuff for cats and dogs can i just use the cat one is it the same thing
does anyone else thank their bun    i know mine doesnt like cuddling but sometimes im sad and want to hold her i end up thanking her for putting up with it and not peeing on me    anyone else
i want one of these guys so much
  i read that those buns are a very good choice for the bunny jumping competitions
  not this but i do ask him about his day if ive been out of the house for a while usually he just wants to play or get more food though perhaps hell give me a full report someday
  my bun hates cuddling or any other physical contact so i just lay on the floor next to her and talk to her
whats the best stuffed bunny to buy for a sexually frustrated male bun
rate my newborn guinea pigs
have another picture of freshly made guinea rodents
  wheekwheek/10 would buy
  i love them anon so cute are you keeping or selling them
  hopefully keeping but depends on gender honestly
  night of the lepus
guinea pigs constantly getting expensive infections  house looks like a fucking barn if i dont vacuum every 20 minutes  cleaning their cage has become a chore i dread so much ive ended up instinctively procrastinating doing it  spending a shitload on new bedding every week  transporting it is also a bitch  impactions are now a common thing thanks to wood shavings getting stuck up there   dust everywhere  why did i fall for the wood shavings meme holy fuck this is hell on earth
  they like big butts
    use fleece with a newspaper base under it when ready to change you can hoover the fleece and then wash it works pretty well once a week change   just have a small area with fresh hay for them
say hi to donald
    donald is a qt you took some nice photos anon
    a bun to surpass metal gear
  damn that is horrible i am so sorry
im putting together a team
heres a picture of donald as a smol bun i have no idea how old he was in this picture but it was around the time when we just bought him
before
  after
  hes a big guy
  uuuu
is this a buns worst enemy
  wood shavings  carefresh paper bedding is pricier but will fix all these problems washable fleece like the other guy said is also a good option but needs attention every day post pic of pigs and pig pen
    two carrots
  new to guinea pigs but we have 3 males had them for 4ish months now and one of them is being very aggressive to the other two ive had to separate them multiple times because one of them is always trying to dominate one aggressively and purely fighting the other one    is it best to separate the very aggro one and try and re home him
  definetly
  gotta go fast
  have you had them neutered do you know roughly how old they are
  those sticks seem so addictive my family always gifts those to turtle bun for christmas he can devour them within a day lol
notarabbit
  ok
  im sorry anon gypsies need to be purged
  is he drawing blood if yes the seperate if hes neutered maybe try placing him with a girl    3 boars is generally not a good idea
whats a good place to take my bun so he can mate with another bunny i want him to mate without me having to deal with having my house filled with bunnies
post more giant buns
  i think it will take whichever is closer a dog would most likely take the bigger one but dogs vary in personality a lot so who knows
  11/10 they remind me of my two guinea pigs that i had when i was a kid
  pretty shiny one
    poor little anon  poor little pig
  depends on the size difference id guess if one is only slightly bigger than the other theyd probably go for the closest one otherwise the biggest   my bun always goes for the biggest piece of veg first even if its all his
bann
  thats a belgian hare
    mmore pplease
are there any good  useful /bun/ items on aliexpress etc stores
  stick
  he sure is a handsome fella
  he thanks ye
  you cant have 3 males together it never works you can only have two in a cage or an enclosure with 6 or more
anyone do cosplay with their guinea pigs or buns
how far have you gone in autism when optimizing the hay consumption for your buns
possums are where its at  
   turtle bun    being thankful for anything    why do you lie to us anon
  you got me
      super late reply but yea none of them are neutered 1 has drawn blood and ive figured we cant have 3  would the best thing to do is rehouse one or to even get another pig to sit with the other one    i dont want to have to get rid of one of the piggies so me and my m8 are find and build a bigger cage if we have to get another pig
my elder bun is deteriorating i am really starting to feel he is going to pass i am not ready he is so close to his birthday which i really hoped he would make
  i love ali but man it spooks me buying pet stuff on there never bought bunny stuff from there but i bought cat and dog stuff that didnt kill my animals i have tested the shit for lead and never had anything come up positive so theres that the us has no regulations for pet toys besides it cant be harmful to humans so chink shit cant be that much worse than what is sold here
  bigger cage  no you need two cages then you can have two pairs you cant have 3 together even in a big cage theyll always fight
tfw my piggies start bweeping every time i fap  y u do this
  close to his birthday  how old 
do guinea pigs and buns like each other
  they can tolerate each other but they shouldnt be housed together because of a bacteria which buns carry it is lethal to the piggies and if the bun decides to hump stomp or get aggressive the piggie it might die    me and my ex gf used to have buns  pigs we let the piggies roam free with the buns sometimes but mostly they lived in their own cages or pens
this is probably the place to ask what type of bunny is this
  turns out its a mini lion lop cute
  their concerned anon
donald bun has been rattling his cage very aggressively lately he doesnt show any signs of aggression when i play with him but usually the time hes not sleeping he keeps making a fuss he can even lift his play pens bars    why is he doing this it cant be hunger or thirst since he eats and drinks plenty is it boredom maybe he wants a girl bun to spend time with
how do i get my bun to go in the litterbox and not next to it
  my bunny would do this at the back gate when he wanted to come in the house to hang out i think your bun needs more attention kek
    buns are not meant to be caged he wants out make him a free roam bun if possible
  bun does not wish to be caged
  dont cage poor donald _    be me  wake at 4am  turn on tv for light  see pic related
    also looks a bit like a teddy widder
  everytime i come downstairs to get a drink or whatever at ungodly hours i see turtle bun looking at me from his shit corner its like thats all he does at night
      but hell poop and pee all over the place
  bunnies do their pee pee poo poo usually in the place where they eat i keep their toilet and the hay spot in the same area     he might mark the place a couple of times before he knows where not to pee pee poo poo with male buns neutering should also help on åeeing and pooing to unwanted places
  i dont want to neuter him at least not until a donald jr is born
  hell poop and pee all over the place  nno he wont      pee pee poo poo usually in the place where they eat  pringles bun dry food is under my bed and veggies are on the living room and she does her pee pee poo poo near the dishwasher in the kitchen
do you guys have instas for your buns also what is the best treat for a 78 months bun i gave her a slice of banana which she loved but then she shat all over the place so i dont do that anymore      is he named after a famous president
  banana contains a lot of sugar which messes up their intestines esp for young ones better start with easy stuff like herbs and start with fruits when she gets a bit older
  yes  ω 
  should have told your parents and they would have gotten the police involved thats fuckin bullshit ill break into your house if you still my pet
i just played the sound of an attacking eagle to stop the bun from entering the bedroom worked
  ill fucking end your bloodline if you steal my pet  ftfy
my bunny just die 
  based
  sorry anon what was she like
  age  _
would any of you recommend rabbits as pets ive been reading up on them a lot and im sort of unsure
    my sisters guinea pig she was called graciela
  they are quite easy to maintain you will mostly need a backyard with natural grass and buy them some lettuce potatoes apples and dont worry if they make caves
  and this
  cute do you have more of her
    thanks /an/on
  whats wrong with pellets as long as theyre all timothy grassbased contain no sugar alfalfa seeds etc and not given in huge quantities theres nothing wrong with them
  i wanna smooch that forehead
rabbits arent rodents
  just one pig  was called graciela  was
  get up at 2am  cant sleep go sit on couch  see something dart in front of me across the floor  wtf  turn on light  my guinea pig had hopped out of his cage and was running around the house hed never done that before he was eating the houseplants after that he jumped out all the time to eat houseplants he liked stonecrop mint oregano thyme parsley basil etc funny little guy
my good boi running around
  lionhead
  more like cute boi
is it true that unspayed female rabbits are at high risk of cancer or is it just memeing
  thats what the vet told me when i took my female french lop to be spayed its about 60 or more on unspayed females spaying also reduces the chances of the bun having a fake pregnancy
  no my gf saved one after easter i thought why not but slowly i was in charge of cleaning the cage buying food pellets changing the water etc it adds up dont get me wrong the thing is adorably fluffy and soft but you cant really pick up like a cat or dog or teach her tricks only get one if you dont change your mind easily and pivot into dogos        im very conflicted on this the vets are obviously in agreement because they profit from it but i dont want to mutilate an animal just so it behaves more docile otoh i obviously dont want it to get cancer either  i also heard letting her have her babies also reduces/eliminates the cancer risk probably that would preferable
  also is it better to have a surgery and remove its reproductive organs than to have a surgery and remove a tumor while not too late if that happens
why do you guys keep these animals as pets their meant to be free in the wild not being your amusement slave inside of the house
  either way its the same procedure its better to do it when the bun is as fit as possible though if the tumour makes her ill or if she suffers from other ailments at that point it has an impact on her chance to get through the surgery
  are you against pets in general or just rabbits
  the operation did not affect my buns behavior at all shes still the same stubborn alleater who dominates her bun bf
thinking bout gettin a coupla buns do you guys think theyre worth it i dont have any pets atm but i want some cute animals to play with and destress after work
    surgery and remove a tumor  if your bun gets a tumor you will only find out after he is dead  those little sons of bitches are experts in hiding health problems       animals to play  a bun is not the answer
  8 month old bun is going through a false pregnancy     wat do
  in hindsight i shouldve taken one of my brown buns
what type of bun is this cutie most rabbit related videos from japan are usually labeled as netherland dwarfs but videos from the us have them look so different  
  the ears and head makes it seem to be a netherland dwarf hard to say on that position
for the first time i am owning longhaired rabbits i thought my little guy was a huge chubby bunny but it turns out his winter coat immediately got entangled in his summer coat because he doesnt shed enough the top would look great but underneath was huge layer of tangles he finally got the layer down to just his new coat and it turns out he is half the size i thought he was if anyone can recommend me some good shedding tools that will be great
  false pregnancy  wat
  exhibiting signs and symptoms of a pregnancy but isnt actually pregnant ive heard of it before when studying for my medical license but never seen it take it to the vet or seek help somewhere you know that has animal help i dont think /an/ can help with that
is donald overweight he weighs about 3½ lbs
  what breed is he 34 pounds is in the upper range of healthy dwarf rabbit weight
  i was told he was simply a small rabbit not a dwarf    i have no idea what breed he is i tried asking around here but was met with no luck
      what is this color called
  its a broken black i believe      3 pounds is quite small especially if hes not really a dwarf some small breeds can even get to 5 pounds i wouldnt worry too much
  alright so just looking at him and comparing images of other breeds he might be a polish rabbit he looks very similar to pic related hes a cutie btw    the accepted weight a 6monthsorolder polish rabbit in the us is 2½ to 3½ pounds with the ideal weight being 2½ pounds  from wiki
  i was thinking he would be something along the lines of a miniature english spot
what kind of bun is on the left
  lop
  dwarf lop or a very young french lop
  the rabbit of caerbannog  hes got huuge sharp he can leap about uhh lookit the bones
so i plan on picking up a bun when i get back from vacation next month is it mandatory to get a bonded pair or if their solo and receive enough human attention will they be fine
  a cutie
  get a bonded pair they are much happier with a mate and when you leave your home they have someone to play with
should i go for air rifle or stun with a hammer / rod  what do you guys usually do  air rifle is easier for me and probably less stressful for the rabbit since i dont have to hold em    i also dont need the head afterwards
  why would you want to kill the cute bun just let it leave in peace    rabbits dont even taste good like chicken does
  its the reason i bought him i was open to changing my mind but he is not cuddly at all  he had his chance
  hahahahahahahahahaha    this is funny for some reason anon raabits are not food gosh darn it you cant kill nothing with an airsoft rifle either you gotta go with a live brine in a bathtub
  are you sure about that  and dont worry not an airsoft rifle a pellet gun for varmints etc
one of my buns is dating at a bunny shelter and i am so nervous that everything goes well his little lady is so cute i really hope he bring her home
  did he hit that yet
does anyone have 2 buns who are both affectionate and cuddly with you i got my 2 m and f about a year and a half ago as bonded adults and the male seems to genuinely enjoy my company but doesnt seek it out while the female seems to just tolerate me im ok with this honestly they have eachother and they most likely had rough childhoods being given as pets to neglectful kids plus i can go on weekend trips without feeling guilty about leaving an animal at home who depends on me for emotional well being im just wondering can you have multiple bunnies who are as bonded with you as they are with eachother
  wow looks just like mine except hes a lionhead mix thats all they told me when i got him with i guess whatever kind of bunny yours is
  mine does this sometimes she lives with a male who is neutered but they try to get it on all the time anyway when i got them i was told she was spayed but at a check up the vet said he thinks that was a lie as she has prominent breasts all mine does is makes a nest somewhere usually in the litter box out of her own fur paper torn up carpet whatever she has access to its kind of annoying but it isnt a big deal i just throw away her nesting materials and she usually doesnt build a new one this happens every 24 months for her and she doesnt seem too distressed when i get rid of her nest the biggest issue is she sometimes gets bald spots from pulling out too much fur for the neat
  i just heard they are moving in together there i can take them home soon
   long snugglebunster and round snugglebunster
smol bun
got some good quality buns in here i appreciate these posts
i have a rabbit shes about two years old  when she was very little she used to do the binking jumping like a retard out of joy thing all the time but now that shes a full grown adult she barely ever does sometimes at night when shes in her cage that she enters voluntarily shes free to roam the house all day until i go to bed she does something that resembles binking but its rare    how do i make her happier so shell bink all the time
  has she already a rabbit friend to bink with
  can these rabbits raise their ears or are they always flopped
  its possible that her personality had just changed not all rabbits like to binky
  they can only move them slightly forward or backward basically the ears are too heavy for their ear muscles to lift up iirc the top part of the ear is also too high which requires a lot more muscle power as well
  i meant too thick rather than high
lop ears  normal ears
god i love buns
im allergic to piggos  am i allergic to buns as well
  my bun also stopped to jump around like crazy after just a few years and to run around like crazy after just 5 now she just walks every were and rarely jumps to my bed    she only runs slightly when we are in different rooms and i call her    but that doesnt happen often since she is always following me
  are you certain that its the pigs and not the hay
stole the pic from another board    which boards does your bun/guinea piggy frequent other than /bun/ ofc
  ive found that my buns bink a lot less when its winter maybe because its too grim and frostbitten outside at spring/summer theres a lot more binkying around
  yes i have one and if i accidentally touch it i get all itchy  once it peed on me and i thought my skin was going to burn off    i mainly just feed it through the bars
  tfw its impossible to hold my rabbit like that  she does not like being on her back if i tried to do that with her shed start kicking and twisting and spazzing out
thread needs more guinea pigs
  buns arent supposed to be held on their backs anon they go through something called trancing and basically go through temporary paralysis and are in a state of terrified fear    
  thats the stupidest thing ive ever seen how are wild rabbits even alive
  my bun was the same way she became more of a loaf and less inclined to bink she still seems happy tho
rate my little fella
  yeah i know but they just look so cute on their back _
  how are wild rabbits even alive  by being permanently alert and terrified of everything around them and always ready to sprint away at the tiniest sign of potential danger
  hes a big guy
  wheres his buddy
you know before having a rabbit as a pet i never imagined they could be so cool and interesting but after two years with mine ive found she has a very defined personality and character and is more than just a cute ball of fur bunnies are p nice
i need some advice i have a guinea pig that just gave birth to 3 babies one of them is struggling and was born a bit deformed she has a club foot but other than that she seems healthy besides being smaller yesterday the mom didnt really accept her but i went out and got condensed goat milk and started feeding her a mix of that and water which i heated up to around body temp    she seems more active today and the mom seems to accept her more ive seen her nurse her now i just plan on supplementing what she gets from mom periodically like every 12 hours i like to check up on her ive been feeding her with an eye dropper but she doesnt seem to get eating solid food yet like the other ones anything else i should do its kind of cold outside too and their cage is down stairs but ive kept a blanket and have a heater by their cage
  sounds like youre doing good i dont know what else to tell you
this is christmas black and elizabeth potato say something nice about them
donald starts humping his rabbit plush doll  decided to take it away from him because it was bothering me  he runs in circles making grunt noises then proceeds to growl and thump his hind legs  put the doll in front of his play pen  he cant hump the doll thats in front of him and proceeds to thump multiple times    was i being too cruel
  christmas is big whats he weigh more pics
why are bunnies so cute
rate
  plooples
   his shit corner    his what
  amazing hairstyle lion lops are awesome
  the corner where he shits the toilet
  neuter him and get him a girlfriend that he can hump
  neuter the gf too females get stressed if the male is humping them more peaceful and less stressful for both of the buns
  why would he hump if hes neutered
  i had a a neutered male and an unneutered female the male did hump the female from time to time though it could have been just to show dominance or then it was a pheromone thing or something

  castrated men can get erections and have orgasms its probably the same for other animals dont let your guard down when your wife starts hanging around a castrated man
what kind of rabbit is trixie she is a rescue californian she has dense fur and very stubby little ears
  looks downsy
why are jumping spiders so different from other spiders 
theyre active predators most other spiders are ambush predators they go around searching for prey and need to catch it and they evolved huge front facing eyes to help them follow their prey and the ability to jump and catch it they have no need for building webs as well
  this also their eyesight is pretty incredible compared to most other spiders and they are supposed to be very intelligent
they cute
  if humans ever died out and somehow these guys grew brains would they function in a society well
  im inclined to think elephants or cephalopods would be better scions of civilization but a cute spider village is a dream come true
  they clearly pay attention to you when youre around the move in your direction look at you
  anelosimus eximus is a the species of spider i could see conquering the world as it creates giant colonies that work together of around 50000 spiders your idea of a spider village is already a reality my fren

my cat   pic related  somehow got a swollen shoulder/humerus area i noticed it yesterday it was softaf seemed to hurt if squeezed a bit harder woke up today  swelling is gone but now has a wound with a small hole about an apple seed size disinfected it  and she left to take a piss    what do 
  if its an outdoor cat or you have other cats in the house you might have an infected bite wound generally you need to take the animal to the vet to get the fur cleaned out from under the skin if its a bite or other type of puncture
  should i be worried  im at work right now so i cant take her to the vet immediately    thenks for the reply
  if its an infected bite wound it probably doesnt need immediate treatment just when you get time in the next couple days an infected bite isnt likely to kill her or heal up on its own in a couple days    i am not a vet though and i dont know whats wrong with your cat im just guessing based on the description i could be very wrong
  very well then  she shall go to the vet later today    thanks for the help 
  youre welcome good luck
how did you cope with your pets death     did you get another one to fill in the void 
  its been like five years since my doogo died      i dont want to be hurt again
did you get another one to fill in the void   yeah two weeks later that may not be a good idea for everyone though    grieving takes time a different amount for each person focus on the good times you had with your pet
id say its normal to get a new pet after a couple months you get very used to having one
  i lost my old dog 10 years ago by a car i suffered a lot for many years after his death and i still dont like to think about it  the dog i have now is 13 i feel like ill be able to live his death in a less traumatic way because hes so old and i will do everything to make sure he does of natural causes comfortably and painlessly  after him i wont get anymore dogs i will focus on taking care of wild birds insects and frogs instead
i did but i still have dreams about my favorite cat    it was a pretty horrible experience woke up to hear sobbing went out of my room and found my mother screamsobbing on the couch only time ive ever seen my mother cry like that shed seen ravens on the neighbors lawn during her morning jog walked over and found the cat her cat that shed had for 12 years in pieces strewn all over the lawn i cant get her words its not even a cat anymore strangledsobbed out of my head even today    i offered to pick up the pieces even though i was very young because i hated seeing my mom this upset but she refused and did it herself i cant even imagine what that must have been like    i had a lot of dreams about her after that not nightmares just dreams and she would just sort of be there sometimes shell still pop up every so often but its been much less since my new cat
  almost the same story here  i keep remembering her and are currently in a situation where i could not deal well with another loss so i didnt have one after her
op here    my male pekingese has ivdd and the symptoms have reached a critical point he pants and cries for the last 3 days currently hes on medication and painkillers hes 12 years old and thats pretty much the endgame my family is telling me to put him down mostly because of the cost of the surgery which is the last option but im the only one who cannot decide which course of action would be the best there is a chance hell be better after the surgery but only god knows what postsurgery consequences could be plus hes old the hardest choices require the strongest wills i suppose
  jesus
i didnt want to own a cat ever again after mine died when we were both 20 8 months ago however a pregnant stray blessed us with 3 kittens we put one into loving hands and kept the remaining two you have no idea how much joy and life those little rascals bring into my house theyre sleeping on the floor beside my bed right now
  let your cat outside to get killed by other people or wild animals  but hey atleast she had a good free live and it makes u pfor her being brutally killed and dismembered
  i cant mak that decision for you anon but what i always think about is the fact that unfortunately the animal might not understand whats happening
  i think its best to say bye give him his favorite treats for me if hes still interested
i studied hermeticism and it states that you live and you die the dying part is branching into another world which we as humans barely understand     the another world turns and turns and eventually comes back to our world    the world is like ours it is ever changing and it does interact with us  while you are alive you can interact with it    i say that our physical world is the most refined version of these energies it filters through these planes and everything is formed on our planet     one of my goals in humanity is to explore this while im alive and map it out and get people to understand it i wish the map could be much how we do with the world today       2 glimpses of this is right here      in theosophy and anthroposophy the akashic records are a compendium of all human events thoughts words emotions and intent ever to have occurred in the past present or future they are believed by theosophists to be encoded in a nonphysical plane of existence known as the etheric plane           
  im sorry anon
  i love this story thanks for sharing
    my cat was my best childhood friend knew her from birth we got her from a neighbour whose cat had kittens and got spayed after everything was fine for 8 years typical suburb life with our and our neighbours cats congregating in our garden every now and then    until one day in august 2008 they all vanished just gone we consulted the local vet and he said someone probably laid out traps or poison unfortunately since there are pensioners and boomers living all around us it could have been anyone so my pain simply manifested in hatred for anyone i dont know well enough that i can be certain theyd never go pethunting a few months later there were also strangled cats found from a different part of town dumped at a nearby lake one of them id also known from childhood age    targetting those two groups specifically because so far whenever a petpoisoner has been in the news it was a 60 aged dude
      think about the new memories you can make with a new companion you can adopt from a shelter to make someones life a little brighter
i euthanized my cat on monday night after he was diagnosed with ckd and given a prognosis of 24 weeks if left untreated on monday his cre was 39 mg/dl and his bun was 1071 mg/dl his test results had been nominal 5 months earlier i was told on monday that hed lost half his blood volume they estimated his kidney function at less than 7    the vet offered treatment involving daily subq injections of fluid iron and erythropoietin but they couldnt judge what its efficacy would be or how long it would prolong his life for because of his rapid decline they werent optimistic about either efficacy or longevity they told me that if treatment were effective his time remaining in good health would be measured in months at most     if treatment failed there would have been a window of only a few days between the end of treatment and his grimmest prognosis he had a sensitive temperament and was distressed even by getting pilled i didnt want to torture him with injections only for him to experience the beginning of dying    im wracked with guilt i feel i should have given him every chance but i didnt want him to suffer my heart is broken
what is up with all these euthanasia and death threads here all of a sudden sorry for your loss op hope you feel better soon
why are gibbons the best apes
  fantastic acrobatics
  i am the best ape though
  what big arms you have
  because of all the apes theyre least similar to black people
  this   humans used to be narcissistic enough to believe they were our closest relatives
for me its  orangatans  gibbons  muhkaks not looking up the spelling  gorillas are cool too    baboons/mandrills need gassed though
theyre not but the monogamy thing is cool tho
  baboons arent apes theyre monkeys old world monkeys to be more exact
there is a squirrel living in my attic theres a hole on the roof and it seems to have entered through the drywall and now is making a little nest or something it cant be a rat because we have 3 cats and havent had a rat or mice issue in years i suspect the rodents can smell cat my parents want to kill the squirrel or throw it out into the cold but i fear the squirrel has no other hibernation prospects and may die in the cold any advice
  happened to me and drowned in my toilet one morning scared the hell out of me solved the problem though
  i had a squirrel family in my roof get a one way trap and theyll be fine it will leave and not be able to get back in iirc squirrels cache their food so it should have its food out there      happened to me too i was not expecting a waterlogged squirrel corpse soon so maybe also consider that op youll run a risk that theyre going to get killed by your cats/drown when it inevitably starts foraging in your house
hi /an/ which is your favourite megafauna animal post names and cool representation
im getting a lot of enjoyment from lisowicia
  beautiful
  ya shame well never get to see a living one or any dicynodont for that matter
  bbut clonation process wwill
  favourite megafauna animal    ur mom lmao
  itll be a cold day in hell before we find dicynodont dna and even more remotely to find a suitable animal to be a surrogate for the rest of the clonation process
  and with with species would be easier
  probably a type of monotreme but even thats like trying to clone a crocodile using a bird surrogate it simply wouldnt work
i guess i just like the classic american pleistocene ones like mastodons and ground sloths its nuts to think that the 5 foot browse line that deer leave in ther woods around here would have been more like 12 feet in the days of mastodons and then theres all the stillextant tree species i see that are relict from megafauna like honeylocust osage orange and kentucky coffee tree i got to think they loved munching black walnut and american chestnut rip too    and then theres also the paleohunter element the big stone clovis points needed to take down those beasts just cool cool times to imagine
  im goign to hijack your thread here sorry    all powerful aliens show up and will play a reality tv show very much akin to alone with you youll be sent back in time 25000 year in the very area you are in now they will take care you are not dropped in a glacier or in the sea though you can take 10 items with you if you do not actually own these items they will be provided for you you have to be able to carry these items on your person so bringing a car or tank is out clothes worn on your body do not count towards the items so dress warm if you want to bring a gun the gun and if applicable 3 magazines count as one item 100 rounds of ammo also count as one item your mission is to survive for 365 days if you do you will be transported back to your time and will be rewarded 15 million us    what do you bring what do you do
  this is an excellent creature    i find it very odd however that it looks so much like a triceratopsfamily but is a mammal
  its a dicynodont from the triassic its related to mammals but lived a while before true mammals appeared its likeness to triceratops is convergent evolution at work
  it seems too convergent maybe its the beak but beak  pseudoheadplates is just too much like a ceratopsid    it feels like what a 10 year old would draw if you asked him what the step between a triceratops and a elephant looked like    im saying it makes me suspicious maybe this is the stumble bigpaleo makes to reveal dinosaurs arent real
  reddit spacing  too convergent  big paleo  i dont know why i do this to myself but here we go  youre misinterpreting the artists reconstruction who was going for a ceratopsine/elephantine aethstetic to help represent what niche lisowicia heldlarge lowbrowser heres the skeletal reconstruction of lisowicia as you can probably tell it doesnt quite have pseudoheadplates as you described but rather extended parietal bones to form more muscle attachments for uprooting plants as for the beak and tusks those are features that have defined this groupdicynodonts since their classification   additionally there are other examples of too convergent unrelated animals in the nearmodern day ie thylacines  canines hedgehogs  tenrecs sharks/dolphins/icthyosaurs moles  notoryctid mice and antechinus  point im making is niche/environment defines animals more than youre giving credit additionally lisowicia itself looks relatively unchanged from other dicynodonts other than a few select modifications that make it better suited to be a large lowbrowser
extant megafauna coming thru
  the head looks very different from the skeletal side view and the artistic front the beak still throws me though i think maybe im not thinking of it but i cant think of any mammals living or extinct have something like that the skeletons are clearly different animals but the artist interpretation makes it look like a mammalian ceratops    i get as much as a layman can how convergent evolution due to environment is important generally though mammals and dinosaurs look substantially different we have no mammals who look like therapods for instance this looks so close in the artistic presentation of it it is very surprising again maybe its just the beak    spoilersorry i just watched a video mocking antiscience people talking about bigpaleo making up dinosaurs to get the superdinosaur bucks i just came too clearly to mind/spoiler
  ayo hol up
  still reddit spacing  i cant think of any mammals living or extinct have something like thattusked beak  thats because this group does not belong to mammalia theyre distantly related by both being therapsids but the likeness ends there  the skeletons are clearly different animals  pic related is a better fossil reconstruction what you see in white are recovered lisowicia remains and in gray are scaled up placeriasa closely related animal which we have near complete specimens of fossil reconstructions no other animals were used for the reconstruction   generally though mammals and dinosaurs look substantially different we have no mammals who look like therapods for instance  its important to see that this is not a mammal and even less so a dinosaur its easy to see large reptilelike herbivore with a beak and spikestusks in this case and reconcile it with the far more popular ceratopsians people are prewired to make connections like that i get it however on closer analysis the pelvic bones arent ornithischian or even dinosaurian at all rather it loosely resembles more that of modern mammals than it does to anything of archosaurian descent additionally this group of animals has more toes than any ceratopsian and fewer temporal fenestrae ill agree that the artist in the first picture interpreted an elephantine/ceratopsid style of reconstruction but in reality it would have traits only superficially similar to either one
  thats because this group does not belong to mammalia theyre distantly related by both being therapsids but the likeness ends there  ahhhh now this i think it a source of much of my confusion i was under the impression from the article i saw that this was supposed to be a mammal albeit a super early one looking at the theapsids i can clearly see the similarities there and this whole thing makes much more sense    i was entirely unfamiliar with this group of critters so got to learn something new today thanks
  any time friend
  i like this idea a lot anon but this is definitely more for /out/ or even /b/
post more modern animals
for me its the yidosaurus
  if those were still around wed all be speaking carthaginian
  jewe
  oh he comin
  were there any herptiles in the megafauna
  megalania quinkana purusaurus titanoboa saltwater crocodile to name a few in the cenozoic
  always paracer they were friendly giants like elephants probably were quite clever as well
  just absolute madness what are you doing evolution
  i mean salties and nile crocs easily qualify american alligators too
  better than elephants rhinos are sweeter than elephants
  the boars from princess mononoke were real all along    damn nature you scary
  in prehistory ever heard of dinosaurs    as for extant animals we still have the komodo dragon 9001000 kg saltwater crocodiles and leatherback sea turtles and constrictor sneks m8          amphibians current and old arent as big    
    the megafauna is currently dominated by mammals because the dinosaur era is over the most obvious example of this is the blue whale which is the biggest animal to ever live
  the dinosaur era is over    5000 species of mammal alive today  10000 species of dinosaur alive today
  by that logic were currently living in the era of beetles
  sick
    first and last kek of the day
  there still are
  these weirdos    were still not sure where they belong phylogenetically i like the theory that theyre early relatives to the common ancestors of elephants and manatees
is there a single land animal a group of 510 cromagnon hunters wouldnt be able to take down
  t rex
burger with ar15
  bait into pit and fill with spears  next      this is correct though with how far detached modern humans are from natural selection they might be able to go up all rambo on him depending on the environment
who here veg/an/ for the animals
  i used to be vegetarian it turned out i have fructose malabsorbtion and im a fullblown meatard now other than that im greenpilled
i went to a farm that my dad keeps his horse at    they have stalls with all the cows a simple set up where they have a trough and a bunch of mud and shit to walk around and sleep in    they live there all the time they are terrified of human contact they just piss and shit all over and walk in it and thats their entire life    i told myself if it meant i could save all the cows there and have them live in a field i would become vegan on the spot but it doesnt it wouldnt make a damn difference if i became a vegan    now i avoid meet though fish is ok fish dont have feelings
this was supposed to be a chill day off but now i have to go to the store and buy spite ham to post because a fucking vegan nigger made another thread
  enjoy cancer
  eat meat  get cancer    be vegan  be cancer    tough choice
  im not vegan faggot fish is the meat most likely to give you cancer ill just enjoy my pork and beef
  if i ever go vegan it will be for myself desu
  fish is the meat most likely to give you cancer  way to generalize a broad topic retard that is the equivalent to say eating any meat regardless of its source cruelty  wild fish from clean water is best easiest to digest fat rich protein you can get just stay away from nasty fish farmed in brazil thailand or other shitholes with no health codes even tuna and swordfish are safe for pregnant women if sourced from the pacific
  moms gonna respect the animals
  i would be a vegan but im just a dumb fucking animal im no better than a snake or an ottereating clams and mice and such if only i was powerful enough to go against my nature i would
  laffed like a motherfucker
do you realize that the current vegan trend was cooked up by a thinktank looking 30 to 50 years into the future realizing that animal farming will be no longer sustainable  they gave it overtones of moral superiority and hipness    the top 1 will never give up their steak but animal flesh is just becoming a luxury for the rest of us  it already is in a way since the stuff you buy in the supermarket nowadays is garbage filled up with chemicals  look at the prices of fully organically farmed beef and youll see    vegan food is and will be a blend of cheaply farmed produce chemicals and industrial processes to maybe resemble the real thing    my issue is not strictly speaking with veganism itself but with the forces that orchestrate for better or for worse    interested parties can check out the movie snowpiercer
  lab grown meat might become a viable alternative sometime in the future
  whats the point of preserving the environment when politicians in the west are flooding every civilized country with sub 85 iq muslims and africans who are just going to trash it all a couple generations down    and i mean this seriously id like humans to live in harmony with the earth but it seems unlikely
  animal farming will be no longer sustainable  he doesnt know what fish farms or bug farms are
  wouldnt it be better if you provided real evidence for your conspiracy theory rather than referring people to an action movie
fuck vegans  i can not live without the amazing taste of death    its the aftertaste of meat that you cant describe   the most appropriate term for this would be umami    i would agree to stop eating animals if i would get human flesh in exchange and dont have to fear legal consequences  veganism is a first world problem   there are much more important problems than the environment   for example  islam
  people who are one lawchange away from cannibalism are the problem
i have often considered it but my diet is shit and i am a picky eater  i mostly eat meat and love dairy so i think i would probably die  also i have shit teeth  they look nice and white because i look after them well and visit the dentist often but i was born with weak enamel and vegans tend to lose teeth due to shit diet    i am warming up the idea of cutting out farm meat and supplementing my diet with hunting and fishing  i think we eat way more meat than we should cutting down to a few times a month could work  i would feel bad about killing animals but they probably have better lives than farm animals  deer in ireland have no natural predator so they need to be culled  could be a good hobby get me out of the house more and i could learn how to butcher a deer
  eventually transitioned to reduce my carbon footprint outside of extremes like factory farms i dont really care for animal for instance im totally fine with people hunting for their own food
  lost hard at that comic
  the artists website is stonetosscom  hes pretty /pol/ though
i really like vegans but then theres  pic related
  i am a dumb i forgoted the pic related here is pic relatted
  no i love animals but i will not cuck my own species for them im not going to become malnourished for them
  better for the environment doesnt really translate to better for animals it just means the ecosystem gets changed less death is part of life for all animals especially for the ones that were literally bred specifically to be food
  as if thats a downside  get yourself together
  to soothe the carnivores within and around you  this is eerily analogous to when a gay man marries a woman  you cant fake the gay away and you cant fake the carnivore away
i am an animal i unironically believe i have the spirit of a predatory beast always have dreams about being nonhuman and escaping into the wilderness away from civilisation i enjoy hunting and harvesting my own meat from pest animals on public conservation land     i am okay with killing other animals for my own nourishment and pleasure i am comfortable with this reality however i am not supportive of overly cruel meat farming practices happy meat is tasty and healthy meat     i would only go vegan if i wasnt so spiritually connected to my predatory side yes i know it is selfish i serve my own interests no i am not interested in serving some sort of moral greater good
  high trophic level fish farms are not sustainable you need to feed these fish a shit ton of other fish or meats to produce food a waste of resources for a luxury product eg salmon trout
  do you realize that the current vegan trend was cooked up by a thinktank  veganism/vegetarianism has been present in various historic societies for years
  heres your predatory weapon to get you started bro 
  trolleys could probably be used for trapping in some way
  no goy just keep using the trolley to buy all your meat in grocery stores like a true predator 
  are you aware you can have a vegan diet with very little or no fructose
  fish have nociceptors meaning they can feel pain
  you arent spiting vegans by doing that only animals animal abuser
  cringe
  source that a vegan diet by definition dont show 1 example of something harder to get as a vegan if it is possible to get then your claim is wrong malnourishes you
  jared leto  at least use a better celebrity if youre going to use one
  if the environment is being fucked up that harms animals causes suffering death is part of life for humans too doesnt mean we should slaughter them if i bred jews for food it wouldnt be ok to kill them terrible arguments all around
i may have to take up eating vegans you know for the environment
  no
  plants react to external stimuli and trauma as well you should stop eating those now too
  plants dont have central nervous systems brains or nociceptors they are intelligent not sentient calculators are also intelligent not sentient great original well thought out argument though i havent heard that one before
  feeling and suffering from pain is different from nociception an animal will not feel the nociception if they do not have self awareness
  bringing jews and murder into the equation is not a good argument for me to stop hunting feral goats to eat them
but ciows benefit from the fact we eat them or they would all be extinct now  be cow  get pastureland and protection from the meat you yield  grow up to be a delicious meat cow  other animals in the wild grow and harvest food as well shrimps will grow sea stars seriously though where does the line between whats okay and not okay to eat if i eat a jellyfish would that honestly upset somebody
look up the cambridge declaration on consciousness fish have nociceptors brains and a nervous system we should assume that they are sentient just as we assume that other people are sentient as they have the biological requirements to feel pain
  it wasnt an argument just a way to show your lack of arguments
you do realize being a vegan is also destructive to the environment land for agriculture doesnt just form in space we have to actually destroy natural habitats you brainlet
  grow up   cows for meat are slaughtered at only 18 months they live for 1520 years naturally id hardly call that growing up the line is at sentience jellyfish lack the biological requirements for sentience
  what do we feed cows
  this  agriculture in general is pretty fucking terrible for the environment permaculture is really the only method that you wont do crazy amounts of harm to the environment i just started a permaculture no dog no till garden last year im hoping to get it big enough to be almost self sufficient in food
  theyre herbivorous however i dont get what point youre trying to make by pointing this out  be vegan   think youre so self righteous and environmentally helpful  fail to realize youre just as guilty as the rest of humanity for destruction of the environment like the absolute mong you are
  if done right with proper field rotation cows can sustain themselves off of the weeds and grasses that grow where they roam they are pretty great at bringing back desert and making it flourish again just by grazing its the large scale farms that are completely shit with shit conditions for the cows
  you feed them plants that require room to grow leading to habitat loss and environmental damage no matter how you look at it veganism is better for the environment vegans dont claim to cause 0 environmental damage we claim to do our best to reduce it
  they still grow up 18 months as opposed to not existing at all
  if you only eat grass fed beef the methane produced is still not great it is infinitely better from an environmental standpoint but still unethical
  what are grassfed cows
  cows should go extinct kill them all
  fucking moron
  oh also we dont think we are self righteous the fact that you wrote it that way proves youre a dumbshit what you meant to say is that vegans are self righteous we think we arent go look up the definition
  grass fed beef the con system required 563 of the animals 248 of the water 553 of the land and 714 of the fossil fuel energy required to produce 10  109 kg of beef compared to the gfd system   in other words grass fed is just as terrible for the environment as conventional if not worse also  implying you eat only grass fed beef  also also look up grass fed vs grass finished grass fed is 100 a meme
  someone is upset you would only be upset if you were actually self righteous and you are having difficulty coming to terms with that fact
  retard alert
  what are countries other than the united states
  they used models in that study are you implying other countries somehow magically feed the cows less water and require less land and produce less carbon emissions if so how the only change between usa and other countries would be that the us conventional system is probably more efficient hell their grass fed cows are also probably more efficient
  i do get upset at animal abusing retards yes youre on /an/ this shouldnt surprise you
  breeding jews for food   blacks taste better desu
  your brain is somewhere else you dont know what you are arguing against someone makes a statement and you argue against what you believe they are saying your belief being wrongon your topic though you are right models are never wrong and are always applicable to reality we should kill all of the cows     take a break from the internet champ
  dont waste your time on him anon why run after the short bus to argue with retards when you can hang out win greenpilled people

he didnt post the webm
  what webm
  good boy
  dank as fuck tbqh senpai desu
  happy fish
  he needs a tank that large
  yeah bettas by far need the most tank space for their size
  you dont
    have you seen how big an adult betta can get
  i havent owned once since i was a child so i wouldnt know
  he fell for the bait
  dscordniggers are back and posting new threads before they are even finished shitposting the old thread to death    fuck this gay earth
  pic rel    also what the fuck is pic related  
  absolute unit
  thats a big betta
  4u
  i want to know what the frig that thing is
  electric catfish
  manatee larva
  a potato
  more pellets
hehehehe he angery 3
  corey is fat has fucked up teeth and hes making money at the cost of losing his mental health
  underwater catloaf
  hes supporting chinese companies that maximize his profit rather than a quality product i like how he loaded his 800 with those shitty blood parrots and took out the live plants
  that fact that you have to ask means you are a shit person and should get rid of your pets to someone who ill take care of them properly if you cant afford or take care of a tank that big for your beta you should have any
  bröther i cant möve please bring me pellets
    what kind of fish is this
  anyone who supports saltwater also supports transgenders
  he basically said exactly the same things in his last live stream he knows
who wants to see somethingsthat ive done recently its been a while and i have plenty to share
  lets see it
do i have ghost shrimp or grass shrimp
  dont bettas hate that much surface movement
  blonde naso tang
  nice
  ghost shrimp
are kuhli a bad choice
    get a bichir instead
  why should i
have you guys ever seen fish pair up spawn and then divorce   my kribs paired up and ive got like 30 fry but mom and dad wont stop fighting  this started after i did a water change
  yes
  damn i took out the male because she would terrorize him is there anything i can do or is he just a bachelor now i dont want to put in another female
    is there a lot of coverage pots stuff to hide in
  not many
  stfu imposter    its heavily planted but sometimes she wanders into him and picks a fight there is one small hide where they laid eggs
  what the fuck is that thing
its a 20 dollar subinch coral frag episode  premium overnight shipping  itll be in quarantine for another week though   dont forget your corals food goy  oy vey no taxes what is this another shoah 11  grand total its 98 bucks you moronic reefer    i just wanted some coralline algae /aq/ hug me
  sorry fren
  i just wanted some coralline algae /aq/ hug me  doesnt know thats what snails and hermits are for
  just buy some shellfish snails or cleaners bro  nah man the display tank cant handle any more theyll starve if it had a purple/pink splotch i already bought it    heres last months attempt though   so visit older fish store that i never visit  no longer sells any corals  no big deal right  eye their selection of inverts  theyre supringly overpriced okay  old mans prices are surprisingly weird healthy 5060 dollar fish go for 25 the fuck  the old man must be going senile  notice they have a display of beautiful purple crusted live rock  walkthedinosaurjpeg  its been 6 months this is it the holy grail of purple colored shit  buy two pounds for premium thats 599 per pound  buy their huge red striped angel fish as well 25 bucks  start to feel bad im basically robbing the man  try not to think about it  drip acclimate boom done now i just gotta wait the month out  the bubble tip nemone kills the new fish a day in  shit never grows rock never darkens or bleaches  hop in discord and ask around  its fake my man real reef rock tm     he was still selling his rocks for cheap but yeah i mad and i still dont have coralline algae i swear if the montipora coming in doesnt have any coralline in the plug im goung mad
  what a great story
  yeah i know that feel    if you want coralline you need to turn down the temps and have 0 nitrate and phosphate also cut back the lighting it doesnt do well under full reef lamps    dosing kalk or using purple up also helps a lot    but its probably already in your tank conditions just arent right for an explosion yet as long as thats the case any you add will just die
    adding to this    pink coralline is the easiest to grow it can handle reef lighting and nitrates up to about 10    if you want purple you need really low light and even better water quality it also grows much more slowly
     dose kalk   crash tank     stupid fuck most new reef tanks dont have enough calcifying algae or coral to justify any sort of secondary element addition adding calcium hydroxide will be the easiest way to crash the aquarium especially without a stirrer or any way to add it in a controlled safe manner test all parameters before adding anything to the tank     dont fall for the dried rock jew and look for large wild caught coral colonies on rock those wild caught rocks are the easiest and best ways to add beneficial flora and fauna to a reef
so electric catfish get to 3 feet long are there smaller ones how long does it take to grow that big ive been shocked by house current before so i think i can take it
  just scrape off some from a local lfs lol
  they are like goldfish and grow based on the size of the tank that guy could easily reach 58 inches in a large tank
why are their 2 /aq/ generals
will a betta be okay in a bowl if its diligently taken care of had a betta in a 55 and recently my all female gouramis keep biting his tail for seemingly no reason i dont have any room for a 10g my family throws a huge shitfit when i keep anything out of my room otherwise id do that no fish stores in my area accept surrenders without putting them down so no luck there bls help guys
    because suo is a faggot
  because /aq/ and /herp/ made a new server and most of /aq/ has supported this thread plus the link the other one didnt get the hint
  most of /aq/ wants both of you dueling discordfags to die in a ditch
hey /aq/ its the zoo autist what would we have to do to get these faggots to survive captivity for even a couple years
  isnt it due to the fact sharks all ways travel and not being able to do so in a tank makes them an hero
  youre a big beta
  4u
  thats funny
  make a mesh enclosure for him and float it in the aquarium
see guppy flashing and white spots  assume it is ich  treat him with api super ick cure  give half dose because scaleless fish  just finished dosing and do the water change  still flashing and white spots  so could he have something else besides ich making him behave like this should i do the full dose instead of half dose it wont kill him i want to know if it might be something other than ich before i treat him again scared the medication might stress him out or poison him or something maybe just do the half dose again
  keeping bettas with gouramis  it literally says not to do this on both their aquarium wiki pages
    tons and tons and tons of dissolved oxygen and space i think they could be realistically kept in large enough sea pens but gws have been recording going extremely deep for unknown reasons     most large pelagic marine species do not belong in fish tanks     also fwiw montery bay has successfully kept white sharks short term just like seaworld has had grey whales on display whale sharks and manta rays are pretty easy to keep too
is this ich
nice betta
  sounds like a good idea would an acrylic divider work too    theyre all female a lfs said that they would work if i got 3 or so they were fine for 6 months until this week when they nip at his tail for no reason
  wont they still lay eggs even without male partners maybe why
  can see that yeah they got this brown stripe on their belly fin recently all i could find on it is it indicating breeding behavior goddamnit betta youre supposed to stand up to these cunts
  what is the stripe
  like this theyre never still enough to get a good pic i have an opaline and 2 blue gouramis and they all have this stripe
    that your fish looks good
  nah she looks pretty similar though
  waste of a tank  the walmart i go to told us its fine to use their smaller container as a tank
  it is a damn waste
what is /aq/s opinion on amanos
what is the best moss or plant to help fry hide and survive their tank mates
  can someone please sad cat this image
  sounds like ick i always do fulldose
  full dose indeed
  he is a big fish
page 3 bump
  anyone  parameters are good
  that creature is fucking adorable     is it a sea slug
  hes a sausage
  java fern
    you mean java moss right
  guppy grass or anything else long and flowy hornworts and the like as well  hope this helped
whats the best technique to gravel vac sand
  my vote is hygrophilia
  java fern

  sometimes if a new couples spawn fails or they get really stressed out cichlids will break up kinda like human newlyweds

hi i have a 55l bowl from 10 years ago when i kept a goldfish unfortunately it died on me when i went away for a week and my sister forgot she was supposed to feed it   anyway recently ive been wanting to set it up again so i want to know what kind of fish besides goldfish can i keep in a bowl this size sorry if you get this question a lot but searching on google gives many contradicting answers
  uma delicia
  i ate uni once i dont know if i got a bad batch it was at a very prestigious hotel so im doubtful but it literally just tasted like chugging sea water no flavor other than salt and something vaguely seaweedy
  the flavor shifts really really fast with them so if they are 24hrs out of the water they taste like shit i tried them like 5 times and it was gross i then moved to hawaii and lived on the beach and went diving collected a few cracked em open for one last try and it blew my mind how good they were talked to a high end sushi chef and he said the same thing if they arent live from local water he doesnt even bother and most are farmed in cali or brazil so if you dont live there or where people dive for them then youre shit out of luck
  you can even get good uni in denver just make sure you see an actual live urchin before its prepared   freshness cannot be overemphasized with uni
  i only want to try it because of salvador dali so if you provide a quote by him that supports this im in
  im not gonna lie its probably not as good as an urchin you just caught diving and cracked open on the boat right there
  i want to eat x food because of of some shit modern artist and his even shittier wife liked it  you need to get some better priorities my man
stupid cunts pretending to have radial symmetry
  they have bilateral symmetry at least
  yeah similar it was as if i had plunked a knuckle sized wad of salt into my mouth totally awful
  if i wanted bilateral symmetry id get a fucking fish
hedgehegs are so cute tbqh
  true
  if you dont like seafood why would you be surprised you dont like sea urchin
    this cant be a healthy weight      at what point did they even imply they didnt like seafood your reading comprehension sucks
  sea urchins are the physical incarnation of all the things people who dont like seafood dont like about seafood
  eating seafood is the equivalent of putting handfuls of salt into your mouth
  hey uh hedgehog lay off the crickets huh
i stepped on one yesterday while fishing   he was ok but my foot was not
    i fucking love seafood and sea urchin is still disgusting newsflash most seafood doesnt taste like a mouthful of sea water
the girl sitting next to me in class is browsing this thread right now i think thats kinda funny
  nevermind she just swapped out 
  i have never seen any of these in real life does anyone in south us see them
  lucky i once got mistakenly banned because someone at my university posted cp
  why would you expect a sea urchin to be anything like a grilled shrimp with steak surf n turf faggot
do you have leechies
  some months ago there was a guy in the invert general who had them
  keeping a parasite as a pet  feeding it your actual self  ill bet this broad has some terrible tattoos
  all pets are a parasite just not usually in the literal sense  letting it latch onto yourself is fucking weird though and im sure she does have some retarded tattoos or piercings aswell
  i like to think of it as a symbiotic relationship
  why not just get a species of leech that doesnt require blood to sustain itself  i remember always having to clean out the horse water butts once or twice a year and there were tonnes of leeches always in there eating the algi growth on the walls dont even know how the bastards ever got in them
  10 bucks says this is a sex thing and she latches it onto her clitoris or some shit
woman with a leech  hyperparasitism in action
  you just know
  yeah that webm set was pretty interesting
  cant feel my knee  better open a wound and introduce a vector for infection  pardon
  youve piqued my curiosity
  risk of infection from a safely raised leech is very small
  wtf kek try imagining a leech with 3 razor sharp triangular teeth laching onto your glans
  dont worry they use local anaesthetic 
  there are leech farm used for medicine in my country they use it a lot here they are raised in a sterile environment making them safe to use
  ive seen videos of guys letting ants and mosquitoes feed from their dicks a leech would be easy mode
  because i like the idea of leeching for health benefits
the ultimate wierd girl pet i hope they all start doing that its better than letting them rescue big ass adult pit bulls they have no control over
  i need this
  do you have leechies  yes lots of asylum seekers here in my city
  bunch of weird chicks spreading the next ebola just to be some trendy weirdo
tfw no tryhard autistic gf
ive been thinking about keeping some but i dont know if i have the time/temperament to properly maintain them otherwise pretty interested in regular interspecies exchange of beneficial bodily fluids theyre cute at any rate
  that fucking youtube channel is beyond bananas vaginal leeching and enemas man
im just gonna say it
whos a good dog
okay this is totes adorable this is just how cute it gets imagine entering a trance and seeing these two you will be permitted to think you saw heaven if these arent angels i dont know what are  source 
omg say hello to the doggy cat and the catty dog
best face swap
you guys think its too late to get my dog socialized beautiful motherfucker always tryna kill people he can be generally sweet to certain friends of mine but it usually takes a few hours or so in his cage he isnt neutered as of yet but i plan on getting that taken care of soon hes nearly two breed is pit  chow his name is escobar hes big as shit
  im so so sorry in advance for what is about to happen trolls are going to come into the thread and they will be saying some very hurtful things about you they will call you some very hurtful names but none of those things are true how could they possibly know how could they possibly know how beautiful you really are how sweet and compassionate you are im so sorry about them please do not let them hurt you    mfw thinking of you hurting
  i cant see this thread going well
how much should i pay for a queen that is half arabian mau and half australian mist i was thinking like 300 since shes not completely purebred but shes also not mystery meat shed be unfixed coming to me do you think that makes her worth more
zero doll hairs    cats are the free garbage of pets
  well shes not a mystery meat cat that ends up in a can of friskies i very much enjoy the quality of both these breeds especially the virtuallyzero health issues and the affectionate nature of them both i would think that i could negotiate a decent price for her
  a decent price for a cat is free    even better if its neutered because only retards breed cats and neutering costs money
  paying for a cat  anon i
a cat is either purebred or not an unfixed nonpurebred cat cant produce kittens worth anything
  you pay for medical treatment and food that went into the kitten up until you buy it so the lesser the quality and quantity of those things the less you should pay   unneutered should be way cheaper
ahem  schlop schlop schlop schlop schlop schlop schlop schlop schlop  fuck non pure breeds
waaahh adopt a dog save a life   waaaaah settle for mutts because theyre healthy  someday a rain is going to come to wash away this filth
  op here my dog is a pure breed mutt
  what is your answer to the pitbull question good sir
  make them eat their owners then train them to hunt immigrants instead of white people
  cherubim are massive spirits with power enough to carry other angels within them if they are in dog heaven their only reason to exist is to send the wicked pups to tartarus pound

my 10 gallon fishtank is completely infested with snails because of a petco plant and the only fish in it that i really cared about died a while back im thinking of dumping it and getting a frog will a 10 gallon tank work for one of those pcman frogs how much equipment would i need to get
false bottom eggcrate  garden lining  substrate  plants  reptile heat lamp  basically it
  get a loach instead they eat snails and are a million times smarter than a frog
  the fish i was talking about was a weather loach
i had an unfortunate fishkill and a bunch of physa snails leftover once about 5 years ago  i sold the fishtank and gear but i actually kept the snails in an unfiltered unheated jar    theyre still going alive and well today i replace the water once a month sometimes ive even used straight tap water drop a leaf in every now and then sometimes i also use that jar to root pothos plant cuttings the snail jar looks pretty normal on my plant windowsill    easiest pet i ever kept
dont kill the other fish just to get a frog
  i used to smash snails on the sides of my tank using a plastic bottle then my blood parrot would eat the crushed snails as they slowly fell   i kind of miss having an aquarium but my cats require too much attention to keep such a thing these days
  youll need a bigger tank eventually but a freshwater puffer fish will clear those snails out their front teeth grow continuously because they eat so many snails and clams with tough shells once it kills the snails i think you can feed it frozen bloodworms
  pest/pet
    pea puffers dont need bigger than ten gallons   carinatetraodon   they also dont have the beak issue     get either one or 5  depending on how strong your filter is  they are good at killing snails but need a heater for sure    really smart fierce fish without fear   never net them in air because if they puff in air they die and they sometimes are sick with parasites so expect to lose a few if your store hasnt had them for a month minimum
threads gonna die   previous thread      itt we will discuss    how could x animal from x movie/tv show evolve  spec evo project your working on  speculative evolution ideas  and other speculative evolution topics
  bumping with a favorite of mine
  last thread hasnt even hit bump limit yet
  the previous thread is gonna die soon though
when the fck is serina going to update
  but its not
memory people were so autistic if they built enough boats and axes they would have survived the invasion
mammals  four legged  two legged  aquatic  gliding  hopping  reptiles  shelled   limbless  aquatic  amphibians  aquatic  limbless  gliding  tree frogs  ground dwelling    is there anyway that a new category of animals could evolve it seems as if everything has already and i mean an entirely new family
  you forgot winged and feathered reptiles
should we setup a discord
  no
  shit i just realized i made this post too retarded i meant to write it like this    fish swimming streamlined aquatic animals  amphibians wet swimming animals which depend on moisture and water to live and breed come in tailed tailess and limbless forms  reptiles hard skinned egg laying animals come in shelled limbless and four legged forms  mammals furry animals which are intelligent come in many different forms  birds feathered animals capable of flying come in many different forms    the question is what type of category will possibly evolve because any speculative animal can go into one of the categories above i want to know if birds or reptiles or whatever can become an entirely different animal
  if you want go ahead id like to see a spec evo discord
  hold on im just adding bots and making the icon
  nice
  yeah but where is it
xenopuses on a terraformed plant diversify and one lineage becomes rocket shaped and takes to the seas after becoming saltwater tolerant and take the niche of small sharks and cetaceans their legs fused and their fore arms lose their fingers and act the same as the claspers of stingrays in which they hold the female the males have large rough patches on their forearms that they use to hold onto the underside of the female during amplexus the female starts swimming to patches of vegetation and the male signals her to stop when he spots an area to deposit eggs the female at that point swims to that area and the male starts squeezing her harder and simulating her to release eggs at which they line up their cloacas in order to maximize the percentage of fertilized eggs perhaps one day he will evolve a cloaca capable of penetrating the female to ensure each and every egg will be fertilized    what do you think
  i have alot of shit to do so i cant finish it today
  also getting the rules setup
  rules  that doesnt take that long man ive had the misfortune of running /k/ servers and it takes all of 10 seconds to come up with a few basic rules
    the rules are done already
ok its almost done execpt for the server icon any suggestions
  just link it
  fine 
  since reptiles already evolved into two extra types mammals and birds i could easily see a third type arising in the future
  id say it would probably come from turtles/tortoises streamlined armor could probably have some potential considering how well its worked for inverts till now
fuck these bastards post videos of spiders being killed eaten alive etc and general spider hate talk
  woops wrong thread ment to make my own thread and i was on this one my mistake
bump
  id say lizards would be most likely to be the base of a new class of animals since their basic body structure is almost completely unchanged from the time they evolved from amphibians
  mfw no serina updates in months now  feels bad 
these threads are fucking useless
  explain to us how its useless
  slow even for /an/  rarely ever discuss anything meaningful   always just die with barely anything achieved  the fucking realistic mythological creature threads on /x/ are better and theyre a bunch of psychopaths
  by your logic the realistic mythical creatures thread are useless because they rarely ever discuss anything meaningful
  also maybe give us some reasonings behind your agurements atleast explain to us how we rarely ever discuss anything meaningful 
  smashed and slammed
what is some speculative evolution games i should play
  what are
  serina
  what is that google is failing me
  
  thats alot of birds
could an animal evolve to have 2 genders
  yes but you have to understand that there needs to be an environmental pressure to do so i actually was thinking of an alien world where the aliens have three genders basically one gender deposits sperm or the alien equivalent of it and the other gender deposits an egg into another gender which mixes the sperm and egg and it grows inside its body i thought this would help as thered be more genetic variance 3 dna codes combining as opposed to the 2 dna codes combining here with earth organisms but i think that this would eventually evolve into only 2 genders i also think that eventually all earth organisms will eventually have just one gender possibly in the next 100 million or so years
    i really dont quite get it myself but apparently some form of genetic recombination is quite necessary  that doesnt stop hermaphroditism of course
evolution is a lie glory be to allah
  i dont see why there would be natural pressure for three sexes to evolve
could a bacteria that infects computer systems eg corroding or corrupting the insides be plausible
  i actually think a fungus would be more likely to do that maybe some scientists engineered a fungus to break down plastic and metal to help garbage plants or to clean forests
  animals dont have genders    if youre talking about sexes it depends on how you define that in the tradition sense probably not it would be pretty unlikely for a species to evolve a third sex it would make reproduction more complicated than it needed to be  however there are many fungal species that dont have gametes the way animals do and can have multiple mating types determined by different genes defined by dna donors and dna receivers      basically an animal that has more than two sexes would be something pretty alien  though there are quite a few species where different males will adopt completely different mating strategies to get with the female as illustrated here i suppose given enough time this could end up evolving into a third sex or gender but more likely itll just be a different male
fishes that can walk on their tail fin
   i know this isnt the spec bio thread but how would one go about designing bioluminescent mammals i imagine they would sort of work like those lightup plastic fiber things pic related where the chemical reaction occurs on the skin but the light travels through the fur of the animal
  beautiful ive always wondered what a crustacean whale type being would be like like if everything went exctinct and crabs had to fill every niche
  fiberoptics have pretty complex molecular structures its pretty unlikely for them to be evolved    not impossible though certain blue animals like butterflies actually dont have any blue pigment rather the very molecular structures in their wing cells are shaped in such a way to refract blue light
what will probably be the 5th animal group to evolve powered flight after insects pterosaurs bats and birds    maybe some spiders could repurpose 2 of their 8 legs into a pair of wings
  gender and sex are the same thing  /deal with it
  possibly a descendant of some gliding animal alive today  sugar gliders flying squirrels colugos wallaces flying frog those lizards with the ribs that spread out into gliding wings    i think the frog evolving powered flight would be cool would need to evolve thicker skin like a toad to not get dried out in any prolonged flight though
just wanted to drop in and show off my copy
  can i be your friend
   thats really what i had in mind maybe certain plants in its environment emit uv light to attract pollinators which then allow the mammals to glow if they have a certain compound in their bodies although im not sure what the selective pressure would be to instigate this maybe just a weird radiation leak or something        dracos are getting closer to something like this so i imagine they are likely to be next
  maybe if those parasitic cup flowers become more abundant birds and bats die off in the ecosystem for a long enough period and like you said they become more independent from water at least in their adult forms
    flying spiders
  wouldnt the dna still only come from the sperm and egg producers not the surrogate
  plants emit uv light to attract pollinators insectivorous mammals then evolve to mimic them
  it is still expensive as fuck
    yes but the sucker i bought it off of charged me 15 bucks at a yard sale
    to add to that i talked him down from 25 because i said it looked like a shit read but i liked the pictures and it would look good on my coffee table
  what will probably be the 5th animal group to evolve powered flight after insects pterosaurs bats and birds  flying spiders are already a thing
  this  the concept of gender was invented as lube for you can totally change your sex guise  why dont we invent an alternative word for race so that rachel dolezal can get the validation she needs
  what if they evolve from flying/gliding snakes in that case we could actually get real chinese dragons
oh nice i tried dumping all my spec evo books in here once a long time ago but the images kept getting resized it was a huge failure
    he means sustained powered flight
  scan and archive your treasures post links here
how could each of these  realistically exist
  no animal can get that big
  i looked at every picture and now i feel slightly more autistic than i was 3 minutes ago
  what if those were normal sized then also you could put them in any enviroment
  in the case of whales i imagine it would be something like a giant krill with the mouthpieces of a porcelain crab or somethingor that filtering anomalocarid
  pillsbery doughboy    kek
could jumping spiders grow bigger and evolve power flight to hunt bigger animals
  could random animal evolve random ability  no
  not powered flight but i can see them growing bigger
continuing from previous thread what is your guys idea for an animal that has specifically evolved for hunting humans in urban areas
  like the legionella living in air conditioners and cooling towers
  any type of animal i dont think legionella is evolved to specfically hunt humans though
  highly evolved wasps/hornets
  judas roaches
  2   id like to see mammalian looking birds you know furry and 4legged
  oh no no 
  animals dont have genders  if youre talking about sexes  kill yourself
  the main problem with this is that as soon as humans catch wiff of creatures in their cities hunting them there would be concerted efforts to seek them out and exterminate them  think the way parasyte ended    they would have to be very good at remaining hidden in fact so good at hiding humans would never even suspect we were there preying on hookers and bums and leaving no trace of a body
  that would be a lot more plausible yeah with exceptions like ghidora  cant think of what environmental pressures might emerge for an animal with multiple heads to evolve brains need a lot of the bodies resources an having more than one wouldnt be too efficient  maybe if two of the heads were actually brainless decoys to confuse predators
    if i say its the same thing it is  single digit iq
send me pics of your most cursed kitties
  i have two good pics
  and picture 2
winkle
cade
he knows
  so recently a species of jumping spider toxeus magnus was discovered in south east asia that nurses its young for up to 40 days with a milk 4 times as protein packed as cow milk now what if i drink the spider milk i want to drink the spider milk
spider milk be tasting like bugs lmao
this is is the invertebrate general if you have any questions about invertebrates want to look into owning one or more or want to simply discuss them this is the thread to do so whether its    /invert/ discord server   old thread     tarantulas and other spiders  myriapods  mollusks  crustaceans  insects  or anything without a backbone    feel free to post it    resources/help and information    tarantulas      mantids    phasmids  
  original op from way back when who first wrote the op post here    what else should we add to the resources list we only had so many people here when we first started almost two years ago and only so wide a selection now that i see we have people asking about various others especially crustaceans what else should we add to the list id say we put crabs and hermit crabs there and maybe beetles to start
  what are some good beginner invert pets   what are the most kino inverts
what if you cant find any tarantula breeders in your country any company willing to ship to other countries also would that be a ethical thing to do as a spider lover can tarantula long distances and live in tropical regions not native to them sorry for all the questions complete beginner here
    also im thinking that ecoearth doesnt have enough cohesion will the tarantula fix this with silk or should i try to find some clayy soil to mix in
  depends where are you
  travel    india
  beginner  scorpion millipedes assassin bugs crickets
  just looked under his rock today and found this guy lying beside his old exoskeleton
  scorpion  arent they really dangerousfor a beginner though
  depends on the species something large with a weak sting like an emperor scorpion wont sting you and smaller ones will usually not get defensive if given a place to hide as they should obviously dont get anything with potent venom    best to go with desert species like harizonensis or hspinigerus and large species with weak stings like htroglodytes or the aforementioned emperor scorpion though those are getting harder to come by
  ive been working a lot so ive been busy but i posted a few months ago regarding us beetle laws and emailed united states fish and wildlife service we would expect that you can import a pet beetle without complications provided that you comply with the requirements  then i was given a endangered animal list with 20 beetles i messaged two websites that sell beetles and asked about their us imports and they say about 3/100 are denied from us customs  ive seen a lot of mixed info on beetle substrate and how well it can effect growth of the larvae so info like that could be useful if that is correct
what are a some fast breeding isopods i could use for a bioactive tank i have a bearded id like to make the move to bio but he will eat three times his weight and hunt anything moving
  we would expect  what the fuck they dont have a database to refer to and give you a precise answer from
  a lot of federal law in the us is open to interpretation by the courts to the point where law enforcement may not be able to give a solid answer also quite a few of our laws have confounding effects such as intent or other trivialities that cant be accurately listed in a short answer    so no unless youre asking about murder or bank robbery or something theres a lot of cases where youre not going to get a yes/no answer from a government agency
  theres also the problem that you could comply with federal laws and still run afoul of state county or city laws    the feds in law enforcement dont generally keep track of local laws so they cant say if youre good there or not they have enough of a mess keeping track of federal laws in the case of importing living animals from another country your actions probably will fall under about 100 different federal laws some of which a person could easily break by accident    provided that you comply with the requirements  is sort of a catchall caveat for that situation its the importers job to know which laws have to be followed and theres a lot of them
  the final problem is one of license vs opinion    if you write to the feds and ask if you can do x and they say yes you can do x that grants you license to do x they arent legally allowed to grant you personal license to do much of anything via a letter though because they dont know the full situation    so what they provide is an opinion if you do x you probably wont be prosecuted or it should be fine for you to do x so long as you file the required paperwork and pay the taxes    or whatever    they arent going to say something is ok to do because thats a license to do it theyll just offer an opinion on whether or not youll get in trouble doing a thing should you choose to do it the letter cant grant you license it can only convey an opinion
    sounds like life would be a lot easier for you guys if you joined the eu
  30 of our economy comes from exactly this sort of bureaucratic masturbation
  along with what    said   the paravejovis spinigerus and heterometrus spinifer are my two most active scorpions even in daytime both of which would be fine as a beginner scorpion as their stings while painful would not be medically significant unless you had an allergic reactionsame as with a bee sting    heterometrus are cool because they get quite big and are voracious eaters
  gromphadorhina portentosa  they are really awesome and easy to keep  keep them in groups they are quite social
anyone keep these things there is hardly any info on them as pets online with most reports saying they dont live long in captivity but its old data from like a decade ago
  even bugs live in a society
my p smithi molted last night
  i have not personally but i hear they have similar care requirements to any other millipede and i believe i have seen people keep them communally with isopods and other species of millipede   they look rad tho update if you get any please
  nigga eatin beans
best places to buy ts uk
  not from the uk but the spidershop is pretty highly rated from what ive heard
  37 cefalotorax  36 crabganias
  giant pill millipedes are pretty much impossible to keep alive in captivity    please dont buy any
  giant pill millipedes are pretty much impossible to keep alive in captivity  y tho
my vinegaroon got stuck inbetween his glass and the dirt then fluid leaked from his leg after this his leg was stiff and unmoving can i do anything to help him or is he kill
  beardies need it too dry for bioactive to work out
  he can regenerate messed up legs if the leg is fubar hell cut if off himself so dont mess with the leg
  nice how big is it
how do i stop the fucking crickets from cannibalizing their cage mates and stinking so bad  do i just freeze them and start keeping dubias
  yes glad to be of help
ill be traveling to corfu greece in april i was thinking about collecting some little insects and bringing them home in my suitcase is it illegal to do this on a plane as long as the species is not endangered do they care will i get in big troubles
  pretty much the only way ive been able to keep crickets alive is by giving them excessive hiding spaces and pretty much an overload of food separated into small portions spread throughout the cage as they will get violently defensive over food if theres only one feeding spot    dubias are cool sure but id be far less worried about a cricket escaping into my house than a cockroach
  dubias cant become household pests even if they escape
  you gonna get black bagged by the epa
  i checked on him now amd he is fine thanks for the info on another note how do you know this do you have a source or have you seen it happen
the usda is what stops most bug imports as plant pest not wildlife laws of the usfw
  always dreamed of cultuvating a garden with enough biodiversity to hatch a mantis egg anybody here know anything about doing something like that is this even viable or am i just daydreaming here
  just plant some flowers and bushes to attract insects and order mantis ooths online they are cheap and available in many places in spring
  common knowledge that arachnids regen limbs
  such sarcastic creatures
  id be far less worried about a cricket escaping into my house than a cockroach  crickets are the real pests
  just look through forums m8  it most likely has something to do with their gut microbiome and temperature  as i said sphaerotheriida pretty much are impossible to keep alive for longer periods of time even for experts  except maybe one species     glomeridae on the other hand can be kept in and bred in captivity    also   why  if we would know it exactly wed be able to breed them
  they got extra eyes lol
  when its doing the typical pokie pose its 2 long havent gotten a chance to get a more recent pic but its colors have darkened a fair bit now     just noticed my heterometrus is molting looks like a really awkward position sort of wedged vertically in its tunnel its my first scorpion so i hope the molt goes well
  really why is that just out of curiosity
  they live on the forest floors of central and south america eating fruits and fallen leaves so theyre not well adapted to human houses  only about 30 out of the 4600 species of cockroach associate with human habitats at all but dubias can escape and live in the wild in places like florida for example so it depends where you live
  this  floridian here can confirm were the only state you cant ship them to
  the molt went well
my lifes work is proving mankind evolved from something cool like tarantulas and not shitty monkeys
  if you make any progress youve got yourself a devout follower so keep us updated
so my a seemanni doesnt want to eat her dubias ive fed her with crickets and mealworms in the past and she was perfectly receptive even if she didnt eat it immediately it would always be gone the next day with a visible husk in her hide i put a dubia in her tank a week ago and i just found it hiding under her water dish thats the fourth time this month ive tried feeding her a dubia shes nowhere near premolt so it cant be that are tarantulas capable of being picky eaters
this is about as close as this qt would let me get before sprinting away at mach 5 why are they so shy compared to other centipedes
help me invert general  i was at my moms house earlier today and we found these creatures infesting some of her spices in her pantry they were light colored and a few millimeters long very thin like tiny termites i couldnt get a picture because they were too small but does anyone know what they might have been flour mites
  funny harvestman boi
just wondering if ive done this right  first spider and ive switched him to a bigger tank hes a mexican red knee if it matters
  sorry forgot picture
my scorpion always holds onto a cricket leg like a drumstick does this happen to anyone else    also she stung the last cricket right in the face while holding onto it fucking brutal
  its a bit big but with a fat butt like that id say hell have no trouble finding food and may make a smaller burrow if he thinks hes got too much space anyways all in all looks fine to me except for one big issue i dont see any lateral ventilation holes holes on the sides  holes on top
  yall need to come to my basement the fuckers will run over your foot
anyone keeping polistes i would like to start with them but im not sure if i can catch a queen at spring also do you have any experiences with eusocial insects
  no thanks
look /invert/ i get that you guys like your spiders and whatnot but every time i see one of those bigass wolf spiders in my house i kill it ive been trying to get better at dealing with bugs but some of them just really freak me out
  we had a beekeeper or two here at some point but i dont know if theyre still here
  did you know that invert was once the term for homosexuals
  quit being a little bitch whos scared of something considerably smaller than him
  step 1 expose yourself to pictures and videos make it an everyday sight  step 2 learn about the animals you are afraid of youre most scared about what you dont know about  step 3 see them up close alive handle it if the situation allows get positive experience with the animal  step 4   step 5 profit
which one
  tank is exo terra 60 x 45 x 60
is there a beginners guide to ant farms
  be terrified of hornets and wasps  see them up close  get stung   thanks doc
  yes lots of them try typing some relevant terms into a world wide web search engine
  look up ants australia great video quality and information they provide care wise applies to ants in general and not just to their local stuff
  was this it
my poecilotheria smithi after darkening up since its molt    
anyone here keeping any sort of harvestman their care seems to be very similar to isopods but the demand for them is nowhere near as big
  he didnt say hornets and wasps now did he
  how long are their lifespans on average
    nice looks good i think my heterometrus is getting ready to molt not out as much as usual and starting to refuse food plus its turning into a blimp that thing is normally an insane eater    my l jordanensis just molted a few days ago too so pretty happy about that
anyone here have experience in keeping zophobas larvae are easy enough to keep but the adult bugs are extremely cannibalistic out of the 7buggos that hatched about 3months ago only two are still alive right now i kept them in a 20x30x20cm fauna box filled about a quarter with wood litter i feed them potato and appleslices about every 34 days   should i switch to a different type of litter maybe cocos fiber  pic is one of the unlucky younger zophobas i was able to save before it was completely devoured by its siblings surprisingly lived for another week or so before it died
how difficult are carpenter ants to raise specifically the floridian variety
  you can do it with species that are native to your area country at least please dont release something like hymenopus coronatus in europe or anything like that   as  mentioned plant flowers to attract insects   id like to do this too but mantis religiosa may not be sold in this area
after i missed the last 5 or so chances to visit terraristika i will finally really go this saturday    im hoping to pick up a mossy frog and maybe some mantids if i find them for cheap idolomantis diabolica and one of the mossy looking mantid species majangella or haania would be nice i might also consider metallyticus splendidus im hoping to find some species that i dont know about yet     yesterday i tried to mate my 2 paradoxas but the female ate my male 
  a mossy frog  why only one    if i find them for cheap idolomantis diabolica   yesterday i tried to mate my 2 paradoxas but the female ate my male   why not try to succeed with the easier species first before trying to go for the really difficult ones
  you cant always win ive succesfully bred 3 species before
how do i get rid of ants from inside my room    i have a bird a gecko and a small dog recently a trail of ants found its way to where i keep my dogs food bowl i cant quite pinpoint where the trail is starting and i dont want to use raid on the edges of the floor/walls because i dont want to harm the animals    should i try to get her to start eating in the kitchen
  get a slightly larger bowl put some water in it put the food bowl in the larger bowl you now have a moat that prevents ant theft
  does that prevent them from attempted theft as well or will i just end up with a trail of drowned ants
  smear vaseline or something on the outside of the bowl to keep them from crawling up also tea tree oil
  youll have to scrub away the little scent trails they leave or you still will have ants following them expecting food seal all the gaps around your home if you can
diatomaceous earth
  cinnamon around the edges of the room usually deters ants as well
  why
  and sugar
try doing a full clean of your room sounds like you need to anyway
mix borax sugar and water together google it for exact measurements i dont remember them soak it in a cotton ball put it somewhere in their trail this should kill the ants and their colony worked for me 3 times i had ants
antrid you fucking retard    they take the poison back to their nest and they all die
  your local hardware store sells these ant sticks that kill their whole nest its a clear plastic rectangle with clear fluid in the center once they find it they swarm it for days and carry it back
uh this thing was abandoned and im hosting it for this night    too much energy cries when we leave the room what do
maybe take it to a shelter could be dangerous
  you could try drowning it the world would have one less stray shitbull if it mauls you to death then we would be out one less shitbull and one less idiot
if you have any kids let the dog sleep in their room tonight and around 3am bust through the door holding a flashlight under your chin yellingim going to get you
  have sex with it
  lock it in a kennel put it on a muzzle and put it back where you found it     op you can thank me later for saving your life
exercise the damn thing take it for a run
  kek
it was very noisy at night barking until our distance was minimal at first then snoring in its sleep once it was satisfied with the distance    at some point it managed to escape its spacious confinement and climb all over the bed which has left me deeply unsatisfied with the experience    i took it for a long walk in the morning but it has not defecated i fed it dry dog food pellets and gave it water     i understand now that /an/ has a meme about dogs of this particular race being too aggressive so i have been apprehensive to engage in more than pullthetoy games with it it tried to grab onto my hand with its jaws to secure its toy though it did not bite per se which has increased my suspicion    is there credence to this meme or is it like the /n/ meme about the black race
  6 of dogs  68 of dog attacks  52 of dogrelated deaths
  put it down
  pitbulls can be friendly for years and one day a noise or a movement triggers it and attacks the issue being a pitbull attack can easily result in death very fast due to their jaw strength and ferocity
  take it to the pound to euthanize it
  jaw strength  no they arent any stronger than other dogs in fact several dogs have stronger bites like gsd but they do tend to go for the face and neck of their prey pitbulls arent some magic dog that is bulletproof with locking jaws that can bite with this mythical amount of force they are just a shitty dog that snaps turns out most dogs can bite hard
not op but have a similar problem  after we had several break ins and several car thefts my dad decided to get a gsd to protect the house from burglars  the dog is not effective and we had another car being stolen   now all the responsibility for this wild crazy dog is up to me and its making my life miserable even though i love him very much  any advice
  panting dogs are conveying the same emotions as a smiling human    pitophiles everyone
  run him every day make it part of your routine gsd are very smart with high energy so they need a set schedule like every day run in the morning for 30min to get some energy out for the day then in the evening walk to a park and throw a ball for 1hour  the foundation of a well trained dog is a dog that gets exercise you cant hope to fix bad behavior if they have a ton of pent up energy
  they can be great dogs lots of people love them but they were bred to have 2 dangerous traits they attack without warning any other dog will give you warning but a pitbull will not attacks happen from perceived threat or sometimes almost no reason at all once they begin an attack they dont let go until youre dead you can gouge out his eyes but he wont let go unless you kill him first these are the instincts that were bred into them and what makes them dangerous
  /n/ meme about blacks  /an/ meme about pits  those are both valid and statistically backed up
  thanks anon good advice
  shoot it
  too much energy    take tennis ball  go to field  throw ball 2050 yards  let dog retrieve  pet vigorously every time it retrieves  repeat for 3090min depending on dogs physical condition     cries when we leave the room what do    do not leave the room/the dog if you return immediately as it cries it will learn that crying gets you to return and hence it will continue to cry start slow just barely shut a door and open it istantly then pet the dog and maybe give a small treat increase the duration of the door being closed second by second and avoid going in to bing increments lest it start to cry and you open the door again starting the learning of tthe aforementioned patter of i crymy owner comes back a consistent verbal cue like saying away when you shut the doorleave for a short while will help tell the dog whats happening too
  why would you believe a bunch of mentally ill shitposters
  its not aggression thats the problem aggression implies a pattern of conscious behavior bullies tend to be very sweet in every day disposition unless abused    the problem with bully breeds is their prey drive if it gets triggered they will kill whatever is close and moving in a mindless state your cat your little brother you it doesnt matter who or what it is  if that instinct gets triggered the dog isnt there until it calms back down
  cute dog anon lets hope she evens out and can be happy again
  im getting word from its rescuers that its former masters have been found thanks all for help      i work from home so we never actually separated since it arrived at my place just had to leave the room a couple times to go to superclean room that cant have dogs in it it eventually calmed down about the whole thing as for energy yeah we ran at the park on a leash every morning and played tennisball twice daily though it wasnt that into retrieving more into gnawing destroying and running away with ball       i know next to nothing about animals so i cant tell between meme and truth in any case i didnt believe strongly i was just asking for opinions
  id be worried mostly because its probably had some bad history     the reason pits are responsible for so many attacks is that knuckledragging morons get them because they want an aggressive intimidating dog so they get themselves a pit encourage bad behavior then subsequently cant handle the monster theyve created and dump them    then everyone wonders why the breed ends up with a disproportionate amount of attacks     doesnt even look like a full pit though too slim built just some street mutt i personally wouldnt really want a strange dog fresh off the street in my home take it to a shelter they may try to asses its temperament and rehome it or they may put it down because they have so many similar dogs theyre usually overwhelmed
    oops missed this this is good news im glad it actually has decent owners then probably a perfectly good girl but yeah the high energy is part of the reason that pits end up developing bad behaviors pent up frustration can turn in to aggression especially paired with incompetent handling and training     they can be good dogs for the right people but dangerous dogs in the hands on an idiot
  not op but i tried this and took my dog to a field and threw the ball and he went and grabbed it and then kept running and now hes gone and i dont have a dog or a ball    thanks anon
  whats with the huge nips
  then everyone wonders why the breed ends up with a disproportionate amount of attacks   nobody wonders really everyone knows the problem is niggers
  some if not most pitbull breeders select for big dicks and big nipples  not joking
  no op /an/ has become utter garbage honestly go somewhere else with your questions i would help but id be drowned out by all the 13 year olds im sorry /pol/tards turned this into a shitbull thread when it didnt need to be gooduck
  it was a mom at some point same thing happens to human nips
  feed it toddlers
  funny way of saying upper class white people with no sense of disciplining their furbabies
  it is actualy similar to the smile  there is the playful happy pant
  yet less than 1 of pitbulls attack people hmm
  i r scary lion uwu
  nobody wonders really everyone knows the problem is niggers    the problem is america then really because you guys have a really fucked up social system which still has essentially slums full of poor black people     whereas the uk and most sensible european countries dont experience the same sharp racial divides and along with that racial issues because we have better integration not perfect but not literal planned ghettos    essentially american society is fucked in a fundamental way pibbles are a symptom of this
  im not american i live in a 995 white country funny how you say the uk doesnt have sharp racial divides you guys are literally electing muslim politicians because muslims only vote for muslims in london
all of you fags saying pitbulls are violent murder machines can go fuck a cactus my parents and myself combined have had over 12 dogs since i was 14 half rottweilers and half pitbulls most of which were heavily abused rescues one of my dogs right now was beaten with a chain nicest dog ever and nobody is scared of him none of you have any idea what youre talking about
  wow what a badass this guy  he owns 12 dogs since he was 14 and if were lucky hes 16 now and half of them havent been put down yet
  its not really complicated  a pitbull can be the nicest dog in the world but they just have really dangerous jaws  it only takes one bite to hurt you a lot  think about how many times house cats spazz out and slash you  now imagine if its a lion  lots of lions are very cuddly and not likely but they are just fucking strong as shit
  huh
  huh huh
  in the same way upper class white people denounce racism and vote for black presidents they get pitbulls   virtue signalling
  european countries dont experience the same sharp racial divides  yes we do we have whole neighbourhoods where the police cant even enter because criminals attack them and all the white people have left turning it into a muslim ghetto   regards a swede
  read again sensible european countries not borderline communist european countries
  uk  sensible  really
  and is a conjunction which not only indicates a unity in regard to the topic at hand but also a division in other respects
this is what libtards actually belive
    68 of dog attacks and 52 of dogrelated deaths  less than 1 of pitbulls attack people  well which one is telling the truth
  the op pic isnt even a pitbull its a catahoula my buddy has one thats identical
  pic related
  probably neither 87 of statistics are complete bullshit
  this isnt a pitbull stop being retarded everyone i had a gold lab for 13 years before he fucking maimed me badly and was a piece of shit aggressive fuck for the next 2 years until he died of cancer it was like living with a landmine    pitbulls are not more prone to attacking than other dogs they just choose much more serious targets when biting and have powerful jaws so when they do attack youre absolutely fucked when my gold lab attacked me he bit me 7 times all on my joints knee elbow wrist hands i almost had to break his fucking neck to get him to let go of my fucking arm when a pitbull attacks the breed goes for face/neck chihuahuas are by far the most aggressive dog breed but because their bites are not extremely harmful they are almost never reported this leads to the extremely unbalanced statistics    people on an animal board not knowing anything about animals is really embarrassing
  wow so theyre not more likely to attack theyre just more likely to kill this sounds like a guns dont kill people people kill people defence
  wow you can read words that i wrote     im not defending pitbulls im just clarifying what you fucking morons keep spouting in thread after thread ops dog still isnt a pitbull
  this sounds like a guns dont kill people people kill people defence  the difference being that a gun cant break out of a private property on its own then run through the neighborhood and kill a child
  it can if the owner is very drunk
  no it just gets walked into schools and shoots a bunch of them all at once what a bad way to phrase that argument
  this sounds like a guns dont kill people people kill people defence    implying that defense isnt the most true and valid statment ever made by man
    thats still the owner handling it then  fact is guns are inanimate objects and without the express intention by the person handling it to shoot someone they dont shoot someone  fact is dogs are not inanimate objects and a person who raises and aggressive pitbull and is responsible for it mauling a child or 12 may not have intended for the kids to get hurt
    
  and people who have mentally toyed with the possibility of committing horrible acts of violence dont tend to proceed with it when they dont have an easily accessible tool to facilitate it
   it seems like you mistakenly thought youre in an argument about gun control this is /an/ since youre seemingly terribly stuck with your own head up your ass ill spell it out for you     i was making the point that it does not take a bad person to kill someone via powerful pit dog merely a person who doesnt know how to handle dogs in that way theyre not comparable to guns because in order for someone to commit violence with guns he himself has to use the gun     i hope you understand my posts now theyre not about gun control you braindead /pol/tard
  fact is dogs are not inanimate objects    that may be so but the responsibility still lies with the owner i have an aussie and i still shorten the leash and switch the dog to the other side every time kids pass us by its just what people with common sense and some basic human decency and consideration do  just in case just fucking realize that your animal is an animal and that you cant control it 100 and then for the sake of everyone involved not least for the sake of your dog not being put down by the gov make the appropriate safety precautions
  i do understand your posts basically you agree with me even if you dont realise it
  i agree with you responsibility lies with the owner if someone owns a dog big and strong enough to kill people he is responsible for controlling that dog fact remains you cant equate a dog killing someone to holding a gun barrel up to his head and pulling the trigger its simply not the same thing and all of these gun control  dog control faux arguments are beyond retarded and need to stop
  fact remains you cant equate a dog killing someone     usually this will be accidental say the dog escapes your grip so maybe its legally manslaughter or negligent homicide but then ofc you can deliberately use the dog as a weapon to kill which is straight murder    to holding a gun barrel up to his head and pulling the trigger    yeah thats murder with the gun being the tool used  just like in the above example the dog can be the tool    its simply not the same thing and all of these gun control  dog control faux arguments are beyond retarded and need to stop    it sort of is because any gov control of anything doesnt work dogs are regulated here as fuck vet taught classes and exams are mandated insurance 750k dog tax mandated immunizations and chipping and still people buy illegal dogs brought in from say bulgaria by gyppos and the scummy chechen still bring their 9mm aks over with them too my point is criminally inclined people to not give a fuck about your laws and recent experience has shown that trucks are much more deadly a weapon than guns
  reminder that according to an npr investigation there was only 11 school shootings in 20152016 no not mass school shootings any type of shooting on school grounds or in a school zone    
  fair enough
  he fucking maimed me badly and was a piece of shit aggressive fuck for the next 2 years until he died of cancer  why did you keep him
  multiple stolen cars  get cameras an an ar fuck
  maimed me badly    you kept a dog that maimed you badly instead of immediately killing it and you think were interested in hearing your opinions how retarded are you
  probably both
      prime gammon confirmed
  that dogs not even that big
  thank god it went for the whale and not the kid
  1 black vs 15     gee i wonder why one is more integrated
  why the fuck did i read your post as if it were a song
fuck pibblesand fuck jannies
  not sure man
  uh ok well um like uh do you yknow like uh maybe errr have any um yknow uh additional information on the um the errr the yknow the dog
  too much energy cries when we leave the room  i swear all fucking shitbulls are the same
  this fucking christ the majority of people getting tough dogs and expecting it to be the perfect family member but also protect you is insane its ungodly romanticized its a fucking dog it doesnt just do what you want it too     doesnt help that pits rotties german shepherds are always toted as this shit
  it is the same murder aside one of the main themes of gungrabber propaganda is that guns are inherently dangerous and if youre around them enough you stand a very high chance of being killed by an accidental shooting or a kid grabbing your gun or it being taken away from you by your attacker or some stupid bullshit like that when in reality guns are perfectly safe as long as the owner is knowledgeable and responsible with them which they have an absolute duty to be the same is true with dogs a dog isnt inherently any more dangerous than a gun assuming the owner is responsible and competent except i suppose for the cases where your dog contracts rabies or develops dementia or something and becomes violent as a result which guns cant do
how do i stop my neighbours cats from dumping dead mice/rats in my garden  webm unrelated
  get a dog
this isnt b faggot
holy fuck kill yourself
since i hit my cat with a broom  accidentally hit her while killing the rat she caught my cat doesnt stay in my room anymore and runs away from me any help/tips
yea stop hitting her with a broom or get her high as fuck on catnip
  your cat is retarded and too low iq to understand you didnt mean to hit her   welcome to owning a cat theyre fucking dumb and will hate you forever for stupid shit
  it fears you now youll have to get it to be comfortable around you
  yeah she fears you now but dont worry she doesnt hate you just dont hit her again pet her dont shoot at her and treat her to some candy if possible like fish or meat or cats snacks this way hopefully she understands that you are not mad at her and becomes friendly again
you shouldnt have hit your cat

  heres another one
no king charles spaniels are lame if you want a spaniel get a good one pic related
  i like how each one is different in its unique king of way
  i mean just look at this little smug fucker its adorable
  of course nature messes things up sometimes
    googles parent has a plan to eliminate mosquitoes worldwide
  how about you either archive the link or type it out here because im not about to give this shitty clickbait website ad revenue
  bats and fish are gonna starve
  there are lots of other invertebrates to feed on specially in shitty waters which is where mosquitos larvae thrive iirc  also arent the main prey of bats moths tho
  the article only mentions a specific exotic species of skeeter there killing a huge majority of mosquitos dont suck blood and arent a problem to humans this article title is sensationalized if they actually mean all mosquitos worldwide then yes thats idiotic
a cat has been on my apartment floor since tuesday and hasnt left  what should i do  it meows at me and even licks me whenever i go outside  i have been throwing it pieces of cooked chicken from time to time     should i adopt this one i have the funds to raise it or should i just leave a food and water dish outside of my door    i am in cali so isnt cold whatsoever outside
  if you want the cat take it in and get it shots and spayed if not stop feeding it or it will not go away
  i dont think its just me some folks on the floor beneth mine have a dish out and another stray has been eating from it i am not sure if this one is doing the same
  if it doesnt have a collar who cares ive stolen cats before i live in an area where its normal for underweight flea infested finding dead kittens roadkill mauled cats and ones picked off by predators if they cant bother to even give it a collar with tags take it
  put it in a pillowcase and beat it against a wall youll be doing it a favor other people would drown it and this is relatively painless
  alright i will see if i can get it into my car monday    i live in a pretty urban area tho no fleas no predators either
  you should be put in a pillowcase and be beat against a wall im sure that would do you a real favour considering youre a mindless parasite spic whos also definitely a neet just wasting away in life
ew it looks diseased
  how
  whatever floats your boat man im not really a cat person but i met a really good felyne buddy in a similar way he just turned up for pats out on my back deck one day and pretty much just decided to live out there he was being fed by someone he was a healthy weight and fucked off for days on end sometimes poor old fella pretty sure we lost him he stopped visiting about a month ago he was doing pretty poorly in the end and getting senile was probably for the best
  cant bother  collars are dangerous for outside cats they can get stuck and choke if you live in a normal neighbourhood you dont need them
why are they so comfy lads  
be beluga  be tormented every day by filthy hooman children banging on the glass hurting my ears  had enough  goes towards them and scream fuck off fucking cunts repeatedly  they just make fun of me  tfw cant kms to end the pain  help guyz pls
  does this look like the face of mercy
fuckin rubber boys fucked me up the first time i touched one
la ballena blanca  
  serenades   kek do people really believe this it just wants to find a way to get the spics to shut the fuck up
  captive cetaceans can shut their blowhole and suffocate to death if they really want to fucking die they have before especially sick specimens     la fantasma del mar
leave the pibble to me
  is this achievable natty
i think shar peis are the only dogs that can legitmitly challenge a gamey pitbull pound for pound
  legitmitly     imagine being this much of a brainlet
  pound for pound  a aus cattle dog the same size as a pit would fucking destroy it even smaller german shepherds regularly rip up pits  size not being equal almost any livestock guardian would wreck a pit too kengal caucasian shepherds and kuvaz come to mind
  my pitbull was terrified of our chihuahua   even when she was sick and dying of cancer the little bitch put him in line
  no   you leave the pit to meeeeee
  nope any of the spitzes will get wrecked by a fighting line pitbull unless they masivly outweigh it they arent dumb enough to rip them selves apart to win even akitas are meh they will try to bail on a fight they are at risk of losing and maul handlers to do so
  lol pits are some magic dog able to kill anything my doberman killed two at the same time that came onto our property and tried to start shit with him he weighed more than them individually but not together my dobe wasnt even hurt in it ive also seen a small bitch gsd rip apart an aggressive pit at a park if it didnt die it was severely fucked up  pits dont have locking jaws  pits are dumb as fuck  pits dont have the strongest bite  pits arent the most athletic
  pits dont have locking jaws  false   pits are dumb as fuck  true   pits dont have the strongest bite  anon  pits arent the most athletic  lmfao   i bet those pibbles your nigger doberman killed were just some ladys little spoiled babies too you act like pitbull are pussies just because some of them wont fight then brag about what a badass your nigger dog is unironically only a nigger would make this post
  both gsds and rotts have a stronger bite force than a shitbull locking jaws are a myth you could google any of this and not come in here looking like a retarded 12 year old whos parents rescued a shitbull and thinks its some kind of badass dog
   dont have locking jaws  false  there is no such thing as locking jaws with dogs  pits dont have the strongest bite  anon  they dont depending on the source they arent even in the top 10 kengals and other lsg and mastiffs have the highest  pits arent the most athletic  lmfao  they arent   just some ladys little spoiled babies  ok and my dobe was my spoiled baby whats your point a police working dog would fucking wreck any fight pitbull
  as silly as they look a komondor would eat any pit those dreds have a purpose and a pit wouldnt get able to grab anything useful while the komondor would shred it
  do you think thats the same reason poitou donkeys have dreads donkeys are bretty gud lgs i imagine a dreaded one would btfo some wolves
if other dogs were better fighters than pit bulls that is what people would fight in dogfights they dont fight other dogs they fight pit bulls   a fighting line pitbull is not going to be beaten at fighting unless the other dog masivly outweighs it     the one exclusion is the sharpei they are as gamey and tenacious as a fighting line pitbull
  nothing in north america can prey on a donkey
  polar bear and grizzly are of a different opinion
  sharpei    are you serious    that dog looks like it die to its own shadow
    stop it /an/    just stop it
  lets lock down /an/ for shaming toadlines they are smart dogs and do not deserve the harrassment
  stop    get some help
  smashed
  his very existence looks painful
  and slamed
  low    reye    der    drives a little slower
  is this serious
  i honestly cant tell if its a joke or what    i mean the dogs are a mess but the website looks like it was designed back in 2000 by a ghetto dweller
  they are serious about it
  someone post the webm of them collecting the toadline semen plz
    burgers are seriously fucked up
  spics are seriously fucked up  ftfy
  the webm of them collecting the toadline semen
    lets post it senpai
  whats the best breed for a pibble defender    im poor so i live around a bunch of posturing minorities who buy the breed of peace to be tough guys
  nice
shhhhhhh enough pitbull threads now no one cares
  alligator
  dont cut their ears though
these huge dog breeds look way stronger and scarier than wolves  how did tje selective breeding work on these its actually fascinating
  these  bred by themselves in the wild after several races being abandonded by spaniards basically natural selection to live in the wild only the strongest got to pass their seed
  what would you name that fucking thing
  for me its the caucasian shepherd dog    it even has caucasian in its name so you know its the white peoples dog
  what was i thinking  where do i store all this dog
pitbulls are a breed of peace
  id like to see you try
  fuck i thought that was a panther from the thumbnail
  yes because they caked their pibbles in photoshop
  jealous whitey spotted
  its the white peoples dog  owned and bred by turkic kawkaz niggers  white      the looks are deceiving wolves are strogner and more importantly smarter than any dog
  pibbles somehow defy laws of physics and act as a black hole and absorb all light  minus the eyes of course those reflect normally
  a wypipo dog   imfuckingplying angls didnt breed pibbles for dogfighting and murdering animals before they even thought of freeing black slaves
  for fucks sake it got me again
  and more importantly smarter than any dog  this mutt owners give their mongrels too much credit for intelligence   
chad dog
    when you realize that shooting this thing would just piss it off and not kill it
  thought from the thumbnail his neck flap was his bottom jaw looked demonic
  
love it
are manatees as friendly and harmless as they look
  yeah basically
  theyre behind the legend of the maremaid so i assume they are quite accommodating
theyre pretty chill theyre like water cows but way more calm than actual cows way more friendly than dolphins and about on pair with big whales in chillness level
  incredibly so
    their vaginas closely resemble human females
yeah ive seen them in the zoo before theyll come right up to you
  lol heard of this one captive manatee that preferred female handlers and about drowned this new guy with long hair when it realized hes not a girl
  they might be gentle but considering how massive they are i have no trouble believing theyd fuck your shit up if they did get pissed
  this   p sure the laws in florida about touching them are more for protecting idiots from fucking with a momma sea cows calf
which are more chill manatees or capybaras
when i was a kid i would feed the manatees off my uncles dock in florida we used heads of lettuce   i would also swim off this dock when the manatees heard the commotion in the water they would swim over and just hang out in a perimeter they never would approach anyone while in the water they just floated about ten feet away once you climbed back on the dock they would swim up and wait patiently for food all the interactions i had with them theyve were very docile they dont really do much just kind of float around and fart a lot they would never approach you in the water and some people were still scared of them mainly because of their size swimming in brackish water should be done with caution anyway
  having a capy is legal in here  once i get my own home im getting one  imma build a pond for it and we will be bff and ever
      t manatees
  sounds similar to some people here
  cool but how long do they live
  810 years
my boss at a place i interned at used to work with manatees she said that one of the male manatees figured out how to suck its own cock
  based
  wouldnt a species go extinct if the males could simply suck their own cocks
  no
friendly and harmless  yeah but they spook easy and move a lot of water very fast when they bolt
  ive done 2 snorkling with manatee tours and both times id get spooked because  other tourists would kick up mud it was like they were intentionally dredging it up  silt and sunlight create illusion of manatee cant tell if im seeing one or not  poking my head in and out of the water trying to hear what other people are sayinggoing  manatee jumpscare  if i ever do it again ill have to do it with less people so i can actually see whats in front of me 1 of my favorite animals
manatee jumpscare  be manatee  swims around minding my own business eating stuff and farting  sees a group of hoomans snorkling around  want to be kind and greet them  swims up to them  one very obsese male bigger than me turns his head towards me  hi   he shits himself and faints  what did he mean by this
  not necessarily they might evolve an extra rib to stop it from happening
  how theyre slow floating meat tubes  i dont think they can even bite
no    
  fuck no theyre fucking evil and viscous there are stories of then gang raping sharks and alligators and divers they will attack boats too they cause more deaths than any other sea creature
  the onion  senpai
  when the guy said that manatees emit a highpitched noise my duck started chirping and i got confused for one second thinking if it was really her or if it was the video
  people have been drowned by a manatee just pressing them down with their bulk
  literally just swim around it  grab onto it and climb over it to be on top of it  literally anything how do you get drowned by a living marshmallow log
search for manatee attacks  just videos of people being scared because a manatee got too close to them
  obviously youve seen one in action they are lightning fast when they want to be ive seen them rip the arms of legs off victims in seconds then gorge on the blood
had one bump into me once in the water like head on just floated into me dopey things
  the same way you get drowned by massive inanimate objects theres nothing to grab and panicking doesnt help
  thats the peoples fault for being fucking retards
  youre lucky it didnt attack it must have just fed on something or youre a skinny dyel and it didnt seen you as a threat youre lucky to be alive
  die that manatee just walk
  to help the first manatee finally succeed to fucking it in the ass  i fucking lost my shit
  also they cant really accidentally kill you like whales can pretty easily
  fuck dude wicked triple hold down how did she survive
  ive had acttualy met some wild capybaras yesterday and they are really fucking chill
  your grammar is unintentionally humorous
  da fuck bro
  trips confirms ive personally seen a manatee crush a 27 foot alligator with ease and then throw the carcass onto shore just to show the tourists then the manatee flipped onto its back in the water and gurgled the blood in its mouth spewing it out and then sucking it back out of the water cool critters
  based
  if you spook them they can move at bursts of 20 mph so they can hurt you on accident
  this is at blue spring park and its honestly one of the coolest places in florida there are a bunch of manatees and alligators living together in complete peace and there has yet to been a recorded incident between the two animals there the manatees will actually be playful towards the gators and it becomes a surreal sight to see a manatee just pushing around or floating with a 8 ft gator
  you might be mixing those up with the dogong who are ocean going around indonesia and australia i saw some old tv show years ago with my brother and they were explaining that the dogong were the source of the mermaid lore it was so funny that his wife was giving us dirty looks
  you do realize this is a joke video right
  so cute 3
      a capybara killed a pitbull in my country it dragged it underwater until it drowned it was protecting the smaller ones  if they get ticks and the ticks bite you you get some disease that kills you tho
anyone else notice that manatees and dugong look like third stage guild navigators
  good one
  they are the same specie manatees are capybaras that love to swim too much  t phd in capybaralogy
    why doesnt the alligator eat or attack the capybara/manatee
  seals are curious af
  based and seacowpilled
  nah
  youre mistaking them with somalis
  male manatees headbutt small boats sometimes    really though they move like 2mph they couldnt hurt you if they wanted
  maybe theyre trying to mate with the boats
there are so few manatees and dugong left that a boat seem to be a sexy target for a horny male
  based
  yeah theyre pretty darn harmless and we never hurt humans or anything like that they are friends to the world
  we
  oh my god imagine bing one of those lil monkeys haha loook at them
  i found two young capybaras once size of a puppy they died shortly after though but theyre really pretty animals my moms uncle had like 100 of them in his ranch he called them capy capy capy and they came running to him it was honestly quite amazing
can this motherfucker kill you serious question about βcarotene
  i imagine you could stab someone in the throat with a frozen carrot
  wild carrots kinda look like hemlock which can kill you
    i meant overdose n shiet you jokers
made me think of this  
  oxidative splitting of betacarotene yields two molecules of vitamin a vitamina a can be poisonous when consumed in high quantity say eating polar bear liver however you are unlikely to kill yourself by eating carrots youd sooner die from complications of a distended gastrointestinal tract from eating the needed quatities of carrots
  die from distended gastrointestinal tract  brutal
  and when it melts away there is no murder weapon a perfect crime 
  i remember reading the vitamin a you get from carrots is different from the vitamin a you get from liver and certain other sources and it cant end up overdosing you since the process to synthesize it is different
  unfortunately i cant get me a liver from a polar bear
  youd still have a bloody carrot left it would just be wet and cold
  not funny
  hmmmmmm
    old timey internet had a semipopular site dedicated to the idea of doing exactly this or maybe it was a sharpened frozen banana i think it was on geocities
  im 23 atm literally eaten minimum 15 whole carrots a day like 320 days out of every year since i was 11 had a goal when i started to try and turn my skin orange never happened but turns out i fucking love carrots so it works out    still a fat fuck at 260 60 but at least im a fat fuck who eats a lotta carrots aint killed me yet kinda think it helps my teeth too since im real bad at brushing regularly but have never had dental problems during my yearly dentist visit like a dog greenie or some shit scours em
  one and a half carrots a day isnt a lot were you stupid at the time you set that goal and then only consumed a normal quantity of carrots
  fat people think eating a lot of vegetables means eating a carrot a day
  fat peoples think    wrong
op looks probably like this
my 89 month or so old cat decided to slip out while my garage was open not sure where he is how long would he be able to survive would he come home its currently 27 degrees with a lot of snow right now and it feels like its 13 degrees with wind chill im using fahrenheit im worried about my cat but he has a tag and is microchipped
sorry missing im worried and misspelled it
kills you
becomes anemone
in 2016 i started searching for a dog to adopt i found bowie on petfinder and spoke to his foster i told her i wanted to rescue a dog and i would be willing to take on any problems except biting because my husband and i were planning to try for a baby soon and it wouldnt be safe she promised he wasnt a biter and we adopted him     i drove hours to pick him up and on the way home he bit me twice he would bite strangers on the street when i took him for walks and bark ferociously at other dogs almost 3 years later although very affectionate at times he still bites me and the vet if we try to clip his nails or wipe him down when hes dirty hes drawn blood from the vet and me more than once when hes calm he loves my husband and i and we love him hes become a member of our family i believe bowie has overcome a lot of trauma with us and has become a much happier dog but he still bites under stress    we have a four month old baby now as we planned im really scared for when my son is old enough to reach for bowie or crawl toward him i have not told my husband how worried i am but today was the first day i felt like maybe i cant have him anymore a car drove by our house and he started ferociously barking and woke up the baby and admittedly i yelled at him and shooed him out of the baby room and he started growling at me i feel badly for yelling at him which i usually try not to do i dont want to wait for an accident to happen with my son     what would you do bowie loves me and my husband despite his emotional outbursts it would be like losing a family member     im also worried that bowie is not adoption material and will not find a happy home hes very loud and aggressive to strangers and has big teeth on top of being a tripod im so sad about the situation
  why are people so irresponsible get a damm pet before their kid so they ditch the pet after you should be required to qualify before getting a pet    id say get rid of the sex trophy of course i detest kids anyway and wish all the little bastards would vanish but thats just me
  as much as i like animals the baby takes priority over the dog since the baby was planned you really have no excuse for putting yourself in this situation  at least you didnt get a pitbull
oh man you failed to train a dog and now youre going to attempt to train a functional human
  have you tried beating the shit out him when he bites you your pets should have the fear of god in them if they so much as look at you wrong if they dont you are a shit dog owner and your dog has no respect for you wolves will straight up kill one of the pack if it fucks up or gets out of line
  are you a pibble owner
  they shouldnt even have a pet to begin with always have the kid first how do you know they kid wont have allergies     have your stupid kid raise it to an appropriate age for pets then get a pet but thats not how self centered self important known it all millennials think they care about satisfying their sense of instant gratification now and worrying about the consequences later     poor decision making is always a good indication of shit tier parents kid doesnt stand a chance
you havent tried professional training
  youll grow past the age of 15 eventually
  eh not that guy but im 25 and cant fucking stand kids as well dont want those anywhere near me
  i mean mentally  but honestly those who think that way should not ever have children anyway so i guess thank you for not procreating
  of course i detest kids anyway and wish all the little bastards would vanish but thats just me  
  op said they confirmed over the phone with the foster owner that the dog didnt bite foster lady lied
  why didnt you confront the foster lady about the biting issue if the dog even bit you on the way home from picking it up
  honestly i dont know i had heard about a decompression phase where dogs are not themselves and we were hoping that was the problem
  well youre two years too late to return the dog to that foster care and its dangerous to have a dog like that around a child start looking around for a shelter that will accept him the biting is an issue but him being a tripod dog honestly increases his chances of being adopted people love adopting animals like that surprisingly maybe try putting up some ads yourself to find him a new home so he can go to someone that will be able to put up with him
adopting from lying rescues  adopting a chihuahua the prime snappy dog  keeping your aggressive mexican rat for 3 years instead of returning it to the lying rescue    sounds like pasta but dogfags really are this stupid fortunately your disabled dog might maul your baby but not maul it to death
  let me adopt your child train your dog not to bite and try for another one
    stupid bitch kept the dog even though it bit her right when she first got him and now she comes onto 4chan to cry about it kek
  so much this they have to learn their place in the pecking order of the pack its literally instinctual if you dont do it youre a shit pack leader and its no wonder they try to challenge you
  and they should have turned their happy asses around and brought it back after it bit them twice just on the way home or within the 2 years they didnt have a baby but still had a bitey dog
  is hours in a car supposed to be a long drive why didnt you just turn back and give him back if it he bit you twice on the way did you think it would just get better over time if you ignored it does making a long drawn out post on 4chan make you feel better about not being responsible for your adopted animal wow you yelled at a dog and shood him out of a room must be an elaborate troll post
  when is your brain going to decompress
yeah op honestly eveyone is going to chew you out on here but i cant really blame you much people on here make too many excuses for these damn animals the stupid fucking dog should have learned to stop biting in 3 fucking years if it refuses to learn after that long you should honestly just dump it in a shelter or go out back and put a bullet in its head because your baby takes a much higher priority or maybe try professional help if youre reallythat attached to it and have a lot of money to burn i wouldnt take any chances if it was my baby but i know how women are and that you would probably quicker hope nothing goes wrong than get rid of it so professional help is probably your best shot
  they also had three years of this dog biting them and other people three fucking years they shouldve brought the dog back after it bit them the fist time but theyre useless weak and brain dead now theyre sad about the situation fuck them
almost 3 years later  he still bites me
need advice on discerning a microscopic creatures identity based on a picture i saw in a book once    it was a row of what looked like small mammaries there were three rows of three on top of each other and surrounding it were some kind of pinchers that seemed to surround the breast like things    please help    let me know
its basically impossible the description you gave only tells me that it was a coccus species but when i get home i will try to do some research why do you need this though
  eagle
  looks like a brown recluse to me
what kind of bug is this gf thinks it might be a type of termite
side note it had wings before we killed it
  he has a gf  has she ever been outside thats obviously an ant
brown recluse
ant queen
  is it
  yes ant queen have wings but shed them after they start a colony
people dont know what a fucking ant is    /an/ how the fuck are people this sheltered
  never underestimate the normies lack of knowledge about animals all theyve learned about them probably comes from disney movies
  termite  that is clearly an ant if its usually large for the ants in your area its most likely a princess ant juvenile queen or a drone male
    didnt read that post if the wings fell off easily it is a princess ant/drone a parasitic wasps wings dont shed like reproductive caste ants do
  are you saying that hyenas arent evil
  you can tell its an ant because of the kink in the antennae and the curvy body layout for future reference
  whats its size and whats your location and ill find the species for you i would say 75 positive its an ant with a very slight possibility of it being a solitary wasp only because i cant recognize it and it looks rather unique for most ant genus
  definitely not a termite probably an ant
  how can they fly with wings on input one side and besides all the winged ants ive seen had wings on both sides
  retard
  probably an ant  probably  god what the fuck happened to this place are you guys even humans
pitbull ant
  there are lots of insects in the world some of them look a bit like ants its better to hedge your bets rather than pretend you know everything
  the only ants i can think of which matches this appearance are tetraponera rufonigra and myrmecia nigrocincta im pretty certain in isnt the later i just also dont think its t rufonigra     word to the wise give more than a shitty picture when wanting to know what something is
  its an ant you utter fucking mongoloid retard dont breed with your equally retarded gf pls we dont need your genes
brown recluse
why do ag gag laws exist
  pigs make me furious
industrial espionage has always been illegal
this is all due to overpopulation
  they exist to protect european and asian bureaucrats from criticism they dont have a constitution like we do in the states theyre a sad fucking lot
  because photographic evidence of animal cruelty in the meat industry is bad for business  what other answer do you require no one cares people are consumed enough with their own lives and i 100 guarantee that there is no vegan ever wouldnt eat meat even from the most tortured of animals if he/she was starving  they say a full stomach comes before morality    of course the moral choice would be to go vegan but no one gives a fuck about being moral if theyre not actively shamed into it
  who the fuck made you the judge and decider of morality  you come across as a cunt deciding that for others now go protest something since thats probably all you have in life
  wow real cunt like of you sound like this knowitall lady who loves to bitch out anyone for anything a few desks down from me
  turn off that resourcewasting computer right now you immoral piece of shit
  they say a full stomach comes before morality  meat isnt cheap though i dont see how this would come up some kind of donner party/ soccer team airplane situation
  why do people pretend to be sad about this  oh no its wrong they throw them on the concrete its much better to kill them in other ways even though we have no idea what happens after death or how much pain they feel  i cant wait until people start claiming eating vegetables is wrong and only eat fruits that fall off trees
  so you think that sedating an animal and jamming a highpressure bolt into its brain is more painful than beating its head against the ground
  veganism isnt really a thing for 90 of the human population most people would laugh at the idea of animal feelings    wealthy western children have the luxury of pretending animals feel things and the angst to hate any ideas their parents had but this wont last the vegans of today will learn to starve before the century is over if for no other reason than that veganism isnt a lot more sustainable than any other western diet  they rely entirely on fossil fuels for their survival just like meat eaters
  you think we sedate them  lol
  yes the stun gun isnt just for fun
  lol holy shit    the stun gun is the same thing as the captive bolt gun    we call it a stunner because pneumatic bolt to the brain gun just doesnt sound as nice    what the stunner does is mechanically crush the forebrain using a bolt driven into and sometimes through the skull this renders the animal insensate while still allowing the heart to keep beating and the lungs to usually keep breathing which makes draining the blood much easier exsanguination works best on a live animal    so no the stun gun isnt just for fun and its just another name for the captive bolt gun
  yes insensate is another word for being sedated it means having the senses annulled there is also an electric jolt which does not help kill it only helps with the stunning dont try to fool me i killed a bunch of animals part time when i lived in cowra
  there is also an electric jolt which does not help kill it only helps with the stunnin  not on any stunner ive ever seen    the point is the animal isnt sedated in any way before their brain is crushed which in theory makes it about as comfortable or as painful as having your head smashed in on concrete either way youre not going to feel it unless its done wrong    insensate doesnt mean sedated you can look them up if you like
  but we have those laws in the us
  this    american anons may not be aware but usually when peta busts a farm or slaughterhouse for animal abuse its because someone volunteered to break those laws its a weird thing people do going undercover in the ag industry to document abuse among coworkers who are often also their unsuspecting friends
  i love that picture
  peta is shit but laws like this are to protect companies from laws to prevent this abuse because if its exposed it means these companies get in trouble for abuse and lose money for not abusing animals peta hippies or what its not right
  i will never touch cow meat again
  desu i think pigs are pretty funny in their death throws so this doesnt bother me    just the way their legs spasm makes me giggle
one day well discover a way to efficiently and humanely produce enough food to satiate and sustain a dozen billion people  until then im all fucking ears but the world cant just eat cabbage
  why not oh it turns out your argument falls apart the moment you have to actually think about it too bad
  why not eat cabbage because people would get incredibly sick from malnutrition humans need animal based food in their diet for good health or everyone will have to be on supplements
  im all for meat this isnt specifically anti meat not that anon but it should be an issue how you get it meat laws like this are trying to prevent anything humane its not about killing something its about how its done and letting people getting to torture and abuse outside of guidelines
  i think its fine i mean i eat meat and dont usually agree with peta on anything but on the flip side theres no need to abuse farm animals stopping people from abusing farm animals just seems like common sense
  good that all resources required to farm on that scale are infinite we can just sit around eating and multiplying forever
  i agree completely unfortunately common sense and decency are becoming more and more rare especially when there is a monetary gain to be had
      bolt guns are powered by what is basically blank gun cartridges not electricity
      the companies do not abuse the animals why would they its only a liability the abuse is happening at the hands of those unsuspecting friends who step out of line and that misstreating the stock beyond the misstreatment thats needed for meat production fuck them no in fact flay them alive
  and then there is this    
  i dont think animal abuse is the norm even in the big companies
  the moral choice is to go vegan  only if those are your morals but vegans like to pretend like the only morality that exists is the one that make their feelings okay so what would you know about the arguments for morality
  product made from mass production of animals find their way in loads of consumer goods that many vegans still use i do not have an issue with veganism per se but vegans usually do not look at society as a whole and do not poder holisitc solutions to the problem and instead usually subscribe to the liberal or often even straight out regressive side of the political spectrum they want to shame me for eating meat but chinks and mudslimes are ok
  vegans still assume that their existence will still cause some suffering and death of animals like stepping on ants etc here is the definition that most of us go by veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude as far as is possible and practicable all forms of exploitation of and cruelty to animals for food clothing or any other purpose you should feel ashamed for consuming animal products it is completely unnecessary unless you have no alternatives for survival its worse for the environment and animal food products contain cholesterol high levels of saturated fat and even some have trans fat the only reason most people consume animal products is for taste pleasure so does taste pleasure justify all the negative aspects of the animal product industry
  we would have a lot more food if we didnt eat meat meat is a horribly inefficient use of resources ultimately takes about 100 calories of grain to make 3 calories of beef about 36 of our agriculture goes to feeding livestock
  we would have a lot more food  yeah moar niggers and more surplus of shitty grain is exactly what the world needs
  it cant be that inefficient if companies are profiting off it
  what about situation in europe
  so just breed people exponentially with all this extra food not like people use resources during the course of their life
  morality is relative  not even vegan but come on relative or subjetive morality is essentially no different from amorality
  the companies do not abuse the animals  the us doesnt work that way we acknowledge that the company is responsible for the safety and behavior of its workers    so if the company isnt training and monitoring its employees its the company abusing animals not just its workers
  yet in usa mass corporate fraud is pretty much legal
  we would have a lot of shit peasant food for niggers plant based diet is a meme everyone should have access to grass fed free range animal products fresh fish and the likes
    actually its you two coming across as high and mighty cunts op asked a question anon responded  why the fuck did you two idiots react so oddly
  but why smash piglets in concrete arent they suitable for farming are they ill i cant imagine it being cheaper or more practical than raising them up as stock so what gives
  that isnt true we could just eat spirulina
  takes resources to feed/raise them so they mash em up
  they arent growing fast enough in those cases  they arent suitable for the system theyre in     its part of the same culling practice that has made pigs 75 heavier than they were hundreds of years ago
  literally the most environmentally friendly clothing all comes from animals everything else pollutes like crazy which guess what kills more animals wool is highly efficient as in they simply shear the sheep but in the case of sheep and lambskin they are killed for meat and cloth in the case of cashmere/merino/yak/pashmina the animal is never killed yaks only when food is short and instead sheared routinely and kept in mostly humane environments
im going to post a platypus in this thread every day until all of /an/ wants to snuggle a puggle    previous thread    this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
i already want a platypus thanks op
  the previous thread was created at the start of august  what the fuck
  hypothetically speaking how would you care for one of these in captivity
lets platytoast for another platyear
hey guys this is my first time posting here but i am just feeling a bit unsettled by something  so i was visiting my parents and nephew he lives with grandparents weird family stuff  so theyve taken in this green anole that they just found outside and kid wanted to keep its a male also pic related but im not sure if its really being treated correctly  nephew showed me pics of when he first caught him and the poor thing is just skin and bones now i think his right hind leg might be broken as the bone on there was bulging and he seemed to not be able to bend it they say he hasnt really wanted to eat anything since theyve gotten him about a week and the poor thing seems miserable im not an expert on reptiles or anything so forgive me if i get something wrong  nephew is always taking the thing out never wanting to leave it alone or feed it he likes to carry it around everywhere and shifts his hands to make it run from one to the other sometimes it falls onto hard ground and i wince every time but he just laughs also lizards name is thanos i dont want to just take it and let it go because it seems to not want to do anything and its awful cold outside  nephew would throw a fit and parents might find out and get mad at me theyre nice people and nephew is sweet i just dont think they really did research    sorry for wall of text
  how are you so retarded you did not immediately explain that all life must be treated with gentleness and respect children arent as dumb as you think explain to him that he needs to put it in a habitat with food and water show him search results of what it requires on your phone and explain to him it needs to be held only when he is is sitting still remind him that if he were the size of a lizard he would be scared of being picked up by giants and would be scared of not having his parents and not receiving food it will die soon probably so you should also gently make him ashamed of himself for allowing this if you are still there when that happens
    oh and alternative convince him to release back to the wild and explain to him that if he is a good boy then his parents may eventually give him a proper pet explain there are many animals that are not interested in being a friend for humans the weather does not matter to wild animals
they took a wild animal out of its natural habitat now it has some kid constantly touching it dropping it and im sure probably screaming at it hes stressed that thing to death of course youre going to be unsettled best thing is to let it back out who cares what your parents think shouldve used their brains
its probably invasive anyways
  stop being a passive aggressive bitch i used to catch garder snakes and lizards all the time growing up the two garter snakes i kept lived over 10 years and the lizard about that long too it took them a couple days to get aclimated to people and were totatlly fine most reptiles are very adaptable    this anon is right talk to your nephew and the grandparents if he isnt going to actually take care of it then they should release it spell out to your granparents that lizards need to eat every day and it needs a uvb light or it will die a horrible death those things are expensive for what they thought was a free pet so im sure they would rather just let it go  my son has been taking care of his pet snake since he was 6 years old taking care of animals and treating them with respect is something even small children can learn unfortunately there are adults who have never been taught and dont have the mental capacity to understand that without being taught
  theyre nice people and nephew is sweet  they are animal torturing psychopaths
  retarded  lol dude calm your tits
go get some small crickets must be small and bring them over also a spray bottle with water and spray something for him to lick they might also eat small pieces of orange
  hi op this isnt a hugbox if you didnt have the thought of correcting the child yourself then you may have some slight autism people may look past children teasing bugs and lizards but it could grow into teasing/abusing other animals as they get older

  well theyre currently being replaced so the autism will vanish anyways
between the two major groups of carnivora which one is the most successful which one has the best chance for survival in the future do you suspect a future diversification of one group than other    in my opinion feliformes have better cunning speed and strategy than caniformes they have also produced some of the most unique and specialized animals in the past like smilodon however where they fall short is predation success rate even in groups lions their rate of a successful kill is low they also seem to be more affected by human encroachment than caniformes      as for caniformes their strength comes from power bears and their strong social bonds foxes dogs they seem to be more generalist feeders compared to feliformes and can work to their advantage in times of food hardships they also have higher success when it comes to predation wild dogs wolves foxes caniformes also seem to fair better with human interaction domestic dogs arent the only ones more people seem to be able to train bears raccoons and mustelids far better than felines which may help in future survival    what does /an/ think
  theyll be fine cunt
  
  mustelids win it for the carniformes
  next time read the actual post cunt
  neither group is going extinct any time soon but how they change will depend on what the environment is like in the future which we have no way of possibly predicting  feliformes are more successful in some aspects like climbing but tend to occupy fewer ecological niches than caniformes overall  feliformes are clearly dominant in africa and thats unlikely to change but elsewhere in the world where the larger feliformes such as panthera spelaea miracinonyx trumani and the saber toothed cats are extinct wolves are the often the dominant predator  with the rapidly changing environment of today those with more generalist lifestyles like foxes coyotes raccoons and bears will probably fare better at least in the short term
  true and well examined from a non expert perspective iirc small/medium sized felids have the highest hunting success rate among terrestrial predators but idk why they are more endangered than other similar species specially by a lack of population weird reproductive behaviour and low adaptation to change hard to tell op
  because feliformes are more specialized lacking taste receptors for sweet they are more at risk for extinction but its not a big risk
i would not be surprised if one of the ursids experienced a sort neolithic revolution if while purposefully stockpiling food they begin to note that seeds sprout more edible plants they would have the power to protect fields with their own strength they do that anyway with wild growth if a species evolved to be more social and therefore share experiences that would probably be the push they need  imagine some posthuman hominids running through the woods finding a bear homestead and trying to steal food only to find that the bears had put out monkey traps and theyre smiling on their porch as the pests get tangled up ready to rip them up for stew meat with their claws
    caniformes occupy a wider range of environments including the sea caniformes are also more generalist in their feeding habits some exceptions like pandas compared to most feliformes are obligate in their dietary requirements     i believe that if the earth continues on its current path with human interference and development  caniformes will be better off
  caniformes will most likely go the way of pigs and such being mainly omnivorous consuming anything they can eat the only group of canines that are better than felines in hunting success are awds and thats mainly due to the fact that awds have much larger packs whilst also hunting primarily much smaller meals the statistics that contribute to their hunting success can range from small lizards to antelope its an extremely ignorant comparison especially considering one hunt for a lion pride can feed them all for days meanwhile dogs have to constantly hunt due to much smaller meals even in proportion to their body size and also because of the sheer amount of running they do during their huntsexhausting them and leaving their food to be easily stolen which is also never noted in these comparisons lions hardly if ever get their food stolen
  felines are better predators than canines overall but dholes are doing fine despite having to compete with tigers and leopards and wolves tend to be dominant over cougars in north america not to mention all the kill stealing by brown bears north america in particular has the highest diversity of caniformes along with europe but their success there can probably be attributed to the extinction of large felines from the area since south america is more feline dominated  omnivorous caniformes like foxes will probably do better for now but obligate carnivores will still be around especially those that dont have to compete with feliformes at all such as polar bears and seals this is all assuming that humans dont cause any more extinctions
feliformia dont live in the sea or poles git gud
  feliforms more unique and specialized  zero aquatic feliforms    feliforms also have jack shit for stamina so that marginally higher top end speed is useless when bears and wolves can run at 30mph for miles    i also dont think any cats have nearly the level of intelligence as wolves 3 grey wolves can basically successfully kill anything by just running it ragged 3 lions can barely tackle an antelope with more than a 40 success rate because they cant chase the animal for any significant amount of time
how are these fellas so smart /an/
things that you can say about your pet but not your girlfriend
  i have no gf
  hard mode things you can say to both without it being a compliment   quit leaving your hair all over the place
  shes 3dimensional
can i boop you in the snoot
  i clean up their poop
shut the fuck up youre not starving
i like how thick her fur is
  its almost like she understands every word i say
  shes happy with a 10 toy and some peanut butter
  things that you can say about your pet but not your girlfriend  i love u
  shes real
  unfortunately this is not true for me when my gf gets hungry just because were a couple hours late for dinner she acts like she hasnt eaten for days    before her i would have never imagined this from someone weighing less than 120 lbs
shes a good little bitch
she sucks my cock
good looking pussy
hermit crabs    theres no reason to own any all storebought ones have been through hell and their living requirements are autistically strict
but op what if your girlfriend is your pet
why not both
  i only bathe her twice a month
  she really likes sleeping in her crate
she took the knot like a champ when i had her breed with that registered champion stud dog
  trick question no one on this site has a girlfriend
  underated  bump
  ill be your gf anon
  ill love you with all my heart
  best in thread
  i remember where shes buried
  she loves me
        this was a genious idea for a thread bump
i like to boil her periods and eat them
he likes to get a good walk in every day to stay fit
just one sniff of my cunt gets him humping
  took a little longer than i thought but shes finally house broken
i didnt have to buy any more shoes after the second month of being with her
  sometimes i get home from work and when i open the fucking front door it smears shit all over the place because she shit in front of it i yell abby what the fuck and then she runs right up to me just like every other day but today theres shit smeared into the front carpet and she runs right through it and gets it all fucking over me  i wish i could just get rid of her
  i really enjoy that pussy
i love you
  clever girl
  its your partner shitlord
ive finally gotten her fleas under control
which is the superior rat
  norvegicus clearly    wider range  can tolerate poor environments  more adaptable  more robust  less shy  doesnt mind heat or cold  can scavenge or predate  domesticated to make cool pets  smarter  can occupy a wider rainge of habitats  can eat almost anything  chunky bois  will bully rattus rattus and win  never carried the plague    norvegicus still gets blamed for the plague even if it was only rattus that were carriers
  norvegicus cuh
  are wild type norvegicus naturally averse to biting  or how did we breed bitiness out of them  ive had a gerbil a hamster tons of mice and tons of rats and even the most inbred feeder stock rats were chill as fuck and would only cry rather than bite if i accidentally closed the cage on their foot or something    meanwhile every other rodent was bitey as fuck often for no reason at all
  how did we breed bitiness out of them  mine never stopped being a biter she would climb from my arms to bite my ear lobe till i bleed scary motherfucker once she got out of her cage i tried to sleep but she kept trying to bite my face and when i was looking for her she would run and hide i felt like i was a prey that night
  it didnt occur to you to set up a trap
  well maybe you should try not having such delicious earlobes then  incidentally i found out that origibal newskin with the clove like scent is absolutely irresistible to rats   i used to get minor cuts on my hands at an old job and noticed that every time i opened the bottle the rat cages turned into storms of activity followed by every rat clinging to the cage bars and staring at me    so naturally i poked my freshly swabbed finger at the cage and immediately got a chunk taken out of it

t rex was the ultimate dinosaur the biggest and baddest meateater to ever live on land in the entire history of earth it was a bussized bonecrunching machine 40 feet long 7 or 8 tons in mass a head the size of a bathtub with 50some railroad spike teeth it used to literally break the bones of its prey so it had brawn and plenty of it but it also had brains it had a large brain so it was intelligent and it had very keen senses particularly of smell sight and hearing it was probably that dual threat of brains and brawn that was its secret weapon    based steve
  i knew all of this whats new
  it has feathers too like the chicken have
  true all true    except the brains part  if you ignore the olfactory bulbs the thing had a brain only slightly larger than a crocodiles and much smaller than a sparrows for comparison an 8 foot croc has a brain not much larger than a thumbtack this is a particularly stupid animal and t rex was not a lot smarter
  how does it feel knowing the most powerful land predator to exist on earth can be outrun with a light jog and dies to cow tipping
  except the brains part  not so much three problems with what you posit first is that crocodiles are not so dim as youd expect second is that when you exclude the olfactory bulbs the eq of t rex is still double the eq of the smartest extant crocodilians cuban crocodiles third is that small bodied animals like sparrows have big brains for their body by comparison because some brain functions have minimum sizes so the portions of the brain are the same size in a being that weighs a gram as they are in a being that weighs 50 kg or moreven which is why capuchin monkeys have a brain to body ratio double that of a human so you cant just use brain to bodyweight comparisons to declare that a 6 ton nonavian theropod is less intelligent than a 30 gram avian theropod    i mean it wouldnt shock me if they were roughly comparable house sparrows are fairly smart but this is something we cant determine solely from the evidence we have    kinematics studies have indicated that while it probably couldnt run as a fully grown adult it probably could still walk 3040 kilometers per hour thats not quite a light jog
  you cant actually use eq as evidence that a dinosaur was smart and then complain that it doesnt work    either it works and rex is a tiny bit smarter than a crocodile or it doesnt work so its not dumber than a bird
  you are a lackwit eq isnt a straight ratio its a ratio with control factor to allow you to compare animals with simipar lifestyles within a few orders of magnitude in size    yes it breaks down when youre comparing something thats 30g to something thats 200000 times larger but it can be used to compare something thats 80000 g to something thats 75 times larger    the wildcard is lifetstyle small seed and insect eating fliers are obviously different from semiaquatic ambush predators are obviously different from a terrestrial macrofauna predator    what rankels is that you are using a faulty understanding of comparative anatomy to prove something is as dumb as an animal that you have an outdated concept of the intelligence of and then use my explanations as to the factors that give larger animals better actual intelligence compared to small animals in a given brain to body mass ratio class to try and claim im saying eq which again is not straight brain to body mass ratio doesnt work youre being deliberately obtuse    again t rex has a brain thats about twice as large as you would expect in a 6 ton crocodilian so unless it has a lifestyle that is far less mentally engaging than a crocodile unlikely odds are good it is significantly smarter than a crocodile    and the intelligence gap between a croc and a bird is smaller than you think
  it breaks down when youre comparing something thats 30g to something thats 200000 times larger but it can be used to compare something thats 80000 g to something thats 75 times larger    you have no evidence that this is true  you just have your own desire to believe it    eq is used to effectively compare the intelligence of birds and whales so your complaints about size and lifestyle are pure bullshit
  uhhh you do know the smartest mesozoic dinos were about as smart as a opossum or an ostrich both not particularly smart animals
  taking a faggoty fanboy seriously just because hes squatting in the dirt with a hat on

knickers looms above the thousands of other cattle that he feeds with in rural western australia    at some 1400kg 220st and 194cm 6ft 4in the sevenyearold is believed to be the biggest steer in a country home to millions of cattle and his size has proved to be his saving grace when owner geoff pearson tried to put him up for auction last month meat processors said they simply couldnt handle him  so knickers avoided the abattoir he will now live out the rest of his life on lake preston feedlot in myalup 136km 85 miles south of perth    when he was young when we first got him we had a brahman steer a breed of cattle which was a friend of his explains mr pearson so his name was bra so we had bra and knickers we never thought he would turn into a big knickers
  thats so sad they wouldnt take him because he was too big poor guy its not his fault we should get together a charity mission to go butcher him by hand
in awe at the size of that lad

  shocking fda approves new steroid    hello clickbait
  in awe at the size of that lad  what an absolute unit
  damn hes huge
  its actually the presence of testosterone that causes the growth plates in long bones to close sooner this is why steers are taller than bulls though a bull might actually be more musucular and stronger the steers height actually makes pulling weight easier and thus working oxen are generally castrated human castratos and eunuchs were reportedly taller than intact men     an old ass dairy steer surrounded by calves that are a few months old and arent even the same breed   wowe what a bige cowe

i love british shows and watch quite a bit in many at night in nonurban areas there is this horrible short screaming noise that is rather disturbing but no one every seems to care within the shows themselves for years ive been watching these and never new what it was figuring it some kind of creepy native bird or one of many mutant british children     turns out it is the horrible noise foxes make creepy as fuck
  reminds me of this thread on /an/ a couple days ago       
  id set everything around my house on fire then pave it i love animals but fuck that

at what altitude do deer become elk
about 104
  as the eagle flies relative to sea level
  i heard it starts at 98 but i guess at 104 most of them have turned
  at what rainfall amount do elk become moose
  according to rdr2 very high altitudes
at what depth does a deer become a raindeer
so like a line of pokémon id say youd go  deer  elk  moose   i dont understand the lifecycle of these animals why are they the only mammals to have a larval stage like frogs

  this actually made me uncomfortable until i read the research article    it seems to me the crows were somewhat trained to understand water displacement even though they were wild captured    also animal intelligence/selfawareness discussion thread
 is this just learned behaviour or does the orca actually understand how baiting works
  orca puts a fish as bait and catches/eats a bird couldnt find a full gif small enough to post you can look it up
  the fact that they are mentally capable of understanding the concept of water displacement at all enough to be trained in how to use it proves how fucking smart they are
my guppy nips at my corys so he can take their pellets
  orcas can perform complex strategic attacks on other animals   signaled by the alpha female two of the faster ones will move ahead and eventually flank on either side the prey will run into them or will be forced to turn around when it does so it will slow down a bit and run into the slower of the whales    coordinated attacks also exist by knocking animals off of floating ice directly into another whales open mouth    the alpha female also is receptive to the feelings of its pack and will purposely try to force the pack to put a hungry whale in the position to get the most prey    the complexity of their communication and evidence in teaching new generations shows intelligence that isnt just instinctual  whales in captivity spend the majority of their first couple years exploring everything in their prisons with serious intent to understand
  many animals have high cognitive ability what they dont have is hand language and proper education

  my tetras just straight rob my betta but the would never attack him directly because he would fuck them up

why do people have cats    im taking care of a kitten for a friend for a few days and its a nightmare its pretty nice when they sleep but the food and shit management is so much worse on balance  and its fun to play for a few minutes a day but they want to play the entire day     so why
  maybe cause most people arent lazy faggots like you
  /thread
cats are like the easiest animal to own puppies are ten times worse than kittens holy shit
  not wanting to scoop shit and be annoyed to death all day by an ill tempered dumb animal is lazy
  not wanting to scoop shit and be annoyed to death all day by an ill tempered dumb animal  thread is about cats not dogs bro
  its yet another thread whinging about cats
  found the stinky catfag no one wants to be around
  cats are like the easiest animal to own    not even fucking close reptiles are far easier
  but dogs objectively smell worse than cats
  thats what (((they))) want you to think
  dies if temperature isnt exactly right  wont eat if temperature isnt exactly right  wont moult if temperature isnt exactly right  easy
  smart people get them in pairs and at 12 weeks old or older  in that case you have not much to do besides lay back and enjoy the cat kino scooping some litter two times a day and opening some cans isnt much work
  catfag  smelly  but dogs are the ones that fucking reek unless you bathe them every 30 minutes
this just in op is surprised a baby is high maintenance
  once a couple of the practice lizards die and the temperature is right youre golden
  if temp isnt right  you could have at least said something hard like humidity temp is the easiest thing to get right get a fuck all hot light and put it on one side of the cage if rep is cold it moves under light if its hot it moves away you have to be brain dead to not be able to take care of a reptile my 7 y/o son set up and takes care of his snake by himself minus me buying the mouse every 2 weeks

how do i build a nice natural looking tropical paludarium    pic related  my geosesarma tank    im in the process of planning a complete overhaul the plexiglass thing is leaking and i have a few other problems i want to archieve a better and more natural look with additional verticality
as the crabs prefer the wet i want to shrink the land side and add 33  swamp dividing the land and water areas i fill the holes between the large stones with fine gravel so it can be planted and overgrown im getting a jbl e401 external filter because my current one doesnt suffice for a water stream and less maintenance    which one of my concepts is better and why i could also need resources or tutorials how to improve my interior design
2nd pic which would be almost what i have now only swapped 1st pic would have more shoreline while this would offer a better swamp area
  ask either herpgen and / or invertgen it is full of people who have done this unless you talk about pitbulls or how shitty outdoor cats are you wont get many replies
both would be fine but personally i would go with  solely for aesthetic purposes as long as you have lots of sturdy plants like pothos and creeping jenny growing in the water that the crabs can climb on youll be fine
there really is no need for a filter with geosesarma   how many crabs do you have   my vamps rarely enter the water they like to enter the little cave or even dig under the moss they are in the water less than 20 of the time    i think the enclosure would look more natural if you have either the water part of the land part in the corner instead of on one side otherwise i like  better    whats wrong with your initial setup i think it looks amazing like that i would just replace the leaves on the land part with moss they love to eat it and maybe put some leaves in the water
  forgot to mention a swamp area is probably a good idea i think the reason why my crabs like the land part so much is because the dirt is always wet do make sure to put in lots of springtails and maybe isopods
  paludarium      the key is to have loads of lava gravel to biologically filter the water if the water can stay healthy all the plants etc will populate the tank on their own which will usually look nice and natural
  i just sort of threw everything in and hoped for the best
can i leave my budgie alone for a week with enough food and water
  i have to go to a trip
    you at least need to change the water daily do you not have anyone that can do this
no they have a very high metabolism theyll almost certainly die
  leave it with a pitbull
  get it some fucking toys anon
no
  no i dont what if i just give him multiple water dishes
ok then she will dead next week tt
  set her free give her a chance
  anon for god sake there must be someone you can trust   check with your neighbours or something your landlord maybe ask at a nearby charity or a church do it for your pretty girl
unless you have one of those expensive budgie punching machines no it will not survive    also remove cere
fellow budge owner here i would never never leave my animal alone find someone to watch over the little bugger even if its just to check in for food/water every day
  you little piece of fucking shit go kys
  no you absolute retard
  yaaaaas
  looool haha punch budgies loooool get it hahaha punc budghies
i trust her would not die i am travelling now
omg i want a pet bird but i like also want to go on vacations and have no friends or family who could check in on it daily  yassss im an entitled millennial being slightly entertained for a week and then becoming bored with it is more important than a living creatures life
  set her freee like dont keep her in a cage give her a chance lol like and share and upvote if you agree  kill yourself dumb virtue signalling shit stain this is how you ensure a painful and lonely death for that poor little bird  you dont know jack shit about birds go back to licking your dogs asshole faggot
my mom left me to take care of her budgies when i was a teenager and i killed it so   possibly not
also rip 4chan
what were you doing and how much did you get paid
  what we were doing was demersal fish surveys the boat did trawl fishing in several sample points and later we sorted the catches by species and depending on the info we wanted we took measurements sex and maturity take otholith genetics or just a crude headcount  i was working as an intern for a university proyect external to that survey so i also had to do extra stuff with cephalopods     as for the money i didnt get paid by the institution behind the survey because technically i was there as a voluntary and i was also getting paid by a scolarship but i heard that you get paid a lot for working in this kind of surveys like 210 euros a day or something dont quote me on that tho  and if that wasnt enough you dont have to pay accomodation or food and get free fish once you finnish the survey
  thats pretty cool do you plan on becoming a marine biologist
  technically i am one already as i have msc and all that shit i would need a phd though for more possibilities of getting a job or funding  if i get to be enrolled in more surveys better because this was my first one and even though sometimes its tiring it does pay off
  lets see your degree
  no way fagi am not falling for that one
  so youre a marine scientist but youre too stupid to block out a name and a date    surely you wouldnt come on the internet and tell lies would you
  that seems like a pretty good trip i hope you had a good time   i started my bachelor in biology at the start of september and im really looking forward to doing field work and not just dissections love the theory though   do you have any advice or tips on getting a succesful career in biology
  what you do is lie about your career to idiots on the internet  thats what i did and now im a successful marine biologist
    happy now  you could have checked the pictures if you wanted as well but i guess it is not enough      make contacts with your teachers and local researchers if you are still studying offer yourself as an aid for whatever proyect they are up tothey can always use a free hand i personally didnt do this if there was no payement and should have even with no scolarshipsto illustrate my point some people in the cruise were still students and somehow managed to get in theremuch to my surprise  also try to find scolarships shit like that sometimes the amount of money is the less important thing and the experience you get matters more  those are some of the few good tips i can offer
  do you actually have a successful career in biology it sounds like youre still in the volunteering for experience phase some people follow those tips for years before having to give up and actually earn some money in a different field
  happy now  i liked how you blocked out coruña
  im still with a foot on that phase to be honesti mean i barely finished my masters this very same year i may be able to start a phd but thats just next year   basically i was extremely lucky to have the opportunity to go on a research boat but if you are persistant hardworking and you dont come from a shithole country where scientific opportunities are rare like i did you could eventually get noticed  also to stay as a researcher wherever people will always point that the phd is the way so asap find some funded proyect that you like and go for it  i know this might not be the best tips but this year has been a pretty intense one so looking back i dont even know what the hell was going on      blowing my cover  i /may/ know who you are in that case fugg you  and if you arent that means the cover wasnt that good anywaybut you wouldnt believe me otherwise probably
  also forgot to dump another picture
  is cthulhu waking up anytime soon
  this thread might have gotten more responses if this was in your first post i overlooked the thread multiple times already because you were researching oil deposits for all i could tell    so what did you discover that was most interesting to you
  he likes to hang around in deeper waters than the ones we were so we couldnt monitor his constants ask any lovecraftologist or local cult they might know something      yeah should have thought that but i wanted to make the first pic one related to the boat and not go all in with the critters /an/ is a slow board anyway so i wasnt that concerned if there is a second thread i might do that  so what did you discover that was most interesting to you  in general there were lots of cool stuff ranging from small uncommon animals to big specimens of known fishes like this huge ass monkfish as many fish species that i havent seen before that are actually fairly common like dragonettes  related to the project big squids several species of cephalopods and we even got many live octopus in several ocassionsplus initial ideas relating to the data such as at what length are the sexes starting to be differentiable or a better understanding of the maturity stages
  i may have missed it whered you sail i work at sea on oil tankers gulf of mexico maybe we passed each other at one point lol
  difficult because im on the other side of the atlantic ocean
since the thread is pretty much inactive i will dump pics which was the main reason of the thread anyway
  a big todarodes sagittatus its relatively rare and it is a mostly deep sea species of squid
  some big sharks that we got they were measuredweighted and tagged before they were freed the biggest one was around 20 kilograms
  a very small dogfish
  some sea spiders i brought some alive back to land because one researcher wanted them that way and most of them made it despite being almost 5 days without feeding
  paromola cuvieri
  a parasitic amphipod phronima
  the cluster of eggs where this  came from
  giant turbot 16 kilograms iirc
  spotted dragonette they are kinda kawaii arent they
  a ebalia crab
  baby monkfish
  random benthic crap sorted
      a pod of common dolphins i only have video i think these ones followed our boat the whole day
  sea mice
  me annoying an octopus pic related to make it show its colour changing abilities   excuse the shitty quality the changes are less noticeable this way
  get free fish  what was the tastiest fish you kept
  the most expensive fishes  so probably the tastiest ones we got were john dorys and turbots but there was mostly whiting haddock and a bit of hake as welletc but you cannot get to decide which ones you take unless you are literally the only one interested at the end of each leg period of 10 days before going to land again all the caught edible fish that was big enough to be fileted gets shared between the crew  i managed to get a turbot in the first of my two stays and in the second got to recieve in my box 7 john dorys out of pure luck plus some fishes that i kept for myself in first place like anchovies and mackarel for my housemates  personally find haddocks and hake very tasty and got some but sadly i will probably have to give them away
  did you not eat that monk fish and its liver monk fish liver is like foie gras  also would you guys not eat the fish while you were out like say you guys got a few turbots could you clean them and have the cook prepare them or was it all frozen and divided at the end
  did you not eat that monk fish and its liver   the tail yes the tail of the monks is always fileted if it is big enough the guts/liver fuck no that shit smells like barf specially the ones of the big monk and the stench remained in the lab a bit after we disposed it  also would you guys not eat the fish while you were out  actually we do but mostly the common stuff like haddocksand not every daythe rest is frozen until the end the share is done mainly for the scientific staff but every now and then we also leave fish for the crew when they request it
  you missed out on that monk fish liver shit is delicious you poach it then sear it off after its cooked through
you ever see this thread op  
  i walked the camino a few years ago and hake was cheap and fresh the whole way forgot what its called in spanish/ gallego never got tired of it though delicious
  next time i go into one of these cruises hopefully soon ill have that in mind      no but i am getting hooked into it despite not being a normal /x/ lurker and all the pics are gone      merluza and yeah it is quite good we got some nice sized ones as well
  i hope you had a good time bro    i got back few weeks ago from sediment sampling on the eastern coast of the usa    are you bio specific or in a general marine science program
  thanks man it was a blast  are you bio specific or in a general marine science program  bio specific fisheries management   sediment sampling  seems interesting was it only physicalchemichalgeological stuff or did you have to deal with sediment critters as well
  this is from a marine biology student how do you get into a research vessel thats my dream job
    i also have an interest in marine biology and would want to work in a research vessel do you have any more squids or amphipods to show
op answer and i will cite you
  does your country have institutions with research vessels if so try contacting them either volunteer for some projects eventually gaining contacts or directly offer yourself for a survey or try to make your grade/masters thesis with them basically make yourself be known  during my stay in the boat there were some students in their masters phase that managed to get there fairly easily one of them already worked with the organizing institution plus i know a friend who did her thesis in a similar place and eventually got into a research vessel survey   i myself got there because i was part of a project that i was working on as a collaborator that required sampling i guess my experience isnt as useful as the experience of these other people at least if you are still a student      we only found that species of amphipod as for squids i have some more pictures and of 4 different species but i may have to reduce some because of size limit      have a you
tfw when you gave up on marine biology
  why tho
  i believed you anon you have nothing to prove  whats life at sea like ive been thinking about getting a job on a shipping vessel the money is okay and it sounds like an adventure
  not op but seasickness can be a real bitch like a torture and im not kidding
  no kidding ive seen some people react to it pretty violently i remember watching a lady leaning over the deck of a fishing boat vomiting her guts out while a violent storm was coming down on her head bad times  my mom gets it very badly planes trains cars boats etc ive never felt anything id describe as motion sickness i can read and use electronics in a moving vehicle with no problem how different is seasickness
  seething
  motion sickness is way more common in women than men often via bad genetics
  of course
  whats life at sea like  pretty nice actually kinda busy as we normally have to work between 10 and 12 hours a day usually starting at 800 thats including some meal breaks plus the time to reach a trawling station and/or the time of actual trawling if there isnt that much fish to sort in the previous catch boat movements can be quite a bitch specially when it comes to shower because the water goes everywhere in the bathroom and to walk around as sometimes you feel like you are part of a bad slapstick movie or doing a parody of michael jackson  also speaking of the money a note about   i got recently told that the 210 euros/day number is for the deckmasters and people organizing the expedition normal scientific crew gets 150/day and students used to get paid 95 euros/day until this year        actually i think i only felt seasick the first day but not on the verge of vomiting rather than just needing to sit down a while and taking some fresh air later i did the most sensible thing and what i should have done earlier took one of my sea sickness tablets and i took one a day the following three or four days after that i didnt really feel like i needed them  sure the days with worse waves there were moments where i felt a bit dizzy but the first day was more tranquil and still was the worst  still the crew has that covered as they have sea sickness tablets and even patches on the infirmary  how different is seasickness  probably not that much different as they are based on the same principle
marine biology  is this a jojo reference
nwn
  tfw you do literally everything to be accepted as real pet and noticed by humans for thousands of years   the most you achieve is getting run over by cars
  they are the best pets but the government doesnt want you to have one
  damn government keeping all the does for themselves
  area 51 is where they keep all the deer wives
  what makes them good pets
  they arent pets theyre wives
  same

  christ thing is covered in snow
  the funny thing is that this is actually an insult in deer langu     stomping the foot like that pretty much means fuck off you fucking cunt asshole fuck and i wouldnt be surprised it the way how it is executed also gives additional meaning  that woman probably just thought its cute though and parroted it

  thanks doc
  dank isis nasheed starts playing
enters store
hi do u have spaghetti here
none in deer size
nice store u got here shame if some knocked everything over and shat on the floor    dont mind them
now about that pasta
  those are some brazen deer i can never get within 50 feet of the ones around here before they bolt
  i got this pile of does that show up to the castle i work at for some fruit and scratches maybe you have evil in your heart or something
  i think its more like around here deer usually get bullets from humans instead of food and attention
  you can kiss them right on the mouth here and they just stand there
  and they just stand there    dont i repeat dont go that textual rabbit hole again i double dare you  i was lucky to forget about this and now you have to ruin it
do you live in deer heaven can you marry them too
  
  nobody around to stop you sometimes ill make a perfect seal around their snout and blow into them
  where is this promised land o blessed one
  its an island any more than that and the law will come break up my deer wife party
  only doe i have
  that doe has been dead for many many decades by now
  ddo you have pics of this purely platonic deer kissing
  the nice man in the picture has also been dead for decades now
there a couple islands in the san juan islands off the coast of wa that have deer with no predators so they just walk up to people and you can pet them etc
  packing my bags now
  etc
  etc
  dont be sad that its gone be glad that it was there in the first place
  dont remind me i may just shed a tear
ive always wanted to see how a deer hunter would react to being in nara japan
  uwu
snnnnnniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiffffffffffff
imagine the smell
    brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaappppppppppppppppppp
    i got pranked into taking a whiff during my first time hunting horrible smell kek
  how do you prank someone into smelling a deer anus
  it was the doe in heat scent lure they had
  so did it give you a boner or what
  do dry heaves count
  that shit is foul and smells nothing like an actual doe its designed to be absurdly pungent so it travels quickly over a large area and lasts a long time
  when have you smelled an actual doe in season
  hunting
  what after you killed it
  
  mmyes ssssnnniiiiifffff quite pungent indeed
  etc   what did he mean by this
  nah i dont hunt the source of the dead doe was hunting though  doing yard work  neighbor comes up  hey my husband got a deer but his back is bad could you help him out you can have as much venison jerky as you want  fuck yes  help him strip and haul the carcass  piss was all over her legs and it smelled like piss otherwise she smelled like youd expect a wild animal to smell but pretty mild
friendly reminder that ewes have vaginas that are physiologically most similar to human vaginas  doe lovers btfo
  human vaginas are shit tier though looks like its sheep who are btfo
  doe are probably tighter though since bucks have total needle dicks
  you do realize we want the opposite of that right like the first item on my list for physical attraction is pretty much totally not human at all
  oh god i remember that post
  that post  its a weekly occurrence there are several massive caps deerfucking is taken as seriously as dragon dildos and mosin nagants
  hope they had change for a buck
be nice to deers or this could be you
bump
cows are just fat milk does   prove me wrong you faggits you absolutely cant
  dont compare my precious durrs to those big dumb brap factories show me a bovine thats this aesthetic i dare you fucker    theyre more like long goats than cows desu
  cowe
  based wizard
  bovine a cute      a cute
  from the thumbnail it looks like it already has the sad cat meme shooped on
  excuse me u must be lost this thread is for deers not rabbit shrew things
  not knowing that the motherfucking dik dik is part of your family
  that is an elk
  same imagine doing this with a donkey or a goat
/k/ we need to talk
  what is it with /k/ and deer
  ill take responsibility      we have guns and enjoy being woodsy and shit so of course lots of us hunt well a good portion of those hunters realize how beautiful and graceful deer are simply by being out in nature with them and because 4chan has broken the knee jerk disgust response most people get when the idea of fucking an animal pops in their head they get to thinking  would it be wrong  yeah  but really would it  i mean probably because consent and stuff  come on does a deer really give a shit about that shit  no  and so they fuck the deer
  now im kinda sad when i realized dillie was never able to know that feel
  ywn have an accidental fawn that you have to explain to scientists
  getting this vibe from that pic
  theyd just take it away from you and study it 24/7
  ywn be in a shootout with government agents to protect your deer daughter
  well the rest of us arent furries go fuck a crocodile or something tell us how it goes id be curious to see what happens
  ask florida man seems like it went okay before the cops showed up
  youre a furry and an animal fucker and this entire thread is a blight    you should all play the rope game
  even on /an/ foe
anon actually leaving the house to meet an actual deer just to tell her obscenities
  i think that species of tiny deer has potential for the pet market
  youre different therefore you should die  sometimes i wonder if western justice systems are overly inefficient but then i remember that people like you used to run things before youre way more fucked in the head than they are m8
  wanting to breed dillie
  are you admitting to wanting to fuck animals or are you defending people wanting to fuck animals
  im saying that wishing physical harm on a human over animal fucking is sociopathic its a fucking animal get over it im all for the humane treatment of animals and i absolutely believe that anyone who is negligent or abusive should see jail time but get real we force them to breed surgically sterilize them lock them up in small spaces feed them garbage kill them when theyre inconvenient kill them for food etc fucking an animal will hardly be the worst thing theyre put through by humans in their life calling for death to dogfuckers is at best hypocrisy
  its a fucking animal get over it  so are humans but i agree animal sex is a good thing also i am vegan so i try to avoid doing and supporting any of those things you said
  zoos keep saying its actually mutual and they always make sure the animal is actually enjoying themselves too if that sounds like you and its true then youve got serious moral high ground  youre still a fag for being vegan though for fucks sake get a couple chickens and eat eggs at least
ew what the fuck
  he thinks he wouldnt fuck a deer
  
  if you have a huge problem with it you should probably go to  instead
  i think reddits your peoples kind of place that and the furry community
  its bestiality you uncultured fetus
  only if its a twink buck
  they banned all zoo content and discussion youll be right at home in your safe space

  after you fag
  oh man you really fucking roasted me good with that legendary application of no u
  says the redditspouter
someone posted this on imgur  how long do you think will it take until they get their property stormed and her forcefully taken away
  shes already bread
  atf takes out the dogs  dnr takes out the deer
  we all crack beers and go to the range
    i never understood why having a deer is such a big deal legally in burgerland  that they go through all those hoops getting half an army to the location just to eliminate a deer someone rescued and keeps as pet is fucking ridiculous interesting way to spend tax money
  its because you need a deer loicense in the states and we take our laws extremely seriously unless theyre immigration or anticorruption ones
  i bet its an island that outlawed cars and makes awesome fudge
  a deer loicense only entitles you to keep captivebred livestock deer an orphaned roadkill fawn is still wild thus you still cant keep it    illegal pet deers are serious business in burgerland and must be destroyed its sad but it must be done before they become uncontrollable and murderous
  weird dick
  youre getting awfully close there feller
  ikr applejack is almost bottom tier pony
  cervines all have weird thin and long ones
  guess im a cervid then
  kek
  doe a deer a female deer
  re a deer i want to fuuuuuck
  i think animals can enjoy sex that doesnt mean they always do   why does refusing to pay for animal cruelty and death make me a fag
  i agree  youre a fag because there are mutually beneficial ways to harvest animal products eggs from pet chickens yet youre vegan also fish and inverts are basically organic machinery with no emotions so theyre fair game imo
  making love to a deer wont fill that empty crater in your heart nothing will
  t has never fucked a deer  its enlightenment
  1 deer wives are for more than just making love  2 theres only one way you could possibly know that you know what you have to do
  even if it were true that taking chicken eggs was somehow mutually beneficial i still dont see how not eating them makes me a fag fish have nociceptors to feel pain invertebrates are debatable but even if they didnt feel pain i still dont see any reason i would eat them
  imagine the ticks that are all over that thing
  why would you want to imagine this  are you a tick
  its okay to be gay anon
  theyre quite sassy
  i do deer wife is ok but still empty
  gonna need more than dubs to override those trips deerwife is still confirmed for curing existential crises
  fish have nociceptors to feel pain  i thought fish dont feel pain
  thats a very antiquated urban myth
this thread is making me want to fuck a deer yo
  good post
  sark doesnt have deer you fucking retard

why are there so many deer fuckers here  is there any board on 4chan where you people dont fetishize the subject
    its time to stop posting
  is there any board on 4chan where you people dont fetishize the subject  this is banner material  and no
  undulating ungulate intercourse is the preferred term
  this is actually 4channel
  why are there so many deer undulating ungulate intercourse furfaggots here  is there any board on 4channel where you people dont fetishize the subject

deer or horse
  depends what for
  deer horse dog marry fuck kill  hardmode youve known them all for a long time and theyre equally affectionate towards you
  marry deer marry dog fuck horse kill you
   2 wives  thats cheating      not just marrying all three if youre going full polygamy
  id do a horse once just to see what its like but i wouldnt want to keep one around long term
  horses are pretty nice if you had the means and to keep one and spent some time with one youd probably change your mind on that
  whut
where are the lewds
  anon sir are you aware that you are in fact a deer
  twenty inch long pencil dicks anon
  bummer
  any links strictly for science
  as much as a horse wife is the better a deer wife wold be more practical for doors and stairs
  i agree but you cant ride a deer wife and dog wife is more practical than both also in order to qualify as a response you need to present your fuck and kill choices
  marry horse fuck deer kill dog
  why doe so tired
  calisthenics
  shes about to sneeze

living mascot thread
would you agree to put your dog down for a one night stand with any celebrity male/female in the world
  only if my dog was actually sick and needed to be put down in the first place
  no and never also i prefer 2d girls anyways
  no it is perfectly healthy and good behavior with less than 10 years age
  dude sex lamo   no
  nigga its literally just sex same pussy you could get from a whore on the street i wouldnt even stamp on a bug for that
    your trustworthy companion or vapid shallow cunt/cock    tough choice
  you mean letting my dog fuck a celebrity
  what a retarded normie question
you have to be at least 18 to visit this site
which celebrity male/female would you put down for the dog of your choice and what dog would you get    for me its amy schumer in exchange for this smug fuck
no thicc big tit gf    why live
  jokes on you i dont own a dog
  youre the guy that made that cat on the ass thread arent you
loyal companion for 1015 years that you raised from a baby and taught how to be a good boy  one night stand with a hollywood harlot  wow so hard to choose
what the fuck is with these /r9k/ tier posts today this isnt your shitting ground
  that loyal companion is already at deaths door
  my dog is already a better lay than any woman so i really dont see what i have to gain from that exchange
  this is a legitimately hard question because theres so many to choose   i guess lena dunham in exchange for a golden retriever
  no i currently get more sex then i want
    how many pets am i allowed to acquire this way if its as many as you can care for im setting up a 200 gallon celestial pearl danio species tank
no retard
    would you agree to have sex with any celebrity of your choice if she insisted that it has to be a threesome with your dog
  who wouldnt that just makes it better
  no but id agree to take turns as long as i go first and dog goes second
  fuck no the loyalty of my dogs outweigh any temporary pussy
    id rather just fuck the dog than have it killed for the sake of puss
  you have to be a serious untermensch and absolutely desperate to even come up with this
  ctrl f milk  nuthin    pleasantly surprised
just like yeller
      only a fucking psychopathic cunt would do this
celebrity hell no any human id consider it but probably still no
fuck off back to r9k you roleplaying faggot
            you dumbfucks should understand that im not talking about some random whore in your college or neighbourhood im talking about a celebrity which is 99 harder to get than any normal bitch      no matter how much you love your dog im sure youd atleast think about ending it for a 2 minutes sex with a beauty like emma watson or some other 4 chans flavour of the month celeb
  id be too nervous and self conscious to have sex so no point
no pussy is worth family
  you can blind fold or voluntarily drug her up if you want to
  dude sex lmao  omg lots of people know who they are lmao  youre braindead this is a troll thread
  uh i can masturbate whenever i want and have a vivid imagination its just as good as a one night stand with anybody
    you dumbfucks should understand that im not talking about some random whore in your college or neighbourhood im talking about a celebrity which is 99 harder to get than any normal bitch    what really makes a celebrity different from someone else though im sure their cunts and dicks are all the same soooo
  absolutely not      not even then
  no i wouldnt
  no
  only if my dog was a pitbull
  hello canada
  99 percent harder to get  199 times harder to get  not even twice as hard to get
how many celebrities do you think have been fuck with dog
  it depends could i bring aniki back to life
  id consider putting my dog down to remove emma watson and 90 of all female celebs from existence but even then i wouldnt actually do it
  would kill that dog to see that girls asshole
  i actualy had sex before and its not that big of a deal    i wouldnt even put a rat down for that
i already put my dog down
  no but thats the most attractive woman ive ever seen
  see ya later boyega no more ruining scifi movies with unrelated politics rest in garbage
  go to shelter  pick up literally any shitbull  give up my dog a few times a week
    what makes famous pussy better than normal pussy
  more swag
  umm lets say exclusivity
  are you a girl
  there are random 16 year old girls in every town that are better looking the thing that distinguishes celebrities is extraordinary narcissism not really attractiveness
remove makeup  suddenly celebrities look just like people you see on the street  woah
i give it 100 posts until someone in this thread unironically suggests that refusing this offer makes you an incel or a womanhater
  all of these threads    no why fucking would you unless youre an actual psychopath and then you shouldnt even have animals
yes i would  fuck dogs and animals in general
  this  its sad to me that virgins worship pussy so much all theyre doing is setting themselves up for disappointment and depression i wish i could somehow tell them that the things they already do every day are way more fun than this ideal theyve set for themselves and actually have them believe me
  id probably put the dog down for free to be earnest
  i dont have a dog so sure ill put down my hypothetical dog
  goodbye sheider hello huskie
  christ this im actually in a happy relationship and our sex life is good but if it was a choice between no sex with my partner or not being with them id happily choose a sexless relationship theres just so many other equally as meaningful and enjoyable experiences you can have with people and even just on your own    fuck personally i cant think of anything better then going for an exhausting hike and then sitting down to your first good meal in civilization for the last few days    trust me even the best sex struggles to rival that feeling of pure sinful indulgence as you shove sweet sweet calories down your gullet    oh and shit sex is the worst my fist time was fucking sad wish it had never happened at all    no sex is 100 better then bad sex and good sex is about as good as any form of enjoyment you can have    this idea of being a sad lonely beta virgin needs to stop    you dont get points for having sex it doesnt make you more complete and it certainly doesnt make you a failure how many times youve had sex has zero impact on how successful you are as a person    i mean ive done it more then once and im still a fucking loser
  why would you rant about this what a waste of time
  idk why rant about anything
  get a load of this cuck  to say set is not important at all is just as retarded as saying its the only thing thats important there are physical reactions that release healthy relationships need a healthy sexual relationship especially during the years 70/80  if you arent having sex that is fufilling with your partner frequently then there is something medically wrong with them or you or they are getting that fulfillment somewhere else like you with food you fat fuck
  its the loosest pussy youll ever get
  all this means virtually nothing coming from someone who has a healthy sex life and gets as much sex as they want now imagine being a 25 year old khv and telling someone that sex isnt a big deal i bet you dont spend your days actively thinking about how great oxygen is either because you already get plenty of it
  underrated
  fuck no pets before thots every time
  any person celebrity or not who would insist that a healthy animal be put to sleep in order to be with them is not someone i would want to be with
  you are either a very horny 14 year old or a woman
  you assume that i didnt spend a long period without it before losing my virginity and didnt spend every waking minute thinking about how to get it     until i finally did and it was shit precisely because i went in with the doesnt matter had sex mentality took me a long time to get passed my disappointment afterwards and realize that with the right person for the right reason then it could be good even then its never lived up to the glorified expectations obsessing over it leads you to have    youre setting your self up for disappointment and failure the desperation will drive people away and you can achieve the same level of satisfaction with a fleshlight some hobbies and a healthy dose of perspective
  john oliver with a beagle
  a fleshlight and a hobby is an adequate replacement for an intimate relationship with another human being  not really sure what kind of normie bullshit youre trying to push here to expect anyone to believe this  you even admitted that you were desperate for sex before you had it so how can you argue that other peoples feelings are invalid just because the first time you had sex you didnt enjoy it you obviously do enjoy sex overall or you wouldnt do it at all so dont tell other people theyre not allowed to be sad about not having sex themselves and that theyre just as well off with a fleshlight
  yes i would let my dog fuck a celebrity
  99 harder to get than any normal bitch  americans everyone
  no he means you take your dog to the vet the vet gives it an injection and your dog goes to forever dreamland  then for some reason you get to fuck the celebrity once    anyone in this thread who would do it ask the vet to give you that injection instead
i love my dog yo death but damn if i had a chance to fuck or even cuddle with nicki minaj i think ill sacrifice my dog
  giving up your companion and friend for some dumb roastie  ahahahahahahahahaha   no
  dude youre a faggot
  thatll be asian jake paul for a rottweiler
  i dont get plenty of sex last time i had sex was many years ago and i dont miss it at all my hand actually feels better  now imagine being a 25 year old khv and telling someone that sex isnt a big deal  this is exactly why when you finally get to stick your dick in that warm meaty hole youve been craving all youll feel afterwards will be disappointment and depression
  doesnt know that a pussy is a pussy regardless if its famous or not    you think the pussy of a thot who was waiting tables before her big break is somehow different when she is famous     fucking incel virgins i wish there was a deadly virus that only took out your kind just think all the beta incels in the world wiped out what a day that would be
    you can be sad about it sure im just saying obessing over it will lead to disappointment im trying to tell you the reality of sex which is that it can be enjoyable yes but that the moment you stick your dick in someone isnt some life chainging momentus moment where the universe sings out your name and god slaps you on the back youll be the same person you allways were and the physical act itself isnt actually as fucking great as you think it will be in terms of pure pleasure you can service yourself and have better times doing so on your own the main kick out of sex is that its a mutual thing you do with someone you enjoy being with if you dont have someone like that theres little point    im telling you as someone that has had bad sex purely because i was focused on just not being a virgin anymore that youre working youself up over a fantasy it will never meet your expectations because youve made it in to something unrealistically important its like taking drugs for the first time you expect some sort of mind blowing trip outside yourself but what you actually get is entirely predictably within normal human experience yeah its a bit novel and weird but at no point did you trancend yourself in to another dimension you were still you and at the end of it youre still just you      normie bullshit     see you should start by not saying shit like that if you want a girl to like you joking aside i say get a hobby because you clearly need to direct that frustration somewhere productive and to have something to prevent you ruminating over these thoughts of inadequacy based on the fact that you feel like you should have had sex by now    in reality whether you have sex tomorrow or never doesnt fucking matter it is literally the least important or interesting thing about you only you make it in to an issue for yourself    youre allowed to be sad about it sure but its pointless torment to keep dwelling on that sadness
  no i like my little buddy  2 minutes   lol
who is that she hot
nope
  this idea of being a sad lonely beta virgin needs to stop  youre allowed to be sad about it sure  getting mixed messages here chief    isnt some life chainging momentus moment where the universe sings out your name and god slaps you on the back  youve made it in to something unrealistically important  at no point did you trancend yourself in to another dimension  pure projection on your part no one else in this thread raised the idea that sex is transcendent or a life changing moment no one actually thinks this way except maybe the most pathetic deranged /r9k/ incels you sound like some facebook thot gossiping over third hand stereotypes of what you think those icky 4chan incels must all be like if you really think that all virgins think this way about sex then how could you ever expect them to manage to achieve a relationship with a woman
  id put her down for a night with the dog
i would funnel every female celebrity into a wood chipper to save my dogs life for one more day
  based
  i agree with   for a onenight stand  no fucking way    i have a better scenario   you discover an antic scroll explaining that in order to make a true love potion among other things you need the heart of a creature that already loves you it specifies that old pets usually work which avoids killing family members or unwanted lovers  would you do it /an/  the love of a human being against your loving pet 
like every female celebrity doesnt have a walkin vagina at this point
  no because the knowledge that the person only loves me because they were being forced to by a potion would ruin it
  absolutely fucking not  anyone saying yes is a bastard with no sense of love or honor
  youre on the wrong board
  i would come here if i were him i visit /pol/ for what is likely the same reason its important to understand those you hate
  my dog sucks but theres nothing to gain from a one night stand and id rather have my shitbeast mastiff that barks at 4 am
  thats just suo doing his thing
  based and redpilled
  seeing as i dont have a dog sure id want to do all the nasty things to tara strong while she does all the various voices of her characters
  
no why the fuck would i do that
  nice
  no id rather have a lifetime with my best friend than a momentary happening with someone who doesnt know me
  damn thats a hot body shame about the face
  no i would euthanize most celebrities before id consider offing my dog
  not wanting to bang her while she does the voice of rikku raven or bubbles  you have shit taste my man
  thank fuck i thought i was going insane
  are you a normie or something celebrities arent actually valuable the industry just picks a few semi talented whores male and female to make it so it seems ultra exclusive literally the same shit as debeers selling diamonds at a 9001x markup by creating artificial scarcity and marketing the fuck out of the idea that their rock is better than all the other rocks    tldr youre an easily manipulated fool
  sacrifice my dogs life for a night with a celeb hell no not even for my celeb crush would i exchange my dogs life i raised her from a month old pup
  i want to fuck the life out of the actress in vvitch
fuck no i love my cat much better than any stinky pussy some bitch can offer
    emma is a fucking cunt and i would never give up the loyalty and stoicism of my pet dog for some bitch no matter who she is     my dog is my pal when i shoot up ducks and geese she goes and retrieves them when there is a thunderstorm she comes into my room to check if i am okay her loyalty means far more than sex with some whore
  no are you insane what kind of question is that
  just end yourself faggot
  liar
  t h i c c
  no it isnt
  letting your penis control you    lmao
  check out this porndependent guy whos had real sex few enough times that it still feels novel
never
  loving companion that you raised since they were tiny   one night of fucking somebody thats probably a petty delusion fuck that you have no emotional connection with    what the fuck are you playing at the very idea is ridiculous youd have to not have a dog or hate dogs to be ok with that meanwhile we have some perverts ready to go buy a shelter dog asap to get a one time lay because theyre petty stupid people who dont have a soul
  yeah i dont give a shit whats left after that get your ass back to /tv/ you fucking teenager     my first thought was the person then it was my dog id stick the needle in them before my dog
itt desperate virgins who idolize sex    sex wont fix you youll always be shit
  your a fucking faggot
asking me to sacrifice my dog for a lay    this is dogdaaaaaa
  yes
no i dont believe in euthanasia and i wouldnt want a one night stand with anyone
  diamonds are more interesting and useful than celebrities
  that is a better question but i still wouldnt love should be earned not forced that would have bad societal consequences
  a woman would not post that
  adam from adam ruins everything for any old mutt

  do reverse image search  just shows some cringe misogyny site and a video of a guy secretly recording a normal woman in a supermarket and uploading it to a porn site
  of course not id kill and eat the celeb if it made my dog immortal by the way
  isnt 99 harder just 1 easier
  desiring any contact with women  3dpd women
    anon  you would be swimming in pussy from a gaggle of women who would be impressed that you didnt put your dog down to fuck (((celebrity))) and theyd jump your bones for being so good to your pupperwhen secretly most of them just want to tell their friends they fucked some stud who rejected a hollywood starlet while omitting the part about the potential dog murder
  samantha bee for a german shepherd and trevor noah for another german shepherd
  walk down the street at a college campus or anywhere that isnt bumfuck nowhere and youll see a hundred women more attractive than emma watson or whatever other average celeb youre thinking of
  i would kill anyone or anything for this and only this
  no never  no pussy is worth it
  i mean theyre job is to be sexy so they probably take care of things also sexperts
give it to me straight /an/ is it a brown recluse
  a pitbull thread died for this
whats up /an/ ill cut right to the chase    my dog isnt pooping for a couple days now she spends all of her time either in her crate or her cupboard and the only way to get her around is to carry her she constantly shakes and does that dog cough that scares me half to death she also kind of smells which i dont understand i should mention shes about 9 and is a shih tsu/poodle mix breed how do i fix her pooping issues pic related its her right now
  vet
  you need to get her to the vet now
  see a fucking vet you homosex
  give her a shot glass of mineral oil that will smooth things out and make her shit
okay boys im gonna try to get her to the vet but my mother insists on doing stuff to help her at home like putting oil in soft food and shit like that    update shes doing a bit better now but thats because she got her soft food shes now running around like shes on crack idk of shell shit now if not im getting her to a vet asap
  pumpkin puree is a good puppy laxative but yes get that dog to the vet
shes happy now
what are the most overrated pets in your opinion /an/
  dogs
  i couldnt agree more they seem neat and all and are great for hunting but most breeds are garbage and lack any practicality and are no longer used for their potentials most dogs are about as practical as cats theyre just decorations now worth no more than a rat that can sometimes learn even more impressive tricks than some dogs ive had an easier time training rats than i ever did with any dog rats just learn tricks much faster maybe theres some intelligent breeds who learn fast but most dont dogs are ok animals but some people really obsess over them too much     inb4 butthurt dogfuckers rage at me to defend their ego and feel less insecure
  pibbles
cats  they spread toxoplasmosis and arent good friends the only purpose i can see for one is to hunt mice and rats if you live on a farm
  although i like cats i hate outdoor cats why risk getting sick like that unless toxoplasmosis only exists in specific countries i had one as a kid/teen that i kept indoors and it was honestly an alright pet besides that
  why do people to this day believe they arent man eating scum of the dog family
cats are smelly and ill tempered and lazy people who dont know/care about animals seem to be drawn to them exasperating their shittiness
reptiles
  dogs its like looking after a retarded toddler but for longer
  humans
  where did any of these conclusions stem from my cat never smelled and i autistically research the care for an animal before getting it although i do imagine the more obsessive cat fags probably are autistic
  women
  when will animal racism end only bigots assume that tigers are man eating machines but in reality they wouldnt harm a fly tigers are very kind and gentle and love human company they are soft and cuddly angels just look at this picture i took with a kind tiger oneanimaloneancestor
  lions and animals in general love humans and other animals only humans are hateful and bigoted towards each other we shouldnt be afraid of them just because they look different let them in your house introduce them to your family and realize how ignorant you have been by ignoring these peaceful creatures    smashspecism nodoorsnolocks childrenforcarnivores diversityisourstrength

i can tell you an underrated pet  hamsters why do we never talk about them
  what about them anon im a rodentfag whos had many pet rodents and the only issue i can think of is how they lack an instinct of fearing heights i like them but as usual rats will win but if you lack space or money mice and hamsters are good especially since hamsters make it easy finding food for them but i am still interested in hearing what other issues they have
  cats i get why some people think dogs are overrated they are not as intelligent as people make them out to be and some are real shitbags but the faggotry of people who keep cats is unbelievable if you say that you dont like cats be prepared for the cat copypasta  the reason you dont like cats is that you want to feel superior to your pet and cats have a sense of autonomy  any pet can be made into a loyal friend however the literal jumping off the walls every time they take a shit is not something i like to put up with
  dogs and cats and the people who post them are some of the most insufferable megafaggots on the internet
  this cancer killing /an/ normies all need to hang in the gas chamber
      im an indoor cat owner and even i still agree with this
  animals only useful pets are women and slaves
  pitbulls
      did you forgot this is 4chan  fuck off you npcs
  ball pythons
i find pet fish to be quite boring and dont really know why people keep them at all especially freshwater tanks reef tanks can look amazing though
  cats theyre the stereotypical crazy single woman or permavirgin pet
  uh huh
  people dont talk about them because theyre considered a beginner pet for children when really children are the least qualified to care for hamsters so most memories that people have of having a pet hamster is getting one as an 8 year old shoving it into a tiny cage and forgetting about it bonus points for shitty parents who buy their children a male and female hamster and are then shocked when the parents eat their babies out of stress due to their shitty cage conditions very few people have a positive experience from owning hamsters because of things like this so theyre not willing to give them a chance as an adult
  is it hamsters or guinie pigs that are prone to cannibalism and homicide
  i cant tell if youre literally so brain dead that you thought obvious satire mocking pitbull fags was a genuine person talking or youre making a bad joke
  neither hamsters come close but youre taking this out of context hamsters will become very stressed due to being very territorial same as male mice and thousands of other animals they will then brawl until one of them dies      damn sounds like americans are pretty stupid good thing no one does most of these things where im from except some getting small cages sometimes but never male and female in one cage i also dont get why children get such a pet and forget about it i never forgot mine and looked after it and played with daily sadly i played too often with mine until he got aggravated sometimes and got told to stop annoying him too often so i stopped
    the people i know that own pits would unironically post things like that though
  snakes they dont enjoy being around humans why would you keep one
  its also a way to waste mice and rats seeing as theyre smarter than literal brain dead snakes that only have a lizard brain whilst mammals have lizard brains combined with others can be taught tricks and enjoy human company    but its natural  letting a snake be free in the wild and hunt on its own is even more natural domestic mice and rats are at least genetically different from their wild counterparts breeding snakes to achieve more varied colors leads to many being born deformed with their eyes popping out their skulls many snake owners are some of the most shallow pet owners ive ever met they usually have tattoos to show off how unique they are lowerclass rednecks are edgy emos living in the 2010s attention whore bimbos etc i like snakes theyre interesting but they are meant to be left alone in the wild no animal unless its a mammal can be considered to be kept as a pet maybe even some marsupials
  cats
dog people are the types who watch jordan peterson  every respectable thinker in history was a cat person
between the random jp hate and that quote this is perhaps the most fedorable post in existence you will die alone     you have to have something deeply wrong with you to hate a dog
  i know right makes no sense that theres so many pit bull hate threads how can anyone hate dogs
  dogs are love but fuck those pit bull killing machines risk outweighs it
  rated as best pet  is best pet  thats literally the definition of not overrated
  ballpythons
my vote is cats  of course theyre not affectionate you have to earn their respect  if you try to pet a cat theres a 75 chance hell just scratch and bite you isnt it cool that theyre so independent like that  why is this a positive whats the point in funneling money into an animal thats going to act like an aloof roommate instead of a friend  i think the toxo zombie meme is stupid but cat superfans are attracted to behavior thats seen as overwhelmingly negative in any other animal or human     plus digging around in their shit and piss and tracking it through the house never liked that
  hes probably memeing the tards who think pitbulls are safe
  the small purse dogs vapid thots and middle aged woman carry around and treat like babies and spoil to death they are always little shits that often are afraid or aggressive to anything and anyone who is their owner
  like dogs cats have breeds and personalities i have a bitchy tabby pic related who growls and hisses and fucking bites my toes rarely nice enough to let me get her head on the other hand i have a grey mixed breed of maine coon and some other breed who acts like a puppy he is actually one of the nicest cats ive had i also have 2 black cats who despite being black are ironically friendly and cute they do steal your food though
  unfortunately the us is terrible when it comes to the well being of rodents and rabbits majority of chain pet stores dont even sell cages that meet the bare minimum space that they need so neither the children or parents who buy them know any better
  i like cats cause i act like an aloof roomate towards them so its mutual getting pets that share your negative traits works great i like lounging around the house all day doing whatever the fuck and that happens to be what elderly cats like doing so i adopt elderly cats     fuck kittens though you might as well get a dog if you want a pet that needs constant attention
for everyone saying cats your issue is probably shit diet lack of exercise and a shitty choice of litter and box depth cats arent as low maintenance as youd think and in order to have a well mannered cat you have to make sure they arent suffering in any way ie my elderly cat turns into a huge bitch when eating dry food because it hurts her teeth my 4 year old cat has severe ibs and anxiety and requires a homemade diet and an anxiety collar in terms of litter box tracking and smell literally just switch to pine pellets or at least something like walnut litter if they dont like the pellet texture cats are a lot of trial and error in order to make a cranky cat into a cuddly muffin and unfortunately most people refuse to put in the effort/money to make that change happen
  dog people are the types who watch jordan peterson  or ben (((shapiro)))
  shut up mentally ill person who has no friends besides his retarded dogs i like dogs too but autists like you piss me off normalfags like you need to stop ruining /an/      probably the second most overrated pet
  didnt actually know that thanks anon this makes me consider cats again i had one mean cat but she was often abused by my sister hence why she was upset i also had a ginger cat who was very sweet towards me and others       christ sounds awful tiny crittertrail tier cages are honestly very rare here ive never seen any kid with one even when browsing through listings of pet rodents on sale even though some stores have the cages none ever buy them i only once saw some deadbeat redneck single mom get her kid one gebril and one crittertrail cage       what is an anxiety collar anon
  most popular  cats and dogs
so i posted recently about what i thought was a mouse in my room i can now fully confirm that the mouse in indeed 100 under my floorboard in my bedroom and that it has entered through my neighbour house were semi detached theyve been doing construction lately and have been leaving their backdoors open to a messy garden where it must have came from not sure if theres anything i can do since its under my floorboards and no way to access it
  the other thread is still up you fuckin berk

are humans animals
we eat animals we dont eat humans so no
  we dont eat humans   speak for yourself
  are humans vertebrates are vertebrates animals
  can animals have religion can animals do complex math equations
  those traits have nothing to do with taxonomy  are humans hominids what kingdom does the hominidae family belong to
  yes anyone who says otherwise is a brain dead autist
  its amazing how the very same scientific illiteracy and special snowflakeness of humans that stood in the way of darwin is still prevalent today

one time i saw this video on /b/ of some dude jerking it onto his girlfriends face as she was sleeping the way she immediately woke up was almost exactly like the way how my cat wakes up when i touch his side while hes sleeping so yes
only humans have da soul animals dont have no soul so dey difrent humans aint no animal
  exactly like the way how my cat wakes up when i touch his side while hes sleeping  expecting cummies
  can animals have religion  thank fuck theyre not stupid enough to have that
  human religion has the same basis as bee dance rituals theyre a system of remembering and communicating ideas

  are monkeys who learned to walk upright and lose their hair animals
  man is a creation of god

  few species of animal engage in cannibalism
  no were a unique and special kind of multicellular cell wallless mitochondria powered eukaryotes that happen to resemble tetrapods  yes of course were aninals
  oh ladida look at mr fancywords over here fuck you mr multicellar mighty chonda eukalyptus tetrapack
  the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell
  i hate that phrase so fucking much    i hate people who think great apes are monkeys too    i hate people that literally think god created everything there is no evidence to suggest anything was created on purpose
  i hate people who think great apes are monkeys too  thats 999 of modern biologists    the only people that think apes arent monkeys are creationists
  hate to break it to you but apes arent monkeys monkeys are monkeys and apes are apes while it is common to say x and y split z years ago that doesnt mean the critter at the divergence point was x or y it was neither    the critter that monkeys and apes evolved from was its own thing with traits associated with both modern monkeys and apes surely youve taken a biology class
  yeah we got rid of that idea back in the 1940s    thats called evolutionary taxonomy we dont use it anymore now we use cladistics which means animals belong to every ancestor taxon so apes are monkeys and humans are fishes    try to keep up youre almost 100 years behind science
  nope wrong while im derived from a fish im not a fish
  american    its rare to find anyone from any other country so blissfully ignorant of science
  some of us eat animals and some of us eat humans so yes we are animals
  oh shit whats wrong with that humans elbows

no rat threads in the catalog time to fix that    looking to own a pet rat just got one and have questions check out these resources          talk about rats show off your cage setups and post pictures of your cute boopers
im gonna help you out with a pic of my passed ratto
  then ill match you with one of my own
have any of you ever taken a rat home from your schools biology lab to keep as a pet
whatre some good fun cheap enrichment toys yall give your rats
  havent owned any in years but god did they love tearing up paper and cardboard more than any fucking toys i ever bought god forbid if its in their reach outside of their cage its crack to them     and the usual diving for peas
how do i get into mass producing rats for feeding carnivorous animals
  toilet paper tube put treats inside and fold the edges in so they have to chew it open also a small cup with treats inside and a ping pong ball in it so they have to get the ball out to get to the treats
to any normal person rats are vermin to be exterminated not to be kept as pets      how does this make you feel
  dude wild rats are like nightmare wolves     not cute and friendly at all
  what poor trolling zero rat owners will argue against the extermination of wild pest rats which have the propensity to spread disease and destroy property    keeping domestic rats as pets is no stranger than keeping hamsters or gerbils and theyre almost always a great deal more social and affectionate than either of those species
  i love animals i dont eat meat but controlling pests like wild rat populations is fair game they can cause serious problems that video is pretty neat ive seen it a few times and always admire the dogs skill doesnt mean i dont love rats they make wonderful pets
      god damn theyre cute          b i g b o y    threads like this wish i could own rats my mother who is also my landlord doesnt want me owning them and my room is so fucking dusty it would probably give my rats lung problems anyway so its for the best
rat pets suck just like hamster and mice  shit everywhere all the fucking time try to piss on your hand to mark you as a family eww  atleast rat is smart dont understand why people keep hamsters and mice they are dumb as bricks
  clean your room
i wish i could have pet rats but my landlord doesnt want any pets so im in dire need for cute rat pics please
my rat bull mostly black with a white underbelly mated with two does both white with a black back and head one had six and one had ten in total there are five albino pups does this mean the father somehow carries a mutation
  exterminating any animal is evil
  dont understand why people keep hamsters and mice they are dumb as bricks  people are sadistic and want to watch a cute little animal do retarded shit  alsothey breed them to be dumber and dumberand more inbredjust like lots of catsimply because of aesthetics
  this time a year a pumpkin        you can cut a hole in it for them to make it easy but theyll get inside eventually
sunday night i saw what i thought was a mouse in the house  so monday i got some mouse traps and laid them out  within about half an hour i hear one of them going off  and go and check and its a bloody big rat  it has only its muzzle and face under the trap its covering one eye blood is coming out of the top of its head  and its still alive  i didnt know what to do  i put it in a plastic bag and put it in the bin i figured the damage and bleeding would kill it  i go to take rubbish out this afternoon and the rat is alive and somehow gotten out of the trap  wtf  it couldnt lift it  did it pull its muzzle and face out  how is its skull not fractured or muzzle or jaw not broken or crushed there was a little bit of dried blood in the bag but obviously it had stopped  i tipped the garbage bin over and got it out  it tried to go back inside but i herded it away and it climbed the fence and went into the neighbours yard    so whats going to happen to it /an/ will it live is it slowly dying from injuries
  dont understand why people keep hamsters  hamster are very low maintenance and while miles below rats still fun to watch derp around
the rats itt are adorable

  its a rat you need a mouse  
  big boys
moved into a bigger place  will be getting more money soon    i will finally be able to have some cute rats of my own  done plenty of research on how to take care of them in the meantime so im pretty sure i know everything just need to decide on names
  take a gander at these cages theyre top shelf quality    
  theyre not necessarily albino they could just be pinkeyed whites this can occur when theres too many colours in the genes and resulting in colours being washed out   
  your drex looks like a balding old man
can you walk pet rats outside or will they run away
  depends how much they are used to you but always smart to put a little harness on them i did let my most loving rat outside she ran in the grass but came stampering back to me when i called for her
got 3 rats 2 months ago theyre at the point where they run up to the cage to greet me but i think its just because they know ill give them snacks how do i make these fat bastards actually love me
  how deep do you make the water i usually make it just deep enough to where they kinda dunk their heads in and im scared to go deeper
  i have 4 and i put them all in my bed at once under the covers and we all lay together every so often hand them a treat too they may have accidents in your bed but i wash my sheets regularly and use blankets specifically for rat cuddlin 3
do any of you have anything to say about neutering your rats i have three boys all brothers but one of them is kind of an asshole hes bitten two of my friends several times including nearly tearing open her finger and just starts shit with his brothers a lot hes never bitten me though and im wondering if its worth it to get him neutered
  i love when people say stuff like this to me as if i would actually be offended
  you have to make rat bait by mixing ammonia and bleach be sure t take a big whiff of it you know you got it right when you smell mangoes
  dont feed yourself to the snake as an act of devotion to it and queztlcoatl the gods demand human sacrifice
  i think it is unnecessary unless you already own females if they bit there is probably a reason being manipulated whil in stress is one of them for instance if theyre grabbed while in the middle of a fight usually they get accustomed to each other and testosterone levels get lower when theyre fully grown it usually goes with socializing them a lot on top of that they only live 2 to 3 years 4 is pushing it so the less operations they have the better for them
  dude non domesticated animals arent pets
not so fast we need more rats
  i cant help saving every single one of these pics
my spherical girl
tfw my girls health is failing and i dont think she has long    it always fucking hurts anons give your rats a big cuddle tonight
  i hope youve taken many pictures and videos with her its the only cash back we get once theyre gone anon
  it looks like a (((happy merchant)))
well guys ive decided to put down my rats    ive never been able to afford the outrageous surgery costs here in virginia when it came to getting tumors removed i think when the lumps first developed they tried charging about a grand each 250 alone dedicated to getting the blood data out with one day shipping its complete bullshit but kicking and screaming wont do anything to fix this putting them down at the vet would cost an arm and a leg too and ill be damned if i let those greasy fucks who put them in this position get any of my money    ill be using the co2 bucket method to do the deed quietly and quickly     listen to me when i say this if you do something as simple as picking rats up at a pet shop make sure youve got exotic pet vets nearby that wont gouge you my pets have been suffering because i was a negligent shithead that figured any clinic would take a look at them for a reasonable price    for the next few days theyll be getting all the treats and attention they could ever want dont be a god damned retard like me please
  its him
cute rats dudes maooooorrrrr
do rats smell bad  i know they pee a bit when they walk  ive had guinea pigs and those things shit non stop can get very messy without daily spot cleaning    i cant keep a dog at my current place and rata seem like a very personable small animal that would exhibit similar traits to a dog  ive held them before and they have cool personalities   i just want a somewhat cleanly small animal that enjoys being interacted with
  it really just depends on how clean you keep their cage as long as you keep it clean they are good at keeping themselves clean with that said the males can have a slight musk to them though but it never seemed intolerable to me
  rats always reminded me of little monkey/cat/dogs they climb like monkeys are curious like cats and are as sweet as a good dog  for me the boys seemed to pee more as they explored  but if you do get rats get at least two and keep them together in a big enough cage and be prepared to have your heart broken when they die
  oh i know they pass at two years old frequently   shame but at least id know that i wouldnt go through a ton of crazy life changes in that time   another reason its hard to keep a dog life always gets in the way    what substrate is best for cleanliness  ive seen people say felt  but i live in an apartment without a washer and dryer seems like id be washing those felt pieces an awful lot     id love to keep a dog again but my housing and work makes it not possible  rats seem like a good pet for my life style and not so aloof like a gpig or hedgehog
so im not entirely sure if this is the right thread for this considering this is for pet rats     but are there any rat traps that kill rats instantly or at least reduce their suffering   there was a rat that just got caught in my upstairs and the little guy was suffering and was barely even trapped it was only his skin i just let him loose outside but my mom i live at home hates rats and shell probably be pissed i didnt kill it   does anyone know any traps that dont make them suffer or at least reduce it
  pic related worked alright for me my last girl would pee more in a couple areas of the cage that i would more frequently scoop out than the rest of the cage id say as for cloth get yourself a good number of yards of fleece make them hammocks out of it cover any raised floor sections and wire walkways with it and when they chew it up too bad just throw them out and make them new stuff check all the fleece every so often incase they are being lazy and having their pees on it somewheremine was so that you can clean or replace it     be creative and vary things up they are smart little animals that like to explore new things so new things to play with climb on and chew up makes them more happy so long as its safe a bigger cages help to that end    just dont ever ever use wood shavings
  oh and i forgot to say you can rinse out fleece or other cloth in the sink with a bit of dish soap if need be and then hang to dry
  even aspens a no go  ive kept snakes on that  some bags do get a bit dusty though    i have a lot more research to do  but they seem like theyd be a good fit
  want to get my first rats soon what is the ideal number of rats to have so they can keep each other entertained while im out working
  how big of a cage do you have one in mind
  i was gonna decide on a number then get a cage big enough to house them ill get just about any cage as long as its nice for them and has plenty of room
  i bought just the bottom section of pic related and i could for sure comfortably have two rats in it if i put enough hammocks and things to climb on/through in it if i had the full unit i would think four rats would be quite comfy in it
  a cage thats mall can house 4 rats they need far less space than i thought they would
  i have 4 rats in a double critternation and its definitely more than enough for them
  you have to let them out for several hours a day and for the rest of the time its more than enough ive known people who didnt even bother with a cage when they had only one rat
  will they be alright with each other for about 10 hours while im out working or are rats yet another pet i cant have due to being a wagecuck
im interested in getting some rats when weve moved to a bigger place  i read they need several hours a day of playtime does this mean 3 hours of being actively playing with them or will they be happy with 12 hours of some company some playing some free roaming
they will be fine while youre at work obviously  13 hours of playtime also is fine for several rats though id recommand more than that when you can spare that time they can entertain each other most of the time and youll probably see them run after one another pretty often the tricky part comes from only having one since as you alreay know theyre social if you only take one rat youll have to be able to be with it almost all the time that is why its recommended to have more than one  not because they need another rat but because companionship is necessary to them wether man or another pet so when people get disinterested they wont suffer and die of depression it also applies with a several rat situation just to a lesser degree
my babies
  you got it theyre in my prayers
  how far away did you release it
  cute
  boop the snout
  boop the snoot  bump the thread
  mice arent dumb they work together to perform tasks do favors for one another establish hierarchy and figure out how to use their environment to their advantage their ambition is somewhat limited to instinct but i have yet to see them do something id categorize as stupid closest thing is maybe when i tried a water dish instead of a bottle and they kept throwing bedding in it but in their defense its probably hard to maintain in such an enclosed space
so does anyone else here have a dcn/cn i need help finding good scatter guards for the top level for the bottom i have a home depot mixing pan but for the top i need to find something thatll keep the bedding in
  ive been building my cages from scrap lumber and wire mesh critter nation cages are hard to find around here all the petstores have them but they refuse to tell me where they get them
what do you guys do when letting your rats out of the cage  im planning on getting rats and would like some advice to make sure they have fun and get good excercise  i was thinking of buying a playpen and filling it with cardboard boxes or something to form a little town for them to explore
  i rat proofed a room in my home that only had their cage and some metal shelves i was using for storage in it everything on the shelves that could be ruined was in durable containers i also arranged it all in such a way as to be interesting and climbable by adventuresome ratties i still always supervised from a cushion sitting on the floor i was very careful when i moved or walked and i also paid extra special care to the doorway     the laundry basket was their favorite hangout when they got to it that and they liked visiting me
would it be possibly ok if i buy a bag of high quality rat food and mix it with high quality hamster food there only exists one store that sells rat food but its very far away so i cannot buy their rat food too often plus they sometimes dont even have rat food when it sells out
  buy the ingredients for your own dry mix  there are lists of good things to include but a short web search away they also need regular fresh stuff if you didnt already know in the end it will be much better for your rats than any premade mix
  high quality rat food     what does that look like
  looks like this      no its not okay rats and hamsters have different nutritional requirements and rats are picky eating only the foods that they like just feed them lab blocks and supplement it with fresh foods like vegetables
  thanks for the reply but sadly where i live there are no rat blocks even hamster blocks were hard to find back when i had hamsters the only rat foods there are are supplements like vitasmart muesli sticks with tons of things glued on wood theres also mouse nature and vitasmart food packs intended for mice if these would be better than hamster food bags ive heard supposedly mouse food bags work for rats but im unsure if this is accurate      food bags that meets 8090 of the rats nutritional requirements thing is these come and vanish randomly at the pet shops so its not very reliable sometimes
    food bags that meets 8090 of the rats nutritional requirements    shit like that is ery funny when its printed on commercial animal food i used to keep a rat in a 120x60x30cm box made from chicken wire on the grass in the garden i saw this in a pet store that bred rats for snake food it ate all the insects that would find their way in there which is a considerable amount and i fed it additional yoghurt/buttermilk/salmon oil/cod liver oil/oats/bird seed mix/pumpkin seeds/leftover roasted chicken and bones/apple and other fruit and veggies etc  my point is your kitchen very likely has everything you need to feed a rat better than any commercial food would
  shit like that is ery funny when its printed on commercial animal food  its not the  of fat fiber and protein etc written on the food bag matches what rat forums recommend
  commercial animal food is industrial waste from human food production which often enough is abominable enough itself i only bred rats for food like written about above for a short 3 years but my rats have always been perfectly healthy and dropping pinkies like mad the males i got over from friends to inseminate my females would usually first pig out on their food before getting to work we have a protein rich cheese here i used to feed a lot in my mix 1214g protein/100g that was a hit with the rats
  commercial animal food is industrial waste from human food production which often enough is abominable enough itself  seems unrealistic to imply all animal food is this but i can see it being realistic for animals who already have short life spans like rats mice and hamsters however i dont live in america or poland where people dont care about what pets eat i live in a country with possibly the strictest food regulations world wide or at least in europe food intended for rodents that you buy from pet shops is actually grown to be fed to rodents here not humans so im sure i can trust the pet food here for its quality a little bit more
how often and thorough do you need to clean cages is it possible to toilet train
  1 week or 15 week depending on how large it is i clean my cage on almost a germphobic way where i scrub with a sponge using dish washer soap including the bars of the cage my breeder friend goes as far as to use bleach but she makes sure she washes out the bleach entirely to avoid harming her rats if i could id clean more often but thats not ideal as male rats will get stressed and start to urinate even more just to make their smell more strong
have 2 cats  neither do their jobs of catching and eating rodents  stop feeding them and they just subsist off of frogs and lizards  also have like 80 chickens and none of them hunt rodents  have to get a 60 electric trap since rats start getting into the chicken feed and killing baby chicks  stupid cat still does not eat rodent unless its a small baby one    i hate dealing with dead rats because i actually like the little guys when they are not causing trouble on the farm is there any better way do deal with them     pic is marx the stupid commie cat who shares the wealth of the pigs and eats their food instead of doing his fucking job
  your cats fucking suck mine catch hares and birds of prey regularly and hes almost 20 years old get a new one
  not my cats just working on the farm to learn farmin stuff or i would get a new one theyve caught moles before but dont seem to go after much larger prey than that
  in awe at the size of this lad absolute unit
my boys butch and petey
  im researching rat diets in preparation for getting some  i can get lab blocks by ordering online and vegetables from a nearby shop how often should i include veggies in their food bowl is that something i put in every day or just sometimes
  i used to think the same until i rescue a dwarf hamster to keep it in my room at the beggining it was boring but cute but soon she wanted more freedom and i let her roam wild through my house at that point she transformed into a curious inteligent and lovegiving animal god i miss her so much
are rat nipples supposed to be visible i noticed they are visible on my rats and i dont remember seeing them on those that were before i wonder if something wrong with their coats or their breasts udders teats
redpill me on breeding rats is it worth it does selling them bring in profit   every time i look at breeding them online every breeder goes off their nut saying its not good for the rat where do the babies go blah blah etc  are breeders telling other people off who want to breed rats professionally a meme  pic somewhat unrelated three of my 4 week boys who are now 6ish months old now
  cute
  i like to give my rats fresh veggies every day making up around 20 of their daily calorie intake
can you just give food to rats and trust them to eat just what they need or do you need to ration them
rade
  b
  rats will eat what they need  if you give them extra food theyll just horde the extra in hiding spots for later
happy thanksgiving rat general
how do your kids feel about rats
going to get rats for the first time soon just doing some more search to make sure i know how to take care of them properly  cage is gonna be a critter nation pic related also getting a list of all the items i need like hammocks toys and things for them to hide in    quite excited to have some cute ratty boys of my own
  the breeder i bought my rats from suggested that in addition to adding hammocks places to hide etc i also remove the ramp going from the ground level to the platform the idea is that it encourages climbing  exercise they definitely have no problem getting up and down
which form is cutest
  5 just look at those eyes
  b
  this form  but they are always adorable
any good suggestions on fruits and veggies i can give to my rats my girls only seem to like greens collard greens kale mustard and turnip greens they hate carrots theyre very indifferent to broccoli and cauliflower and they dont seem to care about any fruit i give them they take a few nibbles out of strawberriesgrapes apples blueberries and then straight up abandon them its really weird because two of them i got from a pet store and the other two are from a breeder and they seem to all hate the same things they eat their lab blocks fine i just heard that giving them some veggies is a good thing to do too
  between 3 and 4 is the most puppy like behavior therefor the cutest i had one lil rat that would spend 20 or so minutes at a time about 48 times a day just doing backflips and jumping off the sides of the walls doing flips and roll around and stuff very cute
  youre a big rat
  b
uuuuuuu one year wait list for a breeder in my area do you all recommend rats from a shelter
  fug anyone wanna reply
how would you feel if a house mouse showed up and took a liking to you and let you pet him
  i like 9  look at that boy  he mad but also good
is it art
  yes of course anything a rat makes is art
  no dont breed rats
  why would you want to breed them selling rat babies isnt exactly profitable breeders also tend to take good care of the babies and make sure they are healthy and sociable which takes time and doesnt return much profit at all rats are also breed for better genetics like low aggression and longevity there are surely more things i dont even know if you want to become a breeder do your research if i get rats from a breeder i expect the rats to be friendlier and healthier as far as the breeder can see than store/rescue rats
  i breed for enjoyment and for continuing my lines dont expect to make money the cost of good food for so many rats will always outweigh any money you would make from selling them and if you wanna breed show quality rats expect to pay a shit ton for breeding rights and all that bullshit    on a similar note id like to discuss rat breeding ethics    i live in an area with the snobbiest breeders so i had to get my rats from feeder bins and craigslist i dont really get why a rat should cost 60 just because it has a pedigree ive witnessed that these breeders treat their expensive rats worse than my feeder rats the most renowned pet breeder in my area keeps their breeder rats in plastic bins and wood shavings and only keeps their personal pet rats in the good cages i spoke to this person and they berated me big time when i mentioned that i breed rats they started talking about how the community in our area spends so much time rescuing rats and that they are all at full capacity and cant save anymore    how do these people explain/feel about feeder breeders/reptiles etc i only breed once or twice a year and when i cant sell or give away anymore more babies as pets i bring them to a pet store to be sold as pets or food depending on demand and age is this really that unethical to do considering most feeder breeders keep their rats in deplorable condition isnt it better to have feeder rats that were raised healthily ive seen the other feeder rats at this store and this is one of the most popular stores in the area and they are all on the verge of death and will bite you if you get close    basically i got in an argument with this person on a rat group on facebook because i was looking for a male rat to breed with my females and preceded to be called rude and unethical
  wtf where you at
he was a good ol boy
  stretchy boy
  las vegas
whats the best cage i could get for a couple of big rat boys
  boop
any tips on how to get your rat to take medicine my vet has my rat on amoxicillin and meloxicam ive been able to trick my rat into consuming the amoxicillin by pouring it in chocolate ensure but somehow she always knows when ive put the meloxicam in whatever shes eating or drinking ive tried baby food apple sauce ensure peanut butter chocolate and strawberry syrupyogurt pudding she doesnt fall for it ever someone recommended onions baby formula and that almost worked but after drinking it super enthusiastically she started rubbing her face all over the bed and now she wont touch it it was super weird
  damn filters    s o y baby formula
fellas fellas fellas im from /biz/ im here to tell you quick ratcoin is on the rise buy into it now
heres a recent pic of one of my boys names hades
what kind of bedding do yall use and how often do you change/clean it
  i was using carefresh but it made my girls sniffle a lot i use fleece now and theyre litter trained so i wash it all out about once a week its about 2 yards to cover my critter nation and they usually have it all torn up and chewed to bits and unable to use after 4 or 5 weeks fleece might not be a good choice if your rats arent potty trained though the piss soaking into the fleece can make them sick if you dont clean it often enough
  drybed/vetbed  twice a week
many might be debating what animals are the most intelligent ones but are there any scientific evidence to point out what animals are the most retarded in general
preferably mammals
probably humans
  koalas
  probably this they work pretty much entirely on instinct
  sloths are so fucking stupid they can mistake their own legs for branches and try to grab them then fall to their death for some reason they are also incapable of shitting while hanging in the trees so they crawl down to the ground every few days to take a shit and are vulnerable to predation    these retards are such easy prey for harpy eagles that breeding pairs will just leave them hanging in an area around their nest so that the chicks can practice hunting on them
    ive heard koalas cant recognize eucalyptus leaves as food unless if the leaves are on a branch they wont eat a pile of leaves because they dont know its food they could starve to death in a room covered in their only food source and sloths dont even bother trying to escape predators perhaps they know its useless but they could at least attempt to flee
  this is ridiculous how did they outlive relatives like megatherium  
  you
  koalas are literally smooth brains
  some single cell rubbish obviously
  imagine an animal that is so stupid that many of them are not aware what animal they are nor even what sex they are imagine this animal enforcing this confusion by force and punishing any aspect to further the species finally imagine this species attempting to destroy all variants of itself under the orders of one variant which wishes to be undisturbed itself  humans are the most retarded  nailed it
  imagine having literally no brain
    unbased
  kek this
probably primates animals like fish and insects run on autopilot and arent prone to fucking up as an animal gets more intelligent it has freewill and has to think leading to possible mistakes and variations in intelligence you dont see a frog cutting its dick off but look at people today
  sponges/jellyfish  no nerves/brain  literally incapable of thinking  i think i win
  no nerves
  imagine an animal that actively destroys its environment and gloats about how important and special they are
  cringe
pits
  implying an animal that can effectively destroy life as we know it isnt important or special
owls are some of the dumbest birds their eyes and ears take too much space in the skull so they have tiny brains
pitbulls are the retards of the dog world
  sounds like an animal toying with the complexity of existence instead of simply bowing to immediate circumstances
  pretty ironic from being the symbol of wisdom
  they arent the dumbest but certainly not as smart as people tend to believe
  muh humans  muh climate change
marsupials  completely daft cunts they only have survival mechanisms in their brain much like lizards especially koalas fuck koalas
    huge numbers of insects fuck up and end up drowing in puddles getting stuck in spiders webs etc fish can get stuck in shallow water and caught out by tides
  out of all chordates koalas are definitely the most retarded
dinosaurs are extin

  thanks for correcting op
  birds are cool
birbs are cute
  why would anyone ever buy that shirt for their daughter
   this is just what they do even if its entirely clear that little girl would not like the shirt they will buy it anyway
  okay this fucker looks like a dinosaur all the other pics in this thread are just mildly intimidating birds but this thing looks like it crawled out of a jurassic jungle
  how much does this bird weight seems like a good replacement for a dog
  they weigh like 12 lbs
  6 kg
   in what way dogs and birds of prey are nothing alike
  what an absolute unit
birds evolved from dinosaurs    lmao okay op give me proof
  whats it say i cant make out anything but talk
    nice     size
    except they arent not counting birds crocodylomorphs are archosaurs that have been around since the triassic and species very much similar to extant crocodilians have been around since the late cretaceous
modern theropods are lovely  
  agreed
  daww id love to do that but i think im allergic to bird dander
  hmmmmm mmmmmmm hhhhnnnhmmmm mmmmmmmmmmhmmmmmm  i hate your whimpering
  i think it says girl talk dont see the problem with that desu
  gib crystal pls
    dinosaurs never went extinct just certain species of dinosaurs just like certain species of mammals etc
  emus look so much like raptors it isnt even funny
  aussies and emus sign peace treaty
  
  strange dog
  but as closely related as they are they are not dinosaurs
  you just know
  its a big animal it is like a dog xd
  you are going to need to give us a concise definition of what you consider a dinosaur

   they are indeed dinosaurs at least according to the experts
why are big ol birbs so cool bros
  the third one sounds exactly like an old monster movie
  theyre big and feathery which looks cute
   had a strange inclination to hug that thing
  how painful do they bite
  welcome to 4channel how new are you
  extremely
  anon thats a man
  how extremely how many mpa
  how can aussies even compete
  its a big bird
  most animals who also are taking their kids with their mouth have really really control over their biting  cats or dogs for example have brains that realize within nano seconds when they accidentally bite something  therefore they cant bite their own tongues off or hurt it like human actually can    birds also have strange skills so control their bites
  i know that birds can control their bite quite well but sometimes they go full retard and in case of small african grey its quite painful  in theory it should be quite painful considering that they need to cut flesh
  archosaur / dinosaur    crocs are still great tho i went to florida for the first time last spring and enjoyed seeing the alligators walk around with a gait that the lizards couldnt becasue of archosaurian femurs

  birds are awesome
  oh lawd he comin
  just
  guished
  birds fall under that category
  birds are dinosaurs they are part of the dinosauria clade they are literally dinosaurs
birds are by definition under the clade dinosauria sharing a common ancestor with deinonychosauria and likely evolving from archaeopteryxlike or troodontid ancestors so that means every time you see a pigeon or a duck youre looking at a coelurosaurian theropod who outplayed the nonavian dinosaurs before it technically were still living in the age of dinosaurs what with the 10000 odd individual species of avian dinosaur
  good lord what a big fucking boy i need the sauce on this bird

  varanids are the thing with best chance of becoming dinosaurs again once the earth heats up    pic related crocs cant do this
  it depends maybe the crocs could evolve longer legs
  no crocodiles cant thrive on land varanids do and ate actually very successful    if for some reason mammals were to ho extinct im sure varanids would take over all the land niches
  kek
  guys i think i ate too fast
  im sure varanids would take over all the land niches  there are still birds and other lizards theyll have to deal with

 hart wrote our conclusion is that eating of fresh stools is a reflection of an innate predisposition of ancestral canids living in nature that protects pack members from intestinal parasites present in feces that could occasionally be dropped in the den/rest area his study consisted of two separate surveys sent to about 3000 dog owners while it is repulsive to human sensibilities its not really all that bad from a canine point of view dogs evolved as scavengers eating whatever they found on the ground or in the trash heap so their ideas of haute cuisine is somewhat different from ours in his handbook of applied dog behavior and training animal behaviorist steven r lindsay says that coprophagia may be one of several appetitive survival behaviors that have evolved to cope with the periodic adversity of starvation in other words when food is scarce you cant be picky     mother dogs will lick their puppies to urge them to eliminate and clean their feces for about the first three weeks puppies will also naturally engage in this behavior eating both their own fecal droppings known asautocoprophagia and those of other dogs allocoprophagia as well as cats and other animals some dogs find horse manure and goose droppings particularly appealing eating their own poop is harmless but consuming that of other animals may cause health problems if the stool is contaminated with parasites viruses or toxins in most cases this behavior will fade before the puppy is about nine months old
  coprophagia wasmore common in multidog households in singledog homes only 20 percent of dogs had the habit while in homes with three dogs that rose to 33 percent    poop eaters areno harder to house trainthan any other dogs    females are more likely to eat poop and intact males were least likely    92 percent of poop eaterswant fresh stuff only one to two days old    85 percent of poop eaterswill not eat their own feces only that of other dogs    greedy eatersdogs who steal food off tablestend to also be poop eaters

this thread makes me realise i need a holiday i need to see some new and interesting animals
  thanks macros of insects ftw  i was surprised my phone was able to focus right usually the pics turn out crappy like pic related
    it took me a long time playing with my s8 to reach its capabilities the stock settings really suck     here is a coopers hawk on my property  my moose photos never turned out though which is a shame
    here is a gopro drop of a school of shad
friendly visitor
  made this picture just today
  this looks like some gigantic divine being on the horizon
      i havent watched quatermass and the pit in like 25 years but this thing looks like the alien monster thing from the end of it    if im remembering it right
white possum
  whys it on your kitchen table
be my cat  its winter time  he snuggles under the covers with me in my legs  proceed to let out several stinky farts  cat has no reaction and continues to purr even though they disgust even me  why dont cats care about smelly farts
because they smell like you and they love you
  be cat  spend my days napping  in between naps i eat my own ass and sniff any other animals ass that gets close enough  sometimes i tongue punch the dogs fartbox then his ears  sleeping in the bed with the human he gives me a gnarly dutch oven  little does he know im braaaap poster and his gas just turns me on
  kek
they dont smell things like we do
  fucking lold
cats do like smelly things like smelly shoes and such
  cats are incapable of feeling love they operate on a lower level of stimuli
  i dont know about cats but when i fart one of my dogs will give me a dirty look and leave the room while the other one lifts his nose in my direction to get a better whiff
  so cats love the smell of farts then
ive gone my entire life liking birds and studying them ive also felt like ive been missing something in my life i think falconry might be the thing to brighten up my life i want to know if anyone has any experience in it and advice fuggin doubt it but hey you guys are full of surprises never know
  ask arabs unironically  mine neighbors took care of hurt one but i was like 5 yo so i dont know much
  yea ik its popular over there it like originated over there apparently they will capture a wild one train it for a year then release it
  i have studied everything a wannabe falconer should know before seriously pursuing an apprenticeship and decided its not for me   apparently theyre easier to keep than large parrots but icbf rn to be the falconer every day of the year regardless of weather i would say its a good filling for a gaping bird hole in your ornithologist heart if youre really that crazy about dinosaurs   would be pretty cool to be t falconer and do presentations at schools and stuff though but if youre going to take a raptor from the wild to hunt with it you better damn be training with it everyday and actually hunting when you can
  i wouldnt get one from the wild i feel like that would be so unfair to them plus my gf is afraid of birds so we decided if i got one id get it as a chick
  if you think catching and training a wild raptor as a falconry apprentice is unfair dont even think of trying to raise a chick as a total noob falconer   how tf you an ornithologist that thinks he needs a murderbird in his life but your gf is afraid of birds
  imprinted birds   thats fucking awful man those are a nightmare  youre better off catching a young passage bird to train and then releasing after a year or two you basically keep it alive through the most lethal period of life for a bird teach it to be a successful hunter and its healthy and well fed when it comes time to go free and raise babies
  cus me and my gf are two individuals with our own opinions and preferences and true thats a good point this is why i started this tread to get advice and opinions before i start really thinking about anything
  good point thats a really good point
  also not an ornathologist at all non organized casual study sorry for the confusion im just an enthusiast
  yeah i wouldnt even think of handraising a raptor if i didnt have experience raising other baby birds and youre used to them being 100 reliant on you around the clock   and even if they survive they usually end up thinking theyre a hoomin
  hooman birbs are awesome would totally keep a parrot or parakeet if i had a house
  if i had a house   how tf you expect to keep a mew without a house
  no op but im curious as to the difference between raising a raptor as opposed to raising another bird i know that the diet is going to be radically different but what other differences are there
as a young lad i wanted to become a falconer and even joined nafex am now a college graduate working in software making more than enough to provide for me and mine and wish id pursued falconry instead of my current career im sure if id become a master falconer i would feel the opposite lifes a bitch
we look at talking birds like parrots and ravens and say wow dude that bird talks radical but imagine if an ostrich saw a deaf guy and said to a flamingo wow dude that man doesnt talk radical
  haha random dx
its currently 312 am in the uk ive just been woken up to what is either a mouse or a rat in the corner of my bedroom either in my cupboard or underneath my floorboards more unlikely though whats the best way to deal with it in a few hours since everyone is still asleep
  have you considered gas
if youve got one mouse youve got a million theres nothing you can do right now to stop them
  put a trap there tomorrow    to get rid of mice you clean your house put out traps and wait for them to run out of food and get caught in traps    if they actually have a lot of food they are mostly smart enough to avoid traps
  this you might as well let them into your house since you cant win how about you give them some nice delicious food to welcome them i have a hunch they love peanut butter but you gotta water it down first or else your brand new little friends might choke and we sure dont want that do we
similiar situation mouse randomly comes to my room pretty much every night and it just runs around the room then leaves
  make a sheet out of duct tape strips and put it on the floor with some food in the center when the rodent gets stuck just roll it up and smack it with a hammer a few times
  this isnt true i found and killed one then incidentally killed one a few months later from a trap i set and never removed that i placed near the probable entrance they were taking from outside it was just a poorly sealed ground floor apartment that was the cause of the problems
    i wonder what spider milk tastes like
  will chinks now harvest spider milk as medicine
  no they only use things that dont work
  milk  silk  
  )))
there was the roach milk already the buzz lasted for two weeks and now nobody talks about it anymore
  good spider mommies
  they genetically modified goats to make spider silk from their tits and you could milk spider silk from them so i dont think its too far fetched that the reverse could happen naturally arent there some birds that secrete a milk like substance out of glands for their chick
  why is there a star photoshopped onto the abdomen of the mother
  shes actually wearing a onestar goku uniform
so is this ant a mammal
  yeah pigeons with their crop milk means their kids can always have food as long as the parent can
  so you know which one is the mother
hey /an/  has anyone here ever tried to kill themselves via an animal sting i want to be killed by the sting of a cone snail    i have a few reasons for this my life is bad and it is because i have brain damage so i am very slow i want to be killed by a snail because it will be a good thing my slowness has ruined my life so the ultimate slow creature a snail should get to end it    people have always bullied and humiliated me and i deserve it i want to die via cone fish and become a meme that people make jokes about and therefore i will have a good memory that i leave for the people    i also want to become famous i have written a first draft of my suicide note in which i reccommend jokes people could make about me getting killed by a snail to help my favoured memory develop they are just suggestions as i have a low quality sense of humour due to my slow mind     how do you think is the best way to do this
  you probably need a cone snail for this to even happen
  this is the draft for my note
  slowness  are you physically slow or just stupid  if its the latter i doubt your that dumb for a few reasons you type just fine with proper grammar and spelling and you acknowledge that you are slow dumb people dont realize they are dumb they just think life is harder for them because of outside reasons   if its the former who cares get a desk job somewhere make a little money and have hobbies
i didnt come to /an/ to feel
  im sure the brain damage makes him feel slower than he was and makes him pessimistic
  this having a slower thought process isnt the same as not being able to connect the dots youll probably do as well as your average office worker trust me and the other anon
  i am mentally retarded and useless
  you could be in a successful pop punk band
  what do you have i have aspergers and still manage to be worth more than a lot of other fucks youre overthinking shit
  i am mentally retarded and useless  if you think that you arent stupid people are too stupid to realize they are stupid
  then go to a doctor get diagnosed and live a comfy life on neetbux
  i have a head injury that has made me slow and retarded  pleas eguys just help me
  dont kill yourself and instead study something you have an interest in instead of being the guy who died from a cone snail become the guy who knows a lot about cone snails
im afraid procuring such a snail is too much of a complicated operation for a retard such as yourself stick around in this world op maybe advancements in technology will cure your retardation someday theyre researching neuroprosthetics rn and the field is probably going to explode in a few decades
    pretty sure they have a really interesting venom
go to the coast of western australia  explore some rock pools for large pretty shells  put them up to your ear and listen  get pinched by a hermit crab  of course you wouldnt be the first to die from a cone snail so youd simply be forgotten about and added to the statistics
  they dont interest me i just wanted to die from one
  get eaten by a pitbull instead the statistics need to go up so they can finally get banned
  good luck finding one   i have been trying forever  unless you are an aussie its so hard to get aussie marine life
  some anon on here had a bunch of them a couple years back    your retardation isnt the problem youre just sort of a dick    stop being a dick and people will be much nicer to you
  after reading the thread youre bullshitting
my family has a shih tzu and she wont shut up  its usually around 2am3am that she whines the most and shell bark off and on for hours   she wont let us get any sleep and i dont even know why she whines ill let her outside give her food and water give her attention but she wont stay quiet this cant be normal my other animals are quite at night     plz help its 4am and i have my finals tomorrow but she wont let me get any rest
  my brother has 2 lhasa apso which i seem like just bigger shih tzus anyway the female does that she just wanders around and whines 24 hours a day for no fucking reason shes like 17 years old and has been doing it her entire life good luck anon
take her to bed with you yeah youll get fleas and might not be able to resist smelling her paws but drastic times call for drastic measures
  shes been barking off and on since about 2 am and its 4 now   i really cant take this ive lost so much sleep over this dog i dont even know what she wants
  i swore id never use a shock collar but then i got small dogs it fixes the problem
  ill try to take her to bed with my but she just leaves and continues barking
  maybe someone is in the house   did you look behind you 
  spray it with a fire extinguisher
  if the fire extinguisher doesnt work smack it on the head with a rolled up newspaper
op here again   its 6 am and i still cant get sleep   shes been barking for 3 hours straight memes aside can someone give me a answer this cant be normal   how does she not get tired   god i hate this dog shes actually fucked up my life
  i already gave you the answer  bark collar    surgery is also an option but bark collars are a lot cheaper and just as effective
  at the dog park there once was a chi barking like mad stirring shit up i asked the owner if i could try to calm her down i unzipped my jacket sat down put the dog in my jacket and asked my dog to sit down in front of us too the chi calmed down and started interacting with my dog      i hope you die in a fire soon
  i hope you die in a fire soon  me too anon me too    until that time ill just point out that you arent at ops house to rapehold his familys dogs and even if you were your magical powers arent going to last more than ten minutes after you let it go
  until that time ill just point out that you arent at ops house to rapehold his familys dogs and even if you were your magical powers arent going to last more than ten minutes after you let it go    lemme just spoonfeed you the gist off the story small dogs are scared because they are small they then overcompensate there must be an underlying reason for why ops dog is uppity if you spend more close time with it chances are youll find the reason sooner even if its not that its just scared and wants closeness
  perhaps    but theres also the fact that dogs gain comfort from barking and even if you remove the underlying source of discomfort you still havent broken the habit of barking for comfort    so the problem will just continue even after you psychoanalyze the poor pupper and remove what you think is the source of the discontent
  small dogs are mad that theyre small  oh my god this website is full of morons
  no sane/healthy dog barks for 3hrs non stop at this point id even suggest going to a vet dogs that get put in a shelter cry themselves to exhaustion within 30mins of barking when they first start to bark like that
  in my anecdotal experience the dog doesnt have to be in constant pain or stress to bark constantly    all they need is to be in pain or stressed long enough to develop the habit of barking and from there on youve got 17 years of constant barking even when the animal is perfectly content    a vet would just recommend surgery or a bark collar which i have already done
  oh my god this website is full of morons  they arent mad but they are guarded because any accidental misstep by a bigger dog can cripple them
  if a german shepherd waltzes through ops shanty then that might be useful insight
  there is a reason why they call thm neurotic dogs they get scared without an obvious reason sometimes the point is to disrupt the behaviour and stop it from going on to where it becomes selfreinforcing as  wrote
    rare sequential digits
just kill it desu senpai
  apparently pet psychiatrists make big bucks in lame places like los angeles its a california thing  
op here again   i talked to my mom and she pointed out that the dog sleeps all day so shes awake at night   im gonna try not letting her sleep today in the evening ill take her on a walk or something my sister also had these calming treats for her dog ill also take some nyquil or something because im a light sleeper   maybe i just need to tire her out   id rather avoid the shock collar because i dont think theyre humane but i might at this point     also in the end she quited down when my sister let her into her room so i was able to get a few hours of sleep
also shes 12 years old and a purebred so hopefully she wont live much longer   but i know the more you hate them the longer they live
  maybe i just need to tire her out  you solved the mystery you fucking trash
  shitzu  12 years old  lol you got like another 48 years my man
  hahah
  you can use a collar that makes noise and vibrates when they bark instead of a shock theyre pretty cheap and they do work
  if that is it  shih tzus are low energy dogs and shes old she really shouldnt have much energy  if it was the dog in your pic or a younger dog that would make sense  but i will find out tonight
  i might try this  even though i hate her i dont want to hurt her but i also want sleep so
  small dogs are often athletic as fuck i have known maltese and doxes that would run circles around a gsd and would be able to almost keep up ofc being much smaller they tire out faster when they play with bigger dogs do not overdo it just go to a park start slow throw a ball let it meet some other dogs about its size moderate if bigger dogs come around let it socialize and play     
      fuck wrong link    
    
  shes not active at all i can hardly get her to go on a walk  when i do take her on walks she gets tired a stops in the middle of the road and i have to carry her back home   but i guess that means it wont take much to tire her out
dogs need exercise and walks every day  walks / exercise they are different in the dogs mind and they need both since she is a small old dog neither will take a long time  play with her in the morning before you leave for work / school and go for a walk in the evening after dinner
  ok ill give her more activity   im way too exhausted now though im just really frustrated from lack of sleep and stress from my finals i cant really study when im this tired and have headaches  she didnt used to be this way it started about a year ago and its gotten way worse recently
    activity doesnt always mean running like mad after a ball an older dog may physically no longer want to run but will still want to do stuff  like say playing the shell game for treats the dog wants stimulation find such activities that it likes and do those if dog park  fetch arent really her thing a xxxxl big snuffle mat can be a great choice if your dog likes nose work  just hide its daily food ration in it
lol this reminds me sorry for the off topic post  be 21yo neet living with parents  like alcohol a little too much  if i wasnt studying for college or looking for a job start drinking as early as 2 pm  sometimes stay up until 35am getting plastered and dickin around  would be up late watching bullshit on youtube browsing 4chan playin games  sneak downstairs to get drinks dont worry it was all drink i bought with own money  dont wanna wake parents    foster a dog a few months after our old boy had to be put down cos of arthritis and he was in severe pain  he was 17 years old rip bud still miss you  shes just under a year old  greyhound mutt rescued from an illegal puppy farm very hyper and can be naughty but loving as fuck  could grab food right from under her wouldnt be aggressive  clever too    one night sneak downstairs for a brew  rummage in kitchen making a little noise because im after having like 8 beers  dog walks up  hand her a piece of ham call her a good girl etc  had a few weeks off from college so this becomes a thing  be 1 something am sneak downstairs trying not to wake parents up get beer give dog a treat etc    ffwd few months  sometimes dont give her a treat every time i grab a beer  one night go get a beer  close fridge  head out the kitchen  dog does that sort of semiwoof not loud following me  look at her say hey its me girl hey shh  could swear she looked at the fridge almost like oi forgetting something  pet her she sits waiting in the kitchen  get drunk in my room    next night same story  go grab a beer  dont give food to dog and leave  dog starts semibarking/growling  look at her and try comfort  think that she doesnt recognise me or something cos its dark  hey its me shh  go to the hallway to go up the stairs  she barks a few times following me  wtf youre gonna wake my parents  anon is that you    she doesnt do that when i give food  tfw my dog is a narc and i had to bribe her for silence
might be dementia that will get worse at night
op update again   i took her to petsmart last night and bought her a toy and calming spray sprayed the toy with the calming spray and then let her play with it  she seemed to really enjoy it   i also took some medicine to help me sleep   im gonna take her for a walk tonight and get her to play with the toy again but this time i wont add any more of the spray   hopefully she just needed a little activity     i actually considered that she may have some sort of mental disorder   my uncles dog has separation anxiety and barks non stop for hours when he leaves her
  wow shit zoos are ugly as fuck
  no sane/healthy dog barks for 3hrs  does this look healthy to you
hey any bird people here can educate me on something  i have this spot at a local river bank where i basically look at the surface and just meditate for hours ive been doing it long enough to notice that ducks get into those big flocks and just chill together in the river only during winters  like no other season i could ever see this sort of a picture  tell me why do they do that im dying to know
i think this might be a thing with many birds but during spring  fall when theyre raising ducklings theyre solitary with their families ones the babies grow up everyone kinda just gathers into groups to chill for the winter until duckling time again and then the groups disband
fuck your mom bitch     now that i got your attention this winter my gsp is going to be sleeping in my room id love to cuddle with him to sleep no homo but i dont want to get sick what are some pointers i should keep in my mind for a night owl whos not used to the whole dog sleeping in my room thing
  being around a dog  getting sick  wtf are you on about damn near all diseases that a dog can contract arent communicable with humans why would you get sick from it sleeping on your bed
  based but greenpilled
  dont lick it or anything it lies on i guess
  most retarded question of the decade  do you think your dog is a walking pathogen there are very few zoonoses that are transmittable to humans you would know if your dog had any of them and youd have to be transferring bodily fluids from your dog in order to contract most of them such as having sex  educate yourself and stop being a hypochondriac
  its too late it already wiped its feces smeared anal region all over your home
dont start smelling its feet thats an addiction you do not want to get sucked into
where can i find info about these guys and their evolution google isnt helping i want to know when they evolved and what their ancestry looks like
spoonfeed me because im too retarded to use google and gave up after one search where i used common names
  if i hadnt tried everything i wouldnt have turned to the worst board on 4chan for help
  
youre a lazy faggot but ill help you anyways theyre just terrestrial isopods and have barely changed for millions of years theyre actually crustaceans and the land ones still have their gills and have to be moist to properly respire just like a frog or a salamander
  i appreciate the attempt but like i said i already tried googling many variations of my question so i already know this im looking for more information than youd provide a 3rd grade science student
this actually just came up in my invertebrate physiology class marine isopods are higher crustaceans same subphylum as carbs and shrimp and started to diverge from amphipods in the late devonian/early carboniferous amphipods being flat sided isopods being flat topped the bottom crawling body plan of isopods made it easy for them to move on land and theres evidence of them on land from the middle carboniferous appearing later than most orders of insects and much later than the millipedes which they resemble even with the millipedes in direct competition the amount of wood lying around far surpassed what decomposers consumed so pill bugs were able to become extremely common not really being limited by food supply saying theyve barley changed is misleading the isopod body plan worked well in the carboniferous and it works well today but if you look under one log youll often find at least 3 clearly distinct kinds of wood lice even if fossils look the same they still change all the time invertebrates just dont change as obviously as dogs also wikipedia usually has that kind of info
  used to carry these things rune bugs since the markings on thier backs look like some type of runes
search isopod evolution on google  first two links have great info and explore everything from paleohistory to anatomy  i dont blame you for being interested in them though really incredible animals but the other anons here have already posted good shit  pic related seems to be a major predator for them
  teleports behind you

do you eat meals with your pets /an/
  when i eat my dog is usually curled up next to my chair i save bites for her until all the people are done eating then i give them to her as we are cleaning up
  i eat meals of my pets
  i usually make a mini version of my breakfast for my rats when its something i can give them
i only have a betta so no    however her tank is in the kitchen so she gets tidbits of what im cooking from time to time
the only peoplefood that my cat gets is a bit of banana periodically because he a love him banan
my iguana did that everytime i fed him in a bowl  eventually i just started slapping it on his feeding platform  he still knocks it everywhere just now i dont have to clean a bowl ontop of the floor
this little fish is so precious i love wathing it
  fish always look so serious its not like theyve got much going on
  better being serious than being an immature piece of shit no girl wants a clown they want serious manly businessmen that can provide them with all they need
where are their organs
  in the front
kryptopterus bicirrhis  glass catfish
  glass catfish are sometimes were used to show how fish dont have a lymphatic system but instead it was a secondary vascular system
  trips of scientific truth  i just want to see them eat and digest
  find current  swim against it  this is your life now  do it til you die
  where is their cocks and vagines
  see those whiskers on the front
  could be worse    imagine being a nematode
  get some glass shrimp for cleanup crew
  is just fish
  i love feeding my shrimp different food and watching their poop tubes turn different colors
  theyre very skiddish fish give them lots of places to hide make sure they can be away from bright light and have at least 6 of them to boost their confidence incredibly awesome looking fish and the way they hover in the same place looks beautiful especially when theyre in a group please take care of them if you get them
  i had a school of 15 of them in my 135 river tank they would always swim in a school against the current just at the top of the grasses     they all died in mass when i added some fish that must have had fish herpes from the petstore     they died super fucking quick over nothing
  thanks for the tips  i will certainly buy a big tank if i ever decide to have those fish 3 each approx  real plants or just artificial for them to hide
op itt
  real plants plastic plants would scratch them and since they dont have scales theyll get infected super easily
  always real plants unless you are keeping giant fish that wreck everything
  hey lois
  in your mouth
  haha good response      thank you i have molly fish now and they dont quite give a fuck about my artificial plants hey real plants can be harsh too but i train them to be little commando special forces
i think you meant watching not wathing
  i think you meant watching not wathing
    yes mispelled very sorry
is this some kind of joke

excuse me i basically never come to /an/ is this a staple meme here what other staple memes do you have

  i thinks its a /tv/ meme i have honestly no idea whats going on but im not complaining
uh you dont get to bring empty spoons
  strange looking koi
  the koi itself is not a staple meme but occasionally there are threads like this that pop up with shopping something into a funny situation like the sad rat thread from the days of yore but its probably a common thing on other boards too     the only real things that might be a staple meme are its a brown recluse and cawcawcaw
is there a more dangerous animal/animals than a pack of wolves like i cant even see two or three grizzlies taking on a pack wolves absolutely destroy everything when in a group theyre like the modern velociraptor
  no animal is dangerous if you live in us and have gun
  while i somewhat agree a pack of wolves are fast enough and have enough members of the pack i probably couldnt kill them all before they got to me with any weapon    didnt you ever play black ops and call in the dogs carepackage those fuckers ripped you apart before you could even pull the trigger
      556
  wolves  velociraptors
  notice how you cant spell velociraptors without wolves
  notice how velociraptors were small shits irl
  notice how you cant spell wolves without deinonychus
    deinonychus  velociraptors     if you cunts are refering to animals seen in jurassic park and related fiction you meant to say achillobator giganticus
  notice how you cant spell wolves or velociraptors without achillobator giganticus

   what breed is he
tfw dog makes a pair with me because he knows i have no friend to pair together for the party game
  neat
  what party game there are no party games we live after 1930 and are adults
maybe the dog wanted to alpha someone and you were the most obvious bitch
last thread vanished suddenly very mysterious almost as mysterious as birds this is a general bird thread so feel free to share and discuss anything bird related here whether it be about pet birds or wild birds     if you have a pet bird or want to get a pet bird please consider feeding your bird a healthy varied diet including fresh vegetables and a good quality pellet as opposed to purely feeding dry seed mix if the bird is a common seed eating variety such as parrots     even the smallest of parrots can live longer than cats or dogs so keep that in mind before making the commitment birds are also loud messy and destructive     try clicker training do effective training of birds or pretty much any other animal google search clicker training parrot and there is a lot of material trick training is a good bonding experience and gives the bird mental stimulation

  why did the last thread get pruned
  the janitor is an autistic 55yo dinofag who hates birds and any life that doesnt live in his obsessively curated reef setup
  featherlet
  for me its the hornbill
  do your birds actually freak out at night  if i make too much noise my cockatiel says eeeeh and taps her beak at the cage bars to tell me to shut up
  not sure if dinofag but he out she more likely doesnt understand jokes
  i owned budgies that did it once in a blue moon
  my birds were always noisy unless i put them to bed sheet over their cage i kept 2 cockatiels one cockatoo a parakeet and 3 ravens in garage then outdoors
oi i just got a cockatiel and hes super wary of me any tips on getting this bastard not to hate me
  keep taking him out of the cage let him just hang out with you all day  if he wont leave the cage at least keep the cage close so he can see you if he bites dont react or hell do it more
when i was 17 i had a pet cockatiel i had for over 8 years it was a hot day so i left garage door open from yard to let my bird cool down come back 1hr later after hearing some loud screech notice theres a cat in garage with wires bent on cage and bird dead with blood all over cat escapes garage as im throwing shit at the fucker bury my bird then leave out a can of tuna with rat poison and octane booster next morning notice there was vomit with blood on our wooden fence suddenly feel at peace knowing i avenged my friend
  those are all fairly long lived birds what happened to them
  youre a fucking idiot and 100 the reason your bird is dead  if you werent such a mongoloid you would have known there were cats in the area and not left your bird alone next to an open door you shouldnt own pets
   i never had dealt with a cat in my yard or garage during the day youre super revvd right now lmao
  oh youre a cunt what kind of shit cage did you have that a fucking cat could bend the wires open  this does remind me   some relatives kid finds a budgie in a dumpster  takes hit home parents let him keep it  next day kids at school  grandma accidentally opens the cage  budgie flies out  cat catches it midair  snaps neck  grandma lets the cat eat it to hide the evidence  drives to the city and searches all pet stores until she finds a budgie that looks the same  gets back before the kid returns from school  13 years have passed and he still doesnt know that its not the same bird
why do geese have teeth
  to bite the shit out of you with
budgie is still obsessed with me and keeps flying to me i have managed to trick him with rewards everytime he steps onto the perch i put right next to him if i feed him millet after the clicker went missing so am waiting on a new one to show up and improvising right now
my homosexual finch went insane and murdered babies what the fuck do i do  have a malemale finch pair among some other finches  one of the gay finches dies of old age  other gay finch is depressed as fuck hope he will find a new mate but he just doesnt  recently one of my finch pairs had babies  faggot finch invades the nest and refuses to leave  parents keep screaming and trying to chase him out but he just fights them off  he doesnt feed the babies just obsessively sits on them  babies are clearly starving and becoming weak  decide the next morning that im going to forcefully remove the faggot  get to the cage and see all the babies lying dead on the ground with him still sitting in the nest
  just sounds like a regular gay to me bigot you should be celebrating his lifestyle not judging it
  one cockatiels flew into the ceiling fan dumb ass step sister took him out of his cage with it on i rehomed the other cockatiel as well as the cockatoo the parakeet was killed by one of the ravens one of the ravens was killed by one of my dogs and the other two ravens moved out but we banded them and occasionally saw them this was all between 2001 and 2006
  oops meant for you
  thats a lot of happenings in a short time consider not owning pets
  can you not read all of that happened over the course of 5 years consider killing yourself
  yeah and its a lot of horrible shit in a five year span responsible owners would have zero maybe one via bad luck happening in a five year span you had two deaths and two escapes if those ravens are african in origin you just modified the future local biosphere significantly
  stfu retard  dumb ass step sister let the one cockatiel out and he flew to the fan her fault for being a dumb cunt not mine  the second cockatiel was mine and i rehomed her years after i got her because i moved somewhere where i could not keep a bird  the cockatoo was donated by my stepmom to a local animal habitat for tax purposes  the parakeet was in his outdoor cage on the patio and one of the ravens was hanging out on top of it the parakeet kept biting his feet and the raven eventually grabbed the bird and pulled it through the bars killing it and attempting to eat it  the three ravens were stolen from the nest at the top of a very large pine try by my dumb ass cousins we took the three in and raised them in our garage we would take them outside in a dog pen with no top one of them tried to fly and made it out of the cage one of the dogs got the bird and broke its leg we made a splint and tried to fix his leg he was fine until he did the same thing then the same dog got him and killed him this time we buried the raven under a rock because the dog kept digging him up to eat when we finally put the rock on top of the grave all that was left was a wing and two feet  the other two ravens were shitting literally everywhere in the garage so we kicked them out they both lived in a tree right outside the garage until they decided to fly off  fuck you and your assumptions you dumb piece of shit
  sounds like your family is a bunch of shitty people maybe youre different but im assuming a soft nope considering how defensive youre being
  they use those things to filter stuff out of the water for eating theyre not really teeth and certainly arent used for normal teeth stuff just look like em a lot
  im just trying to inform you you should probably stop making assumptions
  make suggestions based on the information given  suggestions are confirmed by further details being given  calls me a dumb piece of shit for being on point  nah bro im not being overly defensive look at you assuming things based on me hurling personal insults and typing up reams of text proving you wrong except really it doesnt change anything because im just shifting blame around  you sound like a narc narc
  you didnt give any suggestions confirming that you are in fact a retard  fuck off already kiddo
  consider not owning pets  not a suggestion
  cats somehow manage to spread bars even on quite decent cages
  cats are serial killer vermin why do people buy them anyways
  i had the same question since we still have 2 cats that my sister got and left on me  and i realized only now why when theyre kittens they look so cute also people think are considered low maintenance pets but you will do the technical stuff like giving food and cleaning up the mess most of the time only small fraction of time you will spend playing with them also as cats grow  more boring they become    i dont understand why birds are considered highmaintenance pets at least i spend less time cleaning than dealing with parrot
  why birds are considered highmaintenance pets  theyll tear out all of their own feathers if they dont get enough attention
  yes but why would you get any pet then
  probably for similar reasons as to why many people want to have children
whats an ideal bird for someone who has never personally owned a bird i have lots of experience with dogs and small children so i know how to take care of things just not birds specifically  that being said i dont really want something that just stays in a cage all day i would want a species that likes socializing id also prefer something fairly smart just because i find it generally more enjoyable to take care of something that actually shows emotions and is decently smart instead of just a mindless animal actually talking isnt that necessary if its otherwise still smart  i was thinking a cockatiel seemed like a good option also what would be the best place to get a bird once ive made my choice/gotten everything ready seems like most places like petco etc only have some of the more common types cockatiels finches parakeets and some have conures  and what are some things i should know that might not be super common things told to new bird owners some things are obvious some are easily found in little pamphlets and shit they give you but there might be something less known and i want to be 100 prepared before i even think about actually pulling the trigger and buying a bird
  not clipping your birds wings  leaving a defenseless bird outside where ravens can get it  allowing dogs near your ravens multiple times     anon youre the problem in your life
  good on you for asking the questions anon     an ideal bird for you may be one of the smaller conure species dusky green cheek pineapple etc hahns macaws are a little shitty like all macaws but theyre pretty good birds if you train them right cockatiels are pretty good for what youre looking for too but they can be a bit more neurotic and stressprone      i volunteer at a parrot store that actually gives a shit about the birds so here are a few things ive learned     ask the store owner where the bird came from and how old it is there are very few if zero regulations on making sure the bird was weaned before being sold that it came from a good breeder etc they are not required to tell you any of this otherwise   never purchase a bird from a flea market or exotic pet expo the bird itself may be fine and great and deserving of a good life but it only promotes the terrible conditions these birds live in when theyre not sitting pretty in cages in front of a crowd honestly petco is the better option but theyre shit as well the best option is to buy from a reputable private breeder if you can afford it or from a store that feels comfortable disclosing all information about the bird   despite the seed meme pellets are the optimum diet seed mixtures are just usually nutritionally lacking so theyre okay as long as you supplement the bird with other things avoid sunflower seeds and peanuts theyre awesome treats but theyre high in fat and low in nutrition its like junk food to a bird so its difficult to get them off seeds once theyve started avoid any food containing dyes or other chemicals  thaw out a frozen vegetable mix and give him a proportioned helping once a week do not feed him any mixtures containing onions the ones we buy are a basic blend of lima beans carrots corn and green beans cooked sweet potato is good too give fruit less often     any other more specific questions
   oh one more thing the bigger the cage the better just keep in mind that the spacing between the bars isnt so great that your bird can squeeze through      okay one more thing mirror toys are not healthy nor are plastic hard toys that a bird cant realistically break the point is for them to destroy the toy to feel accomplished so id suggest buying from a bird toymaker theyre usually pretty cheap and some are super fun and creative this is a good place to start   
  unironically a pigeon also called doves many breeds are stunning theyre not the absolute smartest but they are very easy to train and are very emotive im recommending one over a parrot because parrots are far needier and easier to fuck up and the enjoyment difference between a pigeon and tiel is minimal really parrots are only for people who are for whatever reason dead set on having one
   okay jesus i keep thinking of new things theres just a lot involved with birds      so drop that motherfucking pamphlet like a rock they tell you nothing research online consult a vet and really make the commitment to be informed petcos primary objective is to sell animals and dumb products theyve convinced the public are necessary      speaking of vets make sure you know one before you buy a bird they arent too hard to come by but just keep in mind that so much can hurt your bird or make him ill its better to be safe than sorry      i know it sounds cruel but keep your birds wings clipped it is extremely unsafe and more often than not results in the untimely death of your pet if you want to take your bird outside look into harness training it seems silly i know but its a pretty good way to take your bird into new places without the risk i dont think youre looking for an aviary bird so there is no reason to not clip its wings a good clip are the first four primaries only but about halfway anything more or less is a shoddy job never clip the tail or other feathers      when pinfeathers are coming in it is very uncomfortable for your bird if he likes to be pet give him lots of scritches and be patient with him if hes more moody than usual certain weather can also make your bird uneasy      i think im done rambling for now hopefully this helps you
  not that anon but i always debate on clipping they like to fly around and only fly around my room i do worry for their safety but also want them to get exercise of flying
i had a dream that there were ducklings in my yard surrounded by a tall fence and that there were dogs trying to get at the ducklings i wonder what it means
  yo its chill if you have a system that works for you and the birds are safe i only say this because ive heard some sad stories from beginner bird owners but if anon wants to have a flighted bird there are just a few more factors to consider and for a firsttime bird owner its safer to just clip the wings
  were they mallard or pekin
rest in peace little dude i wish i could have seen you alive
  mallard i think
  mine had clipped wings at first and i am glad he did as we bonded better now he flies to me most of the time and seems pretty happy to just do laps then land on my head he is clumsy as fuck and i worry about that i dont want him to hurt himself but he also crashes into things and such he seems happy but i also dont want him to hurt himself
  i wish i could have seen you alive  what
  hes extinct nigga
  
my tiel now says bye when he knows hes going back in his cage after playtime  were trying to get him to eat fewer millet seeds but hell tip over his food bowl if the milletgood shit ratio is inadequate
ive got a pink galah around 30 years old its cage is in my room however it keeps attacking people whenever they come into my room anyone know why
  it probably hasnt been exposed to many other people has it its very protective of you maybe
  birb thinks its your mate and is defending you this behavior is really hard to reverse
  fuck
    gay
  youre going to take responsibility right anon
who else /pigeon/ here my favorite part is how they dont bite and prefer to chill
  i dont have a pet pigeon but i do have one that always returns to my balcony and begs for food
  are you the anon who had to move the cockatoo to your apartment
  it sounds like an extremely comfy option they also dont scream preferring to make soft and really relaxing cooing noises theyre easily trainable to do basically anything too
  carolina parakeets were probably poisonousamerican naturalist and painter john j audubon noted that cats apparently died from eating them and they are known to have eaten the toxic seeds of cockleburs    damn thats metal as fuck
  the solution to the cat menace was within reach
  corn farmers took them from us time to burn iowa to the ground again
  screw the tasmanian tiger bring these birds back
  how come baby birbs have that spotted pattern
    mine has learned that if she shits in a litter tray she gets the good food the one downside is that if shes in her enclosure shell gwaah quietly to be let out to shit there i think i need to start rewarding her shitting in her cage as well    other than that though this was the easiest thing ive ever taught a bird
picture is a year or two old but its still one of my favorites ive taken
  cute
  i love blue jays ive been throwing peanuts on my porch to feed them theyve started to actually approach the sliding glass door when they see me open it and are curious and sometimes come up to peak at me while im watching them eat the peanuts hoping to befriend them
  heres another one i took although it was kind of a crappy day out
   be on the wrong side of the rockies   i hope to see one of these fuckers someday
this is probably another one of my favorites
i really love the green on this guy
  looks great the outline of the bird is very crisp you might want to run it through photoshop/gimp to brighten it a bit but the focus is pretty spot on/ is it a juvenile it looks slightly neotenous    i dont post my art often but this a blue heron drawn from memory i saw one at the park a few years ago and drew what i had seen as soon as i got home
  dang thats pretty good i wish i could draw half as good as that and im not all that sure about whether its a juvenile ive honestly been meaning to learn how to properly do photoshop stuff and whatnot although sometimes i feel that theres a natural beauty to taking pictures of just them in their environments
  i feel the strangest urge to slingshot that at a green pig

anons help i got a canary from a pet store and ive noticed it standing on one leg often also it eats a lot and doesnt sing rarely whistles it doesnt look sick at all idk whats wrong its often standing on its perch just gazing around
  punch in the meantime
  my african grey talks to me when shes annoyed at night
  whats wrong with onions
  eh it just sounds like a bored bird let it out more or something
  i cant it would go crazy the minute i put my finger on his cage itll start flying around up and down
  get it some toys or something to do
  what kind of toys would it like im sitting near it often talking to it and stuff but it doesnt give a crap about me other than just staring at me
  i dont own canaries look up what kind of toys they like my parakeets like bells and shreadable things oh and the is little guitar toy with bells i dont know what canaries like though
  will do should i bring it another canary to play with
  super smooth shape  behaves well  looks soft like marshmallow  cute beak and eyes  can learn some crazy tricks and games  pigeons are totally underrated
  with that picture i was really surprised and impressed by the vivid colors on its neck plus i love the way its cheeks are puffy like that  have a duck
  i wont risk it if they dont grow up together they might start fighting when i adopted a budgie from a friend it fought with the original budgie
  well damn thanks for the help anon
  how smart are they  dunno i like smart birds they are definitely fun but sure not everybody will like dealing with random acts of destruction
  theyre smart enough learn just about anything you can teach them through repetition they arent destructive at all unless theyre gathering nesting material their beaks are too weak to seriously damage anything heavier than paper towels  they will get anxiety if you leave them alone a lot theyre social birds but leaving them for a day wont result in then plucking all their feathers out
everyone here makes me want to get a pigeon as my next bird in 10 years or so
  its a solid choice the only downside is theyll probably consider you to be their mate like basically all pet birds other than really simple ones like finches but unlike parrots they arent possessive cunts about it
    ive been keeping pets for 20 years and ive never had one kill another i had a violent dog once from a previous owner that i tried to retrain to be calm but ultimately could not trust so i had to give it back to the shelter   consider not keeping pets
  there is no destruction pigeons physically cant rip shit apart like a parrot can as long as you dont have like a collection of origami made out of rice paper or some shit youre fine
  toucan with acog
  i think my parakeet thinks i am his mate how do i fix this or discourage this
  just tell him youre not interested
what is better seeds or pellets  what else should i feed a parrot
  laughing gulls are the beach experience without them and the québécois there is no beach tip in the morning get a pizza or some fries with sauce and fill it with laxatives throw it into a crowd of gulls and welcome to shitland
  they will make a shit land even without laxitives
  yes but with laxatives its super shitland
  why would you even want a shit land
  he doesnt understand that and keeps flying to me it is cute that he is interested in the buttons i am pressing on my controller but he tends to get over excited in intense situations and attacks my fingers during them leading me to die why cant he be happy with his other parakeet friend who doesnt want to mate with me
  youre basically fucked enjoy your bird husband
  fuck how do i make him less stressed without encouraging this to go on more
  get the divorce papers in italian birds speak italian italians speak in bird)))
    they love being talked to and cuddled but they dont     scream  rip shit up  bite  go insane if you have errands to run or a steady job    theyre domesticated unlike parrots weve bred their desteuction and agression out of them old german owl pigeons are my favorites

how do i stop my grey parrot from saying nigger i havent said the word in like 7 years and yet the second he hears anything that sounds even remotely like a gun shot he starts yelling nigger or ill fuck your ass faggot which isnt very appropriate when my nephew visits and wants to play his fortcraft game on the playstation
  ignore him you cant do anything about this
  give him the ol cloacal kiss its the only way
  dont these birds live until theyre like 50
  yes and theyre incredibly autistic that bird will be yelling nigger until the end
  depends on species budgies live like 10 years african greys  50 years  best option is really just ignore it overwise it will keep saying it since they like reactions
    wait a moment you have african grey  mine used to day some offensive shit and after 1 year he doesnt say it but he still remembers the word  i just v ignored him
im surprised theres no birdwatching thread on /an/ its something i just recently thought about getting into and i came on here looking but to no avail
   theyre toxic to birds
  is it about sóy or real onions
   theres the birds youve seen in the wild type threads that pop up once in a while we just need someone to make the thread again
   real onions and garlic for that matter onions beans are okay      here are some other foods that are toxic to parrots avocado chocolate cassava tapioca fruit seeds pomegranate ok caffeine alcohol uncooked beans due to hemaglutin all mushrooms and tomato leaves      additionally dont let a bird nibble at just a random plant because it could be toxic other foods that are technically toxic such as potato chips can be given very scarcely as randomly given treats even then only small bits are okay a bird should never have too much salt fats or sugars hence why they should eat more seeds and vegetables than fruit/
  onions beans   whoops forgot about the censorship soi beans
  shit my parrot is tea addict  good thing i like it watery
and he likes apple seeds
  dude that shit has cyanide it it stop the bird just wants whatever youre eating
  except i dont eat apple seeds
  onions beans  had a good laugh what a clbuttic mistake
i had a couple of zebra finches my first birds the male stopped singing and stuck to the nest yesterday and i wanted to take him to the vet today but he died while i was at work i have no idea if i should get the female another mate or if i should send her to my relatives with the family came from i just cant think straight right now
  f  the female really should have companionship theyre very social creatures
  my zebra finches are gay is that alright for them ones a fluffy white wuss who has an anxiety attack at the slightest noise and the other one is a rapey danny devito
  yep birds are often press fucking homosexual its normal especially if theres no female
  extremely  excuse the phoneposting
tfw i saw some birds with salmonellosis at my feeders    i took the feeders down and sanitized them i feel bad because its getting colder and wildfires probably reduced natural food sources in the area but im afraid to put them back up
  never knew about this until now scary are you in ca
  yeah ive seen about one sick bird every six months or so but this time there were at least two one that died for sure it sucks that its caused almost exclusively be feeders/baths i try my best to keep mine clean so i really hope it wasnt my fault
  lol        this its a strainer
  you will
  doves are very calm and lovely birds
can any of you bird boys help me out with an id found this injured bird on the east coast of florida wildlife conservation offices and services are all closed today so i plan to keep it overnight
  kind of looks like a great white heron can you post more pics
  this is the only other one i have right now it has shortmedium webbed feet though its been using its wings to push itself around
  northern gannet      doesnt look like a heron at all idiot
  ah yes that appears to be it thanks anon i made the mistake of filtering my searches to florida native birds
why gulls are so good at shitting on people  i just walked under streetlight and felt something wet sure there were turd on my leg and sandal  previously they managed to cover entire arm  my parrot cant shit like that
what a crow doing caw cawing above a pillar on outside part of a mall
  being an autist crows are just like that
barn owls are cute cute
  tfw never been shit on by any bird not even my pet birds   feels good being a birdfriend
  you want to know how i can tell youre a subhuman race
  i dont believe you even if youd keep them in cage only they will shit at least once in you   agree it feels good to be birdfriend but but that good to be a bird loo
  i dont understand why bird owners are so discriminated   dg and ct owners need just 2 little papers which could be obtained in a week and bring abroad any toxoplasmosis or rabies  birds owners need fucking month of paperwork and in most countries a month or quarantine   i just dont get this
  t dove
  but but  but not fix
i made a bird feeder what should i put inside i mostly see tits around is there any way to dissuade jays but not other birds they keep bullying my dog and last time i hanged up some lard the niggers untied and stole the whole thing
  why would you want to discourage jays  anyway tits like salo but sunflower seeds would work  niggers  use torx screws or one way and steel cable to hang
  because theyre nigger birds that gave my dog ptsd and dont deserve free food
  ok you can buy feeders with adj spring which will close the feeder if heavy bird sits  jays weigh 60g so all heavy birds wouldnt be able to use feeder
are gulls smart  i moved to a city which is near the ocean and there are a lot of them but i never dealt with gulls before how can i befriend one will they expect you to come feed on schedule like crows would do  and what can i feed them besides obvious fish since i have allergy
  subjecting a living creature thats meant fly freely to being trapped in a cage for its whole life only to be viciously killed    youre a fucking piece of shit glad that happened to you
  he didnt say anything about keeping it entire life in cage tho
  gulls are like extra retarded sociopathic pigeons theyre not very smart or friendly but theyll eat just about anything
  so they are just 1 meter wingspan pigeons  i dont think so they dont seem to act retarded unlike pigeons that literally follow a preprogrammed routine  and id not say they are sociopaths either since they live in quite big groups  dunno problem is that we dont have much tourists thus they kinda keep 1 meter from humans
  absolutely based gull and absolutely not based linux
  shouldve installed gentoo desu
  i have done some research and it looks like that they are indeed smart enough but they are complete assholes  also i found out that cheapest food bait for them is popcorn
what does it mean when a bird grabs onto its cheek like this
  didnt this nigga die when fiona sang
  first of all they do it time to time if it does it fast and with anger  it could have some bugs or fleas
  your dog is a piece of shit
  it means that brido wants your hot man love
  ive no dog tho
is it ok give worm medicine periodically to my amazon
  do you suspect they have worms getting a fecal analysis done to know for sure isnt expensive different parasites are vulnerable to different anthelmintics so without knowing what your bird has your treatment could be ineffective
  use some common sense  do you take antiworm periodically i bet no only if you are suspecting that you have worms or if analysis says that you have worms  same applies to bird does it behave weirdly do analysis say that it has worms   anyway if you suspect  get poo analysis it is a good idea to do it annualy just like with cats and other dogs
  just scratching itself because it feels good
weak should fear the strong
fucking cockatoos
  is it a thing that crows have lookouts stationed around areas ive started following any caws i hear to the source and i notice its common for it to be a lone crow cawing constantly and not moving either that or its a raiding party going lawn to lawn plumaging or a few chilling at one of the hangout spots
i caught a sick pigeon yesterday i brought it home catched 2 flyingticks that were skirmishing on him and provided food water and shade for sleeping    yet it is worse today than it was yesterday seems weakier    it cant fly as its too weak its refusing food and water and just keeps sleeping its feathers looks like its feeling cold    its feces are lightyellow and liquid    how can i identify what disease its suffering from i want to cure it
  i like this picture a lot its great please keep taking more pictures
how can i train wild bird  i know how to train bird in captivity but i have no idea how to accomplish this outside without cage
  i tried giving it just water and also rehydration solution it drank but soon vomited something small and white seeming like bird shit came from inside its beak

  my mom took allergy shots after she found out she was allergic to cats after we had adopted two they do work or at least did for her they can be a but pricey and you need to be consistent in getting them although you can go further between shots eventually or might not need them anymore if youre lucky id look into them anon if youd like a pet
  thanks for the info i definetly have to look into shots overall i dont want to become asmathic like my mother has    mom needs shots too but shes the type of person who flat out doesnt go to the doctor even if shes feeling like shit even though we live in a country with free healthcare shes kind of eccentric

  because domestic cows are fed a specialized diet i spent 8 years on a goat farm when i was younger we fed the goats the exact same diet of hey and grains that diary cows are fed with the occasional trip off the farm to let them eat bushes and plants since they are not grazers but browsers and need some roughage to stay healthy because of their specialized diet their milk tasted exactly like the store bought cows milk so really its all about what you feed them apparently reindeer milk is the best milk for making cheese since they eat a lot of mushrooms mosses and lichens when allowed to free range

  did they deserve it what are your thoughts on the intersection of goods producers crops timber livestock etc vs wildlife
you think a lumberjack shot the sea lion
  no fishermen most likely shot the sea lions im asking what people think about the intersection of wildlife and business interests in general
take another animals resources  also just kill it  there no different then the 3rd world subhumans who slash and burn rainforest to make banana or cow farms most the food they harvest goes to waste anyways
  pretty shitty   imagine running a clean business and not being an asshole
if there arent fish farmers in the area it was as likely sportfishers as commercial fishers    obviously this is a shitty move wanton waste at minimum but when human economic and gastronomic interests intersect with nature and animals that compete for the save resources we seek to utilize there needs to be space and resources set aside for nature and our competitors but we also need to write policy in ways that encourage our natural competitors to avoid competing with us in the spaces we dont set aside for them    when it comes to intelligent carnivores like seals wolves and bears well monitored limited sport hunting has been shown to reduce humanwolf and humanbear negative interactions by a far greater factor than the actual impact on the predator population     basically im not a fan of seal poaching the lack of regulation and revenge motivation dont bode well for sustainable taking of seals but perhaps it might be a good idea to issue a scientifically monitored and sustainable number of seal hunting tags for the area to limit seal/fishermen or seal/fish farmer negative interactions
  california sealion found shot in the head  thats a good start but one isnt enough and we need to broaden the targets to people from californa  seriously fuck cali sealions they are such shit animals
  no seals are cute save the seals
whats is this catterpillar  is it poisonous  whats its final form butterfly or moth
  where do you live where did you find this
im in philippines and i have that on my malunggay tree
whos that pokemon
  it depends on its personality value
  10/10
it looks like a polychaete worm   as far as i know there are no venemous or poisenous terrestial polychaetes
  lol    its a caterpillar a hairy caterpillar    theres some video and a few pics of it on google but i didnt find a name it is venomous
its a canapillar op
eagle
  extremely poisonous kill it before it reproduces in your household im dead serious these fuckers killed one of my family members ones
this thread is dedicated to other species of humans that are now extinct     homo floresiensis stood approximately 3 feet 6 inches tall had tiny brains large teeth for their small size shruggedforward shoulders no chins receding foreheads and relatively large feet due to their short legs despite their small body and brain size h floresiensis made and used stone tools hunted small elephants and large rodents coped with predators such as giant komodo dragons and may have used fire it lived between 10000050000 years ago
neanderthal in a suit  neanderthals are our closest extinct human relative some defining features of their skulls include the large middle part of the face angled cheek bones and a huge nose for humidifying and warming cold dry air their bodies were shorter and stockier than ours another adaptation to living in cold environments but their brains were just as large as ours and often larger  proportional to their brawnier bodies    neanderthals made and used a diverse set of sophisticated tools controlled fire lived in shelters made and wore clothing were skilled hunters of large animals and also ate plant foods and occasionally made symbolic or ornamental objects there is evidence that neanderthals deliberately buried their dead and occasionally even marked their graves with offerings such as flowers no other primates and no earlier human species had ever practiced this sophisticated and symbolic behavior
i would
homo erectus he traveled across the world used tools and fire and clocked in 2 million years before fading away
  kek are there more pictures of extinct humans in suits  i like homo georgicus myself
why did it take humans 80250k years if not more to reach agricultural stage and around 8k to reach city stage then 2k to reach our current state if as anthropologists claim the brain size and capacity for conceptual and logical thinking was the same   wouldnt it have been quicker once population reached a certain size
  based erectus  managed to survive up until 50k years ago as well in certain pockets in asia hopefully in the future scientists will clone some of these extinct humans
  same savage women make my peepee hard
  because of the ice age n shiet
would you
  dems some dick sucking lips hell yeah i would
  dat 0 head tho
  tfw no neanderthal gf
  correct me if i am wrong but areas of the brain which are larger in neanderthalensis are the areas dedicated to sensory input yes their senses were supposedly much better than ours
  or bf
rudolphensis were based
  correct me if i am wrong  ok  portions of the brain arent dedicated to one particular thing in almost any case    and just because you use one part of your brain for something certainly doesnt imply other species do often enough even other people dont
      imagine  the perfect lover  able to make love with a greater sense of tactile detail and control than any sentient sense or before
  no wonder we fucked them out of existence   ywn be hsapiens f/hneanderthalis m
50000 years ago and had that much of a monkey face
  could you fuck one and make babies with it
  most likely not h floresiensis seems to have been a sister species to h habilis which means were different species separated by over a million years of evolution
  what a cool idea
  of coursh
pls post more humens
im proud that humans hunted these to extinction we won
  we didnt exist at the same time as most of them
  no bara neanderthal bf  just kill me ill be fine
  some weird ape guy 60000 years ago  yeah nah maybe like 5 million years ago
  its really just the accumulation of knowledge and technology and not much to do with intelligence   logical thinking and conceptualization is built off knowledge
  of course who wouldnt rail the shit out of beyoncé
  basic economics more humans is not a 11 linear return once you have cities for the same living standards and levels of food procurement you also have spare capacity for people just to spend time inventing and conceptualizing
  ayyy
    never liked shakira
  wow this extinct human sure looks very nonhuman no wonder hes a different species   pic related a very human looking human same species as europeans for sure    anyone else really tired of this gigantic farce that is contemporary biological anthropology
  why is bad to have monkeyish facial traits if your skills are far superior than those of a monkey its just a shallow observation even absurd provided they are our ancestors
  old ugly unhealthy and unhygienic  its time to stop posting
  post a human looking abo i dare you  inb4 you start posting famous abos with 80 white admixture
  fading away  i was just in atlanta and i swear theres a thriving population of these across the whole county
  biological anthropology    its cultural anthropology biologists do not touch this subject with a 10ft pole it can only rekt your career
  looks like a normal american to me bruh
  biologists do not touch this subject with a 10ft pole it can only rekt your career  they do anon  just because black people and aborigines arent classified as a different species doesnt mean biologists dont study them
  haha small benis
  eyyy grub meaxu sumtin rite kweek  it aint liek it wuz befour grug if u wanna leev if u wanna survyv u gotta fite dam fuckin homo sapiens mang
  abos are inbred mongrels they have denisovan admixture      yas (((they))) are when not mixed for infiltration    also    nobody posts pics of cain velasquez or nikolai valuev    what a dis/an/ppointment
   posts pics of cain velasquez or nikolai valuev  not different species just excessive amounts of human growth hormone
wood u
which hominid would be most terrifying to encounter irl for you guys for me its either h ergaster for the straight up primal uncanny valley appearance or neanderthals for their big eyes carnivorous diet and physical strength  that fucking danny vendramini neanderthal reconstruction
   fucking danny vendramini neanderthal reconstruction  dont remind me that dude came up with some of the dumbest most sensationalist shit
  my biggest critique of him is that neanderthals would not have traditional flattened ape noses but rather jew noses for controlling air temp in the nasal  do you think they had more hair than us though i think that part might make sense considering the environment of ice age europe
  interesting isnt it  apparently we know shit how most proto humans actually looked  with the neanderthal you got depictions of literal apemen or those who could pass as humans with a short forehead
   isnt it  i cant shut up about this topic and im surprised more people are not interested in it one would think that people would be more than interested in literal other species of humans but the most that people seem to retain is the archetypal caveman h erectus or neanderthal  idk man whats your favorite extinct homo
  freddie mercury
  is it animal abuse
    ya know yeah id
  uncanny valley  no fuckin way
  i hope we learn more about denisovans soon
  this is literally just shakira photoshopped
  minus the forehead she isnt that different to a slightly ugly woman
  some of them survived until quite recently on the isle of flores thus the name
    is that the one that just straight up presents them as gorillas
  yeaah i still think vendramini has some good ideas though like i said about the hariness which would help them significantly in their european environment maybe the eurasian population of n men were less hairy and more humanlike though we may never know  i like to envision them as a cross between the happy merchant meme a gorilla and a human
neanderthal here your wiimin love the bnc
so what comes after homo sapiens
    it lived between 10000050000 years ago  i remember reading that they might have only gone extinct 12000 years ago
  homo sapiens sapiens
  nothing unless we build robots    climate change will lead to our downfall via self inflicted genocide leading to nuclear war
  homo diaspora species cluster
  because civilization is a disease

  istead of past lets talk about future of human race

  looks irish
  holy shit underrated
  kek reminds me of this
i really want sebastian chabal to take a dna test
  shit she does i think i dated her sister in college
  took until 49000 bc for humans with enough intelligence to comprehend agriculture to exist aka us who originated in the eurasia landmass not the africans they call this behaviorial modernity
  just imagine those giant lips on your dick
  neanderkike meme  gtfo fag
  abos are so fucking weird they look more prehistoric than blacks but are actually younger than them by 10000 years
  neanderthals are basically feral super strong white people so they would be nightmare fuel to encounter because they would probably torture you for fun and due to their brute strength you cant do nothing
    this is retarded primates cannot occupy a purely land based niche ungulates and carnivorans already do that a land based primate that cant walk like humans or use tools is an extinct primate as we were made for living in the fucking trees
  cmon they look retarded but the skeletal features dont lie  they have the chin and raised cranium exclusive to homo sapiens  call them an offshoot species perhaps but theyre inarguably closer to us than neanderthals
  but thats already a thing were homo sapiens sapiens as opposed to homo sapiens idaltu
  i mean you can just run away iirc neanderthal hips are kinda trash for long distance running  or grab some throwing spears and meme the shit out of them since neanderthals never got past using spears for melee
  didnt a lot of abbos tribe didnt count/use star and instead they count the dark space between them i found it really intresting that they think like that
  am femanon and look like that should i be genetically/medically concerned more than i already am     tbf doc pointed out other anomalies in my skeleton structure when i was born too
  its only the inner part of you that counts not the looks   i bet you look beautiful 
  post pics
  this do anything for you
  im the book a bunch of inbreed humans did that
  you probably cannot react to a neanderthal throwing its spear due to its monster strength these fuckers could throw you 10 feet away with a single swing of their arm they are that strong and its amazing they were powerful and smart at the same time contradicting one of the rules of nature that the weak are smart and the stupid are strong though elephants and cetaceans also debunk this but i mean in the case of primates
  the old are usually weak and seen as wise that eventually degenerated into smartfrail
  homo basedpiens
  wow i never thought of it that way and i have certainly wondered about it we can be a silly species sometimes i guess    you have a high content of neanderthal dna perhaps its impossible to say and i cant recommend doing the 23andme shit    large nasal cavity with elongated brow  would most likely look like hairy people with big noses  
  i cant even tell what gender it is
  trust me if the inner part was beautiful i wouldnt be on the chan      i dont know what kind of pic to post that will depict what i mean and i dont want to selffag or some shit heres a shot at it     im pretty much femoid hell ive considered taking a karyotype to really confirm if im xx female in original pic with wide shoulders from birth excessive hair perhaps odd body structure especially my legs they looked pretty odd as i was growing up as a toddler      neanderthal huh i dont know really have no idea of my ancestry race ethnicity whatever   really dont know if its that genetic defect both or none
  oh yeah and most of all teeth/jaw severely fucked up doc said even if i got braces teeth wouldnt be 100 because apparently even my jaw is fucked and surgery is too much of a risk    sorry for blogposting
      sure youre just posting photos of people wrecked by fetal alcohol syndrome and simple carbs easy to find pic of white folks who look like that too
  just keep your mouth closed should have gotten braces face looks cute if you wanted the compliment you had it  you can still get braces
  this abo fella looks based  would go on a drinking binge with considering theyre all alcoholics  seriously whats wrong with indigenous people and alcohol
  arent sapiens neanderthal floresciensis and heldergensis all subspecies of erectus
  the biomes we inhabited allowed us to survive ok with just hunter gathering agriculture didnt happen until major changes to regional climated trapped some hunter gathering groups in diminishing food conditions forcing them to improvise    homo in the cold regions turned to large mammal hunting which generally its suicidal in terms of risk while homo in semi arid biomes of the mediterranean and middle east turned to planting seeds and eventually things turned so harsh they were forced to learn irrigation    we can safely assume all species up to erectus understood that plants come from seeds and plants need water to survive but didnt have any real use for that knowledge
  guess ill just pretend to be mute and never eat then     braces  tfw poor  tfw cant work and even if i could it wouldnt be enough   tfw too ugly to take advantage of female privilege and whore myself out or something    thanks for listening /an/  at least my kot doesnt discriminate
  i aint into old ladies but i respect those gains
  homo tfw too mutt to have a ragion to evolve in sapiens
  you probably were born premature dont worry    all depictions of neanderthals are either based on humans or on monkeys with deformed proportions
  him and this russian boxer
    the 7 foot 316 pound nikolai valuev actually lost this fight to the 63 217lb david haye
  no they are derived from erectus but could not be said to be subspecies heidelbergensis is chronospecies with erectus at one end and likely neanderthal for the nonafrican wing and sapiens for the african end on the other
  its pretty fucking hard to get into subsistence farmingto paraphrase one bushman  why would i plant shit food literally grows on trees  as far as i know it started with encouraging tasty plants to grow in certain areas then built until the people involved knew jack shit about huntergathering and were locked into farming by population pressure regardless farming sucks i worked on a farm in canada one summer and it sucks even when you have machinery to help out also its worth noting weve only had a decent method of accumulating knowledge printing pressscientific method for not long at all
  the plot of man after man centers around the idea that the majority of terrestrial life on earth goes extinct so humans begin genetically engineering themselves to fill the empty niches
  they were powerful and smart at the same time contradicting one of the rules of nature that the weak are smart and the stupid are strong    that is not a rule of nature
  jhesus chrst get braces
  its possible to hide your teeth with your lips while talking practice in front of a mirror
  underrated
so um would you
  he looks like a jew
  black people are not a separate species the time when that mightve been true has long since passed with consistent genetic admixture of caucosoid and mongoloid specimens for literally thousands of years    negrito and austroaboriginals on the other hand
  yea id fuck latoya jackson
  im not her but thank god the lord gave me a small mouth i cant smile with teeth for the love of me but whenever i talk i dont show teeth like at all they look like a piranhas and i didnt get braces as a kid so theyre misaligned and i have an underbit i was saved from chinlettery by having a really prominent chin but its receeded because of the underbite
  chronospecies   wut
  didnt haye mostly run around him iirc a lot i dont rewatch it
  neanderthals had a shoulder joint that would not have allowed an efficient throwing motion all of their killing was done cqc    also this idea that neanderthals are completely super human is wrong the complete neanderthal phenotype overlaps with the wide range of phenotypes displayed in modern humans meaning that any neanderthal you encountered were not outside the capabilities of modern humans
  man i wish the olsen twins never grew up _
    that inside body sense when chadgror take all the cavestacy back to his bunga hole and no let grug have bunga with cavestacy too    it not fair we live in a protosociety
  chronospecies is basically a word for a portion of the fossil record where we can document the morphological changes as one species evolves from another in h heidelbergensis the earliest examples we find are essentially h erectus or h antecessor with an expanded brain case but the closer we get to 400000 years ago we find specimens with more and more modern features corresponding to sapiens in africa h heidelbergensis rhodesiensis and to h neanderthalensis in europe and the near east h heidelbergensis steinheimensis h heidelbergensis coexists with homo erectus for basically this entire transition which is why the hominids that were innovating biologically are given their own species name    none of this is still set in stone theres still a 150000 year gap that hasnt been well filled starting around 400000 years ago and relations between transitional homonid fossils are disrupted by new evidence fairly frequently still
apparently its currently believes that only hybrids produced by a female human and male neanderthals were fertile i find it fascinating how it can work one way but not the other
  
  thats a popular theory for why there is no neanderthal lineage in modern mitocondrial dna but its probably not that simple because there is also no neanderthal y lineage either but we dont actually have any direct evidence    i suspect that its going to be something like only the daughters of m neanderthal f sapiens crosses being fertile and only the sons of m sapiens f neanderthal crosses being fertile
  if he was 2ft shorter and had a receding chin hed be the perfect neanderthal
  yas neanderkike mene is real
  goddamnit man its been years since i could give one of these away
  no brow ridge yuo just look like a nigger
  shorter  extinct  manlets when will they learn
  most native populations got a bit of a cheeky mass killing or 5 in the last 200 years or so which lead to lots of fucked up shit specifically in canada residential schools happened after that for some attempted cultural assimilation only really ended about 40 years prior and the last one closed in the 90s   so now you take both of those aspects more or less restrict it to a reserve that isolates the people born there let an attitude of resentment fester for a good while and voila most reses are corrupt shitholes rife with alcoholism and drugs really poor and they get worse the further north you go are some better than others yeah but ive never been to a res that id wanna live in i think its getting better but really slowly every native family has at least one grandma who had her village burnt and more were in the school system best advice that gets passed around there is to get as far away as fast as you can from the res cause itll suck you back in easily  if any friendly anon wants to chip in with anywhere else feel free to educate
  absolutely possible its all so fascinating
  sum wite piporu have rihanna alike foreheads
  yeah and they look like niggers
  i literally used to have incisors like that braces helped a ton idk if itd help you if doc says it wont though
  language
is there a law or anything    i live in los angeles
fuck off statist
alright so im going to be stranded out here in the woods for five days and ive only got a few things with me  half a sandwich  a butter knife  a dollop of peanut butter  a real knife  another pair of boots  a saw  an axe  a hammer  a bear trap  rope  newspaper  a sleeping bag  a tent  a motorcycle  a six pack of beer  a car  a cellphone  another knife  duct tape  dog  a candle  a razor  dogfood  shaving cream  a bar of soap  a cooking pot  two jugs of water  a bottle of whiskey  a lighter  firewood  another six pack of beer  a backup axe  these will be advantageous but i dont have everything id want in a perfect situation
  henlo
i never understood people who preferred this larping faggot to bear grylls show    but he carries his own camera equipment  so what lower budget i guess maybe tune into a strongman competition if you like seeing people haul shit around impressively    bear grylls slept in a hotel les whateverhisnameis authentically gets eaten by mosquitoes all night long  again who cares no one wants to watch either guy sleep in the woods or desert or whatever so you might as well focus on the cool parts like when he free climbs a sheer 100m rock face or when he improvises a raft and then tries it out
  actually watching survivorman guy get really miserable is super comfy
i liked man vs wild    its a run in with natives episode
whats that show where that barefoot fatguy that looks like a child molester goes around with some ex military guy doing lame stuff called
  dual survivor i think  i think they split up after 2 seasons or something because conflicting personalities or whatever
  that ex military guy was such a fucking retard he kept arguing with the hippie dude once about how a baobab tree full of bats was a good place to sleep
  fuck you talkin bout i cant recall him ever being that well prepared hell a few episodes he ended early because he couldnt survive the time planned
when did you realize lizards are the perfect animal
  the perfect animal   literally has the most energy inefficient gait of all animals
  about a month ago check out my lizard
  that never happened
nice pic but it bugs me that they messed up the leos face
  are they poisonous
  no brain  no soul  no personality  mammals and birbs are the only animals everything else is a flesh automaton
when i was 6
  a few weeks ago when i decided that i was gonna get a leopard gecko
  howdy pardner
  reptiles are much more intelligent than you think  
  i love lizards i got one for my 10th birthday my best friend had huge two snakes and i still like lizards way more
why you no have best cat thread /an/ do i need to follow in platys footsteps and make a daily reminder to want a cheetah
dont deny best cat /an/ons
  pajeets actually used to hunt with cheetahs according to african anons cheetahs do make good pets it really fucks me up that such an easily domesticable animal will probably go just go extinct instead
  im so fucking jealous
  cheetahs are by far the worst cat
  claws always out though
  im sorry you didnt get enough love growing up    thats fine theyre closer to dogs claws anyway
  babbys first fallacy i guess
  why would i want one tho they cuck tier predators
  cheetah claws are blunt and only partly retractile these claws arent for digging into flesh but for digging into the ground for traction at highspeed
  sshh    we cheetah now
my favorite feline
tfw no obese house cat the height of a cheetah    why god
  blepmom
  why would you choose obese cat over lean cat
  what are the pest control prospects for cheetahs they wouldnt bother birds as much as house cats do which is good but i hear they are very shitty hunters so they probably cant deal with hogs
  very shitty hunters  its not that they are shitty its that they are very specialized hunters their prey is fragile and fast so they had to become faster thus becoming mroe fragile than other cats they just dont have the mass claws or jaws to take down bigger more robust game like hogs
  so if you wanted a cheetah as a working animal pretty much the only use they would have is if you lived in africa and needed to keep the african deer things out of your garden
  no they are excellent for getting rabbit and in the states we have pronghorn antelope which is what cheetahs ancestor evolved its speed hunting i dont know the legality of hunting pronghorn with cheetah though
  hunting pronghorn with a cheetah  pic related may be more legal than you think
  cougars are no longer legal in ohio because of that one guy setting some animals free
i dont want the fastbois to die
    i thought that they are very good hunter but very shitty at protecting their meal from other predator
  cheetahs do horrible in captivity because people still dont know how to properly care fo them    all cheetash in captivity either die from or die with some level of gastritis and/or kidney disfunction incidence in the wild is almost 0
  good thread my friend
huh where are all the people saying cheetahs and mountain lions cant be kept as exotic animals because they are wild i thought literally all cats that are not at least 75 genetically domestic housecats raised and socialized from kittens to be around humans were completely unsafe and could not be tamed to prevent them from just mauling people they arent closely accustomed to
getting bullied out of your hard fought kill by a fucking vulture
  well dont invite them ya dingus    its more that the other big animals saw the vultures landing and would come to steal the easy meal
fun fact males work and live in groups females live and hunt alone    also cheetahs are the biggest beta bitches in the savanna
  males can work in groups
  open  thats pretty cute  brief thought of i want to kiss it enters mind  oh no  oh no
  caaaaaaan you feel the looooooove tonight
/an/ hates pitbulls  loves cheetahs and advocates domestication efforts   fuck em both i say
  hey fuck you man
  i dont hate pitbulls ive actually never seen one in real life and cheetahs are going extinct so we should conserve them
  is it true that domesticated cheetahs act like dogs
  wait what theyre going extinct  fuck  the elephants   who are these niggerfaggots ruining my childhood picture book animals
  but cheetahs look cute tho
  look at that comfy slut in the warm sun just asking for belly pats
the best cheetah interaction videos on youtube  have to listen to a retard slowly narrate his experience of it    
  i am so fucking jealous right now    just once just once in my life time i want to play and snuggle with a cheetah like in that picture    even if it decides to bite or attack it would be so worth it to me
  he needs to stop dying his hair
theyre total losers and autistic    but thats mainly why theyre so lovable
  wrong image thats actually a snow leopard ah fuck it
cheetas taking very well to taming and living with humans they were kept as hunting animals for thousands of years in egypt the middle east and persia  you can find wall paintings in egyptian tombs showing them with collars riding around in chariots used to hunt gazelle
  you will never ever be an italian banking magnate and ride around with a cheetah on the back of your horse
  keep cheetahs in captivity is torture they all die w/ medical problems because we cant adequately feed them
  the asian cheetah was hunted to extinction in the 19th century they hunted them they didnt hunt with them  it was egyptian middle eastern and perisan royalty that hunted with them in the same way people use dogs as coursers
  youre by far your parents worst offspring
  i could reasonably beat back a cheeta in an emergency a red nose niggerpit or similar ghetto mutt no i dont advocate pets that could kill me deadly snakefags can fuck off too
aww cute kittis am a real cat fan and if i could i would get a cheetah as long they get along with my 3cats
is zoology a meme degree
  yes
  /thread
  heavy competition  shit pay  get worked like a slave  
  taking microbiology classes to rake monkey shit at the zoo   thats a yikes for me
  gender studies degree way better desu
just study biology
  degrees are a meme theyre literally the acquisition of knowledge through an imitative process
  yes thats called learning faggot  you think we would have the current level of development if everyone had to discover everything by themselves over and over again
  and thats what a meme is
  yes    with a zoology degree you can work in the lab at a mine or a water treatment plant or industrial factory those are about the best paid jobs youre going to find but even then they just want you for your lab skills so you could just as well take biology    to actually do zoology you need at least a masters for boring field work and a phd if you want to do actual research on your own someday when your professor finally dies    even then your pay grade as a professor or a researcher is going to top out about where youd start as a lab tech in heavy industry and thats after 20 years making shit stipends as a research assistant doctoral student and finally post doc doing the grunt work for your professor who gets to take credit quite literally for everything you do    if you have a burning passion to expand human knowledge about dust mites or appalachian salamanders or central american bats then by all means do it the pay doesnt matter if youre doing what you sincerely love but otherwise its not a great degree for much of anything else because its too specialized to get you most jobs in science and not specialized enough to get you any serious job in zoology
either /an/ is getting faster or im getting slower butim going to post a platypus in this thread every day until all of an wants to snuggle a puggle    this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
    youre as gay as that winston faggot
  rood
  youre starting to get to me platyposter i kind of want to snuggle a puggle
  good    this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
  cant these things kill you
  no there is no record of a platypus ever killing a human they can cause significant discomfort if you mishandle a male
  daily reminder there have been zero recorded deaths from anybody just wanting a platypus
  you make an excellent point add not ever having died because of to the almost innumerous list of reasons    this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
how do i acquire a puggle that i would snuggle would you recommend taking care of one
  take a normal platypus and be better to it    also this is your everyday reminder to want a platypus
  i legitimately dont know what that is i feel like i want to keep it that way but i dont want to assume or be judgmental     this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
man now i want to snuggle a puggle
the worst thing about australia is how fucking strict they are with their animals i just want to see australian animals without having to go to australia
  those digits confirm wanting to puggle snuggle is correct    this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
  i looked it up and the google said that it is very illegal to get a platypus does google not want me to snuggle a puggle how do i get around this
  i missed you puggle anon where did you go
  /an/ is getting faster because of all these pitbull hate threads    this board is slowly turning into /pol/ but about animals
  there is a place you can legally snuggle with one you have to go to queensland australia to do it though the healsvill sanctuary has an exhibition that lets you swim with a hand raised female platypus       this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
  at this point i might have to start a posting two reminders a day
  reminder that platypus are australian and males are venomous not exactly cuddle material
  see
thank you platypus poster  i now wish to snuggle a puggle
  kys
  healsville sanctuary is in victoria
  good good then it is all worth it    this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
reminder platypus venom cannot kill human but it will hurtalot
  but it can also lead to treatment for diabeetus    
  that is the place to be for puggle cuddling yes    this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
they really are cool animals how well do they do as pets
  theyd probably need a big aquarium or an indoor pool and theyd also probably need to eat mostly fish and crustaceans
  you cant its illegal
  only in australia they are not an endangered species and i have a plan to get one legaly although not necessarily sanely
  they would make terrible pets
  cute
  wanting orb spiders anywhere but australia  i will kill myself if those things break quarantine and blame you in the suicide note
  yes yes they are    they would need a platypusary actually     this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
  do all creatures in australia have to be deadly and violent even there fucking herbivores arnt ones to mess with
  they have quokkas but those live on a tiny sub island with no predators platypuses managed to be as cute as they are and survive millions of years in the outback    this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
male platypus have venomous spines protruding from their hind legs would not be a good day if u got stabbed
  gonna derail the platy subs for a second with some pixel art i made of a quokka
  cute
  see
  yes very cute well done however i will now get this thread back on track with a hand drawn baby platypus and its corresponding meltibeed platypus counterpart    this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
  but some of us might get platypuses in the deal wont you think of the cuddles    this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
  okay okay i want one now
what if this threads purpose is to actually make platypuses go extinct by abuse from humans
  it was established in earlier threads that platypus anon is actually a platypus with a computer who is trying to trick his way into having a pet human
  good good thats why i did it     this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
  patently false think about it there are more tigers in texas than there are in the wild granted there are more than a few shitty tiger owners but nobody going to get a platypus out of some misplaced sense of machismo how are we going to ensure their survival if there isnt a robust breeding and conservation program even if most us can never have one if we want one bad enough we will contribute to their conservation as the next best thing    this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
  okay puggle anon how do i keep a platypus in my home if its illegal i already have a 1500 gallon pond and live in driving distance to wild crawfish and a bait shop with feeder minnows now how do i house the cute platy if its illegal i cant break the law
  you just wait for australia to realize that the best way to conserve animals is to establish breeding populations in different places what if theres a platypus disease like the fungus that kills frogs and suddenly all the platypuses in australia die what will we do then
  tasmania has a platypus killing fungus and they still dont allow them to have their populations diversified through zoo breeding programs i think if san diego can get one it will be a watershed moment in their conservation     this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
  to my knowledge female platypuses are not actually illegal to own or transport outside of australia that being said getting them responsibly is going to be the hard part if a few could be gotten for responsible medical research into their milk and venom they would then need dedicated caretakers that is about the only legal reasonable way i can think of right now    this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
okay platyanon what sort of name should i give a snuggle puggle
  if i get a boy i will name him gulliver for a female im thinking madeline or paddleina
still no update on when san diego zoo might be getting its platypuses but they are still actively working on conservation efforts and building their relations with australian zoos in hopes of getting some       this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
interesting population study of platypuses just for a change of pace      this is your daily reminder to want a platypus

can you please help me   ok so imagine the platypus had no bill what would the closest animal be to its body   i think otters but i not sure
  can i put one of these in a 5 gallon
  they would not fit and they would climb out harry burrells made what is probably still the smallest livable platypusary in pic related and even it was only for temporary display and transport    this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
  no it is illegal to have a platypus as a pet and you would not be able to provide the conditions it needs it would die very quickly as platypuses are highly sensitive to ecological changes platypuses are native australian animals and therefore protected by law they are not permitted to be kept as pets in australia or any other country   why do you tantalize me so
  but anon platypuses are frequently rescued by ordinary people and depending on where they are some even get to nurse them back to health themselves so at least for a little while regular people do get to have platypuses right now  
  crud forgot the thing    this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
  i think baby platypus are ducking adorable and i want one but considering that im pretty sure the males have a toxic claw on their back feet i think id pass
  you could always want a female platypus for platonic cuddles    this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
  then why would the australian platypus conservatory put out a pdf on how to safely catch one      this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
i guess i would snuggle a puggle but im curious about how their fur feels like
  their fur is extremely soft and velveteen it is said to be of an extraordinarily soft and fine texture it is denser than that of a polar bear and almost all otters      this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
how do puggles behave when around humans are they docile uncaring affectionate will a puggle struggle if you try to snuggle do they bite do they fight will they sting over any slight
  they are very energetic animals they can be very affectionate if hand raised the males can be territorial and tend to like to play tug of war with things they do bite but they dont have teeth and their bills are actually of a texture like fine soft leather they try and climb more than most people would think think slightly awkward goofy toothless otters the males can sting but if they are handled correctly can be held safely normally they are held on a towel or a pillow              this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
    this is your daily reminder to want a platypus

    youre going to make people own them and fuck up their habitats/population look what finding nemo did to clown fish
  how would a pet platypus interact with a pet deer
  implying people who dont live in australia let alone australians themselves will ever get to look at australian wildlife
  post hyenas instead please
i want to snuggle a puggle
  implying no one would ever do something hard and illegal for money
  well they have to contend with australians so yeah
  they would not fit and they would climb out harry burrells made what is probably still the smallest livable platypusary in pic related and even it was only for temporary display and transport  platypusary  platypusary    hehehe
    hes/shes encouraging tourism to australia and frankly that would be one of the coolest places to vacation think of all the animals to see and all the hot/crazy women /men to meet
  good    that is what a plce to keep platyuses is called       clearly cool but not monotremes im sure a hyena thread would be cool but it detracts from platypus wanting so no good luck in your hyena wanting     this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
  its hard enough to smuggle little tropical frogs now try smuggling a two and a half foot long venomous mammal
  you will never be able to see or even work with a platypus at your local zoos  fuck you australia you greedy bastards let other countries have platypuses
  sam diego is still trying to get two on loan but some australians are being cunts about it and trying to block the deal    this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
  thank god they dont have a market for them in chinese medicine i suppose     this is your daily reminder to want a platypus
we should release them into american river system i think theyd do well in the south or northeast rivers here its not fair australia are such cunts and hog all the platypuses to themselves
    while i love the idea of have platypuses in country they would not likely survive our local predators they are vulnerable to things like wild dogs and especially animals like coyotes sadly that just means when we finally do get australia to share we will have to keep them in nice safe platypusary    this is your daily reminder to want a platypus

good
i feel bad every time i squash one of these fuckers i miss once and they run at 30 mph down my floor fearing for their lives i understand that theyre just trying to live but the infestation in my apartment complex has gotten out of hand i just flushed one of them down the sink after i found it in the bathroom taking a swig of water anyone else
    i try to avoid killing most invertebrates that i come across though i make an exception for roaches and kill them on spot however i do respect how tough and versatile the little bastards are theyll be around long after humans so i look at killing them as improving the roach species as a whole dont feel to bad anon
  grab em with tweezers and burn em with a lighter roaches are surprisingly tough and they wont fully burn to ash unlike wasps which really deserve to be ripped apart limbbylimb but thats too much work for me
  i kill all turks on site  we had an infestation of them in our dfac and i hate these fucks so much
    whats the best way to deal with an infestation of these does diatomaceous earth work on them
  buy lezards
  rip beetles
  they dont live here so i dont have to although i do kill pests like them when i see them in my house because they spread filth and disease

can you post a pic that we can actually see sounds like a eucaplyptus tree but there are a shitton of trees that fit that description

i sort of want to get some fish but i am a poor neet not quite sure how much fish eat so a approximation about how much the cost of food of food for one month would be nice
  feeding flakes is basically pennies per month fish food is really cheap almost a nonfactor in aquarium expenses unless you buy autastic fish that require specialized diets
  its more the water/electricity  i bought one container of fish food more than 6 months ago and theres more than half of it left   it was the cheapest food   i have one betta   three loaches that i feed worms and chicken and some algae eaters that get a little bit of peeled cucumber every few days     i strongly recommend getting a bigger than 5 gallon tank/clear plastic tub and grow some pothos out of the top of the water too   paradise fish are highly rewarding and can handle not having a heater bettas need consistently hot temperatures if your basement stays warm enough for you to be comfortable and naked without any cold times even at night then youre set for a betta if it gets cold even a little bit then you will kill it from stress and disease     age your water 24 hrs and do weekly water changes get plants before you get fish gravel is more work than fish are      a basic cheapo setup would be     clear plastic tote bigger than 3 gallons/aquarium  lights use a regular led screw in bulb and a desk lamp  random good looking outside stick rinse thoroughly and expect it to turn water brown for a month or so but most fish love it  water plants fromaquarium store big expense  or pothos cutting from grandmas house  air pump optional if you have water plants and airbreathing fish like bettas/ paradise gouramis    cycle the tank by pissing into it one week before you add fish   or waiting till the pothos cutting grows roots   then change half the water out for clean aged tap water    this is a step that helps reduce stress on the fish and gets the plants ready for the tank     when you get your fish put it in a cup and with a serving spoon or turkey baster switch out its store water for your tank water when its fully been switched over add the fish and feed it every twothree days  change one gallon per week with aged tap water

can a cherry shrimp climb out of an aquarium my cherry shrimp disappear sometimes
  theyre probably dying mate
so i bought a cheap sand siphon on amazon theoretically how much tank water could one ingest before they should start to worry
  yes
i think aquariums are going to be really in this coming year it seems like something everyone had in the early 00s
is there a reason my floating plants like to congregate to one section of the tank i got 5 different species and they all stay on the left side even if i move them to the right there is no current or surface agitation so i dont get it
  even if you dont see flow theres always a tiny amount
  how doing walstad method with nothing but fish and plants i am confusion
  thats why you educate people on dos and donts if they care enough then theyll listen if not theyll get bored of you and the hobby real fast and leave so everyones happy
  fish move the water wind/ac on the waters surface also plants stick towards the tank walls because of surface tension
  are you some kind of retard of course the water moves
  i have a 37 gal betta  shrimp tank planted nothing fancy petco plants no co2 flourish supplement drops added during water change    lately when i do water changes 1015 weekly i notice a lot of tiny white wiggly things moving around in the water upon googling i have determined that theyre detritus worms there seem to be more and more of them every week should i be concerned i dont see them except when i disturb the gravel during water change
  not much of a concern so long as your betta eats them to keep population down
cold water natives guy here im frustrated with the slow growth of my regenerating lily pad and have started dosing ferts to try and speed it up the three pads it has produced have 8 inches to go before they reach the surface i may even buy a heater my water temps are steady in the 50s my fish are getting spooked by the light over their tank so id like significant plant cover before i switch them to this brighter tank    im pretty bummed that im going to have to nuke my coepod culture i have such a lovely variety of detritivores in there and theres no way to save even a fraction of the leaf litter they call home if im to have any chance of making a clean break from the hydra and theres over 60 of them in the 10 gallon culture right now
  i got those worms from a plant i bought on ebay my dwarf rainbows occasionally slurp them up theyve been eating them for weeks so i doubt its harming them
  buy a chinese burning laser and go to town on them
me after buying the african cucklids ive been trying purchase for months from the lfs but always too scared to ask the employee for
  and then the same people who quit the hobby will be reminded why they did so after their fish only live 4 days
im a beginner on a budget where do i go to get things such as wood and plants for cheap
  outside
   this plant came from the river pretty awesome eh if you have a river i suggest it over the lfs as long as you properly quarantine them/remove parasites some stuff simply wont grow in tropical conditions so keep that in mind
  i never understood the point of keeping these faggots they are virtually nonmoving and will kill literally everything in the same tank as them at least electric eels dont use electricity 24/7 and tolerate small tetras
  is that an elephant seal didnt know you could keep them in aquariums
  check local ponds lakes streams rivers and the beach if you have those nearby for both rocks and wood like the anon said you can also find plants in a few of these locations but they wont be the best plants i would suggest checking local hobbyist groups on faceberg and check your local craigslist if you are lucky enough to have an aquarium society where you live consider going to one of their meetings most of them have an auction where you can get everything needed in the hobby tanks equipment livestock plants decor etc very cheaply
  nearby rivers and ponds you will get some wildlife with it if you dont bleach it check second hand sitesoften people give away tank with fish and everything with it for cheap or free cuz they didnt know how much work it would be
  yfw no one cares about that dead server aquarium community is even far superior
    then why are you posting about it you seem to have a hardon for ancord
i like bosemani rainbowfish
  lilly pads are heavy feeders even in ponds they can suck piles of cow shit dry you probably want fertilizer tabs
  gottem    tank is also getting a half tsp or so of cheapass pellet food a day there is about 2 inches of black dirt that its rooted in too i will consider upping the nitrogen input until the fish are added maybe some dog food
how to deal with this hairy green bullshit
  the only who seems to care is you
  manual removal and fucking cleaning out your water you gross asshole
  fuck you nigger my bugs will survive
how does one maintain a fishy highway
  how do
  it is a cherry shrimp tank that ive ignored for a few months havent wanted to do anything aquariumrelated things im going change the water but i need to wait on some salty shrimp i guess im not really sure
  african butterfly fish ftw  i gotta supplement with crickets and wormies and shit which i have to cultivate  you know youre serious when you have to set up another aquarium/terrarium to cultivate the food for another pet
    pissing in the fish tank    why not just go cheaper on the food and nut in the tank on the daily basis to watch the fish eat your sperm
one of my fishs eyes looks like twice the size kind of popping out of her head what do she seems to be swimming fine and eating normally
sup /aq/ thinking of keeping sea urchins snails crabs clams mussels and possibly abalones basically all the shit sea otters eat would even be interested in breeding my own livestock especially since all those animals also tend to be delicious   would sea urchins eat alfalfa pellets also apparently blue crabs can survive in freshwater how feasible would it be to breed a couple blue crabs in a saltwater tank and stock a freshwater pond with their spawn
would a 20g be fine for a single peacock cichlid
when was the last time your fish won a best in show    
  same problem here how do i deal with this i think its cladophora algae i removed the moss balls already but this shit regrows from any small spot
also what is this a mosura crown
another spotted one i need to get rid of them
how long does it take guppy fry to develop enough pigment to get an idea of the patterning they will have as adults i have some fry that are almost a month old that are a cross between a tequila sunrise female and blue tuxedo male currently they are pretty colorless besides some small dark blue areas
  aw fuck if it is i do have three small moss balls in there i would inspect under a microscope but i dont have one at home i have to send my samples to work with my girlfriend for her to inspect i think the next day she works is saturday so i will prepare two slides one with a sample from a moss ball and one with a sample of the green hairy bullshit and we will find out
  from my experience it takes several months the only thing you can do to help speed this up is feed food multiple times per day to keep them growing quickly and feed them colorenhancing food
  thank you i have been feeding twice a day with some regular flakes and omega one color flakes and occasional frozen blood worms its good to know they will probably be more colorful should be fun to watch
  i cant explain it otherwise for my issue i only have slight spot algae which is normal in every aquarium nutrients are well balanced as i use ro water    your algae appear to be somewhat slimy
  why would you want only one hes going to be awfully lonely in there
  adult blue crabs can live in freshwater but theyll never breed you can breed them in stock tanks and pools and sea urchins are scavanegers theyll eat everything
  so i upped my nitrogen input and overnight the lily didnt gain any height but did start a third pad thats probably twice the diameter of the other two    hopefully it puts some height on swiftly    i started spending 10 minutes a day picking at them with my forceps now im down from 100 visible to under 5 i know ill never extirpitate them this way but you can already see the coepod culture rebounding im hoping to breed the umbra limi by christmas and will need this culture for grow out
4got pic
what are some good fish that can coexist with clown killis also should i get more then just a male and female pair or will they be fine as a pair
  as long as it cant eat the killi it should be fine some reccomendations are cories small loaches small cichlids like apistos and peaceful mid and top dwellers like the smaller gouramis    try to get another female or two so the male isnt putting too much stress on a single female
  yeah it will in fishrooms its common to keep extra males in 10 gallons
  people still do guppy shows what is this 1988
  no its not slimy its rough
  i wish it was
  most of those animals exist in the tropical marine trade but breeding them is very difficult because of their relatively unknown spawning habits and complex larval stages it wouldnt be worth breeding them for food but keeping them as pets is fairly easy depending on the species
  guppies are really big in asia particularly places like thailand and indonesia for some reason probably cause they can just keep them in buckets with no filtration and one plant and just dump half the water out twice a week
  i researched it its most likely cladophora beside of picking off the pieces you can only use chemicals
  cute fish
  theyll never breed   perfect   alfalfa pellets wont kill sea urchins though    it wouldnt be worth breeding them for food  yeah dont sea urchins take like six years to mature and produce roe i would think its a very fun challenge for the legitimate biology enthusiast though
i dont know how i did it but that my friends is a tiny tiny ghost shrimp
  guppies are really big in asia  how big im looking for some 1215 inch guppies
  go back in time and rescue titicaca orestias before they were eaten to exintiction    but seriously there are some jumbo guppies being bred but theyre only a half inch larger if you really wanted to you could probably selectively breed guppies to be an inch or two larger over the course of a few decades
  pull it out by hand then remove ten percent of the water and replace it with dechlorinated water
  less than that if you are fierce in your culls
can i raise a congo tetra or a tiny pleco or maybe a panda corydoras in a fish bowl
  not a lot of people know this but arapaima are excellent bowl fish
be tiny freshwater fish  swim all the way across the ocean from south america to the caribbean islands  are guppies underrated
    thanks but im looking for small fish redbelly piranhas are really large maybe by piranhas you meant the underrated herbivorous piranhas like the myleus rubripinnis but afaik those are prone to diseases
    oh sorry you meant arapaimas dude you cant rise those in a bowl theyre like 267 meters in length how would you fit them in a bowl
full grown ghost shrimp on the right  how the fuck did this happen   am i god
  on the left
  more likely youve got a palemontes sp instead of a proper ghost shrimp    often called glass or grass shrimp palemontes shrimp are true freshwater shrimp and will successfully breed in home aquaria unlike ghost shrimp which have salt dependent naupuli
  what if i breed them to have colours like neos
  that sounds awesome but difficult    the shrimp you are talking about are the same genus too just a different species
  could be possible but would take a long time neos are a bit different cause the wild form was brown with red and blue and yellow specks which people purposely bred for glass shrimp are just clear maybe you can breed them to be more black or even green cause thats the only other color that is on them
so i had a small school of 5 glowlight tetras and they didnt do much theyd just sit in the middle of the tank and hang out together not moving much    however recently two of them passed in succession id had them all for several years and now one of them has become very aggressive i think its a female and she has begun to bully every other fish in my tank chasing them away from her constantly anyone know what could cause this abrupt behavior change they were all very chill before
how often does aquatic arts do 40 off fish sales im tempted to get some gobies now since i dont have a lot of expendable cash but id be better prepared for them in a couple months
will java moss anchor itself around a branch over time or does it have to be tied down to look like this
hey /aq/ please give me some ideas for a floating plant that could replace hornwort in a 3 gal shrimp tank    hornwort is a disgusting plant and i want to get rid of it but the tank looks like shit without it since the upper third is completely empty and the shrimp have less cover as well
  frogbit and elodea
  does elodea shed like hornwort does  i wanted to get frogwort but im not sure if my shitty lfs has any
  frogbit sorry
  it doesnt and frogbit can be bought off of ebay
  nothing sheds as bad as hornwort which is unfortunate since it looks so nice  cabomba and water spangle are some other alternatives
are panda corys too big for a 10 gallon
  yes since theyre schooling fish and over an inch each youd need at least a 20 gal high try pygmy cories or otos instead
  i have some canadian variety elodea can confirm it does not shed at all
  ludwigia repens sheds pretty bad if you have the variety of hornwort from washington with the thick green knuckly whorls then it doesnt really shed at all but i have heard the needle like variety is pretty bad
just got this betta from petco today tomorrow ill be putting it in a new 5 gallon tank that ive been preparing for a week do you think hell marble in the future
what happened to aqadvisor is there other site i can use for the same purpose
  is the umbee the true thanos cichlid
redid my 5 gallon hopefully this gravel will be easier to clean
  you have horrifically bad taste
  you have a horrifically bad outlook on the world
  probably not and you should try and let the tank cycle all the way first otherwise youre going to have to do like 3 water changes a week for the next month so you dont hurt that pretty boy
i traded a 32 tv for a 24 so that i would have room for this in my tiny ass bedroom its a 55 14 x 85 x 14 i went to the old ebay and bought some micranthemum monte carlo cardamine lyrata and a dwarf anubias nana preattached to some driftwood i was really hoping to use the cardamine as a background plant while i have the anubias in the center with the monte carlo surrounding it im using root tabs and i also have co2 booster and liquid fertilizers if needed    does this sound alright
  look i took some elodea from a disgusting pond and even though i cleaned and cleaned it some more i almost feel dirty having it in my aquarium its such an invasive species that ducks can walk on the thick mats it forms thats unappealing to me though i will say that once new growth formed it started to look prettier and i like the way mine branched off also no it wont shed depending on your type and where you live i suggest buying it online where youll get a bunch conveniently wrapped in a lead weight because anchoring them directly in the soil is a pain in the ass
  lead weight  i hope its not real lead
  tie it down and it will eventually anchor itself use black string the string should break down by the time the moss attaches
  thats just the name people use for them they are actually aquarium safe if you buy stem plants at all then you would know this      you have tie it down to something first ive stuck pieces in the graven and eventually they stuck to pebbles fairly well     this one i tied down with fishing string and at first it looked awful but now it looks pretty damn good and i like how its flared out if you do it right and give it time to establish then it will look like your picture and not just an ugly ball of yellow moss
rate my betta
fuck im exhausted    aquarium soil was on sale at my lfs for black friday so i finally bit the bullet and got rid of my shitty sand and rescaped my tank i like how it turned out but im waiting a few days for the dust to settle and plants to establish before taking a picture    the worst part about redoing substrate is scooping out the old one with a plastic cup and hauling trash bags of wet sand to the dumpster fuck my back is killing me
  how big    cute
  thats why for my second tank i decided on a 5 gallon i hate doing that    anyone else think this is a really pretty lilly
what recommendations do you guys have for sand thinking of changing out my medium rocks for sand my cories might feel more at home that way
  play sand no joke
  i use pool filter sand in mine
    how do these look in aquariums
  let me see if i can find a picture of the pool filter sand that i posted before
    hopefully not too hard to sell these are under one of those color enhancing bulbs because that was all i had at the time
  that actually doesnt look bad using real sand would just create a bunch of mud is the outcome different with this also nice snail collection
  here is some in a bucket when i was washing it  one problem about looking at pics of sand like this is that two areas arent likely going to have the same exact sand i bought two bags at the same pool store about 2 weeks apart and got two different types same grade but the two were from two different companies and were slightly different in color   i think this stuff in the bucket was the first sand i bought and the stuff in the previous pic was the second bag  i did try some play sand but it was very fine
  its not sand from like a river bed it is sand in the sense that it is that small but from what i could tell from the bag it is just crushed quartz it gets cleaned mostly before being sold because it is used in pool filters play sand is also very clean the play sand ive seen for sale around here comes from the coast so it really depends on where you are located
    75 gallons so it took like 5 hours from start to finish 60 lbs of substrate is like double that when its soaking wet wonder if anyone figured out an easier way to get rid of old substrate    thankfully my other tanks are only 5 gallons
hey guys wanna kinda give my aquarium a makeover and a restart but how do i keep the shrimp single fish i got alive meanwhile i empty the tank of water
  its simple you dont do the restart you can make over the aquascape all you want as long as you keep some water some established gravel and/or the old used filter cartridge if applicable if youre doing more than that such as a gravel change its easier to have a secondary established tank temporarily for them to be in while the main one recycles
  if you want black sand buy black blasting sand from tractor supply for my tanks i use a mix of 18 black blasting sand to play sand from home depot makes it look a bit more natural
  change one thing per week    if you want new gravel leave the decorations in the tank without cleaning or drying them and scoop out the gravel and add new the bacteria will then colonize the gravel in a week or two then you can remove the decorations    if you have a good filter in the tank where the bacteria has had a chance to colonize in then this will be your main source of them and you keep that the most stable throughout dont clean it basically and once you have redone the tank give it a good squeeze over the gravel or sand     it will make the water a little dirty for a few days but at least you wont be sending your whole tank through another cycle
  this doesnt feel right
  just embrace it anon
i picked up a female platy the other day and she quickly gave birth to a single fry its been around for about a week now and seems fine my question is if theres only one will it survive in a planted tank with 6 adults and how long will it take to grow large enough to not be eaten / swim out in the open
  sponge filter didnt come in the mail  never ordering something from hong kong again  i need like several spongefilters do people sell them irl
  any aquarium store that isnt a big box store should have them
  petco/smart both have them where im located if you live somewhere more rural id doubt theyd have it
when you guys do water changes is there any reason to not just leave the pump intake at the top of the water column when youre drawing water out of the aquarium cleaning the substrate isnt important to me because i keep shrimp and id rather keep the pump high up so i dont accidentally suck up any shrimplets
  no my fish are too big but if i had shrimp or fry id slip a piece of pantyhose onto the tube
  i havent done any water changes since the summer probably june or july feels bad man
does anybody have experience derimming tanks i want to take the top trim off an empty 20g long i have laying around but im not sure if the bottom rim would offer enough support without a brace on top
  never seen them in a big box store but all of my lfs sell them if youre in the us im pretty sure aquarium coop sells them if you cant find a lfs with them
  ive always heard rimmed tanks arent built to the same spec as rimless so its generally not a good long term idea dont think it would be too bad to add a clear acrylic piece across at the center just to be sure your tank wont spontaneously explode outwards
i havent fed my snails  in like two weeks at least last night i tossed them a handful of organic spinach and baby greens like i normally would but today the water is extremely cloudy what gives the only thing different i didnt do was wash the leaves off under cold water this is probably unnecessary because they are organic but i cant think of any reason for the sudden cloudiness maybe because they got food to they produced more waste and that is where the bloom is from
how big of a co2 tank should i get for a 60 gallon tank
  just a standard 5lb tank will do you could go 10lb or bigger if you have somewhere you could chain it to for safety reasons expect to fill it up about every two months if you use it daily
  you dont need to order them from china i order mine on ebay and they come from california you can get a 5 back for like 20 bucks
i set up a new aquarium and im using a new filter  i squeezed some muddy water from my old sponge into the new tank to skip the cycling is waiting one week safe enough to start adding fish
  test the water  have you been feeding the bacteria  you can probably start adding fish a little at a time staring with the most hardy but it doesnt really sound like you know what youre doing
  i know what im doing usually i just add a used filter from another tank to skip cycling now i dont have a leftover so i just straight up threw the bacteria in there
just dropped a dozen or so camellia leaves into my 25gallon wanted it to look a bit more natural just cleaned and boiled them and placed them in not sure if this is a terrible decision or what have white cloud minnows
  i think you meant that for 
so opinions from betta owners    ive had a female betta for a few months now and she is a complete scaredy cat    everytime i change anything in the tank she gets stress bars and paces one side of the tank for a few days like if i do a water change she does it ive also moved her to two different tanks no tank mates cause she gets scared and she will pace with stress bars for a good two weeks after the move    i was watching some youtubers who have large betta sorities over ten bettas and the bettas seemed to act like birds inthat they would all graze together and pick at stuff on the ground looking for food they seemed very calm doimg this    so my question is would it maybe help my current betta if she werein a bigger group would she maybe feel safer     i have plants and decorations for her to hide in and the lighting isnt bright
  could just be her personality ive had a few like that who do nothing but hide all the time others have been more social showing ugly faces and hanging out i think you literally just got a beta betta
  that makes me sad because once she calms down shes very active and exploring her territory i was hoping that maybe having other fish around might make her feel safe but i think it would have to be other bettas because she got terrified of tiny little neon tetras
  any one know what it is i found it in a nearby tub might ad some more
  anyone    i am considering giving the fish up all the aforementioned one does is chase everyone around all day it cant be healthy for her
  for a few days  thats way too long my male betta gets over it in 10 mins max
  how big is your tank sororities can turn into deathmatches if its not big enough or has enough bettas within it a 50 gallon with at least 5 of them is recommended if you try this    i have a female betta who was terrified of the community tank i put her in and hid for a week but eventually got used to the other fish and now likes to swim around near them a lot your betta is probably feeling unsure because of the tank/home changes a community tank of other species might be better for her than other bettas
  thats some kind of water sowbug  it eats detrius in the substrate
  i started her in a 2 gallon then after about two months i got a ten gallon and mover her in let her settle and tried introducing neon tetras 6 she wouldnt calm down even after two weeks so i moved her into a 5 gallon of her own    she calmed downed after about a week and a half of being in there but every time i do a gravel vac or change the water no matter how careful i am not to scare jer she paces for a few days after with stress bars    i was thinking aboit getting a mr aqua 12 gallon long and the petshop owner will let me return bettas so i was thinking of trying out like 6 to start return the agressive ones and replace the number as i go until i get very calm bettas
  thats not enough space for 6 bettas even people with larger tanks who said their sororities were fine for months have given updates showing that one of the bettas suddenly became highly aggressive and killed the rest    this is something i researched for a long while because a large tank of bettas sounded awesome to me but i decided against it i would research a lot more before doing this unless you dont particularly care about the potential of losing them all
  sororities were fine for months have given updates showing that one of the bettas suddenly became highly aggressive and killed the rest      i will research but ive this similar line said about a lot of different tanks and species i dont think there is ever a 100 chance of things working out fine but i think steps can be taken to minimize things    if i do decide to try this i will make sure there is enough places for the fish to hide in or behind and i will watch closely for any signs of aggression
  like i said it doesnt matter if you dont particularly care about potential loss of the whole tank minus one    realize the one may snap during the night or when youre away as well and be unable to stop it
  thats true
    so theres something of a pattern that im finding interesting in that these pwople who have larger groups of bettas seem to be having more success like 10 bettas    im curious if that makes it more difficult for the bettas to form a strict hierarchy    im also curious to see if anyone has been trying to breed bettas for more calm temperments instead of just colors     and on the other hand i wonder if it might be easier to keep a guppy tank since they seem to have beautiful coloration as well but dont seem to fight so much    i have to go to work but damn if i dont want to stay home and research this stuff more
  im usually not this guy but  reddit spacing
  greetings newfag    reddit spacing is a myth it may or may not be used on reddit i dont know but we were spacing our posts out on 4chan long before reddit was invented    youd have to think were really stupid not to notice the spacing or accomplish it by accident     of course this isnt the case the spacing is intentional and only redditfags would think it has anything to do with their stupid site
  inserting a newline after each sentence doesnt make your posts easier to read newlines are necessary sometimes but not after each period
  inserting a newline after each sentence doesnt make your posts easier to read  neither i nor the other poster did that
  the post i initially replied to is structured like this    1 sentence improper use of period making it look like 2 sentences    1 sentence    1 sentence    1 sentence    1 sentence    i think that it looks fucking retarded and would be easier to read if it were written as a single paragraph but instead people like you seem to think every point in their post is so utterly profound that they need a newline after each period its okay if you think otherwise though im absolutely fine pretending that this embarrassing incident for you never occurred
  you fucking idiot thats a guppy     either you are fucking around or you got fucked in the head by tyrone and you lost all cognitive features
   thats a betta definitely
  im just pretending to be retarded  this is you
  ah so it doesnt count because his second sentence doesnt meet your high grammatical standards   lol
  you could add some more females just make sure do like 3 or 4 at once any less will result in bullying but if you have enough they will establish a sort of pecking order and you might see you current betta come out of her shell but then again she could just end up being scared again its really hard to say
when i got this filter i managed to lose the piece thats circled it hasnt been a problem until now since i added some little albino cories i tried wrapping it in netting to keep them from getting sucked up but now its getting blocked up by the gunky stuff and stops the filter flow completely    does anyone have any suggestions to rig it up and keep the little guys safe    or should i just get a new filter
  stop putting them in your ass faggot
  you could get a small piece of pvc and cap it then use a small saw to cut slits in it slip this over the end of the tube and you should be ok otherwise you could try a really coarse sponge but it will still get clogged
  it sounds more like that one fish is a male and now the other male died so hes got all the females to himself and chases them around get some more if you can thats always the first thing to do when you see behaviour lika that
  prolong the end with a tube cut a lot of holes in the tube and put a sponge over it
  anon where are you ship them to me i think theyre gorgeous
  bro you do know that organic means they was it less than the regular stuff you threw dirt in your tank
  nice its a lill shy i see it move around once a day then it hides imma find it some friends since its alone right now but since ive put him in a tank i saw a lill pond snail and some white tiny creatures that spas out to swim around i dont have any idea of how they got there besides hitchhiked along when they where smol
  bro you do know that organic means they was it less than the regular stuff
  less clean
  organic produce is fertilized with feces and treated with diatoms nicotine and pemethrine containing plant extracts to kill pests generally its less clean than nonorganic grown produce you didnt say that what you bought specified that it was prewashed    however right now the cdc has advised that all romaine should be thrown out because literally thousands of people are sick from it and they didnt except prewashed or organic only an idiot trusts that kind of labeling
  well upping the food input has caused a big bacteria bloom that caused my sponge in my pump pipe to clog and get sucked down into the pipe did an 80 water charge and picked out as much decomposing food and organic matter as possible im thinking im going to fill the standpipe with ceramic disk media so that a clogged sponge cant get sucked down
  a waterlouse   they are like shrimp but more effective at cleaning if you like the way they look and none of your fish can eat them you should add a bunch to your tank they can be found in any body of water
  depends entirely on where you live and what laws and regulations there is there
sup /aq/ how do i capture wild fish and marine invertebrates for the aquarium at my office
whats the cheap animalcruelty way of breeding ghost shrimp just curious
  force them to have sex by hiring a pistol shrimp and pointing it at your ghost shrimp then forbid the babies to die
  kek they say 10 per gallon so i guess i theory you could breed them in really small containers not that im going to
  heater 10 gallon tank java moss desk lamp boom shrimp factory altogether thats about 40 bucks and youll see your 40 back after 2 months
  thats at least 100 in leafland so like 75 muricabux
  why does the male constantly herd the female around
how important is it for fish to have a steady light cycle of something like 8 on 16 off
hi everyone havent posted in a while but my neons have been healthy and since my last post a few months ago i have added 3 guppies julii corys and 2 apistogrammas
  you probably imported some eggs without noticing theyre tiny and every rock and plant in ponds is covered in them  the tiny creatures are probably daphnia one of the most important organisms for a healthy pond
  cool can you give us some updates about it    sup i know petcuck petco has this to capture them in a tank   small animals only though this is the biggest and cheapest i can find its 52 so small animals only i guess you can collect small big ass fish while theyre juveniles i mean
  dont bother with diy shit my cory almost got sucked up into a diy filter tube i made if i didnt save him when i did he might be died right now he still might be recovering just spend the 20 dollars on a filter bro
  this can be helpful for fish that require hiding dont get rid of it
  im not in a hurry to meet any quotas buddy     nigger im a landlocked midwestfag how do i keep the fish i caught on my vacation alive
plant is micranthemum which will carpet the entire aquarium sooner or later i also have some cardamine lyrata for the background and some driftwood with petite anubias nana attached which i hoped to use as a center piece i think thats all im going to do with this aquarium
  get a load of this guy he doesnt have a python
  my cory got stuck between a filter once it was a pain in the feels to get him out i had to leverage style him out with a net corys are just stupid when it comes to hiding
  you literally cannot also its more than likely illegal in the process you should just purchase saltwater fish from a good lfs or live aquaria i live in nyc and because of expensive rent i have to order my fish from online     spoiler however i heard during the spring a warm front causes tropical fish to be pushed upnorth to long island from the equator so i might just have to take a drive up there next year get flexed on landlocked cuck /spoiler
aquaclears are the masterfilter
can i give my betta a chill pill like a nonlethal dose of clove oil or something fucker will not stop pacing    plenty of plants gentle sponge filter lighting is dim hes the only one in the tank and the water parameters are fine
  micranthemum which will carpet the entire aquarium  gravel    wew
  literally just a sponge filter with a motor air powered sponge filters are the true rulers of filterdom  safe with all fish and any aquaria application including raising fry  doesnt need unplugged during water changes  can put tank directly up against wall  makes the same noise regardless of water level  buy a decent air pump and its silent  can run multiple sponge filters off a single air pump  no moving parts  lasts decades  cheaper than alternatives  if you need chemical media you just suck at fishkeeping
what do yall use for heaters the amazon reviews on all of them are fucking horrifying im about to just set the heat to 72 in my house and hope for the best this winter
  i use sponge filters on utilitarian tanks like for quarantine and breeding but you sure as shit cant make that shit look good    also  cant inject co2 while running air
  i use hagen marina ive only had one problem with a single 200w heater out of 5 or so and amazon sent me a replacement without any problems i didnt even have to send the broken heater back to them  mfw contacted hagen and got a 2nd heater for free from the broken one
  i bought a tidal 75 from seachem for my 55g because it was on sale pretty comfy    i have a sponge filter lying around but the air pump i used with it was louder than i liked so that didnt last long
   a decent air pump and its silent  my air pump is nearly silent but all 4 of my air sponge filters gurgle fairly loudly
  i used to have six and it would take me forever to count them p sure theyre just good at hiding
redid my 5gal and put rook in it sieved 25lbs of play sand to get the same size grain for the substrate moved the main décor and added some windelov   in his old 25gal is a female halfmoon plan to breed them in the future       you can cover sponge filters pretty easily
  im not sure about keeping a female in an old tank that housed a male i know next to nothing about breeding bettas but i do know that the male produces a hormone and this hormone goes in the water and causes the female to become eggladen i dont know if the male makes this hormone all the time or only in the presence of a female but i would be worried that you would cause the female to become eggladen by accident
  huh didnt know that only just started reading about the possibility of breeding em ill do another water change but other than that its a bit late now
i have a few buckets of gravel with water and mts in it that are taking up space i want to drain the buckets dry the gravel and pack them away but i dont want to kill the snails what do you guys advise
  does the cucumber trick work on mts
  im not sure i was checking out the sera snail trap and i know you can bait it with whatever but it seems that people use algae tabs for mts i havent tried to bait them before though so i cant say 100 that cucumber doesnt work but when i did use it usually my omnivore fish would devour it before the snails had a chance to get to it
  anon is this a new behavior change for your betta    kek
  no hes almost always like this    also why do you have a name its an anonymous site
do you think these additions will be okay pearl gourami wont eat the shrimp because its a coward tank is infront of a window so algae growth is insane but water is crystal clear so im worried about the shrimp and otos health
  mixing ghost shrimp with cherry shrimp  but why  i wouldnt trust danios with shrimp either
  i got it a friend but i havent seen them both at the same timemaybe never saw the first one again after i put the second in they hide most of the time so its a bit sad theyre not realy active i saw a bladder snail the other day that probaly came along with the daphnea and pond snail
recommendations
  drop the tetra6 is barely enough and neons get boring fast drop the plecos get 12 corys and fine sand at 103
  depends on the food  do you have copepods     also a bunch plant or some moss would help
  i disagree with  drop the pleco instead
  get a bigger tank
  drop the pleco and get 4 otos instead  they will school with the cories because they are mimics
  try at night
anyone giving their little ones extreme 3minutes salt baths theyre healthy for little fish
  only if its sick why would you do that youre stressing it out    if you just want the health benefits put a little salt in the aquarium
    new water and some changes to the tank eventually i want to upgrade her to a 5gal but itll be a minute before that happens
  i give mine extreme 10 year salt baths  they like it
whats the deal with weather loaches being so diverse mine looks nothing like any of the varieties ive seen online and its behavior is completely contrary to what most sites claim doesnt touch snails doesnt burrow himself doesnt care about hiding and is very active both day and night its hardy and ive had it for around ten years at this point but shows no sign of mellowing out
what happened to aqadvisor
  what do you mean
  site doesnt seem to work/load for me
  odd works just fine on my end try using a proxy/vpn or restarting your system/router
      well subtract the pleco he passed away today my friends and i found him on a riverbank while camping a few weeks ago heres my updated tank info
  how much salt should it be exactly
  you can safely put 76 grams of noniodized salt per gallon into a freshwater aquarium
  thanke you
can i put the pennywort in my back yard in my aquarium and expect it to live ive been paying close attention to it and for days now its been thriving submerged in rainwater
  not sure on that specific plant but a lot of plants can endure adverse conditions temporarily but cannot thrive in the midlong run they can be fine for weeks but then just die
  in the worst outcome it will rot and culturally enrich your aquarium in necessary microelements
  there are fully aquatic species like hydrocotyle tripartia and similar creepers like cardamine lyrata ill probably go with something like that
why are mollys such fucking dickheads
    we have a new non reddit affiliated /an/ discord hoping to start things new and fresh
  fuck off with advertising competing platforms mr anontalk
    salty /an/cord fag detected
  we already have /an/cord fuck off we dont need a tenth shitcord shitting the threads up
    but /an/cord is run by circle jerking redditors its time to let it die
  but my discord is the right discord  kys egofag
    its a discord free of suo and frutchs faggotry it also currently has the best collective knowledge base of /aq/ and /herp/ you can join both and decide for yourself 
  the state of reddit chatcords pathetic that egos make you shill on here stay in your circlejerks you faggots
ok guys very important lesson i learned today    do not put any small fish with ghost shrimp even neon tetra they will catch it and they will fucking eat it alive
  this is why you stick with based amanos
  would a 2 cm 4/5 in assassin snail be a threat to a 5 cm 2 in mystery snail
  how is this server any better than /an/cord
  try harder mystical you anime villain cuck lord
best way to lower my ph by 02
    because its an actual free /an/ server where you can say and do what you want no cuckoldry with the mods
  aktchually there are dozens of species sold as ghost shrimp and many are peaceful detrivores you will definitely want to avoid macrobrachium and sometimes mississippi grass shrimp will attack fish
  everything discord is reddit bye
  fuck dscord if you fucking discord brainlets cant figure out that we dont want you advertising your shitty chat client and insist that people who hate you are hosting competing rooms its a miracle that you dont have to manually breath    fuck unofficial official dscords fuck your dscord fuck the whole platform its a data harvesting zoomer trap that brings nothing but drama and is just as cancerous as anontalk reddit and every other namefag space that touts itself as cutting edge but creates a user base driven to shill their shitty chat room in anonymous spaces might as well link your facebook you attention sucking queer    fuck off and die
  i once saw some big ass ghost shrimp like 4 inches long at this one obscure petstore their arms were really large and skinny only thing that sucks is that they cant breed in freshwater
    its ok us discordfags dont want your nasty piss yellow sponge filtered tank ass posting there anyway
plants for goldfish
  quit pissing in your tank you salty /an/cord fag
  its just one other server being butthurt about being banned i dont see the problem why do we need a new server
have never seen my banjo cat eat  still alive after almost two months  its a community tank which gets fed a varied diet and i have no idea what it goes for what a dork
    nice same fag loser go post about your 5 gallon neon tetra betta tank that definitely stands out from all the other tanks ever posted here
  same with mine when i kept them i read they dont even process fear like other fish which is why you can just pick them up
  /an/cord isnt even leddit affiliated do you even have fish
      ya i got fish
  better than your no tank memeposting attention whore

  nice pic of someone elses fish
    ooooook anon
  move to a new area with a natural tap or well that is 2 by default
    seahorses are so fucking cool heard theyre boring as shit though
    they are kinda but in my tank they require virtually no special care because they find so much stuff to eat
  go back to 4chn
      once my corals grow in im gonna post my tank

  oh ah heh    do you have a religion pray to your god while you can
  those are the most venomous spider in the world one bite can kill 10 strong men  luckily their mouths are too small to bite you    t moms everywhere
watch out anon it looks radioactive
  i libe in el salvador and found this friend near a waterfall they look similar
just recently adopted a dog and shes comin around quite nicely the only problem we have is that she refuses to piss or shit outside and only does it once she is home what can i do to prevent this anything helps
  just wait for her to go and eventually she will she cant hold it in forever
  girlfriend once stayed with her outside for 13 hours the moment our dog came back inside she peed twice in the span of 30 min    what doesnt help is that we live at the 3rd floor of an appartment so when we start to notice her signs of wanting to do it its either too late or we just spook her from wanting to do it
  scold her when she does it inside and praise her when she does it outside the whole only positive reinforcement is bullshit dogs understand when your mad and if you catch them doing the bad thing they understand its that is what made you mad when ever she does it outside link it to a word like potty buisness bathroom etc say it over and over during your praise that way she will learn that word means piss  shit when i tell my dog to do her business she will squeeze anything she has out even if its a couple drops its nice for when the weather is shitty or if your running late you can go out and be done fast
  to add to this set an alarm for every hour or so when you are home to take her out when she is home alone keep her in a crate until she is housebroken clean all places she has peed with a steam cleaner and / or an enzyme cleaner for dog pee
  when i tell my dog to do her business she will squeeze anything she has out even if its a couple drops   so like pavlovs bell interesting we will be sure to try this out once she starts doing it outside for now it seems like we cant be too afraid to scold her a little if she does it inside  thanks for the advice mate
if i water a fruiting plant with water mixed with caffeine powder will the fruits the plant bears have a caffeine content    does what you water a plant with affect the composition of the fruit at all
answer me fuckers
you have to pee in the soil else the plant cant absorb the extra caffeine
google search told me that certain plants are ok with diluted coffee mix but did not mention any fruit fruit may be too sensitive to the ph of coffee i dont think it would change much if anything
  not coffee a regular water solution with pure caffeine dissolved into it just small amounts    i just dont know how well the tree/plant filters the water before sending it to the fruit
  only one way to find out nigger
what the absolute fuck   i thought it was some asshole throwing a dog out of a plane but then it was just 5inches height and snow

  have fun post updates
you got a bigger tank faggot
  just ask them how much they want for the fish   i hope you liberate it onto your cast iron pan i would personally dry rub  smoke it ive heard pacu ribs are excellent
its clearly not stunted and this angle shows you that theres significantly more tank length wise    its honestly probably fine aside from the fact that they like plant cover
  not your personal army
chances are if you steal theyll just get another one
be me  live in the netherlandsmp3  go everywhere on youre stolen bike  leave it unlocked  bike gets stolen  get mad that youre stolen bike got stolen

tfw my pets love me more than my human family does    anyone else know this feel
saying that its a bad thing i specially love the part where they specifically ignore my family members and show preference for me
follow their example op love exists embrace it
they are pure beings thats why  love u op
  the moment youre independent enough to do so leave them leave them op and never look back dont waste your time and effort trying to get your familys approval its never going to be enough
  no because i know what love is and i understand that encouraged dependency is a very different thing but nobody loves me right now and its a sad place to be and i suspect thats what youre really getting at
  autism    you have a pokemon pic i know by experience
  no im not that worthless
no you love your pets more than you perceive your family to love you and mistake that as the pets loving you back i wish furfags would go and stay go
  letting what other people feel about you define your sense of worth  i have bad news anon
  thats a whole lot of projection
  everyone does that anon  even op is doing that    living things need other living things approval
  bollocks
  bullocks
  bullcocks
  feels good man
  kicking people while theyre down is this way  
    no this is pretty much the place for it emofag
  yes my pets love me more than my family does and i have no pets
im thinking of getting new plants for the holidays and im looking for interesting plants or lichens i could grow  pic related my year old mimosa pudica
ill post more of what i have too
just got from my bio teacher yesterday
  air plant not that into seems pretty boring to me  in the first pic the red container with the lights had some asian dancing plant seeds that never germinated im also gonna try to get a mother of thousands and trachyandra tortilis
papyrus plants are not common but they do quite well indoors
  im sorry but what is the point of that thing theres no point in supporting a stem that long thats never going to get to light    you are literally torturing that thing
  yea ik i dont want to cut it shorter till i get a grow light and i know it will get enough light i was planing on triming it plus its like pea plants they need support
  it had more leaves all along it but they came off after my sister bent the stem so im supporting it till it heals up till ik it will survive and then ill trim it
  plant them outside and compare them to what youve got lonnngg and shitty my dude  do like that im not the only one using cookie trays for homegrow though
i have an asparagus plant in my bedroom its in the bathroom in the picture for lighting though i think the foliage is nice mines pretty unruly just because i like it like that it does well with a watering every 34 days and a misting as well     ive been contemplating getting one of those how do they do in general its awfully pretty    thats pretty cool i never would have though of papyrus
  yeah i never thought about it either until i saw some smaller species of papyrus in planters at an office
 i dunno just got the moon cactus like a week ago seems like its doing ok its two different cacti grafted to each other so id imagine it can be pretty dificult to start and have to watch out for infections and fungus
op here i just thought to mention what kinda defines interesting so like the mimmosa its a plant that closes its leaves when theyre touched the asian dancing plant moves on its own and corresponding to music trachyandra tortilis  is like tendril without leaves that kinda spirals in on itself and a mother of thousands is a plant that basically buds off full plants on its leaves that drop off and root on their own so what im looking for i guess are plants that are different in some way unique and have different machanics than others
sansevierias are really weird and grow well indoors everyone just grows the same two variants but theres tons of weird ones
    do you have examples
  asian dancing plant moves on its own and corresponding to music  what  it moves corresponding to the day/night cycle temperature swings i think  just like calathea marantha and related genera
  gilligans faust    doesnt look like much but you get a big purple bannana shaped root at the end of it
  heard it does i dont buy too heavily into it but if its a thing its due to the vibrations and it moves on its own also called a telegraph plant it has like small leaflets that rotate or flap with a cycle about every 5 min
  thats actually my gfs favorite shade of blue i might grow those for her thanks dood
your mimosa which is a literal weed looks like its on the verge of death and so does the sundew that peat looks bone dry you have shadeloving species of lichen in a pot with a cactus and is that a salt crystal is there even a hole in that pot    as for interesting plants you could try bulbophyllum barbigerum it has a hinged lip that moves eerily in the smallest breeze just dont fucking kill it      moon cacti have a life expectancy of max two years the top is a desert cactus with no chlorophyl and the rootstock is a jungle one good luck
catasetums are another thing to consider they cum on their pollinators
  just bought the cactus ik the sundew is too but nope its wet peat and the mimosa is growing some new leaf buds
  naw its not salt its some kinda fucked up glue from the person who i bought it from it id love to get more tips on growing shit so i dont kill my plants im in a shitty appartment with fucked light and the window i have them at is the only one that doesnt have a draft that blows like a fuggin fan im getting a grow light to try and help them
  just dont fucking kill it    fat chance you saw the picture right    its like he read care sheets and did the opposite
im growing 6 avacado trees grown from pits theyre actually quite hardy
didnt think that it was too tall and was gonna trim it till the stem snapped and i wanted to give it time to heal before i stressed it out more its a year old and has flowered multiple times i understand and totaly respect you guys scolding me for being shit with plants ill show you the rest i have and you guys should tell me how i can do better
here just repotted made sure to use 2/3 sand and water it ever 2 and a half weeks
the branch got broken my sister yea my sister she lives an hour from home and never visits so when i went home this weekend i decided to bring them to my apartment so i was just barely hanging on washed the bits of branches and washed them with distilled water and planted them so thats why theyre at weird angles the whole bottom pot isnt filled just the sides so the middle one doesnt move so much
same thing with this alloe the outer old leaves look like thy might be dehydrated but the new inner ones look plumper ill take a close up i probably have the soil fucked up they came from a bigger dead one and these were the only living bits that im trying to salvage
  camera sucks
  yea i didnt put everything in the pot just bought it from a guy whole thing
got this ball python recently and woke up this morning to him being kinda in a striking pose and this liquid with chunks was under his hide hole can anyone help identify what it may be
  thats pee
  the chunks are urates basically snake pee usually there isnt that much liquid too but it isnt anything to worry about
  wtf do snakes pee my gecko never pees
theres this really cute parrot that hangs around my apartment balcony and i dont know how to communicate with it  what sounds should i make so it comes near me and talks with me what do they like to hear    i cant offer any food to it because i will get stuck and fall
  if its wild its not going to want anything to do with you
  damn society  rules n shiet
  where do you live  are parrots native in your area
leave it speciesappropriate food in a safe place    thats how to start communicating with a wild burd
  mumbai  yeah but illegal to keep as pet in houses
  okay but like where do i leave it  its floats in front of me on electric wires  i cant throw the seeds/bread at it
  just introduce yourself and ask if it wants to go out for a coffee some time you coward
  you think i didnt think of that smarty pants  i googled and it turns out birds are highly lactose intolerant i would look like an asshole in front of him    stop trying to sabotage me
  he drinks millers milked coffee    you can leave some food on balcony birds have extremely good vision so they will notice it put some food and leave the balcony
  millers  fuck why gboard comes with this shit
  fairly long series of tongue clicks  short melodic whistles  talking normally  drumming for a couple of seconds with your finger against a hard surface
  thank you anon  finally i can be one with the birds now    at last i have become the birdman2014 directed by alejandro gonzález iñárritu
grab iit by the neck choke it gently yet firmly press its neck on the ground spread its legs and fo elbow deep in its cloaca
  sorry i dont speak retard
i live in mumbai too  wanna meetup never seen a curry nigger around these parts desu
  how old are you
be  live in a hostel in a third world country   sunday  its chicken curry time  hostel owner says not to feed chicken to the dogs since they get inside and make mess  everyone secretly slides chicken on floor to the dogs  mfw faith on humanity restored
cool blog
    im happy for you anon  eats dog
for real though id be pretty pissed if someone fed my dog curry because shes old and shits herself whenever she eats something unfamiliar
  lmao youre poor
how come there arent a ton of insects in the ocean i know theres those bugs that skitter on the surface
  because crustaceans and mollusks have dominated the oceans long before insects were a thing
  i know that i was wondering how to better word my post around that i mean reptiles and mammals in the past were able to return to the ocean from the land and find a niche
  insects are badly suited for open waters and all adults need to breathe air diving beetles and such would probably drown if there were some waves going on or they get picked off by fish every time they need to swim to the surface aquatic freshwater insects generally prefer ponds with a lot of vegetation or the larvae of some insects live among stones in rivers    there are simply almost no niches for insects where they could compete against other marine invertebrates
there actually are saltwater insects but they live around the coast and in bays and marshes where theres tons of vegetation
  insects are part of pancrustacea so really bugs are land crustaceans
  thats not how it works anon   mammals and fish are both vertebrates so fish are aquatic mammals
  there are in the bottom as you see all the shit in the ocean is eated by little unseen niggas and the rest is eaten by hardened niggas cuz particles fall and shit
  i recall there are actually some theories about that one being  and also something regarding their lipid layer of their exosqueleton  still there are some species of insects but in shallower waters if i dont remember wrong but they are as scarce as crustaceans are on land relatively speaking    those are crustaceans tho isopods amphipods and decapods
  mammals are osteichthyes hexapods are pancrustacea and traditional crustacea are divided among the basal taxa of pancrustacea
what is this big fella and how do i make him happy
give him a large piece of driftwood to hide under and some algae wafers
  looks like a pleco pretty chill fish i like them you can get them algae discs to eat
zucchini and blanched spinach is good
are dogs omnivores or carnivores
  carnivores
omnivore  carnivora is not the same is carnivore
i dont know but those are quite long
theyre omnivores
carnivores some may accidentally ingest plant material but that doesnt really count  vice versa to a cow accidentally eating a fly whilst grazing
  its not about what goes down their gullet its about what theyre capable of digesting and they can all digest vegetable matter
  no its about what they eat if you dont feed them and thatll be meat
  no
  am i wrong a stray dog will eat rats and stuff wont they
  omnivore    they evolved genes for salivary amilase that arent found in wolves but are found in omnivores such as black bears and pigs    they evolved this ability to digest starches because theyve been eating plant foods give them by humans for tens of thousands of years so theyve transitioned from wolves that are essentially carnivores to dogs which eat most human foods
  and stuff  like garbage scraps  dog arent wolves theyve evolved over time to digest and thrive on plant starches
  hasnt seen how cows and deer eat birds for calcium intake
  bpitt
  yeah but assuming no garbage scraps theyre not gonna start eating plants theyre carnivores
   theyre not gonna start eating plants  yes they will they will eat anything theyre omnivores
  thats why feral dogs dont generally exist in the wilderness its just a city thing    most dogs cant hunt and kill prey so they just starve to death
  but they wont eat plants by choice dogs eat a little grass sometimes but thats just them messing around   if they were hungry theyd kill something and eat it obligate carnivores
  stop using words you dont understand
  but am i wrong
  yes dogs are not obligate carnivores cats are
  but theyre carnivores tho
  theyve evolved over time to digest and thrive on plant starches      found the vegany
can a dog survive and be in good health by eating only vegetals    a human can and since the same is also true of humans eating only meat humans are omnivore but what about dogs we know they can survive on meat only but what about plants only
  can a dog survive and be in good health by eating only vegetals    no there have been a few cases of militant vegans trying it on yt and blogging it failed every time    a human can    no    and since the same is also true of humans eating only meat humans are omnivore     humans are omnivores but try going back in time 20ka and look for food that isnt animal in the european landscape there is literally nothing with a kcaldensity that would keep you alive if you arent a ruminant that can make use of the cellulose youre fucked
  human actually can but vegans are pretty weak compared to normal
  no they can not
  define they can  i know veg faggots and they are quite old
    hahahaha youre so delusional that completely breaks your credibility i was gonna believe you about dogs but seeing how utterly wrong and stupid you are about humans i must withhold my judgement
  they gotta take supplements or will be sick  yumans cant get all they need from plants and its not possible to survive as a vegan without farming man made crops
  not true vegans can eat any plant and survive
  they will starve to death   you cant survive off picking berries my man
  the problem is that there arent even many berries to begin with and the store bought domesticated shit all looked very different 20ka ago
  okay wtf does wegan mean
  yes exactly even in something like a rainforest with many wild fruits we are not built like monkeys to br able to climb forage that shit and only a very low percentage are even digestible to us the vast majority like 90 of wild fruits and berries will poison you its not possible to sustain ourselves on plants without farming a hunter can easily live off of wild game and get what he needs from muscle and organ meat     eating only plants
  this for example is the closest thing to an apple youd find on the european continent 20ka ago
  rosehips are good to eat and very available for foraging but yes you cant possibly sustain yourself on them youll need hundreds and hundreds every day i have a handbook of available plant food in the north european wilderness and its not much i think rosehip is the only fruit listed as a possible food source
  so they are basically a symbiotic/parasitic species now
  humans are omnivores but try going back in time 20ka and look for food that isnt animal in the european landscape  you clearly have no idea how hard we min maxed hunter gathering
  you clearly have no idea how hard we min maxed hunter gathering    i have no idea what this means in any case if you disagree with me you have clearly no idea what grew in the eu back then      they are good because they can be found from fall to spring and provide a quick vitamin boost whenever you do find them but actively looking for them would be a waste and would burn more kcal that it brings in
share cool pictures of owls cool stories about owls cool facts about owls etc
can anyone identify this owl for me    it is awfully cute
majestic almost supernatural appearing like something that would appear then take you to another dimension
  looks like an eagle owl
why are owls so puffy   why do they need so many feathers
    to mask the sound they make when they hunt pray i think
  the facial disc also directs sound to their sensitive earopenings
  i dissected owl pellets before found rat bones including a whole skull
bump with an owl
lookit dem eyez
    so cute  
  eurasian eagle owl i work with them
i once worked in animal control and met this guy
i know this thread is old but an owl started living on our roof we were leaving it be but one of the young ones got out got trapped in our porch and now i guess its too bright for it to figure out what to do because its morning should we leave it or what theres no animal control in our area and im worried that the wild cat in our area might try to eat it
  i never understood why occult persons identify owls with moloch i get they are nocturnal predators but they are just are just animals going about their business plus they are adorable     i guess its just like with goats and their association with baphomet shubniggurath etc they are cute critters but just because   muh horns are evil  the stereotype stuck    uggh im getting off into /x/ territory lets see cool facts i guess the fact that in french owls with ear feathers and those without are given different names hibou for the former chouette for the latter chouette also means cool
  lol
  if its a large owl id also be worried about the cat too lol
  i think i have never seen an owl in wild ehh
  i think the main reason owls were seen as bad omens is because people in the middle ages thought their faces were creepy    im pretty stumped about the moloch thing though hes usually associated with bulls
hey /an/ went to and owl sanctuary yesterday it was full owls eagles even some chickens ducks and quail or whatever among them was this owl which im told by the owner was used in a lot of famous film stuff that its the one from the start of the first harry potter the chronicles of narnia n stuff honestly cant tell if the owner is serious or just goofing hes a very well trained owl and let me pet him n stuff     i forget his name but heres a pic of him moments before shitting all over my arm   
can you have owls as pets or are they just out door boys
  may not be this thread but i have shitloads of great horned and barn owls that live around my house ill try and get some pictures with a combination of my pocket floodlight and my camera theyre difficult to capture and i usually dont bother sometimes they just perch on my deck theyre fucking huge
i farted on an owl once    love hyena
  youd have better luck with some basic ir goggles to find them at night less chance of spooking them off too
  they dont spook easily where i live i have a gigantic tree out in one of the pastures where they just hang out i simply never bother to take pictures all the trees on my property are very very old and very tall     its cold as shit at night but i might go out there and try go out there sometimes and get a look at them ive got this strange militarygrade floodlight that fits in my pocket from a friend and they dont fly off when its pointed at them
  same and it greatly saddens me
  thats an awfully handsome owl
  what do you do for work
the last 2/3 times ive walked up a large hill to smoke ive seen an owl the first time he sat in the tree next to me and made me tweak out
  fair enough moloch usually is associated with bulls but in other instances the phrase moloch the owl is used this is because he is supposed to be a being that preys on your ignorance while being in the dark without knowledge by the time you figure out what what moloch truly represents it is too late and he snatches you up in the manner of an owl snatching a mouse
  i was taught as a museum docent that owls have binocular vision because they are arboreal animals and other raptors have monocular vision because they hunt in open spaces is that bullshit the girl that told me that was really triggered about the idea that prey animals have monocular vision and predators have binocular vision too
  is that bullshit  yes   if you can clearly see both eyes of an animal from the front it has binocular vision
  cows and lions both have binocular vision lions just have a wider span of it

i am become death
  an old ass holstein steer   being kept with cattle that are a few months old and arent even the same breed   i cant tell if this is their lead steer or if australia is so fucking boring that they have to pretend they have big cows to be on the news
  boss has underlings
  its aesthetic
  it also was in our local news in germany
  u n i t
  metal steer
  this and iirc the heifers are half jersey which is one of the smallest cattle breed out there
looks like a single space marine hanging out with imperial guards
  featuring the skull parasite unit
  that thing is a foot and a half taller and half a ton heavier than any previous holstein its not his fault hes the biggest and the strongest he doesnt even have to exercise
shhhh    everyone be quiet my cat is sleeping
  caw caw caw caw
  ahhh what did you do you stupid fucking bird
  i just wanted to feed you
  oh thanks bro im hungry as shit
  good thread
  bark bark bark bark
fuck this bitch
dont mind if i do
cute
awesome dogger would pet 10/10
why would someone breed an animal to be this violent
why would anyone breed an animal to be this ugly
  asked your mum the same thing
  can gonfirm
    vicious      basically for sport          samefag detected  66
perro de pelea cordobés was even worse
i love dogs in general but i shoot pitbills who arent accompanied by a human
  why would someone endlessly post pitbull threads on /an/ when noone cares 
  low iq angls needed dumb violent shitbeasts for blood sport    now nogs spics and white trash get them because theyre tough and can be trained to fuck up another person and white middle class childless liberals get them to virtue signal that theyre good people for raising a misunderstood breed
  neo /an/ anthromorphizes a panting dog by thinking its smiling like a human    youre as dumb as the average pithag
    omg a random person accusing me of being another random person i better take a screenshot to show him oh wait i dont give a fuck
    i never once thought the dog was smiling are you retarded or dont know what memes are    i posted it because its a pitbull thats clearly not being aggressive get off your computer chair for once neet and maybe you wouldnt be so negative still wouldnt find a gf with your looks though
  literally bred to fight other dogs
  12 children hospitalized  breed of peace strikes again
im so fucking sick of pitbull threads                                
  cringe imagine being so easily offended by someone online
    day was saved by tard wrangler using his professional skills to subdue dog
  lmao i poisoned a pitbull that looked just like the one on the right in your pic
  humans have been dumb retarded low iq niggers
  coincidence i think not are pibbles just the downy kids of dogs
  they are not violent they are lower on the violent scale then chihuahuas and dawson maybe instead of listening to the bullshit news you could do some research or go spend time with one you should always see something for yourself instead of be spoon fed someone elses opinion
  not true
  spend time with one  ignore statistics that look at tens to hundreds of thousands of cases  hmmmmm
  based samefag
  i dont know ask god hes the retard who made humans
  niggers
  money breeding them for selling the pups or some underground dog fighting    ferociousness and viciousness or rather their builds and strength was all that was looked for as far as dog fighters breeders wanted them cute so they have big ass heads
  have you ever met a black person anon
if youve ever volunteered at an animal shelter then you know that more than half of the dogs are usually pitbulls and if those shelters are nokill then they have to constantly be getting their dogs adopted in order to continuously make room for new strays as a result you end up with lots pitbulls being adopted for next to nothing to lowincome families who are traditionally awful at taking care of pets let alone a specific breed that needs tons of attention and care to not turn into a psychopath at the slightest disturbance    i really dont know what it is with poor people being so fucking helpless and stupid when it comes to proper pet care it takes no effort to go online and read about what it takes to take good care of a dog living in the ghetto has taught me so much about the way these people think and approach life i have barely any sympathy for them anymore yeah go ahead and whine about how trump is ruining your life while you let an innocent animal rot in your front yard because you never let it inside
  they didnt end up dumb/poor for no reason expecting the type of people that end up being low lives to take care of a dog or any pet when they cant even help themselves is ridiculous and frustrating
  yeah the person seething this hard over a 4chan comment surly has a healthy social life and totally isnt projecting lmao
    
  thank you for your service
  no you dont
  is is that the same girl after the dog attacked or is it an unrelated image
  sudden movements scare them check  absolutely feral when provoked check  borderline vegetables with teeth check  prone to random biting check  shits and pisses everywhere but a fucking bathroom check   loved and protected by liberals of all creeds check  blacks and other low iq individuals keep them around for entertainment and empowerment check    this is getting scary lads where does it end
  who knows shitbulls kill so many kids every year that its hard keeping track of them all
they used to be silent fighters   the dogs didnt even bark at eachother in the pit  it was like boxing  two skilled fighters against eachother    as man grew more blood thirsty and violent  so did the dogs  they became jumping screaming howling beasts    they were bred for war  they arent nanny dogs or live stock guardians    because of this they excel at many other jobs but in the modern world their true purpose isnt acceptable to the public anymore     there will come a day when dogs will be able to be dogs and men will be men    but for now its all posturing things are done and bred solely for looks  but the instinct is still there  people fail to realize that and problems occur
    how can u hate them there smiling
  im a libtard and i hate pit bulls
  great counter argument lots of well thought out dialog and researched facts
    pit bulls  pit bulls  not used in pitting  goddamn are you legitimately this retarded
driving to store  see lost pit bull roaming my neighborhood  approach with excited friendly voice   get many licks wags and fullbody wiggles  use cell phone charger as leash and put pittie in car  make and hang up quick signs around neighborhood since its saturday and i figure the owners will probably realize pretty quickly  30 mins later sobbing pittie mom knocks on my door because she had been so so scared someone was going to hurt her dog for being a pitbull    /an/ is just a bunch of posturing cowards judge by the dog itself there are plenty of sweet pitbulls more than 3/4ths of the ones i work with are rescues from being beaten by their old owners terminate the breeding of english bulldogs first those things are disgusting on multiple levels
  sure some are fine  but most of the breed arent  6 of dogs but attack and kill more humans than every other breed combined
  set out a global death sentence for people who fight dogs and the numbers would drop    exercise caution around an unfamiliar pitbull never approach one unless youre experienced with handling strange dogs but im talking about the posturing fucktards on here talking about poisoning or killing the breed as a whole as if its not inherently human fault that the really vicious ones exist in the first place just be cautious and if youre that paranoid about it dont get one if you have or will have kids     hell even my dog is an abused rescue that has tried to bite kids and only kids because kids were his abusers and crippled him as a puppy and hes an otherwise exuberantly friendly whippet a lot of new parents adopt shelter dogs and dont test or take into consideration that the dog might be child aggressive until a child suddenly enters the home through birth like my aunt and uncle
      how about we dont let retards own massive powerful dogs that can crush skulls with their jaws  what if that sweet sweet pittie you found had happened upon a nervous child first
  exercise caution around an unfamiliar pitbull never approach one unless youre experienced with handling strange dogs  have u ever stopped to consider that if some retard like that pittie mom you helped out so heroically lets their dogs loose in the neighborhood people may not have a choice to avoid them if an angry pit is loose an angry pit is loose and its ruinous with that breed because no other breed is as fast strong and deadly  youre talking about how if you dont trust them just dont get one and dont have one around kids right after you just fucking described how you came across a free roaming one in your neighborhood like do you not understand the problem here
  massive    are things that are scary to you automatically enlarged in your mind as you piss your pants or    the american pit bull terrier is larger by margins of 68 inches 1520 cm in height and 2535 pounds 1116 kg in weight    also    all pit bulls in the world will kill children because i saw this gory picture and it scarred me you guys wtf  im so upset    literally pathetic
    dont pretend for a second that pits arent muscle bound as fuck theyre by far the strongest dogs around kilogram for kilogram     if theyre not dangerous round children then how come you just said  dont get one if you have or will have kids    literally contradicting yourself
  i only mentioned children because pantsshitters like to drag up dead kids     around kilogram for kilogram  a much bigger dog like a mastiff is still stronger even if theres nonmuscley kilograms in there i was still making fun of you just for calling a quite averagesized breed massive      but there was no angry pit loose an angry pit would be as equally disastrous as a neglectful owner whose rabiesspreading golden is on the loose any aggressive dog that gets loose is bad my cousin got mauled by the dog from next door that got loose when she was a toddler and had to get reconstructive face surgery it was a maltese    but if it was a pit she would have died    and if it was a husky she would have died or a mastiff or even a chow chow hypotheticals do nothing pit bulls arent even ranked as the most randomly aggressive dog cockers are
   hypotheticals do nothing  look at these statistics and tell me where the hypotheticals come in you delusional piece of shit
  and i say again and    statistics like that tell you nothing at a glance was it a child or was it someone who trains and fights dogs ending up on the wrong end of the teeth like they deserved the majority is almost definitely the latter if you specialize a breed and torture a breed and that is what dog abusers consider the breed for you are likely going to die from said breed the moment that muzzle slips at an inopportune moment    you have to actually go to the website to see    pit bulls inflicted 91 21 of all dog bite deaths in the 1029 age group 72 36 in the 3049 age group 74 56 in the 5069 age group and 66 50 in the 70 age group     pit bulls killed far more adults and males
im going to sleep because retarded anons will always be asshurt about their own paranoia and fear and blame liberals or whoever for it but statistic interpretation of proportion percentage vs n is actually important like how huskies kills are 92 children but the n is 13 more of you should learn it just as a general statement
  and i say again and  i guess i forgot niggers dont have empathy i shouldve figured considering youre defending nigger dogs
  shown his interpretation of the facts are provably skewed  nnigger    whew
  shown straight statistics  tries to talk them away like theyre not an overwhelming majority of deadly dog attacks  yyoure skewing facts  yeah ok blackie
  i actually knew a pit once she was extremely friendly and loved to cuddle i recently got the news that she had got put down by her owner because she bit someone
  this aussie bit a kid too and ended up in a shelter but was eventually adopted without footage of the incident shit like it bit somebody is meaningless
  
  without footage of the incident shit like it bit somebody is meaningless  what does he mean by this
  kid punches dog in the eye  dog snaps at the kid in reflex  hurr durr evil dog mauled my innocent babby gas it now    you need objective proof of how the situation went down
  true but i cant get rid of the suspicion that she bit for no reason and it could just as well have been me who got bit while i was playing with her if the dog bite for a good reason i dont think it would be put down
  the dog was killed not sent to jail or hell its not a punishment there is no good reason for a dog to bite a child
  the dog was killed not sent to jail or hell its not a punishment there is no good reason for a dog to bite a child
  thats not whats being argued tho right they still made up more than 60 of all deaths regardless of age
  idk man theyre cute tho  also i think a lot of pit owners are niggers or other kind of subhumans who dont teach them anything
  they are cuter than your shitpugs fag
  implying a shitpull is better looking than my regal looking purebred nordic spitz
  i wish this infographic actually had a citable source  theres no good data on this shit
i dont own a pitbull and never will own one and i dont give a shit about them but you people are stupid beyond belief        borzois were bred to kill wolves whats your point moron      there is no such thing as a pitbull breeder because it isnt a breed      a ton of breeds were bred to kill other animals you people are beyond dumb irish wolfhounds salukis and many others were bred to kill wolves rhodesian ridgebacks were originally bred to kill fucking lions       bulldogs have bull in their name because they were originally bred to fight bulls but nobody actually breeds them for that anymore either dumbass      dog fighting is already illegal the problem is less to do with dog fighting and more to do with backyard operations  puppy mills and the lack of a breed recognition for pitbulls              there are literally like under 30 pitbull deaths a year this isnt even a major problem you fearmongering retard
reminder that every shitbull must be shot and whoever disagrees with this must be shot too
  an hero
    i dont like pitbulls because they kill people and killing people is wrong  i want to kill people for disagreeing with me    getting mixed messages here  but i dont even think you know what you even want to say and are just really stupid
they arent violent owo the owners train them to be owo owo owo
my cat just got mauled to death by a cat those saying i shouldnt let my cat outside he was a stray cat who lived outside he was absolutely miserable staying inside and would sneak out or howl constantly to be let out    the truth is it is an issue who owns them it was this skinny weak woman who couldnt hold her dog back women and basedboys shouldnt be allowed to have pits they dont understand that their dogs have a high prey instinct and treat them like babies you always hear about white women having their dogs maul someone they require a strong firm owner who wont let them get away with shit
  3/4ths of the ones i work with are rescues from being beaten by their old owners     ah there it is    this is a pitophile that gets paid to propagate this vile breed disregard the previous story
  a lot of new parents adopt shelter dogs and dont test or take into consideration that the dog might be child aggressive until a child suddenly enters the home through birth like my aunt and uncle    the shelters are at fault and should be held accountable then    if they profit from putting dangerous dogs in unsuspecting homes they should pay the piper
  trying to deflect with politics    tight as fuck the pitophile has resorted to blatantly violating board rules to defend their dumbass position
for fighting
  there are literally like under 30 pitbull deaths a year this isnt even a major problem you fearmongering retard  thats over 60 of dog related deaths 60 is a major problem you fucking retard
  pffffbbtttt if i have 10 peanuts and 6 peanuts fall on the floor then that means 60 of peanuts from my measly sample are dirty and therefore all peanuts are dirty and this is a big pffffttttttt proplem pfffbtttttttttttttt    who gives a shit more people die from fucking ecoli every year nobody says lettuce is a major problem dont call me a retard when youre literally incapable of using your brain beyond your stupid feels over reals horse shit you worthless faggot
  just because you dont understand how statistics work doesnt mean they dont matter   if theres 30 dog deaths a year and 60 of them are pitbulls that means pitbulls are responsible for 18 deaths a year 18 deaths a year are by no means insignificant especially considering how easily these deaths could be prevented    more people die from this  more people die from that  it does not matter were looking at statistics about killings caused by violent dogs whatever else people die from is completely irrelevant and does not devalue the discussion youre frankly just trying to be a complete piece of shit by saying it doesnt matter stop talking about it
  why should we regulate smoking youre more likely to die in a traffic accident  why should we control immigration and make sure we dont let terrorists immigrate more people die of obesity than terrorism  you right now
  more people die from fucking ecoli every year nobody says lettuce is a major problem  within the context of food safety people are indeed saying lettuce is a major problem and are discussing e coli   just like how within the context of violent dog attacks people discuss how pitbulls are a problem     you cant just denote everything as insignificant because viewed out of context its statistically lesser than other things its a logical fallacy and a well recorded one at that so yes you are definitely retarded
  especially considering how easily these deaths could be prevented    i wonder why nobody bothers to apply the same logic to migrant/immigrant/muslim crime and murder
  why would you want to breed an animal incapable of defending your family from invaders fuck off greeny leftwing black loving shithead
  a lot of people do the most successful countries in europe spend a lot of time thinking about this issue which is why migrant violence is very low in certain countries such as denmark and switzerland   this isnt /pol/ though its /an/ hence why people are talking about /an/ specific issues and topics such as animal related deaths and not say e coli or traffic deaths or whatever that guy tried to deflect with        bulls inflicted 91 21 of all dog bite deaths in the 1029 age group 72 36 in the 3049 age group 74 56 in the 5069 age group and 66 50 in the 70 age group     pit bulls killed far more adults and males    your literal statistic you yourself just quoted shows they overwhelmingly prefer to kill younger people they account for 91 of dog bite deaths in the 1029 age group but only 72 74 and 66 in the older age groups     how fucking dumb are you son
    18 deaths a year is insignificant as fuck you moron even if it was 50 pitbull deaths a year it would still be insignificant        nobody says we should ban lettuce or that we need to be redpilled on lettuce the same way you morons are shitting up these threads about how we need to kill all pitbulls stop bullshitting      why should we regulate smoking youre more likely to die in a traffic accident    wrong actually there are 30k traffic deaths per year and 500000 smoking deaths per year neither of these numbers by the way amount to fucking 2030 which is a measly and insignificant number you are really fucking stupid    funny enough more people die from second hand smoke related illnesses than traffic related deaths  just to really show how stupidly wrong you are    why should we control immigration and make sure we dont let terrorists immigrate more people die of obesity than terrorism    thats actually a legitimate argument terrorism is also a minor problem that fear mongering feels over reals retards like yourself love to inflate because youre extremely stupid
    you dont understand statistics  what are sample sizes lmao
    and by the way all of what i just said is ignoring the fact that pitbulls arent even a real breed so the statistics are bogus to begin with
    see          unless every single individual dog in any sample has a pedigree its a mutt and not a breed that makes the pointlessly measly numbers presented here bogus to begin with
cops and law makers hate pitbulls so much i could shoot your dog on the street for no reason and be automatically presumed it was in self defense    t someone who has shot 3 of these vile dogs on 2 occasions
        tthe statistics are made up   lol ok son the mark of a defeated person
  funny enough more people die from second hand smoke related illnesses than traffic related deaths  just to really show how stupidly wrong you are  well shit i guess we should stop caring about traffic laws then its clearly not as important as smoking
  if you seriously think that we should kill all pitbulls is a common argument or point of view then i think youre genuinely retarded and are arguing against a fantasy person in your head that is so unbelievably dumb and simple minded there is no way for you to be the intellectual loser of the debate  also called a strawman in other words nobody ever said that you daft fuck people want them regulated
  every time a pitbull attack makes the news thats the public sentiment and its what all the shock jocks start shouting that doesnt happen when another breed is responsible for an attack
    comparing pure bred dogs to mutts and calling them a breed to justify some weird fearmoningering bullshit    the irony is that this wont actually fix the problem with pitbulls  in which the only way would be to establish and incentivize ethical breeding thats not going to happen if there is no pitbull breed to begin with so yes the stats are bunk im not even sure how you can think otherwise if you cant prove the fucking dog is even a pitbull then how is it even a pitbull maybe if you want to say 90 of mutts contribute to all dog related deaths or whatever that might be the actual argument  and then the answer i suggested still persists ethical breeding practices would fix that      you missed the point entirely because youre extremely fucking stupid if only 20 people died a year from both of those things nobody would actually give a fuck without some weird fearmongering narrative      nobody ever said that you daft fuck people want them regulated    several people in this thread said that or openly talk about killing pitbulls themselves one dude  even suggested killing people who disagree with them so already youre wrong and a complete moron
    and either way lets pretend to ignore the people talking about randomly killing dogs because theyre mentally stunted feels over reals retards    what exactly do you mean by regulated
  only rich people with the means to provide them silk bedding and the love of a thousand suns should be allowed to own them
    so what happens to the tens of thousands of dogs that the rich people dont wind up adopting or owning because youre limiting the amount of homes to a small minority of owners
  requiring training background check to own
  if only 20 people died a year from both of those things  dude its only 50k people who cares its insignificant do you know how many people ther are in the us alone who cares about 50k
    50k people is a lot of people this is not an argument once again you are really fucking stupid      many rescues already require background checks to own training is difficult/impossible to require for a number of reasons and it would significantly limit the amount of homes the dogs can go to which would lead to an even larger amount of dead dogs than there already is not to mention that largely speaking obedience training wont stop aggression issues caused by a lack of socialization socialization is the way to fix these problems training is secondary    again ethical standards and breed regulations to establish legitimate breeding processes for all dogs whether they are akc recognized/certified or not to prevent puppy mills and backyard breeding operations is the best way to reduce the problem of aggression issues in dogs
im on the fence about them ive raised german shepherds from a very young age i dont trust them its likely typical paranoia from hearing about them ive never known them to by anything other than perfectly amicable and kind when training them i think theyre scared they want humans to love them and many do not     that can breed fear hatred and loss in the mind of a dog you cant do that however they were bred to fight things much larger than themselves to fight theyre not a pet object theyre youre dog you have to be a great trainer and a good person to have one     its not for moronic assholes like some gangster or something to have a difficult to train dog its very experienced people theyve been overbred by people who dont have the balls to intimidate people by themselves
  50k people is a lot of people   explain by which logic 50k is a lot of people but not 20
  theyre not born regulation limits their production regulates it so to speak
  bbut that one generation of dogs we cant solve a problem because itll cause a single generation of homeless dogs think of them
  fuck that shit we have to make an effort to breed that aggression out of them we are responsible for this species we formed a pact with them the moment we gave a wolf a piece of cooked meat we can never get away from our responsibility to them theyre us now were them
    what is statistical significance     again you are stupid just stop
  dont dodge the question by which logic is 20 not a significant amount of deaths while 50k is whats the cutoff which logic is the cutoff based on
    i dont really think you actually understand the gravity of how stupid you are or how stupid your question is     it swings both ways 310 people die from rabies every year why not regulate all animals in north america over 310 people per year lets make 1520 threads about this every day on /an/ about the massive rabies problem in america or the massive shark attack problem which effects around 23 people a year give or take if 20 people is a massive number why not 2 or 3 which logic is the cutoff based on shit if just a single person dies from something lets just rant about it and compel for government regulations to prevent it
  i think you should stop dodging the question by which logic is 20 people statistically insignificant while 50k people are statistically significant explain your criteria and the cutoff and the logical reasoning behind them
  so the cutoff is one person single people apparently dont count is it basically that you hate introverts for some reason
    and since its established that youre extremely extremely retarded the reason why we dont make a big deal about the things listed here  is statistical significance if certain trends are of such small statistical significance its difficult to really compel widespread change since its not a significant problem 50k people can equate to an entire city or towns population so thats of much higher significance it also has economic implications too
why are redditors trying to normalize shitbulls so hard
  dont dodge the question see     i really dont give a shit about what you think about other unrelated things i am straight up just asking you the question in 
    how can you talk about logical reasoning when youre a logically bankrupt retard you literally have no idea what youre talking about as evidenced by    
  mate can you stop deflecting by which logic is 20 people statistically insignificant while 50k people are statistically significant explain your criteria and the cutoff and the logical reasoning behind them
    im not deflecting your question is impossible to answer because you dont understand how stupid it is
  if my question is impossible to answer then that means your statement that 20 deaths do not warrant action while 50k do is completely pulled out of your ass and not backed by a single logical thought or fact     or are you gonna answer it
  then that means your statement that 20 deaths do not warrant action    i never said that actually funny enough in fact i said quite a few times the specific actions that need to happen to fix this problem the difference is that i dont think its a big enough problem to justify the absurd hysteria and fearmongering     ive said this a few times now but youre completely stupid and have no idea what you are talking about your question is retarded and completely illogical
  i never said that actually funny enough    you did   direct quote   18 deaths a year is insignificant as fuck you moron  there are 30k traffic deaths per year and 500000 smoking deaths per year neither of these numbers by the way amount to fucking 2030 which is a measly and insignificant number    so not only yes you actually did say that youre also lying about having said it now that you realize it was an indefensible position to take im done here faggot dont bother backpedaling any harder now i wont read it and your bike might break
cant stand em    cant stand that they are bait for lonely women    cant stand that women will go outside and walk twothree of them at a time pretending as if they have any sort of real control over their dog i literally got fired from my last job because i argued with some stupid woke liberal girl that pitbulls are an unnecessary risk to take just so we can prove the thousands of deaths were accidents or a result of mistraining    animals bite back even when they are on their back begging for mercy you really think you can breed or train the killing instinct of an animal out of it how many centuries of society and humans still prefer vane representations of beauty but somehow your pibble is 100 definitely not one of those faceshredders    just as bad as people who use their phone when they drive literally just asking for it to happen and pretending that it hasnt yet is proof it wont fuck you and fuck your shitty babymauling dog
    where in that sentence did i say that theres no action that can or should be done about helping pitbulls and making them more socialized ill wait maybe in that time you can learn to read
    also i dont know what youre talking about me realizing i have an indefensible position  my position is the only correct position
  i really dont know what it is with poor people being so fucking helpless and stupid when it comes to proper pet care it takes no effort to go online and read about what it takes to take good care of a dog  welfare/benefits recipients often put no effort into any aspect of their lives
    the majority of welfare recipients are white
  the majority of people are white never mind that heritage and genetic background come into play white people right no we all have separate identities heritage ancestry you just like to think your snowflake ass is unique because your parents fucked a donkey or something     go fuck yourself with the idea of a minority or a majority for that matter the majority of the world is chinese
  the majority of people are white  the majority of people are chinese  lmao he cant even keep his story straight
    all of these /pol/ idiots are extremely dumb dipshits who just want to justify their bullshit theories and feelings its a real shame because this board used to be really cool and full of smart people before the stormfags ruined it
      white people own a gud boi
  are you implying that repeating oy vey goyim ad nauseam isnt a good argument
  i wouldnt dispute that i live in an extremely white area but theyre mostly useless filth with horrible looking dogs
  next he will tell me 6 gorillion died and there was no typhus
  bad goyim bad delet
    like clockwork
  look at per capita consumption of welfare    also most violent crime is committed by blacks and the media glosses over when they wanna burn down cities and murder cops like that piece of shit in dallas or the copycat killers in louisiana    plot twist im also not white its just retarded how its trendy to hate on whites and give blacks a free pass to act like violent animals
  back for another round of spamming and bans incel
  so niggers can at times be peaceful and even nurturing but you surely wouldnt want nigger around a white baby would you
itt  people who got cucked by their gfs pit bvll
  niggers were our nannies for most of white history dumbass and they actually did a very good job because they are natural servants
  what a terrible way to die
what about staffies
  this never happened
americans calling for ban of shitbulls because they kill like 10 people a year   guns r my right   everyone here is a statistical retard and could do with reading thinking fast and slow but wont because it takes time to read a couple hundred pages  glad im not in america
  glad im not in america    im sure america is glad you aint in her too you hoplophobic piece of basedsnorting trash
  thinking fast and slow  i just looked it up and it looks interesting whats it like
  read this book written by a jew telling you how to think  no thanks i already watch hollywood movies
the sheer amount of brainlets in this thread is astounding oh my
  whats hoplophobia
i was once walking down a lonely street when soddenly i saw a what i blieve to be a pit bull just a lone pit bull no leach no chain it wasnt moving so i tried to just move beside it it tuned its head at me not wanting to risk anything i moved back this is when the owner comes out of her house and quit loudly tells the dog to come to her before telling me it doesnt bite you may now scream
  i dont know why everyone ripps on pitts when there are idiot owners of all sorts of breeds    it just seems like fighting/guarding breeds get picked up by inbreds who want a scary looking dog    cycle to work early in the morning before dawn  see the glimmer of a fag tip in the distance one day  guy in all dark clothes with black alsatian shaped thing beside him  sees me and in a hushed panicked voice tries to usher to dog off the path and holds it short on the leash as i pass  hear this primal fucking snarl behind me as it tries to bolt after me  run in to him regularly  dog is so aggressive he can only walk it at the crack of dawn before anyone else is around    one day ill see a local news report about how one of the elderly joggers that frequent that route has been mauled to death and the bastard will just be like hes such a sweet dog really i dont understand hes never done anything like that before
awe whaddagoodlilboyyo look at him hes smiling give my lil good ol doggu a lil kiss whad a goodboi
  judging by context clues it seems obvious he meant to write the majority of american people unless you thought this thread was about the pitbull situation in mozambique
  i dont know why everyone ripps on pitts when there are idiot owners of all sorts of breeds    i dont know why people dont want lions to roam the streets after all lots of people have aggressive house cats
  per capita
  ill take shit that never happened for 100
  are you seriously comparing a pitbull to a lion and all other breeds to housecats because fuck me if you are thats retarded    yes pits are strong dogs but dont tell me theyre physically more dangerous then something like a rottie mastiff or even a big shepp
  lions kill you pitbulls kill you  housecats dont kill you chihuahuas dont kill you    very comparable yes
  picks two extremes    its exactly the same    no most dogs arent chihuahuas and you know it pits arent the most physically dangerous dog out there and you know it     pitbulls are a problem because they are a large strong dog that needs a firm experienced hand which has become popular with your avarage human trash as a form of makeshift personal protection they arent in themselves some sort of transcendently violant genetically engeneered super monster they are a dog there are many large strong dogs that shouldnt be owned by the majority of people    if everyone had a cane corso or a tibetan mastiff i guarantee that would be a bigger problem
  based but bluepilled
    daily reminder that pit bulls kill less than 50 people in the us each year    stairs kill over 12000 people a year    ban stairs now stop the killing
  honestly fuck stairs theyre the real problem in our society
  unironically this the government should outlaw stairs and instead build elevators in all buildings
  yes elevators only killed 30 americans last year meaning they tied with pit bulls for safety
this is now a stair danger awareness thread
  lets ban pitbulls and stairs
  nobody should be able to own any dog that is capable of killing a human being easily unless he underwent strict training  youre retarded if you think german shepherds dont need to be just as regulated as pitbulls pitbulls are just the most offensive example
  nobody should be able to own    molon labe
  ive poisoned pitbulls before so yeah
        what is the top breed regarding aggression towards humans   this may shock you but dachshunds and chihuahuas exhibit the largest amount of aggression towards humans this includes both strangers and the dogs owner pit bull terriers are more known for aggression towards unknown dogs than humans
  im genuinely not opposed to having mandatory dog licensees that require at least a basic test of competence     i think it would go a long way to help solve a lot of problems
  chihuahua and sausages cant cause much damage
bbbbbut muh pibbles  nanny dogs  pibbles
  i do not expect anything else from authoritarian marxists but to be psychopathic criminals and to brag about it too that in fact is 90 of the reasony why we carry guns anyway
  i own guns ive gotten rid of a pits once they broke out of a garden and displayed aggression  if it happens once itll happen again and the next time they might find someone on the street before their owner notices    nice game you play in your head though  if someone doesnt love my fucked up nigger dogs unconditionally hes just a gun grabbing libtard
  your  your  your    keep your fucking hellhounds away from me and my pets
  the first reply is a pitbull woner trying to justify the pitbull
  accurate
so basically i should just filter pitbull and /an/ becomes usable
  because you want a fucking guard dog or a fighter not a fucking pet you fucking onions faggot
  i had to do a doubletake after misreading the first line as all we want is to sit on your face
  i love made up facts put into an image macro
  based
  some pitbulls legitimately resemble aliens with a really strong jaw
  its only anecdotal but even owners who have done everything right as much as they could to train a pitbull or a mixed pit properly with professional trainers have had some seemingly small thing set the dog off with no warning and gotten attacked     i remember one story of a woman sitting in bed reading while her husband was brushing his teeth and their pit that they raised from puppyhood attacked her without warning something about her dropping the book on the blanket being a possible trigger and what saved her was putting her arms in front of her face/head and her husband being close by    dogs that have relatively high aggression risk and have the strength to back it up should really just be kept as yard/outside dogs
  sounds about right for pitophiles
  why would someone assume a dog is vicious just by how they look a big hearty fuck you to you honestly a few bad apples spoil the bunch
  different breeds dont have different visual characteristics
  just by how they look  imagine being low iq enough to actually think a dogs breed is just how they look
so this would not be the ideal dog to have sex with
people think hes really dangerous but hes really nice with me because im special    am i talking about pitbulls or bad boys now you understand why women like both
  infant is on top of the dogs paw  infant is incapable of getting there themselves  infant was therefore placed there for the photo    im gonna go one step further and say it was the mother who did that
  smiling  panting
  what the fuck is wrong with pitbull owners i thought it was just memes
  pitbull owners  they are either shit people or virtue signaling faggots the virtue signaling faggots get all worked up over the pitbull attacks because it is never an abused pitbullt that does it this destroys their narrative of no bad dog only bad owner and they get angry its the equivalent of showing gun grabbers actual death rate data from cdc and fbi they lose their shit
  wait where are you even getting thousands of deaths from there was 284 pitbull related fatalities between 2005 and 2017  even if you had european countries int hat time im doubtful youll even hit the 1000 mark in that 12 year period    something tells me you were fired for being a spastic retard and you often argued over things you could have googled yourself
  golly that was difficult i had to google the title of the infographic and everything  
    pitbulls are aesthetic desu if it werent for their mean attitudes theyd be the best dog breed out there easily    iirc they were bred for bloodsport
we have a staffordshire he was never violent with us but we have to keep him separated from our beagle becuase they are both very territorial and obviously the staff is much stronger and violent
  anti pitbull website  based on our own statistics  right real official  also  more likely to die from a lightning strike then a pitbull  huh and this is an anti pitbull website
  holy shit when does the cleansing of this filth begin
  dogs pick up social cues from humans if dogs learn that humans act happy when they smile they are positively reinforced to imitate the facial behavior its not exactly smiling if anything its closer to a sign of submission or endearment but the effect is the same
  majority plastic surgery required for recovery is overwhelmingly due to pitbull attacks  the very distant second is rottweiler followed quickly again by pitbull cross breeds  most pitbull rescue centres inform owners that pitbulls are not a suitable walk around the park kind of dog  hurr durr theres no significant difference between pittbulls and other breeds  theres no reasons several institutes such as the military banned pitbulls  its just the owners fault but im definitely the appropriate owner for a pibble  pitbulls were historically nanny dogs    get over the fact that a pitbull isnt anywhere near top of the list for best family dog breed as it sure as fuck shouldnt be
insert anecdotal evidence  pibbles r cool shud up
  its not the stairs its the property owners
  spooky
  theres no good reason for a child to piss off a dog
  she was ugly anyway not a significant loss
  for the same reason gallos de pelea exist money
  ecoli no  every supermarket near me has pulled all romaine lettuce off the shelves due to the ecoli scare you fool
  imagine pokemon in real life
  thats the most neurotic looking rooster ive ever seen whyd they dub just the comb and not the wattles
  if i see a pit in my neighborhood im feeding it poison  fuck these things
  guys son gets absolutely fucking massacred by not one but two pitbulls  the dude is obviously grieving especially after seeing his son actually torn apart  pitbull apologists tell the guy to kill himself just because he said that the dogs are retarded savages that kill for no reason  what the fuck is actually wrong with people fucking hell man
  found  thats my doggo you mong
muh nigger doggo bad  emm sweatie any doggo regardless of race can be a bad doggo if their owners act like niggers or dont properly train them vid related 
  le nurture meme applies to dogs  no dogs are fucking stupid canines their demeanor is all based on their breed genetics canines dont transfer knowledge meaning instinct is how they get around so say nurture has any effect on them is sheer nonsense caused by humanizing the canine because its your pet
  because its cool    but really its in the name its a dog bred to be pitted against bulls
go to youtube and search for smiling pitbull or pitbull smile if you want to see how insane pit owners are
  not true
  it was bred specifically to fight thats why
    so i keep seeing the supposed pitbulls used to be called nanny dogs shit in a couple places and is it just made up bullshit that people are trying to push or does it have any form of legitimacy attached to it i have absolutely never heard it before outside of those specific fact images
  is it just made up bullshit  yes
the purpose of the pitbull was to sit next to the child while mom and pop where out tending the cattle the primary trait they were breed for was aggression against anything that wasnt part of the pack
  majority plastic surgery required for recovery is overwhelmingly due to pitbull attacks  the very distant second is rottweiler followed quickly again by pitbull cross breeds  youre going to bff to source me cause that sound wrong the german shepherd ids one off the most popular needs with a bite force stronger than a pit bull theres no way they arent on that list  most pitbull rescue centres inform owners that pitbulls are not a suitable walk around the park kind of dog  hurr durr theres no significant difference between pittbulls and other breeds  same thing for most large dog breeds  theres no reasons several institutes such as the military banned pitbulls  pit bulls were not the only breed banned most large breeds were  its just the owners fault but im definitely the appropriate owner for a pibble  you are literally more to die by pretty much anything includibg lightning this is a fact you can check the statistics from wikipedia not everyone should own a lot bull i know a pit bull rescue where they take the dogs from criminals or minorities still youre going to have to prove to me that a pit bull is much more dangerous than a german shepard or maybe a rottweiler if pit bulls are banned theyll be coming for those dogs next
  if you find out that of all the pitbull deaths 90 of them are nigs and spics 9 are low class whtes and the 1 left are normal people i think yo would change your mind 
  i wish people would stop obscuring names
  but thats just not true the deaths are caused by white liberals virtue signaling with their dog unironically blacks make the best pit owners because they beat the shit out of them
  blacks also encourage their dog to be as violent as possible
  
  pitbulls  literally just a poor american problem    how do you feel about your country being so shit
  to bait bulls  why the hell do you think theyre called pitbulls
pits are the equivalent of boys with adhd put them in house raised by a single mother they turn into problems stick them with a dad with rules boundaries discipline and exercise and they are just fine  maybe just make a rule that white women and s o y bois be barred from owning pits they would have to look elsewhere to virtue signal though
  shelters label half their dogs pit mixes because their heads are a little fat most likely the pitbulls also include boxers mastiff mixes and other fatheaded breed mixes like english labs though staffies and pits are way overbred    and as a pet professional most of the fights ive actually witnessed between a pitbull and another dog were started by the other dog and finished by the pitbull but the pitbull was blamed by the smaller dogs owners despite their dog obviously starting the fight pitbulls will murder you and your dog if you mess with them and they should not be owned by casual dog owners who dont know how to properly socialize and train them as puppies  theyre also dumb as rocks
  actually rottweilers have a stronger bite strength than american pitbull terriers on average    american pitbull terriers are considered mediumsized dogs where i work as a pet professional sometimes you do get an absolutely massive pit mix but usually they are actually american bulldog mixes and not actually apts american bulldogs have fat pit shaped heads but are much larger and somehow even stupiderlooking people mistake them all the time    shelters are filled with pitbulls theyre hugely overbred in my opinion the main reason that they account for the most deaths is that there are a shit ton of them in shelters who have been abused being adopted out to families who are not dog professionals any dog from a dogfighting breeder should not be adopted into just any family thats crazy  raising a pitbull puppy you have the ability to control their development and properly socialize them when properly socialized and trained they can be just fine dogs most of the pits who kill people are adopted as adults or are from dogfighting rings
theyre a very difficult breed that should be moved into the specialty class basically dogs that need serious training by clear professionals rather than somebody who gets them for no reason or to protect themselves     right now theyre being bought by people that should otherwise get a lab or something more manageable because theyre not easy to deal with theyre very very strong and need to be welltrained not to do harm i actually like them because theyre very kind and steadfast when theyre treated well     you dont get a dog for petty reasons and your responsibility doesnt end after purchase i met a girl with a rottweiler that was totally out of control she never payed attention to him and he acted that way my sister and her boyfriend didnt like it because it chased and harassed their dogs    i came to visit them with my german shepherd  mastiff cross thats extremely well trained he challenged that dog and had him acting normally in the first twenty minutes thats a big challenger with good energy they didnt have a problem with that dog again until they moved
  or are from dogfighting rings  wrong
  why is you never hear about pit that was abused killing people or its owners it is always oh my little baby just snapped he never bit anyone before i dont know why he did its dumb ass white women wanted to virtue signal that have no idea what they are doing with an active dog bred to kill things   nogs make the best owners because they beat them into submission you never hear about nigglets getting kibbled by the pibble its always white women and their mixed babies or an unfortunate neighbor to them
  you might have an argument if you could find a way to speak english this isnt your instagram account you fucking imbecile im not who you replied to and i have no idea what you just fucking said     kibble never hear kibble blah    i didnt donate 5000 to adult literacy a month ago for you to completely bumblefuck the english language that was my black friday money and some good spending
  wrong many babies mauled are niglets
  these should be illegal everywhere in the world
  lmao i poisoned a pitbull that looked just like the one on the right in your pic  youre doing the world a favor
  kill all pitbulls i swear to god these things all need to be exterminated
test
  every time someone posts some pibble shit talking about how cute and gentile pitbulls can be i feel far more validated in my opinion that people should not own pitbulls anymore
  youre going to have to prove to me that a pit bull is much more dangerous than a german shepard  gibs me proof  no not that proof
  pit bulls biting more people is not proof that the breed is more dangerous    for that youd have to control for population size control for the fact that pit bull isnt a breed and then control for owner demographics    once you do that your proof is gone it was fake news all along
  control for owner demographics  why are you so racist
  why are you    if white people werent racist then brown people wouldnt be poor
  holy fuck what a bunch of cunts
  they are the animal version of black people  inb4 black people are animals
      you have a filthy mouth
  dog parent  well that explains everything
  its probably because the pit bull is now the alpha male and considering how the owner goes on reddit to cry about being bullied by his dog instead of standing up for himself chances are the pit bull will either be abandoned or put down dont wolves also do this shit dont the leaders attack and harass the other wolves so they know whos in control just dont let your dog trample over you like some pussy
  and white middle class childless liberals get them to virtue signal that theyre good people for raising a misunderstood breed  is this also why they date interracial
  dat strawman
  you forgot theyre overpowered
  i change my mind we need more guns in this country
  theyre terrible dogs but if they attack your dog or something theyre at least a good size where you can kick it right into the air
anyone have any cat memes i need them for work

baby hippos and pygmy hippos are super sweet baby pygmies are the candiest check out these wiggling ears
  how does something so small because so fucking massive  its like human baby sized
  thats a pygmy hippo but baby bigmy hippos are much larger
  arent much larger
  it stretches and gets fatter i guess baby ostriches storks emus cassowaries pelicans etc are also tiny but turn into freakishly tall longnecked longlegged behemoths
    lol white trash seething what happened your baby turned out to be a black one
  blue whale vs hippo
roommate just moved in and brought the dog with him she loves him to death but i dont think his work schedule is ideal for her hes gone from about 13 pm to 11 pm2 am for work depending on the day i work 85     problem is because of those hours he sleeps from like 5 am to noon or later every day with her in his room the expectation is that its when she should sleep but shes a dog and of course wants to sleep during the night so in the mornings when i wake up or at lunch when i come home i can hear her stirring and trying to get out wanting to dog things     when i get home shes generally asleep how do i keep her occupied so she sleeps with him and isnt bummed about being cooped up in a bedroom all day
  is this a pibble were talking about
  nothing just let the dog get used to the fact that even though he hears another person awake its still his sleep time
  also animals arent people they dont need uninterrupted rem sleep or anything they move around all the time
male  chill at feeder lets sparrows eat too  female  belligerent sparrow comes a foot near or looks at her funny she chases or attacks them
its because she is a bird
  bitchez be trippin dawg
  sparrows are an invasive species the female knows its best to yeet those bitches back to azerbaijan or whatever gay hole they came from
the female of the species must be deadlier than the male
shes redpilled
discuss prehistoric fauna flora and geology now enriched with 100 more dinoanons    whats your favorite prehistoric organism    /paleo/ discord     old thread 
what the fuck was his problem
whats the dino with like a bump on its head and they would supposedly bump each other    not the triceratops
  pachycephalosaurus and similar species
  tube
  yes
anyone else creeper out by fern
  i think they are kind of pretty they probably were a cool setting for dinosaurs i love to see areas dominated by ferns it looks almost like a jungle plant    he was a fast guy but not fast enough
i like how they didnt make the jaws too wide like with baryonyx
im usually quite biased towards ornithodirans that being what i mainly study i do adore my dinosaurs and pterosaurs if i had to pick 1 genera from each clade itd be tyrannosaurus including all five species under its genus and pteranodon sternbergi
  tyrannosaurus including all five species under its genus
  trex tbataar tsanjuanensis/brinkmani tsp and tmagnus
  tsanjuanensis/brinkmani tsp  i was willing to buy bataar and magnus but come on
  tsanjuanensis/brinkmani was the ojo alamo tyrannosaurus which is based on very fragmentary evidence as is tsp which was transitional between tbataar and trex and displaced the dryptosaurs in its environment as apex predator
  which is based on very fragmentary evidence  which is exactly why im not buying it like the whole troodon/stenonychosaurus thing where they based everything they know about troodon off of one tooth ever found just because it was similar to sten
  they based everything they know about troodon off of one tooth  this is the kind of shit that turns me off from paleontology
  this is the kind of shit that turns me off from paleontology  its not on purpose you just have to give a tooth a name if its new and distinct from there people discover the rest of the animal and everything is looking good    then people discover three different species that have the same tooth and suddenly it doesnt look so good anymore
  treats t species as an actual species  protip when a scientist says t species we mean an unidentifiable species not a new species    usually its unidentifiable because theres not enough of it left to identify it to the species level
  psittacosaurus sp for example its considered to be identifiable as its own species it just isnt named and its preserved perfectly with skin impressions and filamentous feathers in its tail yes the tsp material is fragmentary but using the psp line of logic it can be considered valid i know sp is a placeholder for when a species is formally described however because it is so fragmentary in needed the sp until more is discovered of it my point is its still valid even with the sp assigned to it
  troodon is based off one tooth yes but the animals ive listed have more than just a tooth sure its fragmentary but enough to warrant a placement within tyrannosaurus and a formal species name stenonychosaurus very obviously takes priority over troodon because it is a tooth taxa the others arent the remains known are similar to tyrannosaurus however the stratigraphic data suggests that its a new species
sup jwe thread just wanted to say i really doubt theres ever going to be an option to build aviaries in jwe ever but it would be really cool
  my point is its still valid even with the sp assigned to it  its not valid unless its described and named    ever    because 99 of the time its not a new species its just an unidentifiable bit of a known species    your point is ridiculous
  dont say shit like that i genuinely believe with enough public opinion would drop that air and water dlc they just have to feel enough people would buy it i would buy it twice just to have it
  succh looks amazing too bad bary looks like shit
    i almost dont want them to bother with air or water creatures feels like to big of a leap and would have to be completely different games not only that i hated the pteranodons looked in jw and how brutal they were just too movie monster for my liking     i just want a better more fleshed out base game and more content for that
also does anyone here frequent the jwe frontier forum this last dlc was a shit show with people being for or against hybrids and now the only posts made are by two retarded brazilian guys who make stupid threads for one dinosaur
  theres any cool wallapper about pachycephalosaurus fight
  why does everyone think this sea/air shit would be tough to finesse fucking put it in
  i really should hop on there i love this game i would like to tell them what i think
  i can see marine reptiles being added but jwe would be the first ever custom aviary building sim if thats what you want maybe you could place the aviaries as buildings  even some mammals like columbian mammoths and uintatherium would be cool but they really gotta get the maps figured out
  looks like i could smoke that shit
  first thing that comes to mind when he sees a fern is to roll up a doobie and smoke it  a stegosaurus posted this
  he thinks alamotyrannus is anything other than tyrannosaurine indet
spoilerseething/spoiler
  had i been running things id have given the option to create purestrain dinos at 100 genome purestrain being more accurate to life counterparts though a bit of a misnomer since youd still be able to tinker with the gene mods granted id also have a more in depth customer ai with those wanting cooler dinos and those wanting more real ones those wanting more visibly comfortable dinos and those who want the dino gladiators etc    not to mention a complet overhaul to escape mechanics frontier promised escapes would feel more like an rts i did not get this at all    but then again wed be able to fix this ourself if theyd just fucking allow mods
  everything you say i like except the mods whats wrong with escapes
  over simplicity makes it less a crisis and more achore id make them a rarer thing but when they happen you have to move an acu team in properly with a squad and have to choose between leathal and nonleathal takedown maybe even make call speakers to lure the animal into a trap and if possible maybe even make saurian support animals for the squads this could make story missions way more interesting too instead of just sending the dino off and thats the end of secrets you could be in command of a strike team to take down the sabatoures hands on in a climactic confrontation     not to mention more security and feeding options like moats pigs cows fish to dispense into the water
  i thought spinosaurus wasnt going to be in early access    also lol leglet
  is this another scam starter like the last competing dino zoo game turned out to be
  who is seething
  pks tech demo is unironically more fleshed out than mesozoicas 30 launch release which is now being sold for an embarrassing 99 cents
yo guys what plant should i pick once the pk people contact me    i was thinking something weird like the corpse flower
  it isnt its the first dinosaur thats going to be worked on after release whenever that is        you forgot to mention that pks demo is free  when was the last time any kickstarter game offered a free demo
i really like the field museums new cgi sue model theyre using for the private suite media elements
  universal wont allow it because  someone streaming with mods would be bad because it would hurt our brand image like adding feathers we want to make sure feathers dont ever exist in the public imagination never ever lol 6 foot turkey lol
  awww shes so chubby
  but universal doesnt own dinosaurs also its ironic that they are being so greedy and grubbing when the movies argue so strongly against greed
dude that spinoraptor mission was dope
  universal pays copyright office billions  soon all natural history museums are forced to pay royalties to universal and put jurassic world stuff in their gift shops  paleo artists are forced to forfeit their intellectual property to universal emily willoughbys works are destroyed  universal execs start managing dig sites telling paleontologists what to dog for  scientific journals get payed hush money to censor claims made by chinese paleontologists especially those regarding feathers  textbooks are rewritten to say v mongoliensis resembled v nublarensis
  emily willoughbys works are destroyed  censor claims made by chinese paleontologists  ok wheres the downside
  here it is
  it wasnt that bad granted it is the worst of the series but even that id at least enjoy
snabbity snab
  why did prehistoric whales look reptilian
  jw1 was by far the worst generic and cheesy fallen kingdom was cheesey but at least unique jp3 was generic and bad the first 2 were excellent
  i actually think jp3 is better then tlw the second movie was so up its own ass with environmentalism for unnatural animals of all things though the sandiego sequence does help it jp3 never pretended to be anything it wasnt a simple romp with the dinosaurs on the island it didnt pretend to have any serious morals jw was mostly the same in this reguard while fallen kingdom once again tries to moralize about it but in an indecisive manner i like all these movies but damn id give a couple of them another draft myself
  wrong    jp1  jw1  tlw  jp3  jw2
      i issue to you all a challenge say some thing nice about your least favorite film in the series    ill start  jp 3 has easily the best designed and portrayed raptors in the series being not mindless murder machines like the previous two but nor overly friendly mascots like blue became not to mention a unique look to them with good patterning and overall good effects
  i thought the indoraptor looked cool and there are lots of things i like about jp3 just as a whole its garbage the animatronics look like garbage and dont blend with the cg models like they do in jp and tlw like the rex puppet is brown and the model is green for instance
  the concept of the indoraptor and the island erupting both work bringing the dinos the mainland is a good escelation and the indoraptor felt a proper evil counterpart to blue but it should have been 2 movies with more time to flesh things out and the indoraptor didnt get to show its intelligence properly id have even made it responsible for freeing the dinos as it avoids the issue of humans making that stupid choice
  honestly something i really liked about jw1 was how open ended it was while also being a satisfying conclusion for the island park and t rex giving those a good sendoff while also raising questions about the state of the world what are other people doing with deextinction are there other dinosaur parks out there if dinosaurs are being considered for military application are they currently being used for other purposes is biosyn in the picture is that where wu is going with the dna at the end will there be people trying to put a stop to other dinosaur related activities after the events of jurassic world are there animal rights groups for this sort of thing instead we find out that despite the public being bored of dinosaurs jurassic world had a monopoly on the dinosaur theme park thing and these are the only dinosaurs left on the planet we got the lost worlds story again except the ending is exactly the same as jurassic world and the only question we have is can they actually pull off the planet of the apes but with dinosaurs concept for the third one the indoraptor was a needless retread if theyre going to keep going with the hybrids thing they should do something new with it i actually liked the indominus in the first one i saw it as a natural progression of the ideas and foundations in the first movie but the indoraptor is just that again but its a raptor now
  jw2 gave zero fucks about portraying needless violence towards dinosaurs you think they wouldnt have built jurassic world on the site of an active volcano think again commence the dinosaurs melting in lava getting btfo by giant chunks of rocks and running over a cliff in a panicked state and fucking drowning in the sea and even while all this shit is going down predators are still murderbeasts that must attempt to eat humans presented the chance or outright kill another predator just for being a different species   just imagine if it was an island of dogs instead
  idgaf that emily is a furfag artist her shit is aesthetic
  yeah personally in my fan wanked extended cut im imagining its not the only new hybrid its simply the latest along with a pair from the games the spinoraptor and the carnoraptor and theyd be part of the indos posse of sorts mirroring the big one to a degree as well as being a dark mirror to raptor squad    the smile it pulled also gave me an idea to add thay might be out there but could also salvage a thing there arent any known nonprimates that can smile indicating that it may have had some human put into it id have used this make the kid being a clone relivent as she was the first cloned human her genes would already be in the lab theyd use to make the new indo this would be enforced by having it hesitate to attack her as it would smell something familiar on her       as a side note im very sure the movies are going to have blue breeding on her own in suppliments materials from jw she was noted as being made with monitor lizard dna instead of frog komodo dragon females can breed via aparthenagenesis if needed
  land hawk  shit
  shrinkwrapping and edginess
  jwii or how it should be known jurassic world the lost park takes it self way to seriously to be enjoyed on that level doesnt help that every dinosaurs ojectively looks retarded and shit they feign all the fucking effort in the world at ilm with sophisitcated muscle software but since they officially gave up on anatomy well no shit your dinosaurs looks like weightless cartoon characters maybe they shouldve gone full stupid but not the marvel flavor of stupid like bmovie levels of dumb filmaking to the point of unintentional comedy but eh the franshise is beyond saving at this point and its actively making any mention of prehistory progressively gayer and gayer by making all these sad exuses for dinosaurs go even more mainstream than they already are
  hilariously the one dino that has some weight to its motion is the one that was made up
  shes definetly not bad but i find her to be extremely overated her style isnt exactly for me not sure what it is about it it all seems so round an clean but iirc she was one of the first artist to actually pinpoint the modern raptor aesthetic down without it looking like a komodo dragon getting raped by some madman with to much time glue and cheap hobby lobby feather and no sense for aesthetics or taste even
  i suppose you gotta love how the engineered millitary killing machine goes off roaring at all its victim looks lack luster as fuck and has a bright neon yellow stripe for easy spotting im sure youre gonna get the jihades with that goyim of course
thinking of putting a mobile museum together i was thinking of leasing retail space but eh i really want to specialize in authentic fossils the public can touch and feel a whole variety of things and even some you can hold in your hand yes i was thinking of putting a petting zoo together at first but you dont have to feed fossils
  using different types of lightsuvblack light are a cool idea that ive already seem in the streets
  she does small dinos better than big ones she anthropomorphizes the bigs ones but the small ones are on point  what im waiting for is another big budget dinosaur film outside of jp  peter jacksons king kong was bad and has been shelved in favor of a new king kong reboot  disneys dinosaur is overrated irrelevant kiddie shit  ice age and the good dinosaur are kiddie shit walking with dinosaurs 2013 was poorly done kiddie shit  dinosaur revolution is sappy and bad  terra nova is bad and irrelevant  dinosaur planet is decent at least  the original walking with series is great even if dated needs a reboot dinosaur revolution is a failed attempt at this  when dinosaurs roamed america was great  they really need some fresh ideas like maybe a horror film about a yutyrannus or nanuqsaurus running around in alaska dragging people off into the night or something
  wait what furry artist fuck off with that feces
  the color wouldnt matter if it had its predecessors camo ability though i like the stance overall the acted far too dumb some of that can be explained with its a prototype but not enough im more forgiving to this film then most but ill call out flaws where i see them
  yeah in general we need some creators to piggyback on the hype generated by the movies ironically to remind people they dont have a dinosaur monopoly
  people who dedicate their lives to drawing some specific thing have serious autistic dedication lots of actually good paleoartists are furfags
  im pretty sure ive seen her discussed on kiwifarms animal control board as well
  no theyre not
fav prehistoric animal palaeospondylus    its an enigmatic organism from the devonian is it a shark acanthodian jawless fish or tetrapod larva nobody knows this yet and it is a hot debate
  it looks like my peenus weenus     hahah d
  peter jaclsons king kong is alright when they arent stuck in that fucking boat there are some decent fancuts that do the movie a little more justice i think the new one seems to be more along the lines off low effort marvel rip but with bigol monsters goyim but i know what you mean though i think this problem extends much farther in scope than just paleo shit everything seems to be piggy backed off of what came before and worse hollowood seems to have a fetish now for making everything jokey and giving everyone stupid one liners becauase everything needs to be like a faggoty superhero movie which is very much the case for jw and got so much worse in jw2      ive heard a premise about time travelling back into insert mesozoic time region here be pitched several times and having it be a character driven internal collapse of the group of time travellers as they encounter dinosaurs being weird as shit channeling the whole all yesterdays movement in making the dinosaurs be unexpected yet not particularly unrealistic would make for a pretty nice movie maybe something like one of those wwds nigel marvin specials getting botched would make be good jumping off point that or just embrace the stupid and have kung fu raptors from deep outerspace
  not sure about the furfag thing but i know a lot if the male ones are cucked sjws though if were honest with ourselves its rare to find an artist that doesnt channel the sperg in one way or another much less a paleoartist
  find me one paleotographer besides emily willoughby who draws explicit feral pornography not inoffensive sterile scientific speculation on probable mating habits but outright bestial xxx erotica alongside inflation fetishism and macro footsquishing
  switch jp3 and jw2 and i agree with you 100
does it count as lips if an oral seal is keratinous instead of fleshy
  are beaks called lips  no  sometimes  never  but what if its got teeth  still a beak  but no what if the beak seals the mouth then its lips right  no  but i really want a beak to be lips  nobody cares
  who are you quoting
  every possible iteration of the sort of absurd thought process that causes people to ask if beaks can be lips even though beaks exist and nobody calls them lips
  am i the only one who isnt on board with this recent trend of copypasting existing bird color schemes into dinosaurs especially dromeosaurs i meandoes anyone actually think lokk wat are the odds hurr durr they exactly same seems kind of lame sure its not a big deal but it seems pretty low effort on the artist part even as a visual experiment
  i generally think people spend too much time copying instead of extrapolating
  this is another biological shibboleth the uninitiated such as yourself cannot comprehend    theres a very good reason why they do that biologically speaking but more importantly theres a reason they do it biosnob speaking only other biosnobs will recognize the leet meaning behind the move it immediately sorts out the uneducated lumpen such as yourself so the real purpose isnt so much to be true to biology but to be true to multiple highly obscure rules of biology so only the very best of the very best can recognize what exactly they did there and why
  what you dont actually know because youre uneducated swine is this    bird color schemes are commonly repeated in nature among relatively unrelated species of modern birds and theres reasons for this those same reasons existed in the cretaceous so we can expect those exact same color schemes to have been repeated in early dinosaurs as well    but more importantly you didnt know that and by incorporating it into their art they had the opportunity to laugh at your ignorance and lord their superior knowledge over you    as i have done for them by proxy haha take that you uncultured dullard
  definetly there are a few artist that capture color really well like julio lacerda and douglas henderson but its kind of an annoying trend even projects that are generally great like saurian pull this shit aswell with their osprey dakotarapor even if it is visualy stiking
  uh sure      no there are for sure similarities shared with animals that fill similar niches but very rarely do they ever repeat each other identically   also a lot of these dromeosaurs  other dinosaurs this happens to are considerably larger and lived in different enviorment like that deinonychus how exactly does basing a 3 meter long terrestrial predator that lived in swampy floodplains copy pasing the color scheme off a tree dwelling animal from central american jungles wise in anyway at this point im convinced youre trolling me
  very rarely do they ever repeat each other identically  yes this is exactly what i mean    people that study birds disagree with you  youre welcome to your opinion but frankly paleoartists arent flocking to your door to hear what you think in fact theyre just laughing at you for disagreeing with people that know much more than you thats their real hobby laughing at you for not understanding their scientific accuracy it makes them feel better about themselves you can understand that since youre playing the exact same game just without any of their knowledge
  do you believe tigers and zebras both have stripes because theyre both 400lb predators living in the jungle    no    then what makes you think bird colorations have anything at all to do with their size or ecological niche especially when its widely agreed that the patterns are generally a detriment to their survival rather than a useful adaptation
  at this point im convinced youre trolling me  you troll yourself i just stand back and watch
  a 3 meter long terrestrial predator that lived in swampy floodplains  then we have this silliness    theres a handful of mistakes right there  its wrong to assume that a paleoenvironment was homogeneous in time the swampy floodplain of today is next months dry desert savannah not only did the environment change seasonally but it changed over the millions of years the animal existed and for the most part fossils dont record those changes swampy places dried out and then flooded again repeatedly became forests and then deserts and then grasslands over and over your understanding of climates doesnt allow for this    environments changed in space perhaps that swampy floodplain you picture was located next to a desert or a forest or the foothills of mountains and the animals actually lived there most of the time but for whatever reason migrated once and died    or perhaps they always lived somewhere else and their dead bodies were washed into a swampy floodplain    or more likely they lived in many different environments that both were and were not swampy floodplains but happen to be found in swampy floodplains because thats where almost all dinosaur fossils are from not because every dinosaur ever lived in the swampy floodplain but merely because thats where animals were most likely to be preserved as fossils upon death    you make a lot of assumptions about the animals paleoenvironment and thus its niche but no scientifically literate person would take any of your assumptions very seriously and they shouldnt theyve extremely shaky assumptions to make
  take your lithium      thats fucking bullshit if someone found a new bird that was part of a brand new order and asked you to draw it from an xray of the body with no other information youd have to flat out guess the coloration bird colors and patterns are absurdly diverse for all we know the ancient maniraptorans were mostly flat colored like ratites tend to be if you pick any one answer and claim its the right one you better have real evidence which you dont
  thats fucking bullshit  it is and it isnt    the artists are absolutely correct that bird coloration fits a number of patterns that repeat with very little actual variation theyre also correct that these same patterns have been found in nonavian dinosaur feathers    its bullshit because we have no way of knowing which dinosaurs had which patterns so thats guesswork    its also bullshit because the bird patterns artists use are a direct response to people such as yourself complaining about shrinkwrapping the subtlety you and the rest of /an/ dont get about the shrinkwrapping rebellion is it isnt literally just about stretching skin tight over bones its also about things like colors and ornamentation that cant be deduced from fossils so with your complaints you have given artists license to guess about how things looked and theyve run with it
  take your lithium  to a retarded person a genius seems insane
  why do all dinosaurs look the same  ok well make them look different then  theres no evidence they all looked different  ok well poke your eyes out with a no4 pencil and call it a day
  cut this argument from authority shit you havent presented any example of this bieng a wide spread trend in bird or even animal coloration in general youre being that kid whos dad totally worked at nintendo and knows all the viseos games uh huh      do you believe tigers and zebras both have stripes because theyre both 400lb predators living in the jungle    wtf is with this terrible example we have somewhat of an idea of why both these animals look the way they do since the stripes of tigers function as camoflauge for their enviorment as fo zebras to my knowldge their somewhat of a natural anomaly ive seen the whole dazzle hypothesis being thrown around for years but ive also seen another hypothesis rise in popularity with the stripes functionin as protection against blood sucking african flies since for some reason they avoid zebra like patterns not sure about that whole thing im not obsessed with zebras point is this example doesnt even make any sense since they arent what im even fucking talking about plenty of animals have stripes for various reasons though to my knowledge most seem to work as camoflauge zebras themselves being outliers    what makes you think bird colorations have anything at all to do with their size or ecological niche    idk its not like animals adapt to their enviorment and develope camoflauge as to remain unseen thats just stupid what its not like you see animals like civets  ocelots or jaguars developed certain patterns due to them being useful to them and raising their chances for survival/reproductionthats why birds of prey are beight red with purple faces owls and birds of prey needing to blend into their enviorment and developing camoflauged patterns nah thats fucking stupid my daddy from ninte er i mean harvard told be birds only come in like 6 flavors and never deviate from that
  you havent presented any example of this bieng a wide spread trend in bird or even animal coloration in general  nor do i intend to that defeats the purpose of gloating about things i know and you dont   pay attention  its not like animals adapt to their enviorment and develope camoflauge as to remain unseen  do you seriously suggest birds developed bright fucking colors in stunning patterns as camoflauge
  terrible come back try again        its wrong to assume that a paleoenvironment was homogeneous in time the swampy floodplain of today    uh im not super familiar with the cloverly formation itself but to my knowledge we have plenty of fossilized evidence to suggest it was a floodplain/sawmpy enviorment i also know thereve been redwoods found there aswell iirc plants fossilize too  you know    the swampy floodplain of today is next months dry desert savannah    seasons were generally less extreme in the mesozoic and even today we dont see swapms turn into fucking savanahs in the course of a month well we do but africa isnt an accurate representation of most of the worlds climate much less the worlds climate during its history    became forests and then deserts and then grasslands   mesozoic grassland  xd ok vig voi alright    not because every dinosaur ever lived in the swampy floodplain but merely because thats where animals were most likely to be preserved as fossils upon death    yeah no one is arguing against that but guess what deinonychus in the infinite defiance of all likely hood was one of those dinosaurs how weird    you make a lot of assumptions about the animals paleoenvironment and thus its niche but no scientifically literate person would take any of your assumptions very seriously and they shouldnt theyve extremely shaky assumptions to make    you make a lot of asumptions for someone whi doesnt know plants can fossilize      the artists are absolutely correct that bird coloration fits a number of patterns that repeat with very little actual variation     i know right because there are so many harpy eagle clones out there whats more if what you were spewing were true wed see the same 10 to 16 bird pattern repetitions which isnt a thing bird patterns are extremely diverse sure some look similar but those can be attributed to similar survival pressures
  nor do i intend to that defeats the purpose of gloating about things i know and you dont   pay attention    that sounds like a fancy way if saying im making shit up as i go    do you seriously suggest birds developed bright fucking colors in stunning patterns as camoflauge   ok youre trolling me for sure
  seasons were generally less extreme in the mesozoic  lol  bird patterns are extremely diverse  birds are extremely diverse  hose can be attributed to similar survival pressures  lol 20    im still waiting for you to learn why birds evolved bright colors and bold patterns protip it wasnt survival pressures those are things that hinder survival not increase it this is freshman biology here what do we call a trait that hinders survival and evolves anyways
  ok youre trolling me for sure  its a serious question and some very serious biologists have answered it for you    why the fuck would an animal evolve bright colors that make them easier to see and kill
    lul    ok ok ok imma let you in on a little secret but most extremely colorful bird/animals are generally pretty small or live in isolation its why crows arent as colorful as birds of paradise and such i know cassowaries are a thing aswell but they live in dense jungles which are easier to hide in and to my knowledge arent subject to major predation but most importantly they are not predators which is not the case with birds of prey which have selective presures to not be seen 10 miles away and lose any chance to predator and its not like theirs huge variations between birds with extravagant sexual displays right guyd why do you think snow owls are white why do you think nightjars are the way they are    but idk why you keep toing this line both sexual and natural selection are pressures animals face nobodys argueing againts that so i fail to see how this means that its logical to copy paste a color scheme from a modern bird that looks a certain way due to extremly variable sexual pressures and very real selective ones to an animal that had different pressures due to being larger ground dwelling and predatory imagine youre given the skeleton of a supposeddly newly discovered terrerstrial predatory bird but since youre convinced birds come in like only 6 flavores goyim well you basically rip off a harpy eagle and call it a day but plot twist you were actually given the skeleton of a seriama but its ok you were totally right to low effort copy paste an animal thats suited for another lifestyle its not like seriamas tend to blend into their enviorment oh   wait

  but idk why you keep toing this line both sexual and natural selection are pressures animals face  because up til now you havent mentioned sexual selection youve only mentioned survival and camouflage which tells me you didnt know the reason until i forced you to learn it    once you understand why bright colors evolved thousands of separate times in unrelated bird lineages in niches on land on water and in trees youll get closer to learning what those artists are doing    that is if you can shelf your ignorance for a moment just a moment and assume there might be something here you dont know yet    it seems reasonable every time you open your mouth youre forced to learn something new perhaps just maybe youre not done learning things yet    ill wait and see if youre actually retarded or if you can drop your willful ignorance and understand a thing
  okay so artists are actually just taking the piss that at least makes some sense  its still retarded to just literally copypasta colorations from extant birds      insane people usually think theyre the only ones making any sense checkm8 faggot
  insane people usually think theyre the only ones making any sense  thats why we call him schizoanon because hes legitimately a paranoid schizophrenic
  god i still cant believe what happened with that theatrical walking with dinosaurs movie
  thats why we call him schizoanon  actually you call me schizoanon because you legitimately hope ill go away so you can go back to pretending to be experts on a subject you dont have even a childs understanding of    its ok i understand youre retarded
  its still retarded to just literally copypasta colorations from extant birds  its not but youre retarded if you think it is
  it is because its straight up improbable and youre retarded for thinking it isnt
  hundreds of scientists and artists are laughing at you and you know it
  more offensive than the lack of feathers is the tooth row extending all the way to the back of the mouth
  we need a dinotopia movie done right not like the miniseries
  for jp i can deal with the lack of feathers for the sake of visual consistency with its own franchise pattern wise i like blue but they really messed up the subtle anatomy giving an uncanny valley feel ive defended parts of this movie but only in the sense of it having worth while elements and trying to tell people it didnt kill the franchise     but then again im a filthy defender of the star wars prequels so maybe i just have shit tastes
  would a new strike at it benafit from using more modern inspired designs sticking to what was in the books or going divergent to hilight that theyve evolved too over these millions of years
  because up til now you havent mentioned sexual selection youve only mentioned survival and camouflage which tells me you didnt know the reason until i forced you to learn it    omg stop trolling me youre insane    bright colors evolved thousands of separate times in unrelated bird lineages in niches on land on water and in trees youll get closer to learning what those artists are doing    implying bright colorations have anything to do with copypasting colorschemes to animals mich larger with different pressures    aslo what what does birds having sexual displays have anything to do with copypasting bieng accurute not only that but obligatory to be accurate also its still relatively small animals that are this colorful yes there are some exceptions but there is a reason most rattites and birds of prey are drab sexual selection only goes so far when youre being raped by a coyote and worse predatory dinosaurs had better eyesight than their mammalian counterparts which could be a reason why some animals get away with how they look and its not like this contradicts any evidence psittacosaurus and that one nodosaur show signs of camoflauge to hud frpm predators and now that were talking about known dinosaur color schemes what animal rips are those from what animal rip is anchiornis from or that orange ring tailed compsaugnathid i firgot its name but im sure you know which i mean the one thig you could pull against me is a blavk bird but its such a common and generically useful color anyway and isnt even what im talking about if you need a refresher im talking about very particular color schemes that are ripped from one animal to another which is improbable as shit        thats why we call him schizoanon because hes legitimately a paranoid schizophrenic    this actually explins a lot definetly explains his army of imaginary scientist friends
  i can only aspire ti troll at a level such as youself well gooday sir
  with the black bird in that last part i was refering to micropenisraptor
  literally hundreds of quack retards are laughing at you dont you care what they think  nope if they did some math and figured out there was a greater than 001 chance that their subject was colored just like an osprey then id take them seriously until then theyre blowing smoke and idgaf what they think
  shhh dont make fun of his imaginary friends he might go full terry and run over a glow in the dark nigger faggot
  i think it would be most ideal if james gurnei himself were to remake the designs that or base if off hus most recent work for maximum authenticiy to the original style the spec ev angle does seem a bit out of place for that and wasnt the original focus of dinotopia
  well in king kong the spec evo was mostly just an excuse to make the designs more pulpy thats sort of what i was thinking
  well that seems somewhat more reasonable but id still rather have them be the same species presented in the book
  if they did some math and figured out there was a greater than 001 chance that their subject was colored just like an osprey then id take them seriously  they did exactly that    his army of imaginary scientist friends  nobody here is going to clap you on the back for that one they all know im a dinosaur paleontologist they dont like it but they dont seriously doubt it either
  what what does birds having sexual displays have anything to do with copypasting bieng accurute  nothing whatsoever they just blow your camouflage ideas out of the water    also the insane number of very brightly colored sexual displays in birds should tell you there are particular pressures on birds to be brightly colored why do you suppose that is
  stop im done getting trolled you had your fun but its over goodbye
  they did exactly that  kekeke nope even among extant birds less than one percent of them have colorations like the osprey why dont you link me to the relevant research if youre so sure it exists
  why dont you link me to the relevant research if youre so sure it exists  it amuses me to know things that you havent read yet    not only have you not read it but you look like an ass denying it exists just because you havent read it yet    thats funny it always has been and it continues to be    sometimes i like to imagine your stupid face after youve spent days denying science exists only to have it shown to you i wonder how that makes you feel i think youre too dumb to be embarrassed you probably pretend you were right all along  huh
  okay you have no links nice job btfoing yourself
  this isnt exactly the first time hes done this you can always spot schizoanon by his indefatigably arrogant and baseless assertions with the steadfast refusal to ever post any supporting evidence while proceeding to call everybody else a retard and repeating his imaginary credentials which of course have also never been cited
  im new to this thread but i figured it out pretty quick im   i just wanted to find out if he was crazy but with actually useful information tucked in there somewhere or just flat out crazy hes proved himself the latter so i guess ill just ignore him now
  he is actually crazy i thought he was trolling at first when i saw him completely fuck up the definition of lex parsimoniae some months back but he stuck to his guns to vehemently and gave so much textwall gibberish that i cant believe he was just shitposting nobody who puts that much effort into weak bait and continues the ruse while also essentially trying to cultivate eceleb status can be sane
  i get the feeling hes a 4d chess level troll if so hes pretty good at riding the line between complete insanity and believability or hes just mentally ill either way it feels like im talking to an overgrown toddler
  you can always spot schizoanon by his indefatigably arrogant and baseless assertions with the steadfast refusal to ever post any supporting evidence  i almost always post proof because i love to watch you faggots shut the fuck up for a week or two when i prove you wrong    over and over and over
        i particularly like the part where i prove you wrong you shut up and then a week later youre back again pretending you knew all along what i taught you    and then trying to teach it back to me
  schizoanon  as the morrison museum anon and a genuine schizophrenic i dont like being associated with that faggot doesnt he pretend he used to work at dmns or something
  checked  he pretends hes human
  and worse hollowood seems to have a fetish now for making everything jokey and giving everyone stupid one liners becauase everything needs to be like a faggoty superhero movie which is very much the case for jw and got so much worse in jw2  this is true id would be nice to see a self respecting science fiction story about dinosaurs a high budget remake of the lost world conan doyle novel is also a good idea or even just a movie about time travel maybe something like halflife where physicists rip a hole in time to the mesozoic and dinosaurs start wandering through
  no they should turn raptor red into some dialogueless impliedthroughactionandexpression hyper realistic oscar bait movie it could work
  raptor red movie   i would even love a walking with type series with time travel hosted by robert bakker but the hollyjews are boys with horner they even had a bakker character eaten by one of the t rex in the lost world
    this would make for one of the coolest movies in recent history if done right but it would have to have actualy effort put into it and the dinosaurs should look updated aswell but the biggest challenge would be to stave off the horde of brain damaged executive jewllywood cunts from turning it into another wwd 3d
  doesnt he pretend he used to work at dmns or something  ive worked at a couple museums in colorado i graduated from mines and did my postgrad work at csu     i live pretty close to you    i dont mind that you dont want to be associated with me but i have a handicapped son almost your age so im probably a lot more sympathetic to your dreams of building zoos or museums than a lot of people and unlike most ive actually seen the barrier at the zoo you got in trouble crossing and i agree they were way too hard on you
  thanks buddy but you still make the paleo threads unbearable could you maybe not
  nah you literally only recognize me when somebody decides to argue with easily found science    all the good posts in your paleo threads those are me too
  good one maybe if you namefagged i would believe you
  ill show you sometime
can upright apes go extinct and stop polluting the planet already
  this is gonna sound really gay but i do have some hope in humanity to not completely fuck it up its not however found in people thinking theyre so special they deserve to pass on their lineage when the earth is already overpopulated with damaged bipedal apes that is not to say some people shouldnt have kids but most of them should definitely stop   inb4 hurrr ur parents made u   im not entirely grateful for them burdening me with fixing this mess of an environment or go extinct with the rest of the threatened animals    come on fellow schizo we can still contribute to making just one good thread for once its come to my attention that museums are closing down it really doesnt surprise me seeing how many museums put more emphasis on display than interactiveness and touch i would love to discuss museum design etc with ya i used to dearly want a zoo and there still might be a zoo in my future but fossils dont require feeding so ill start with displaying those
  nope those are me
  remind me to show you my fossil collection some time i have the usual stuff you can get off ebay a hadrosaur egg spinosaurus tooth various dinosaur bones a large collection of sharks teeth trilobites ammonites bryozoans rugose corals colonial corals brachiopods crinoids fish etc    im not actually schizo as you well know i am what used to be called an autistic psychopath but now is called assburgers    a while back i posted about t rex having over 50 lungs and when asked for a citation i very generously offered one    that isnt by any means the only kind post ive made but its typical of what i contribute i only argue with people that deny basic science thats easily found online even then my purpose is to teach them some people wont learn unless you either spoon feed them or make fun of them though
  im not actually schizo as you well know  yeah youre not cool enough to hang with the cool kids   i guess theres not a lot to talk about museum design especially if the emphasis is taken from display to touch and interactiveness the idea of putting together an accurate teaching curriculum is really daunting though i can have the best fossil petting zoo in the world but i dont want to fuck up and teach something outdated disproven or just plain wrong what do you think some good attractions would be btw i can think of tons of things that fit in your hand that you can let visitors handle with supervision but i mean big shit like whole mammoth tusks as attractions
anyone know how competitive the summer jobs at the royal tyrrell are
  how accurate to the novel would you want it to be because theres been several very faithful movie adaptations over the past century the problem was they werent very good because sir arthur conan doyles the lost world is a fundamentally generic safari narrative with extremely underwhelming prehistoric fauna which is a fault of both conan doyle only giving a shit about paleontology of the british isles and the fact that it was written relatively early in the history of the field so there werent many species to choose from in the first place the main interesting animal encounters are a pterodactylus an iguanodon a miniature horse a megalosaurus and an irish elk and a bone thrown to north america with the stegosaurus

i miss this game
  just play it  i lost it  emulator
  what was so good about nintendogs it always seemed like a cheap pet sim with like 3 things to do
  how do i get an emulator
    go to homebrew general and read up what you can do you can also get desmume ds emulator and get yourself the game online
    you want /emugen/ homebrew is if you still have your original ds but lost the game
tfw cant bring myself to rev up the ds and see them after over a decade despite just being pixels and lines of code  apparently if you dont play for a long time the dogs wont be at your home and after a little while theyll return all happy and might even bring a gift im not worthy of even that much
  is it true that the dogs run away or is it just a myth
  myth  they just get hungry thirsty and dirty and dont listen to you very welk until you clean them uo and build up a routine again

are corgis a good breed
  i have kind of a weird problem my dog knows hes not allowed to shit and piss in my room and will let me know when he needs to go out but if hes in any other room in the house hell just pee or poop wherever without letting me know at all ive given him treats almost every single time he goes outside but he still hasnt learned and its been a few months how else do i teach him to not go inside
how bad will a labrador shed if i brush him everyday with furminator
  how old is he generally theyre terrible at holding in their pee and shid until theyre 46 months of age depending on breed     in general dogs will generally avoid peeing and shitting where they feel at home the issue is either that hes too young or he doesnt recognize the places where he shits and pisses as his living space to counteract the latter issue after cleaning up his mess play with him in that spot and/or general area or put some food for him there thisll help him associate the area with living space which any dog naturally does not wanna poop or pee in
ive heard people say that if you feed your dog a raw diet food there should be one day a week in which you dont feed them at all just give them a bone with some meat and thats eat for the entire day supposedly this is so their digestive system will rest is this true they say this comes from the fact that wolves dont eat every single day but i have no idea seems a bit too extreme for me especially for dogs who excessive a lot daily
is there an app on which you take a photo and tells you your dog breed    i just dont want my yorkie to end up being a morkie
  depends on what kind of dog you like and how well they fit your needs i like them      make sure you are supervising him when hes in other rooms and take him outside on a schedule or whenever he starts acting like hes gonna go in the house potty training is a twopronged thingyou use management to prevent accidents indoors and reward for going to the bathroom outdoors also this       labs are pretty heavy shedders brushing everyday will prevent a lot of that hair from getting on your floor clothes etc but dont expect no dog hair      anon puppies are ridiculously difficult to phenotype compared to adults even for a trained human eye im sure there are apps that can guess butthats really all it is if you wanted to be sure your yorkie wasnt a mutt you should have just bought a purebred dog from a good breeder
  mutts are good dogs
this biting as a puppy is driving me nuts the yelping and ignore method no longer seems to be working eventually hell calm down and stop though  getting him to ignore the chinchilla is going to be one hell of a task especially since the chin now barks at the dog because she feels threatened
not much of a pet owner myself but is husky a good pet and if not are there similar races of dogs that are easier
   but is husky a good pet  that my friend depends on you huskies need a lot of excercise work to do and assignments to be happy if you give them lot of time and attention they are good dogs if you keep them locked up in the yard all day or dont walk it for a couple of hours a day it will get restless and might not be a great dog ive heard they are quite stubborn and can be hard to train if you never owned a dog before maybe a samoyed might be easier
  teacup dogs  kill yourself for encouraging this large scale suffering
  yes they are good dogs if you can meet their needs which the average person cant they have very high energy requirements are escape artists and prone to killing small animals if you can walk with them daily have a large secure yard and dont leave them unsupervised with small animals ie cats then go for it    samoyed are good too with slightly less energy but they have the same problems prey drive and stubborness youll also need to brush them thoroughly at least twice a week to prevent the fur matting huskies shed a lot but arent prone to matting and they bark a lot    maybe look into eurasier and keeshond if you want a wolfy looking dog but with less intense energy requirements
im getting her a new bed for christmas does your dog recognise and get excited when you bring them gifts    my good girl seems to understand
  well other than pugs which i agree with you what issues do other small dogs have
is there a breed thats chill like a basset hound but is on the smaller end of medium size like 2530 lbs
how hard is it to find a male of the same race for a non pedigree female  id like to make my shiba reproduce
  i have the same issue only my dog pisses right in front of me he knows not to piss on my bed which he is now banned from or the living room but he legit peed right in front of me then ran off into his den hes 2 years old and ive had him for about 3 or so weeks now so he should be accustomed to the house now
after a lot of research i found that a greyhound would suit my lifestyle best picking up this guy friday im very excited it will be the first dog ive had completely on my own
  why do greyhounds always look so nervous
  serious question  my dog is deaf becoming blind and now has a failing liver  where is the brain in a dog or the softest spot on a skull i cant find a good image on google  i just want to put him out near his favourite hole when the suffering becomes too much
  hello friends can someone tell me what breed of dog this is
  brown recluse
  please please please someone answer this ive heard the exact thing several times before
  golden retriever  maybe australian shepherd
  golden and border collie mix
  what a cutie i think a greyhound will be my next dog too
  fucking hate coyotes
  it takes time for them to learn and have the self control to apply what theyve learned repuppy biting    sometimes yelping can just excite puppies more but youre on the right track with ignoring him he bites and you become a boring tree that doesnt move speak or look at him until he calms down after a few seconds of nice behavior you resume play for especially persistent puppies you may need to also leave the room for 10 seconds or so longer if needed to teach the same thingfun stops when you bite humans too hard just be patient and consistent hell grow out of it and youll get through this
  thank you for the picture shes a cutie      maple seems to know when something is for her and she does get excited when i tell her its for you shes so cute      3 weeks is not that long he may need more time to adjust to your home instead of looking at it like he knows not to do x consider that hes not quite used to his surroundings or you and just needs to get more accustomed to the routine dont punish him for peeing in the house or else he may just learn that you get mad when you see him pee instead manage him like you would a puppysupervise and restrict his access to areas take him out often and create a schedule and reward for peeing outside it can take some time just be patient      awesome anon post some updated pics when you get him      probably a mutt looks a little english shepherdish but hes more likely to be a retriever  border collie or aussie mix      rude
zeus has been adjusting to me extremely well considering i got him less than a month ago but sometimes it seems like he gets flashbacks to when he was abused he runs away really scared when he does things that i dont appreciate like jumping on the couch or peeing in the house how do i assure him that im not going to hurt him while also not being so light where he thinks hes able to do whatever he wants
  nice
  pretty obvious that dog is nervous because someones grabbing its asshole but i agree they generally tend to look that way maybe a race thing great danes has a tendency to nervousness/anxiety too and theyre pretty closely related
  poor buddy my old dog had the same as we got her from a rescue centre she had obviously lived in a house with no garden before and would hold her pee in even though she now had a dog flap she used to run away whenever she farted so she obviously was beaten for farting  i would just carry on being assertive with zeus and over time he should gain trust
sleepi dog
who else /monochrome/ pupper here
  long boi
  extra sleep
dog just gave birth to four pups one is lethargic and cant even crawl or try to suck milk what do
  pretty dog
  feed him at the exact place where he pissed/shat next time it happens and to kill two birds feed him by hand piece for piece and pet him the whole time this will make him realize that the place he pissed at was his home and dogs do not like to relieve themselves at home and feeding by hand will foster closeness and cement you as the source of everything good aka food closeness will help also do not let it come so far that it climbs the couch or does other things you do not want disrupt and prevent unwanted behaviour before it happens
i had to say goodbye to my cutie yesterday i felt like i should share her here
  had to say goodbye    i dont get this line unless the dog is screaming in agony im not putting it down
tips for high prey drive   i have a new gsd hes about 1 year old and he goes crazy near cats and chickens which i have both of my two other dogs are very chill near my cats and chicks but he tries to charge at them whenever he have a chance it will break my heart to give him away hes first owner gave him away before he was 1 yo and i dont want this dog to keep changing families
  nvm hes dead just buried him
  you need to desensitize/habituate the dog to the animals meaning have a chick and cat around at all times for a few days/weeks pet them hold them into the dogs face let them sleep close by eventually the dog will stop going crazy
  not him but my old dogger had cancer for a long time and one day she was just laying there paralyzed on the ground and that was when we had to get her euthanized lived a long 14 years though but was a dachshund mutt so she had back problems  tldr its better to euthanize them when theyre suffering instead of letting them live on in agony
  instead of letting them live on in agony    who defines whats agony here you can see dogs with their hips and legs crushed by a car accident and they still jump around and want to play until they die from the injury i do not think dog pain works like loads of people think it does im not killing my dog to the very last minute and when i decide i will im shooting her myself at home after ive fed her all the crap she always wanted to eat
  youre the worst    dog wont eat shitting itself cant play fetch make sniffs or do anythjng it likes but its quiet and still tries to wag its tail when it sees me so it must be happy ill just let it exist until its literally begging for death then ill put it down    euthanasia is about the dog not about your selfish ass
  youre the worst euthanasia is about the dog not about your selfish ass    go fuck yourself i see animals being put down more often for financial reasons than for anything you described
  let me quote you      unless the dog is screaming in agony im not putting it down      if you really find it easier to watch your dog continue to live in pain rather then give it a quick easy end to what im sure was a long and very loving life your priorities are whats best for you not the dog    euthanasia for financial reason isnt okay if its my dog needs a surgery but i dont want to pay if its someone who simply has no money and the dog is suffering i think that euthanasia would be the kindest thing i would question if that person should have a pet in the first place but thats another debate
  based and greenpilled  also referring to putting animals down with the euphemistic and innacurate animals cant consent word euthanasia really activates my almonds
  its better to say goodbye a week to early than a day too late advice my vet gave me when i put my dog down last month he was still active eating well and generally happy but it was obvious he was on a downward slope and not going to get better my family waited too long with my childhood dog he was declining then one day he fell over and started wailing he had been okay the day before but id give anything to put him down a week earlier so he didnt have to spend his last few hours in agony
        you know the movie about the aussie who cut off his own arm when he was trapped in the aussie wilderness something similar happened to me i fell into a hole in the rock and snapped my calf the pain made me pass out some time later i woke up how long i was passed out i could not tell and the leg had swollen 100 its size i barely managed to make a tourniquet and stab my leg to relieve some pressure to get it out of the rock then i crawled back 16kms to the road with an open fracture i guess you can imagine the pain during all this time and despite all this pain i never gave up or thought about death being somehow better i do not think dogs wish for death because of that     just this summer i saw a 13yo dog jump out a window and snap both her knees after surgery she developed a nasty infection the recovery is still ongoing but all summer this dog was bed ridden and would be driven/rolled/carried to the dog park by her owner there she would lay in the grass and watch the other dogs play waging her tail and having fun being greeted by the other dogs most owners would have euthanized her instead of shelling out the 5k for surgery for such an old dog im not saying i would never mercy kill my dog but im saying i do not think that most euthanasia cases qualify as that
  f a t d o g o n s a n d  a  t    d  o  g    o  n    s  a  n  d
  quality of life if its not there why make the animal suffer
  quality of life if its not there    thats completely arbitrarily defined by you
  it may be entirely defined by me but its still based upon the suffering of the animal
  poor thing     f
  keep us updated i really hope you manage to give little zeus a good life    youre a good guy anon
  heres the thing though a dog lives entirely in the moment they dont think about tomorrow dont think man i feel like shit but at least im at the vet so ill be feeling better soon a dog with cancer doesnt understand that hes undergoing treatment and might feel better soon he just knows hes felt crappy for the past 5 months and thats just his life now    so if its something where the dog has a high chance of recovery of course but to me if the dog is feeling mostly sick and only a little okay and they are elderly it doesnt make sense to drag that on for as long as possible just because you arent ready to say bye
  i need some help so my dog ate like 6 herseys milk chocolate kisses he weighs about 30 pounds so given how little cocoa is in hersheys and the number he ate should he be alright asides from maybe a little sick
  dumb cunt we put down our dog recently we delayed it for as long as we could until it felt inhumane to keep her around any longer the vet said that that if you cant list 5 things your dog currently loves then its probably time for them to go ours was a 16 year old maltese who was incontinent deaf blind nearly anosmic had growths on her skin had rotting teeth never left her bed couldnt run couldnt play and no longer wagged her tail there was absolutely no reason to pretend that she was still enjoying life she probably had pretty bad arthritis at that point too
my buddy got diagnosed with lymphoma today and his prognosis isnt good     what can i do to make him happy for a little while longer
  maybe a whole chicken rat rabbit salmon just something with fur and bones to shredd
  had rotting teeth    well there i was almost thinking about giving a fuck but then you just show that you aint giving a shit about your dog anyway btw pic related is a double merle dog born deaf and blind
anybody else have a racist dog whenever mine sees a german shepard he goes on full alert and has to be coaxed to stop howling at them
  he might get a tummy ache but milk chocolate contains relatively small amounts of theobromine compared to dark or unsweetened chocolate so he will be fine if in doubt consult this 
looking for advice for a bit of a weird problem i adopted a 3 month old puppy about 3 months ago and to this day she will not go for a walk alone if i bring a friend/family member along with me or go alone with a second dog she will walk normally but as soon as it is 1 person 1 dog also tried getting other people to walk her alone to make sure it wasnt a problem with me she just sits and refuses to walk and pulls really hard to get home ive also tried driving to places she is unfamiliar with so she cant pull to home but all she wants to do is get back to the car what do
      so his first night went very well hes settling in nicely i think everyone please say hi to boone
he did this shortly after arriving so i think hes comfortable he was actually homed once already but then returned apparently he didnt get along with the other dogs and the couple who got him originally really wanted a female instead either way his experience in a home before is benefiting me greatly no accidents or anything yet
hes a sweet guy so far
        what a handsome boy quality posts anon and congrats
dog wakes up and walks over to me  take a big whiff from the top of his head  why does it smell so good
fuck those people who post dog abuse webms seeing that shit ruins my whole day
looking into getting a new dog im looking into a rottweiler a neo mastiff or a newfoundland  redpill me on these breeds
  newfoundland  fucking adore those thing newfoundland stronk  i dont know the first thing about them i just get all warm and fuzzy inside when i get to meet one
rub my dogs head  he holds my hand in his mouth almost like hes pushing it away  rub his back and anywhere else  just pants and wags his tail  does he just not like getting pet there or
  the sick fuck raping his german sheperd is literally the worst thing ive ever seen on the internet  just thinking about it ruins my day
how do i deal with my dogs extreme separation anxiety he just starts pissing all over the floor when someone leaves and runs around the house whining and howling i seriously cannot handle this i feel like im trapped in my house because if i leave hell tear shit up and stain the carpets
i know you you guys hate questions but does anyone have a husky/s any tips on training im training her not to pull on leash and shes being difficult i knew she was not gonna be easy to train and i refuse to give up she was adopted when she was a year and a half old sucks not knowing her past as she was a truck stray anyone have any experience adopting dogs around that age    sorry about the blogpost
  my dog hates most pitbulls kinda funny
im getting a poodle next year how do i groom it     ive owned dogs before but never anything that needed such complex care im going to take it into the groomers but id like to know how to properly maintain inbetween visits
tldr probably gonna adopt this greyhound black labmix what should i expect    i was planning on getting a greyhound next year after i pay off my student loans due to the fact that theyre low maintenance widely available and are cool with being alone i have a roommate and gf who dont mind helping out and dont mind paying for a dog walker but i still got a full time job  commute    today at the shelter i volunteer at i met this qt greyhoundblack lab mix stats    125 y/o  25 ilbs  impeccable leash manners literally no tugging went wherever i led her  was comfortable being pet and chilling with humans but didnt bark or jump when approached unlike 99 of shelter dogs who either go full autistic retard if you come within 5 ft of their cage or cower in the corner  didnt mind being picked up  no piss or shit in her cage did piss outside when i took her so probably trained    i was gonna go back tomorrow and volunteer again to make sure this wasnt an anomaly or she was drugged or some shit assuming that isnt the case    have any of you fags ever owned a labgreyhound mix and if so what can i expect i realize every mix can come out with a variety of traits but id like to hear your experience  considering shes at 125 years i can reasonably anticipate that if anything shell only get more chill with time correct  since greyhounds spend an average of 18 hrs per day sleeping do you think 1416 hrs would be reasonable expectation
  i remember as a child when my brother and i would open presents wed also wrap a few toys/treat boxes for the dog    the first time we handed one to her she just sniffed it and gave us that confused head tilt when my brother and i started opening our presents she seemed to understand and tore the wrapping paper off the rope then got excited and whipped it around a bit    no clue if she actually made the connection that we were exchanging gifts and these were hers just as those were mine but at the very least she seemed to make the connection between the tearing off the paper  get a prize ritual
  dogs always smell really good after theyve slept for some reason
  everyone is shitting on you but i agree anon i reject the idea of compassionate euthanasia as a whole youd also be surprised how quickly old dogs with cancer die on their own just give them narcotics or whatever other drug to let them be comfortable in their final days and die in peace
  youre correct there its obviously hard to measure but dogs do not experience pain in the same way as humans they do still experience some kinds of pain but there are ways to tell some dogs will whine and other more stoic breeds will just tremble but you can tell
  steroids gave my dog energy and appetite in the weeks before he died when he had cancer and obviously give him his favorite foods and do fun activities too sorry to hear about your friend
  hello boone what a sweetie
  some dogs dont like getting touched on top of their head      unfortunately as huskies were literally bred to pull it can be difficult to break them of a leashpulling habit look up kikopup leash walking videos and try some of her methods keep at it and be patient it can take some time to replace a heavily ingrained pulling habit with good leash manners      brush/comb at least once per week to prevent tangles either use clippers yourself to clip the dogs coat to the length you want every do often or pay groomers to do it baths occasionally as needed a lot more fancy grooming can be done on poodles but it isnt actually required all that you need to do is prevent tangles/matting in the dogs coat and keep it clean      hes adorable congrats on your new buddy
so my wire haired dachshund going on 14 years old took a nose dive off the side of the bed in a botched jump and landed face first just a couple hours ago  she broke one of her bottom fangs in half and knocked out one of those tiny front teeth the bleedings stopped but shes been quivering ever since and constantly licking her chops  any advice i unfortunately dont have a lot of money for an expensive vet bill for such an old dog anything i can do to help her out
  surrender your dog to a family that can afford to keep a dog if you cant afford a trip to the vet you cant afford a dog period
what breed is this dog
  looks like a puppy breed guessing based on appearance is already a crapshoot but phenotyping puppies is especially difficult those ears remind me of a papillon but it probably isnt do you have any better pictures of the dog from different angles and a clear shot of the face that will help with guessing but again any guess is just a guess the dog is likely a mutt of several different breeds    if you really want to find out breed/mix here you go 40 off the most accurate breed dna test on the market 
  oh i have the money its just savings and we both know how expensive dental can be plus shes really old ive taken her to the vet plenty over the years and kept her up on her shots but it made a lot more sense when she was young and i was looking long term  its just a sad fact that shes old and more than likely doesnt have more than a year or two left of life  so yeah it just doesnt make logical sense to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars to get her treated when that money could be spent on my much younger cat who is only two if he ends up needing it
  thats kind of an unethical way to look at it    the dog is treatable you have the money i dont feel like it because shes old is a shitty excuse you made her a lifelong commitment to take care of her when you chose to have her for your pet take her to the goddamn vet you monster
tfw your dog shakes its head and you hear its ears flapping
        for anyone reading and wondering here thats why you do not let your dogs on the furniture dog jumps down on slippery hardwood floor  bad fall  speards legs  hip dysplasia triggering injury here we go    broken teeth need a vet asap its probably hurting like hell and may keep the dog from eating and drinking
  due to the fact that theyre low maintenance    i would question that do you have a safe open space for it to run that about 200x100m big at least what about the prey drive what if it sees a cat/hare/deer there
  my dog despises large fluffy black dogs like bernese mt dogs
  youre kinda disgusting dude tf is wrong with you
  youre getting a lot of shit but youre completely right the dogs 14 years old and spending a ton of money on a dog that may not even live another year is entirely nonsensical   theyre right in that you have to bring it to the vet though maybe its something easily fixable if its an expensive fix no vet will look down for you for getting an old dog put down     to all the people going on about how a pet is a lifelong commitment youre humanizing the animal ethically theres nothing wrong with putting an old animal down if it would be too costly to keep it alive he could give it away sure but how do you think thats gonna work out hey anyone want my old dog by the way if you dont get her teeth fixed for a couple thousand she will live in agony
so do you like the dogs fights
  pupper need bellyrub          ccute
  rottweilers are really good all around dogs but damn they are fucking uncontrollable rascals as puppies in my experience
  
  ill never understand people who spend thousands of dollars on their pets yeah it sucks when they die but if you really care about dogs overall that money would be better spent helping multiple animals  like spend thousands to get a dog treated for cancer or get the dog put down donate to your local shelter and adopt a new dog that needs a a home  shit i knew a couple whos dog had a tumor on its lower spine that was inoperable and made one of its hind legs go limp and instead of putting the dog down they got the leg amputated for crap tons of money and extended its life by less than a year  meanwhile some healthy dog somewhere who had years left to live probably got put down in a shelter because no one adopted it  i dont know maybe i just love dogs in a different way i try to look at the bigger picture more often than not
  this is a really weird request but does anybody have that picture of a dog at night with a stick in its mouth in front of a bunch of guys posing the dogs hair is sticking up on end and its eyes are glowing from the camera flash    its got the same energy as this image
  lebbit will suit you better
  i am not suggesting he give the dog away i do think its unethical to put down an animal thats treatable with good prognosis and quality of life when its fully within your capability to acquire this treatment if he couldnt pay for it yeah maybe euthanizing might be the best choice because trying to rehome an elderly animal in agony is justnot gonna work out well as you pointed out but anon said he has the money its not about humanizing the animal paying for vet care is your responsibility when you have an animal
  while i understand your logic about the greater good it isnt just about the greater good when there is an animal in your care that specific animal becomes your responsibility dogs and humans form strong particular bonds with each other im not trying to equate the two exactly but imagine using that same logic for a human family member my brother got cancer so instead of treating him we put him out of his misery and my mom adopted a new child in need of a home no dogs life is inherently worth more than any other so it makes sense to spend your money on the dogs in your care that you are responsible for and have a bond with already
zeus is a lot better than he was before but hes really scared of my mother for some reason he pees in fear when she approaches sometimes is there anything that i/she can do to help him with that i was thinking about making him a service dog for my severe depression and anxiety but now im starting to second guess it after everything with my mother    thanks man i really appreciate it    i think i have his trust for the most part he got attached to me pretty quickly
what are some beginner friendly spitz breeds    i really adore the wolf/fox like aesthetics but i read that their temperaments lean towards the more difficult side
my dog snores in his sleep should i worry 
  
how hard is it to maintain one of these before i die i want to own a huge dog lived all my life with small ones
do dogs like the smell of farts
my dog walks while she shits she squats and then shuffles forward midshit so the last piece of shit falls several feet away from the first why does she do it its annoying as fuck to pick up
  my dog turns himself in the squatting position after hes well done with the shit and then scratches it away with his back legs sometimes its just the ground but other times hes not happy unless he kicked it he has 100 white wirehair and im getting tired of having to wipe my fucking dog like hes a three year old retard      no more or less than people  they shouldnt really and there are lots of dietary choices to find one where he wont smell of farts
  shit came up and i cant adopt her regardless i guess ill just wait till next year probably for the best considering itll be much easier when im not hemorrhaging 300 a month for loans not to mention the looming racing ban in florida    by low maintenance i meant cool with being alone for the most part sleeps 1618 hrs a day im cool with paying a dog walker to let it out/give it a bit of exercise but any dog i get is still gonna be alone 510 hrs any given weekday     ive heard alternately that greyhounds need to run all out a few times a week and that theyre fine with just regular exercise id love /an/s opinions here particularly those of you whove owned greyhounds in the past either way there is a decentsized fenced dog park within driving distance so i figured id just go there at odd hours ie with no small dogs around twice a week
  and i thought the one with the dog getting beaten to death with a shovel was bad but this sounds a million times worse
  seriously  what about the one with the german shepard strung up by its back legs on a tree and skinned from the paws to the rib cage while still alive and struggling  or the one with the dog tied to the post with wire as its blasted with a flame thrower  or that one where the dog is tied to a log while having a large bit of wood rammed up its rectum
  a dog with that temperament is definitely not suited to be a service dog service dogs need to have very stable temperaments not aggressive not fearful etc because they have to be able to work in public your dog can still be an emotional support animal without any special training but esas are not entitled to public access like service dogs are in my opinion it would be unfair of you to your dog to try and take him in public as an attempted service dog as he just doesnt have the right temperament for it being so fearful
  youre probably right thats quite unfortunate
  twice a week    definitely too little say a good walk every day  a yard  run at a big dog park/beach/field every other day i can see being enough
my new pupper
who was in the wrong here    
  mostest guddest buoye/10
i live in a tiny shithole and it would be cruel to keep a dog here but im so lonely and really want a dog i even volunteered at a shelter to walk dogs for a while but i moved to a smaller town that doesnt have a shelter any ideas on how to be around dogs on a regular basis without owning one
  place an add saying youre a dogwalker maybe there are people who work and need somebody to take their dogs for walks around there
    sheps are strongwilled stay consistent and firm with training if you let up too much and coddle him hell know he can get away with things it may sound like bullshit but mine knows what she can get away with when im watching her as opposed to my husband they are smart and will constantly test their boundaries
  but hes really scared of my mother for some reason    maybe there is a reason for that never trust a woman

  so let me tell you about the jews
    pardon sir do you have a moment to talk about the church of jesus christ and latter day saints
what are the least ugly front opening terarium
    for glass ones sold at big box pet stores the national geographic ones are pretty nice pvc or wood looks the best though as far as im concerned
    zoo med ones have a single opening door instead of the exo terra double door that looks nice but can be a drawback depending on whether you like having the ability to only open half the front for maintenance
  theres already another thread
how much effort is to to care for a beardie
  i personally prefer the zoo med enclosures
  they look kinda cheap though and they have poor screening material are there any higher end low iron glass ones
  the screen actually doesnt rust nearly as quickly as the exo terra screens
  decent amount gotta make sure the humidity is right and his tank is clean most reptiles ive kept dont drink out of dirty water you need a heat source too look up some better substrates than sand and youre good their diet isnt complicated veggies and mealworms

  tilapia are food not friends
this tank is only a temp so plz no bully
  when i bought my 55g i actually wanted to only have a betta in there i was told bettas actually hate large spaces something about insecurity then i was told that was a myth this hobby is so confusing
    dont forget to join our friendly discord community          
  thats a lie said so people buy overpriced cubic 5 gallons with built in filters same with the aggression shit no shit a betta will kill a neon tetra in a 25 gal but keep a betta with rasboras and small gouramis in a 30 gal and theyd be fine
who here /aqherp/
  need more shrimp  need less bladder snails
  what are assassin snails  what are pea puffer fish  what are kuhli loaches
this thing    i slept in the day it came in the mail and sort of panicked thinking it was dead which it very much seemed to be when i opened the box the only possible sign of life when adding it to the aquarium was that it seemed to have flipped itself from landing upside down as it sunk to the bottom after acclimation and i was ready to prepare a refund request if i didnt see activity within a few hours it didnt move hide change colors or bury itself the only thing that let me know it wasnt dead for the first couple days was the fact that it would magically be in a completely different part of the tank every once and a while when i looked over to check    it initially did not have burrowing behavior for the first few weeks until then it would be content to perch in my coontaillike plants or more amusingly rest vertically on this fake red plant akin to its swordlike leaves if disturbed by the other bottomdwelling tankmates before it got used to them the response would be to hover using its gills as a propulsion system and fantail as a sort of rudder in seeming imitation to a dead leaf and relocate a humble distance away    currently it seems fairly comfortable and established although most of the day is spent buried in the sand sometimes its face will be peeking out it is nocturnal in the extreme and will refuse to become active until every single light in the room is turned off including my laptop as consequence im finding myself in bed hours earlier than normal in order to accommodate the banjo catfish which means im finally curbing my longtime bad habit of staying up until 5 am    10/10 fish hardy as hell doesnt do anything never had a fish impact my life so drastically
  its some bullshit to say they dont like open space but they can have too tall a tank as they breath air
  i plan on getting some african dwarf frogs here pretty soon i have a 52 gallon thats im pretty sure cycled now as its been breeding snails for my puffer for a few weeks im not sure if i want 2 or 3
  peapuffers are so fucking cute also love it when i see them kill a ramshorn 3x its size
the apisto fry are getting so big
  they like lots of plants and places to hide because they come from very vegetative waters but that doesnt mean they dont like a lot of space    you can get away with keeping them in smaller tanks but you haveto be on top of the water quality and giving them things to do they are hunters theyll get bored and depressed if they dont have something interesting to look at or interact with
  setting up this 55 for frogs would they do better with plants that form floating leaves or whos leaves reach the surface of the water
  they like both mine like to rest with their body out of their water for some reason
  i ordered some cardamine lyrata on ebay when i got the tank like a week ago that shit should be just what i need but could i benefit from a couple of banana plants theyre ridiculously cheap and it has lily padlike leaves
  could anyone possibly identify this plant species ive checked all of guides on local river plants and found nothing most people try to tell me its ludwigia palustris but it looks too different
  too bad they are illegal to have where i live
  slammed
  the more plants the better its really fun to watch them bite a plant by accident and try and pull it out with their hands
does anyone know what is growing on the tips of my windelov ferns
  looks like its growing new plants once they get big enough half inch or so rip them off and put them in a small open container without any water flow and a few flakes of food or a couple pond snails so they grow big enough to be planted
  that plant is pregnant
  just like  said i have them growing on my ferns leaves too
  sexually transmitted diseases are just natures attempt at doing a water change
      thanks ive seen the big versions with leaves and all on my 20gals java fern but i hadnt seen them at this small before so didnt know thats what they were just put my co2 setup into that tank too so should see them explode
when you know what you want in life and achieve it
  banjo cat are super underrated theres a species that only gets 06 inches and looks like a little bumble bee theres also these giant foot long monsters which venture into brackish water and incubate their eggs on their bellies its on my things to do before i die list to somehow collect a few dozen of pic related and breed them
not having your aquarium in the kitchen so you can feed your fish the scraps while cooking    its like you guys dont even care about your fish
  implying i dont
  nice
will a flourescent bulb in a floor lamp be enough to grow aquarium plants     it says not use more than like a 60 watt bulb
  depends on the plant plants for carpeting usually require a lot more light
  very pretty plant where was it collected from
  i would probably swap out the sponge filter for a less loud one amphibians in particular are sensitive to vibrations and dont like too much surface movement
  does anyone know if the chinese remote controlled leds controllers work with the equivalent fluval lights
  ive seen em both together today they seem to be doing fine i think they hid because my lighting was a bikelight attached to the electricity outlet and pretty bright
look at how absolutely fucked my tetra is what a survivor
  newaukum river in lewis county washington the leaves all died back and new leaves are growing
  what did that
  im guessing its fins got nipped off by the other tetras and its got a columnaris infection on its face that somehow didnt spread how does it even eat  sorry my pics and videos are so shitty idk how long to make my webms before theyre too big
  just the basic beginner plants
  you can use movavi ver 15 is a decent torrent if you dont want to pay for it you can use the crop tool to make the video smaller then in the converter you can just straight tell it what file size you want the export to become   its how i made this webm  
  i just used an online converter thats probably really bad or something
what is the minimum amount for a group of upside down cats i read 3 but that seems small
  what is the plant on the left
  that ones a silk plant one on the right is a windelov java fern with bits of marimo ball everywhere and a fuck ton of duckweed     it doesnt look bad for a fake plant though does it
  i had the exact plastic tree trunk does your betta like to sleep inside it as well
  sometimes
  eh it didnt look real so i thought id ask
apparently freshwater dragonets exist why isnt anybody collecting and selling these
hey lads whats wrong with my gfs fish    2 black tetras  2 yellow ones  2 gilli fish  2 koricats  the 2 yellow ones have been hunkering underneath this moss we planted a while ago  never come out to eat  rest of the fish are acting normally    so theres 2 fish constantly hiding with the rest acting normally the tank is fairly large with three plants and three pieces of decoration so its not like a size or decoration thing the water appears clean
  what are the yellow fish barbs or platies or something if your tank is large just get like 2 more cause theyre likely just intimidated by not having conspecifics
  theyre yellowish tetras
does this look like an alright tank setup i have no experience with rainbowfish
  sound like they are barbs make shure you know what you keep and how many you need of them 2 of each kind is not enough to make em behave naturally get rid of the yellows and buy some more corys and black tetras
some type of clover growing in a bucket of rain water i wonder if anyone has tried to grow this plant in an aquarium
my two year old betta just started acting odd a week ago hes barely eating and is sleeping constantly the only thing appearance wise ive noticed is that the bottom of his mouth area seems to have lost a little color but it isnt white or dramatically different looking its sort of grayish anyone have an ideas or is he just getting old hes in a well maintained 20 gallon tank with ten neons
  he could be getting old i would watch him closely over the next few days to see if anything else pops up
the hell is happening to my boy losing his colour from his body and fins  is this fin rot or some other disease    5 gal tank on his own  heated to 78 and filtered  regular water changes and nitrates are fine    hes still perky and just as active as usual
lately my tap water has been alternating between coming out at 60 and 84 ph i guess because of heavy rains    whats the easiest simplest way to simply set a bucket of 5 gallons of water to ph 7 for a planted tank
  it starts with you organize an expedition to south america and start rearing these guys
currently setting up one for the first time because of greases spirits and primer compound im fanaticaly washing my hands in fear of contamination also thinking of changing my job but off topic the tank is a juwel 70l 61x31x44cm id plan on 12 cardinal tetras as the swarm i honestly wouldnt want shrimps slugs why not dont know which other fish i need besides ground cleaner leopards cant have too many as we have a volume law per fish respective size
  depending on if you were raising or lowering the ph you would use an acid or a base sodium bicarbonate or carbonate as a base and some type of weak acid like vinegar would work
  bladder snails are the fucking bane of my existance my 20 gallon long is just lost to them ive tried everything    i got four assassins for my 20 gallon long they dont do fucking shit    arent pea puffers super aggressive i dont want to hurt my other fish    i have 8 kuhlis they dont do shit with snails
  volume law per fish  are you talking about the inch per gallon guideline or does your area have an actual law on fish    cory cats are great kuhli loaches are nice too but unless you have a large group youll never see them     id highly recommend changing up on your shrimp policy amanos are super based bamboo shrimp are cool too if you want something big
does styrofoam man still lurk these generals i really liked his tank wondering if he ever updated us
  pea puffers are super hit or miss some dont bother other and some will nip relentlessly really not worth it to get rid of snails in a community tank you could set up a 10gal for some peas and collect bladder snails from your 20 though would be endless free food
  im sure the bladder snails ate a hole in my anubias while not being effective at all at cleaning the algae off of it that pains me but they have not exploded like i thought they would a month or more ago there was 1 now i count only 4
  mine have ruined half the plants i tried planting at least the ones who established havent been ruined by them just occasional holes in leaves   when i found out it was them i started systematically grabbing them and tossing them in the puffer tank i have mts and rams horns in the same tank so i suspect thats why i havent had an explosion of any one snail
  switzerland has it tied by law   aquariums ponds    size classes and liter of volume per cm of fish length     aquariums liter per cm ponds liter per cm  1 up to 5cm 05 up to 10 2    2 up to 10cm 075 up to 20 25    3 up to 15cm 1 up to 30 5    4 up to 20cm 125 up to 40 7    and so on   also as well as volume the dimensions have to be acceptable too  length min 3x body length of largest fish  width min 2x body length of largest fish   depth min 1x body length of largest fish    plus it has to have rounded corners but well as one can argue that the isolation is already a rounding from two flat planes of glass it can be ignored it has to have an escape proof cover it may not be visible from all sides
  check the timestamps nigger and migrate your shit thread here
  thats so shitty and invasive so what does some over paid fuckboi come into your home to make sure youre taking care of your fish    its fucking switzerland too like 90 of the fish trade would die by september if it got somehow released into the wild and escape proof lids have nothing to do with how those invasive species even start    its like preventing car deaths by requiring glove boxes have a lock
  no its more or less a thingy against animal cruelty the veterinarians that would be called if anyone would suspect inhumane treatment would most likely not care about how many there are but how well they are kept  the escape proof lid is against fish jumping out of the tank and dying
first time setting up a sand bottom how did i do
  if i get 10 shrimps and 20 neon tetra in a 50 galon tank will the neons harass and injure/kill the shrimps
i got back from work and my two clown killifish died out of nowhere they were doing just fine earlier and i checked the water and it was fine too all my other fish are okay but im sad that they dropped like flies i only had them for 2 weeks
  oxalis    too small for that plecostomas 0/10
  for what purpose
  i had a pond snail tank because i didnt want to kill them sometimes i would feed them to my yoyo loaches eventually i moved the tank outside while rearranging during the summer it went pretty much dry and i just left it out on a back porch i noticed today that there are still some snails alive in it i might clean it out and bring the snails in for the winter i was feeding them just whatever scrap trimmings and veggies i had you can see how many were in there based on the amount of empty shells littering the bottom
  i knew switzerland had that retarded law about guinea pigs but id never knew theyd make a law that is just plain retarded
how well can fish take temperatures a few degrees f lower than their suggested range its getting chilly here and the aquarium temperature has dropped but i wont be able to get a heater until tomorrow
  tetras are small enough that they are some of the calmest fish you could have even in large numbers they wont cause problems and do well in any community tank in a 50 gallon you could probably go 4050 neons desu
  oh nice didnt even notice the shells i just thought it was pea gravel that reminds me i wanted to set up a small tank for breeding scuds cause they just look cool and supposedly clean better than shrimp
  for tropical fish i wouldnt go under 65 degrees farenheight for sub tropical hillstream loaches some barbs some cichlids i wouldnt go under 55 and for coldwater dojo loaches goldfish northern fish as long as the water isnt frozen its fine
  definitely warmwater fish for the most part thermometer is reading at 69f whats the maximum for dojo loaches
  dojos are fine with very low water temperatures or else they wouldnt be invasive in new york but they cant handle temps over 75 degrees for a prolonged period of time it drops their life span from 20 years to only 5 or so if kept at a temp like 80 for their whole life
rip
my cardamine lyrata arrived in very poor condition it was delayed in the mail by two days most of the leaves are melting off will it come back pic related but not mine
  get an african butterfly fish
  why they are kind of an interesting fish and i surely have room for them but all of my tanks have tons of floating plants so im not sure they would enjoy my tanks
i recently found a picture of the cutest cat ive ever seen has anyone seen a cat cuter than this one
  mine
  
do you walk your cats /an/ do they enjoy it
  my cats walk themselves
why would i walk them they get all the exercise they need catching birds lizards snakes etc
  you know someone could kill your cat while you were walking it and youd have zero legal recourse right like i could literally stomp on your cat and beat it to death and theres nothing you can do because youre walking a pest cats arent dogs
  similarly i could just shoot you with my constitutional carry firearm for being a nigger because i live in a free state
  destruction of personal property in all states  you are retarded and dont know what youre talking about
  they get all the exercise they need destroying natural wildlife for no reason    how do toxofags justify this
  i get a lot of exercise culling the local feral cat population too  funny little fact tho a collar does not make the cat reasonably nonferal
      ow the edge
  an animal can only be considered feral if away from its owner or his property
  unleashed unsupervised dogs  not pests  i really regret not trying to walk my cat when he was alive i want to if i ever get another
  i go out of my way to try and hit every cat i see with my pickup truck
  funny little fact tho a collar does not make the cat reasonably nonferal  no shit dude the cat being nonferal makes it nonferal i feel like i get what you are trying to say but spell it out for me anyway legally speaking stray cats arent even necessarily feral cats unless you are from some shithole that isnt the us then i honestly dont care what the fuck your laws are
  name a single pace on earth where that is true lol
  zero recourse  not murdering you in self defense    i know this is bait but you should be gutted like a fish just to be safe
  why would i when im rich in melanin
  a drunk college kid once kicked my pug while i was walking him my recourse was to punch him in the throat and steal his wallet while he was doubled over on the sidewalk that was a fun night and id welcome repeating the incident with anyone who touched my cat
  the average cat owner is too lazy and selfish to do this    this is why tylenol and tuna exists
  well its either this or let them roam free to destroy wildlife
my cats go outside when they like but when i walk my dog in the woods they follow and walk with us which is nice
  you get away with shooting roaming cats collar or not because its reasonable to assume that a nonferal cat is not unaccompanied in the wild
  lol
i got my cat to be okay wearing a harness and we did a few trips outside but she got too used to it and started trying to door dash so i stopped taking her out when i have my own house id love to build some kind of catio but for now inside she stays
  just let it roam outside
  can i harvest your melanin
do you fags dont care what could happen to your fucking cag when its out  heartless motherfuckers
  cats need to be free even if it shortens their lifspan and there is zero benefit to it if youre not a homosexual whose living space is inside a closet
  cats need to be free  care to explain why all other pets are perfectly fine living indoors
  dont forget to shoot his dog too if you live in a state like that the atf wont do it for you
  snap
  wow your so tough i hope when i get to highschool i can be as tough as you
  this is why we shoot cats on sight  
between the cats will be cats let them outside and i shoot/poison all outdoor cats i see i just dont know whoms is trolling whomst is it all just one ongoing shitpost with neither side being serious like pibble posting
  because other pets arent perfectly okay living indoors
  not gonna lie id suck your dick
  eh a lot of it is just shitposting but i dont doubt with both issues that there are some absolutely autistic anons that are dead fucking serious
  culling destructive feral animals is autistic
  what is animal cruelty  what is damage of property and ownership
  theyre having a larp
  in my state i can defend my property with lethal force and with no obligation or duty to retreat my pets are my property so if you try and destroy it i could legally shoot you not trying to be edgy but thats how it works in non commie shitholes
  wha
  cats arent dogs  youre right theyre better than dogs
    that is a very good way to get yourself severely injured or killed
  not by any objective metric
  m a i n t e n a n c e
  y o u  s m e l l  b a d
  that only works if your property is on your property  as soon as your property wanders onto my property its fair game as you are if you come on my property and try to start anything about it
  great subjective example stupid catfag
  can you read that was a reply to   which has nothing to do with someone or their cat being on your property why dont you go to /b/ if you want to be an edgy 13 year old
  i track my cat anybody ever hurts my cat i will burn them alive in their sleep
  if you like you wont get away with it though ive gotten away with killing lots of cats its not even illegal really and the police arent interested in investigating the loss of stray cats
  tylenol isnt an instant acting poison your cat will wander around for 30 mins of agony before it expires
  thats okay i dont need the police to handle my problems thats why i track him 24/7 in the case of him being hurt i can easily locate the person who did it and where they live
  having not one but two ocelots
  my cat doesnt care about messing with poison
  tuna makes it irresistible to outside cats
  
  why do dogfags in denial double down  to prove a non point
  ethylene glycol tastes great though
  ocelots  those are bengals i grew up having them crazy smart and athletic cats one started peeing and pooping in the toilet on his own with no training im fairly certain from just watching us do it we had to change the locks in the house to have a key on both sides because he figured out how to work every lock and every door and would escape
urgent does my puppy have parvo and what can i do to make sure she isnt dehydrated i already made a vet apt for tomorrow shes been puking for a few hours and wont drink water or eat at first it was normal dog puke but now it looks like human spit a couple ml or so every 20 minutes she does not have a fever but shes been lethargic most of the day no diahrea or bloody stool is giving a 11 pedialyte water mix a good idea shes only 8 werks old thats why im so nervous about this
  is her poo and wee normal honestly with such a young dog i would get her to an emergency vet   do you have a syringe to try and get some water in her at all have you tried different foods boiled chicken or something does she respond to you    it could be anything from something viral to a blockage either can mean she passes quickly and suddenly
  is the pup okay
      we went to the vet this morning and she was doing a lot better and the vet said it was probably worms but then she got worse and we went back to the vet and she tested positive for parvo went to the nearest 24 hour emergency care center and waited in a room for 3 hours pic related bc they are so busy her vomit started to have red spots and smells metallic they finally took her back for care basically it will be at least a few days of intensive support making sure she doesnt die of dehydration etc the vet said we caught it early and she has a decent chance at making it through but she is only 8 weeks so you never know frankly im going to be 4000 dollars in debt and i might never see her again
  im sorry to hear she has parvo but with vet care and medication she might be fine    you need to contact wherever you got her from and let them know as it could affect the rest of the litter keep us updated
  i called the resue last night and left a message she was from a litter of 9 really sad to think 8 more puppies could be going through this too as of now she is stable she stopped vomitting but she still has diahrea and hasnt eaten the vetritary medical credit card we got last night only approved us for 6000 so if she isnt better in 4 or so days i wont be able to pay for them to take care of her any more if that happens ill have to try to keep her alive at home but all i can realistically do is get some supplies at a drug store and give her subcutanaeos fluids so she doesnt die by dehydration
  i dont mean to get your hopes up but the vets gave her a damn good fighting chance and usually dehydration is what does them in    shell probably pull through anon have hope for her but if she doesnt know that you did everything you could
  i hope she makes it anon
  sorry to hear about your puppy op i wish her a speedy recovery
  i hope she pulls through she reminds me of my golden
  how about going to the vet instead of asking a bunch of random anonymous assholes on a mongolian piss fetish board    oh thats right you cant afford the vet but you have a pet anyway
  what the hell is wrong with you he did take her to the vet read the posts
update they have the diahrrea and vomiting under control with medication they fed her with a feeding tube and she kept most of it down the vet is hopeful but said to keep in mind that sometimes parvo comes in waves
  that sounds really positive shes made good progress then
she probably has ligma
update she is still doing well and making progress they are about to feed her with the feeding tube again and are hopeful that after this time she can eat on her own they said she goes through short periods of looking happy and perky between being lethargic and visibly in pain which is really really great and makes me feel a lot better
arent parvo vaccines standard procedure was your dog vaccinated and still got it or did he not have the vaccine
  parvo is a series of 3 vaccines she had the first but not yet the 2nd and 3rd
  i see wasnt aware thats how it works i always thought its just repeated  sucks hope shes gonna be ok
how is she doing now op
  the vet said this morning that she is brighter and more active she still wont eat on her own so they are still feeding with the tube but shes keeping it all down and they are getting her a lot of calories which she really needs also said the diahrrea has almost completely stopped and she will probably be able to come home friday possibly tomorrow so things are going very very well i should have another update in a few hours too
  im so pleased to hear shes doing well
take your dog to the animal er you stupid fuck
  this is very good news anon   im sorry about the debt youve taken on but hopefully now you and your puppy will have a good life together
my doggo healed from parvo thanks to cannabis oil didnt need to and pay the vet jew for putting him to sleep because thats what they do with dogs sick of parvo in my 3rd world shithole glad to hear your doggo is doing fine tho
so happy this cute puppy is doing better
new update shes not doing quite so well anymore still feeding with the tube but she is regurgitating some of it and she still has some diahrrea with a bit of blood in it they ran blood tests and her protein was really low so they are giving her a protein transfusion the vet said this sort of plateau happens a lot with parvo puplies and the protein transfusion is their go to method in this situation and it works very well so we are still pretty hopeful but probably wont be able to take her home until saturday at the earliest we were only approved for 6000 in credit and we are approaching 4000 now so if she isnt ready to come home in a few days we will have to take her home anyway hopefully that wont happen but if anyone has good resources on how to do things like give a puppy an iv and the cheapest way to get vetirinary drugs id like to be prepared to do what i can just in case
  well youre already doing a beautiful thing by having the credit approved and ready for 4k debt bless your soul hope she makes it through to make the next 15 years some of the best for you
best of luck hope she gets better
    so glad i pay hc insurance for my dog when i hear cases like this granted im pretty sure my insane grl will need hipellbowknee surgery eventually so there is that
  we were considering it but the options we saw did not seem worth it for example you pay around 40 dollars a month for a maximum reimbursement per incident of 1000 but you have a 100 copay we do have a 30 day free trial of insurance we got with adoption with a max reimbursement of 500 per incident that will help a lot with this bill if the insurance company doesnt manage to weasel their way out of it by saying the parvo was a pre existing condition or something
  you pay around 40 dollars a month for a maximum reimbursement per incident of 1000 but you have a 100 copay  what a fucking rip off you made the sensible choice with that the odds of it having paid off were incredibly low    good luck with everything hope she starts doing better again
update the protein transfusion worked very well and she is doing great interactive and almost playful with no more vomiting or diahrrea as soon as she eats on her own she can come home they said last night she licked her food but didnt eat any so hopefully she can come home tonight and if not then almost certainly tomorrow if nothing terrible happens
  4000   holy fuck where do you live and what kind of shifty fucking vets do you have
  yeah its fucked up but its around the clock intensive care by vet specialists theyre doing iv fluids and medications and lots of blood tests and such thats why its so expensive its basically a 5 day hospital stay for her
  it had to have been one of the most severe cases of parvo ever or youre getting scammed its like a general home contractor that shows up to fix a few floorboards and then starts to fuck with your plumbing and electrical system     im placing a bet on california or new york
  meanwhile a parvo shot is like what 20bx      a week in a vet clinic with a vet 24hrs on duty can easily cost that much    lessons learned for all the noobs getting a dog do not forget to vaccinate your dog in fact dont buy puppies that havent been vaccinated by the breeder already
  my dog was found wandering around on the highway with his brother and sister luckily they were found by the wife of a vet they were all nearly dead i guess i dont know who fucks around and doesnt vaccinate i got the second round immediately because i work in medicine and dont believe in the vaccinations are for the devil fucking nonsense that some people seem to fuck around with     ive lived with dogs since i was three so thats what you do dogs especially because they have some serious viruses that can take them out like running into a moving train
  good to hear fingers crossed for her
  who fucks around and doesnt vaccinate    back yard breeders
  parvo is a 3 part vaccination and she had only gotten the first one bc she was 8 weeks old
  fuck i came into this thread ready to rip into you like all the other neglectful shitbirds and you did everything right    genuinely sorry for you
  sometimes youre just unlucky i hope the little shit pulls through god knows we could use more owners that do as much
this is not helpful and unrelated but i was working at a wal mart many years ago stocking the pet aisle and an obese woman came through with a tiny chihuahua she asked me where the medicine was and i told her and she said yeah shit my dog been acting weird and shit i think ill give her heart worm medicine just in case she was obviously high or very dumb and after work i was wondering if she just gave her dog medicine at random could giving a dog heart worm medicine if it doesnt have heart worm harm it
  doubtful it depends on your definition of harm it might have had distemper stupid people probably shouldnt be allowed to have animals its like gangsters or gangsters having pit bulls only very serious trainers should deal with serious breeds yet we get pantshitting morons buying dogs from puppy farms and backyard breeders and we end up with a shitbath of problems     being unable to articulate your speech properly is a very large indication of a problem they should get a gold fish and have that thing die these are mammals and our evolutionary friends you dont deserve them if youre too stupid or disrespectful to have them
did she come home
  she came home yesterday shes doing pretty good shes on a lot of meds for a few more days and shes not eating as much as we would like her to but shes doing great and getting better by the minute still doesnt have much energy but she does play and get excited sometimes she loves chewing on her rawhide i only let her when she wont eat food for a while though i figure its better than nothing im gonna ask the vet about that next time we talk
hello i need some help i found these leaves in hay pack for my bunny i cant identify what is that and is it safe to feed it to my bunny   thanks

  looks like an eagle leaf
  dude lmao
hello /an/ i have a question regarding c02 euthanasia for rodents i have a rat thats ready to go and i have my chamber set up but what im concerned with is how safe it is for this method to be done in an apartment ill be using baking soda  vinegar to do the job and what im worried about is the gas being potentially dangerous if it seeps out of the encloser or once ive removed the lid from the chamber i really appreciate any insight on this because i dont want to see this critter suffering anymore
  isnt it supposed to be carbon monoxide when co2 builds up in the blood it becomes acidic which causes the bodily pain associated with asphyxiation
    really i was using this as a reference  from what i understand it acts as a anesthetic before the asphyxiation happens if its going to cause distress then im in a bind man
  take it from a guy who gassed a lot of rats it never quite works out the way youd hoped
  they sell devices specifically designed to kill rats quickly and humanely you can buy them at any hardware store or online
is this a pet rat you have thats suffering or just some rat   either way no its way outdated     its brutal but if you arent going to bring it to the vet smash it or break its neck itll still be more humane

im compiling a list of the oddities of the spider world at the moment i have argyoneta aquatica diving bell spider bagheera kiplingi vegetarian spider and the aracheidae family pelican spiders but i need atleast 10 for this to be a true list requirements for posting a suggestion to my list are it has to be something unique or bizarre and you must give reasoning why it should be on my list both araneamorph and mygalomorph spiders are welcome suggestions
  caerostris darwini for having the biggest nets and strongest silk    mastophoreae for their bola hunting technique    anelosimus eximius for their social lifestyle    deinopidae for throwing webs onto prey
silkhenge spiders also build really weird cocoons that made scientists guess what animal they were from for a long time but i cant find any scientific classification for them
  there are some jumping spiders which mimic ants either to avoid predators or sneak in to ant colonies to steal larvae
poltys sp and their camouflage
walckenaeria acuminata not because it does anything unique but for some reason males have a big stalk on their head like a pikmin where all their eyes are
maybe a big brain portia for their autistic plans
 damn youre right no idea how i could have overlooked these smart lads
  ant mimics ive been contemplating but also been unsure of because it seems to be a somewhat common adaptation which would make them not so odd
  i say cyclocosmia truncata the ravine trapdoor spider should count because of the shape of its abdomen
  cyclocosmia truncata  thats actually a really good suggestion dont they use their abdomen as a makeshift shield/plug for their burrow when threatened iirc
the rune on their butt is to keep ghosts out of their burrow
  so cute and chubby i wanna pet him
this is the list i have as of now thanks for the help fellas
dont forget the deinopis buddie boys  netcasting aka ogre face    also mirror spiders that make their butts into discoballs
when is it too cold to take my pups for a walk 32f here 27 real feel temp and some light snowfall cant stand them looking at me like this
  just him put a shirt on lo
  32f  0c  barely freezing    are you dumb thats totally fine when in doubt just open the door and if they go outside theyll be fine just check their paws regularly for irritation from salt and gravel in winter and cut down the fur between their toes lest snow freezes to it and causes injuries/irritation
  never if it gets cold just stay near your house so you can get back if they want back in
   dont bundle yourself up super heavily just put on a hoodie or something and use yourself as a measure if youre too cold its time to go back in
cats are fucking disgusting  i was at my grandpas house helping him with his computer and his cat walked in the room and started pissing everywhere and i literally puked  seriously why would you keep such a fucking nasty animal around to piss and shit all over the place
  it sounds like he already had toxo
cat walked in the room and started pissing everywhere and i literally puked  btfod
  why are stinky catfags so proud of how disgusting they are
  dogs dont shit and piss everywhere
  i think you mean a dog did that anon
  what a weak bitch you are that you threw up from a smell i agree cat piss reeks but to throw up from it is just fucking weak
  what makes you throw up tough guy
because your grandpa is mentally ill  thats not normal i know a bunch of people with cats and not a single one of them ever pisses outside of a litterbox
  op is mentally ill and hallucinated that his grandfather was a cat this is fact
  being physically ill from food poisoning or a virus you bitch do you get faint at the sight of blood too
  yes if theres a lot of it but i didnt grow up playing videogames so im a natural person
  based cat
  its another whinging about cat thread
  a natural person wouldnt faint at the sight of blood you fag humans are natural hunters that shouldnt be afraid of killing and skinning animals
  oh dear what a fallacy you dont know much about human history have you be honest you have obviously read very little about it
  its a fact humans used to hunt animals until the animals stopped because of exhaustion and then they killed them faggot
also they puke from time to time  fucking nasty animal around to piss and shit all over the place  i dont know either i have a parrot that shits everywhere by design try i have more control over it compared to cats and not as disgusting
  try  but fix
  your grandpa will be doing that too eventually op
puking from pee  how weak  that aside cats really dont urinate/shit where they cant cover it up its not that theyre trained to do so either they naturally prefer to keep it hidden  it sounds like that cat has some sort of condition
  they do or my sister has 2 retarded cats
itt catfags pretend cat waste isnt especialluy noxious and that their living space doesnt reek like it
  dog shit is literally responsible for 20 of water contamination
  implying that dog fags are any better
  what a dumb response and what a dumb weak little faggot you are lmao
    wow two sinks of dirty dishes lets cats on counter and just take pictures of them peeing i wonder why that cat smells everything as a litter box
    as with all pets both dont smell or destroy the house if they are healthy and the owner takes good care of them both can quickly become disgusting and develop mental issues if neglected in some way
  why do cats use everything as a toilet that smells like a toilet except litterboxes that arent scooped daily
im super stronk because the stench of cat doesnt affect me  cringe and toxopilled
  id go for the latter even outside you see cats go specifically for more remote areas to poop and if available sand or something else that can be used to cover it up  only time my cat has ever relived herself outside of her litterbox it was because she couldnt reach the litter box for some reason and with the appropriate reactions on our part she learned to just hold it as she got older
  usually the only time they dont cover it is when they want to mark their territory ifthose two cats dont have enough litterboxes and arent best of friends they might not cover it to tell the other one that this box is not for the other cat to use
  you must be 18 to post here jayden
  do you faint whenever you have your period
  one is castrated one is sterilized  dunno   fact is that they never did into litter box with litter but they did in empty i mean making it empty greatens possibility of them shitting and peeing in designated place   i guess they are retarded
  if they go outside they return home just to shit in the middle of room
also they like running glaze on bathtub by scrabbing it  id say 40 in bathtub 30 in designated litter box 30 in the middle of the room  while parrot shits 40 in cage 50 in trashcan or sink and 5 on floor and 5 on me maybe im just more responsible
  based grandpas cat btfoing op

  cats pissing out of the box is a sign of health issues usually bladderstone/crystals tell your grandpa to take the cat to the vet and stop feeding the cat dry food
even with a litterbox a cat will still be shitting inside your house in your clean living space this is why i can never even comprehend owning a cat sure dogs still shit but they do so outside where i dont have to see/smell the shit when im going about my indoor activities
  waaaah a cat hurt my feefees and i pukeeed    jesus christ faggot
  cats pissing out of the box is a sign of health issues  a sign  jesus you cat fags are over reacting retards  oh my god felix sneezed we need to take him to the vet  cats piss on things for a huge number of reasons including byt not limited to  its mad  its sad  its bored  it doesnt like the smell of the thing it peed on  some faggot came into its house  the least likely things causing them to piss on things are the ones that need to be addressed by a vet
  do you go outside whenever you have to take a shit
  i flush it immediately unlike the cat
  ha weak i have toilet outside
  dogs smell worse by default you dont walk into a cat owners house and smell a cat but you do a dog i always need to wash my hands after petting a dog because its stench is that strong cats actually smell pretty good desu
  trust me your house smells like cat
  no it doesnt thats not a thing
  na maybe youve grown up with it and dont notice it but cat stench is real and permeating
ive owned both a dog and a cat in my lifetime and can say with 100 certainty both are the worst but both are also the best
birdowners are the worst letting their birds out of the cage and shitting everywhere i cant believe people can live like that
  this is why i dont really want any animals in my house i love birds and ive been thinking since ages that i want one but i just know how much cleanup it requires and i dont have the room for it smaller birbs are better as they can fly around in a bigger cage but even if they are in there they create a huge mess and dust
  it is quite easy to train a bird to shit on demand lets say in a bucket and it is easy to make parrots notify owner about its shitting plan  if birds is perched it would do the needful on designated paper under perch  also bird shit doesnt make your house smell like public toilet  anyway for me it is much less disgusting to deal with birds than dealing with cat they like shitting in shoes or with dog imagine waking with a turd in a bag
  mess is a meme dust is not  worst part of owning a bird is that at least once it will do the needful on you
  only if the owner doesnt keep the litterbox clean       only if the owner doesnt wash his dog or cleans his house
cats started pissing on my shoes and all over the house    why the fuck are they doing this theyve never done it before since then ive been keeping them outside to stop my place from smelling like cat piss
  hygiene cats are very very susceptible to utis and if their litter box is full theyll try to find running water areas like sinks toilets or showers
  probably protest towards something new in their environment did you get any new furniture or maybe move things around
  gbto by the mater race of pets    congrats op
  could be a sign that theyre sick they will do things like that to get your attention
  did you have a stroke
  white trash keeps animal improperly  omg i hate this animal  wow just like clockwork
  when i was involved in house cleaning there was this one house the owners would let their dog piss all over the house wherever it wants whenever it wants must mean all dogs are disgusting and piss all over the place
  no it signifies nothing cat is just being a cat a an untrainable animal
  kermit an hero you fucking fruit
  not only that they go on murder sprees of local wildlife for fun cats are evil vermin that only use humans for food and shelter
  my cat kills to provide me with food i always bury the bodies in the backyard because i can feed myself ive probably buried around 15 dead robins squirrels snakes they dont stand a chance because he can scale trees like a squirrel he was born on the streets so he will never be changed
  he can always be exterminated for the good of animalkind
  he was born on the streets so he will never be changed  then kill him you fucking dindu lover
  cat eats birds  oh noo not the birds please someone save the birds  cat eats snakes and squirrel that eat birds  nooooo not the bird eaters nooo   anon decides for a lawn and pool instead of bushes weeds dead wood and a pond efectively preventing birds snakes squirrels and a shitload of insects from being able to live feed and breed  anon buys cheap nonorganic faggots haha gmo food that kills even more insects and all animals including a shitload of birds that depend on those for food  what i a human want is more important that any animal but obviously this isnt the case for people that want cats
  old cat  never sprayed in my house  never shit or pissed in my house  would tell you when he had to go out and use the bathroom then come back in  kept the field mice at bay    new cat  sometimes hell use the litter box  most of the time he wants outside to use it  if you dont let him out when he wants he shits in the bathtub instead of the litter box  if you dont let him in when he wants when he gets in he shits in the tub  afraid of the field mice and instead would rather fuck the neighbors fixed female cat all day every day and fight an old 1 eyed raccoon that lives in the woods  but at least he doesnt spray inside
  lol what a faggot
  no your parents failed at parenting and now youre a sheltered little bitch faggot
  that means the cat has kidney problems dumbass that cat is probably equally as old as your grandpa
  gmo doesnt kill pestecides do and gmo requires less pestecides than conventional organic stuff
  and that is why all pestecide companies are in gmo since jews can sell proprietary pesticides and it is more expensive
cats are for fat dumb incels who cant quite afford an escort so they get a cat
    with cats its the same like with you your mom and dad let it happen that you are a fucking pice of shitsame goes for that catcats also pissing around when there is something they dont likein this case probably being with a fucking smelly motherfucking bastard like you in the same room
    i gt the feeling that your sister is the retard probably a filthy bitch who doesnt take care of the litterbox cats peeing around outside from being very angry about something they also start not caring anymore when everything smells the same anyway
    if it smells like shitits probably made for shit
    we had 9 cats in the past and they all went outside the only time they used the litterbox was when they where inside and no one there to let em outif your cat comes home to shit for yourthink of this statement for a bit
  think of this statement for a bit  ok i did i came up with the fact that you are a lazy irresponsible piece of shit who lets their animals roam around unsupervised
    trust me and the stench isnt as strong as the dogs by default    i mean its fact is as dogowner you will always smell your dogs stench but as cat owner you wont dont get me wrong i like both but well dogs stink morealways especially by rainy days
    start growing up pussy it isnt worse than every other pet
  litter box is kept clean by everyone in family and it doesnt matter if there is litter or its empty   btw most effective to make them shit in designated spot is by reducing food i dont know how it works but starving makes their brain work  parents thought that im cruel but they adopted my technique
    untrainabledude you have no clueand for trying to sign us you have any cluemakes you a retardthere are whole cat shown everywhereyour right a cat is not like a dogslave but they can learn shit too
    dont worry most people here are retards    guys humans kill any kind of animals under ridiculous circumstances they even fuck other poor animalsshould we get rid of themanswer is yes 
    2 cats 2 characters but the field mice do you fight em yourself now
      weeeeeew dude take care of your edgesi mean the other thing are questionable but whats dumber about someone who actually confess he has to afford an escort wait that makes you probably ugly tooget a woman in the real world faggotwoman like cats btw
    supervising an animals all day when they go outsideyea dud suregod some ppl herehahah
  yeah thats why you dont let your animal out all day you fucking genius
  all this fresh fish taking the bait
                  omg stop
  cat houses smell absolutely vile no matter how clean you keep them my parents only have two cats and scoop their litter box every day and it still hits me like a freight train whenever i visit them    if you think petting a dog is going to soil your hand youre either hanging around some disgustingass dogs or are a muslim
  this  cats legit smell like putrid piss and shit  dogs smell like  mushrooms yeast  im not saying they dont stank  im just saying they stank less than vile permeating cats and the piss and shit that comes with them
dogs and cats are both fucking disgusting     pic related superior hygenic pet that actually cares about cleanliness
  dives into mud
  ur mom lol
  its yeast in the paws and ears sometimes
friendly reminder that george was the best dog

pitbulls need 2 be gassed
fuck
the same unfunny normie meme again and again
  normie  youre on /an/ litterally the most normie board you bafoon
  why
all you gotta do is spade nuter and train your fucking dogs not just pit bulls
just noticed the cute smiling pibby d
how do we solve the pit problem
honestly surprised the gsds percentage is so low most i got really fucked up by a dog stories ive heard were about german shepherds though yeah pit bulls are fucking assholes that tunnel under/break fences and randomly attack people at least from my experiences
  i guess its a matter of german shepards being a bit bitehappy but not having a pathological drive to home in on your neck like pit bulls
    theres seven pitbull threads going right now and im sure you have nothing new to add im sure you can wait for another pit in a news headline before making the exact same thread cant you
254 deaths is comparatively pretty low and actually demonstrates successful dog control for comparison 88000 americans die from alcohol use every year
  6 year old daughter mauled by pitbull for no reason   but what about this completely unrelated thing people die from
  you cant base laws on but my children the simple fact is that all freedoms cost lives pitbull ownership is not worth the cost of regulation based on the relatively low number of injuries/deaths
  yea but do those threads talk about how pit bulls are a jewish plot
  problem  kills a couple inconsequential people that were probably dog beaters anyway    whats the problem
  you cant base laws on but my children    why    pitbull ownership is not worth the cost of regulation based on the relatively low number of injuries/deaths    is it worth the cost of shelters taking public funds to prop up the continued existence of this reviled breed and waste spots that could be used for nonviolent breeds
  ze zermans vant to controhl youh noht kill youh
  why  because if youre going to outlaw things that kill a couple children a year everything will be illegal swimming running jumping sledding driving hunting walking not walking eating not eating    everything    pit bulls are at the very bottom of the list of things that kill kids somewhere behind stuffed animals and tricycles
    assuming a single 4chan thread has escaped /pol/s pubic lice
  this is the dumbest statement ive read all month and i work in washington dc    by your logic nearly every cause of death is insignificant and not worth regulating or even attempting to prevent because they all pale in comparison to the top two heart disease and cancer    lets just remove dui as a punishable offense since only about 10k/year deaths happen because of it which is a tiny fraction of deaths from heart disease    also no it most definitely does not demonstrate successful dog control you retard just because the number is small compared to a completely unrelated number doesnt mean shit    if i had a study of a new drug where only 20 people had complications whereas thousands have complications from over the counter drugs all the time it doesnt mean that drug was successful if my test group was only 100 people    likewise pitbulls represent a tiny fraction of dogs in the us its not even top 50 most popular by sheer population yet represent the overwhelming majority of fatal attacks
  pitbulls represent a tiny fraction of dogs in the us its not even top 50 most popular by sheer population yet represent the overwhelming majority of fatal attacks  there is no science indicating this is caused by genetics rather than cultural and socioeconomic factors    and there never will be any such science because most of the pit bulls in fatal attacks are actually mutts    so the number represented by the breed doesnt actually matter youre comparing a breed to a mutt
  works in dc  encourages a nanny state  like clockwork
  if it only becomes as a pit bull after it attacks someone then the statistics make perfect sense
    you realize that pit bulls are hilariously overrepresented in these statistics because when people get bitten by a dog no matter what the dog if it looks even vaguely like a pit bull they will report being bit by a pit bull
  he didnt mention anything about government regulation why do you think x is bad immediately means x needs to be outlawed by force
  he didnt mention anything about government regulation  second sentence literally suggests government regulation    kys
  you cant base laws on but my children  can i base them on pitbulls being fucking ugly though i dont care if theyre dangerous or not i want them banned because they are ugly same with pugs english bulldogs boxers and modern day german shepherds not the working line ones the ones with the fucked up back legs
  if we outlawed things for being ugly your mom wouldve died long before squeezing you out of her rotting cunt
  theres no capital punishment where i live dumbass she would have just been in jail and she actually was fyi so jokes on you
  fair enough
responsible dog breeding and making sure dogs are not given to fucking retarded idiots who dont know how to handle guard dogs or larger / more intimidating breeds
ownership licenses for certain dog breeds the same way aspiring gun owners need to pass knowledge and handling classes and psychological evaluation in my country its not that pitbulls are terrible dogs its just that pitbull owners tend to be terrible people
  muh beautifull spitz breeds muh mystical wulfs  fucking faggot
  i read this in ana kasparians voice with an additional im better than you at the end
  most i got really fucked up by a dog stories ive heard were about german shepherds  maybe they were talking about other kinds of fucking
  genocide
  there are 18000 murders a year that means for every one hundred malicious killings in the us two of those are committed by a dog that doesnt seem like much but bare in mind that includes chicago detroit nyc and any other crimeinfested shithole you can think of
  you either gotta be a real shithead to fuck up a gsd or bought attack/police dog stock     remember they are the second most popular dog in the us and pitts are one of the least popular
  do statistics on other dog attacks
  true enough pitbull is a rather ugly dog so if someone chooses this breed in particular its very likely because of its aggressive reputation pitbulls and staffordshire terriers are also hyperactive and very eager to please which their owners exploit by training them for aggression and once they do attack someone their strength and powerful jaws make them more dangerous than most other dog breeds
pitbulls need to be eradicated
  havent seen this one before kek
  dog bite fatalities    i dont think theyre reporting shit
  shoot em on sight
  take that back
  anon that doesnt seem to be a pitbull  it doesnt have the down syndrom eyes and appears rather too large in the chest/abdomen/torso though maybe on the latter point its just a bit chubby    its face also looks a little too smashed and slammed to be a apbt and a little pointed upwards    it looks more like an american bulldog which while i think is a bullydog is certainly not nearly as bad as a apbt etc    a pitbull usually refers to a apbt which was the result of taking a bulldog and crossing it with terriers and others to make a bastard fighting dog nearly as bad as the cordoba    i might be wrong about all this but yeah i dont think its a pitbull although admittedly sometimes theyre lumped in as such
  a pitbull usually refers to a apbt  lolno
  no shes an english bulldog and a anon was dissing my baby though admittedly ill never get one again shes fucking expensive as shit and her legs are already deteriorating at 2 years old she was my first dog and i was ignorant to everything about them but my husband convinced me to get her
  american bulldog  thats an english bulldog this is an bully type american bulldog
    owns an english bulldog  doesnt take the time to rotate images before uploading  filthy phone poster  and thats how we can tell youre a woman
  oh  i skimread over what you replied to and only took notice of the first part about pitbulls    sorry friend  why get a bulldog    oh  rip
    ontario banned them despite the ban probably every 1/5 dogs you see being walked down the street is a pit bull shelters just relabeled the dog as a lab mix and vets dont refuse to work when cash is being thrown in front of their face the only thing i noticed is their seemingly harder to get so meth heads and wiggers dont get ahold of them so the bite statics are a bit down however now other breeds are taking the rep for pitbull bites because theyre being sold and adopted as labs mastiffs boxers etc
  thats why bill should have created pitbull death squads to kill the beasts
    send pit bulls to tijuana to deter honduran / salvadoran migrants two problems solved at once
    the only major thing that can happen is the municipality and ospca/hs can seize your dog a dna test and breed analysis will be done if its found to be a pitbull it will be destroyed however your likely hood of being reported is slim youd have to be a serious heat bag and nearly neglect your dog tie it to your backyard tree to die for the neighbours to even call it in    though slightly amusing a dog park in my city was reopened this year and a new rule was no illegal breeds it caused a bunch of closet pit bull owners to cry out and the city seized and destroyed 13 pitbulls because of it
  so youre saying that pitbull genetics are a factor
no pet ownership humans have ruined dogs beyond repair
  essentially this if you want a dog with a reputation of increased aggression you should have to prove you are able informed and willing to take care of a dog like this
    how fucking stupid do you have to be to make an issue about your illegal dog not being able to go to a public dog park because no city has other areas to exercise dogs if theyre that stupid that they essentially turned themselves in it looks good on them
  the counterargument is that government has a duty to protect us from each other and not ourselves someone elses dog can kill my kid without him even agitating the dog i still dont like regulating dog breeds but this is the next logical argument
  the answer to that is children arent legally responsible for protecting themselves so that doesnt work
    my guess is pretty fucking stupid  there is a larger cleaner rule free dog park in the ritzy part of town the dog park in question was ironically in the low income part of my town
  they wont let me
      retards rewarding breeders for breeding animals not suited for life  how do you feel having a dog that cant exercise properly because of genetic defects ruining their respiratory system
go back to 4chan
  heard youve been talking shit
  we will never leave 
  execute humans who breed pitbulls
pitbulls should be outlawed and euthanized
  children arent legally responsible for protecting themselves    they really arent though so im not sure what your point is 6 year olds are expected neither to arm themselves nor memorize every single thing that could possibly pose a threat thats the parents job until they come of age
  anon said the government only has a duty to protect us from others not ourselves    children have no duty to protect themselves so the government has a duty to protect them from anything that might harm them including things the government wouldnt protect adults from    so the response that we should be protected from eg guns but not our own guns doesnt work with children since they cant protect themselves
  bong  deadly animal  cant wait for it to shred your intoxicated cantrotateanimage phone posting face
  hell get acid thrown in his face before the dog can chew it
to solve the pitbull problem ive been crossing pugs with pitbulls crossed with spanish bullfinches   the idea was to either create an animal that would spontaneously gum you adorably and then asphyxiate itself or a loyal guard dog that had its iff stuck on everyone is my friend so that it would violently dribble and intimidate by sniffling  unfortunately hybrid vitality has created a flying musclebound creature with a bugeyed jaw so it can literally detach from the skull and shape perfectly around targets  of course i blame the owner
  its about how the dog is educated
  genocide them they are a breed that threatens humans so should be purged as they clearly arent mentally domesticated enough
  children should be outlawed and breeders euthanized
  black children should be outlawed and breeders euthanized
  naw every type of children  if you havent noticed i want humanity gone they are taking too long to wipe themselves off the map
  i mean we are taking too long to wipe ourselves off the map
  pit bulls cant be equated to things like alcohol or drugs as they are self destructive vices the problem with pitbull is introducing a violent animal into an environment and endangering other people who cant do shit about it it should absolutely be normal for pit bulls to be banned at any level because i dont give a shit about the freedom of some asshole who endangers others as well as himself he can fuck off untill he decides to do meth and hang himself which is fine and should be legal otherwise the breed should be regulated and fuckin domesticated besides that its only measuring fatality by dog bite which is a god damn hard thing to come by injury im sure is at least ten times higher     its almost as if a fighting monster was bred into existence and suddenly we no longer have any power to redact that why not just start working on a breed of dog that is the size of a small gorilla and completely hostile to any form of human interaction make it more dangerous than a tiger is it still domesticated just because it was made from the same genetic base as less dangerous dogs fuck no this shit is retarded and the mongrels need to be put down     i swear to god everyone turns into an ancap as someone says pit bulls are a danger to other people probably the same people on welfare that buy the mongrels
  hahahahahaha good
  there are an estimated 35 million pitbulls in america bro we arent talking about a small sample size
  how about driving then or guns in your world both of these things should be outlawed because they endanger others
  we dont less than 1 of pitbulls attack people
  what percent of dog attacks are done by pits though
  theres strict traffic laws and background checks and licenses required for gun ownership in many places  owning a pitbull is really fucking easy theres no controlling instance if you buy a gun illegally you bet your ass the black market you find is actually a honeypot   if you want to buy a pitbull you just find a breeder across the nearest border theres your doggo    the other thing which is understated and people dont think about it often is that guns and cars are inaminate objects they will strictly only harm someone if operated by a human  a pitbull does not have to be actively operated by a person to end up killing someone this is a pretty big deal when it comes to the whole intent business which is major in law
  to put it in other words   if the gun owner is a great gun owner who does not make any mistakes the gun will never kill someone innocent   if the pitbull owner is a great pitbull owner who does not make any mistakes the pitbull might still get triggered as they were bred for a strong kill drive or if you dont believe in pits snapping might still just straight up have brain problems like any being with a brain might have escape one day and kill someone     thats something people fail to understand yes owners ruin dogs but also dogs are living beings with their own complex neural systems and they will sometimes act on their own volition be it because they were bred that way or because they have mental illnesses    in the same way you dont let people own bears in their backyard because the bear might break out and end up killing someone you shouldnt let people own dogs powerful enough to kill people in their backyards
  btfo
humans created pitbulls humans deserve to get mauled by pitbulls
  most of america does not require any background checks or licenses bro
  pitbull is not a breed  american staffordshire terrier is the breed    how many deaths from a gun vs a knife  both are tools that can be used to kill    this pitbulls are bad dogs mentality is a fuckin disease    pits have large heads and wide jaws meaning their bite by nature is stronger    also they r incredibly persistent ask any owner how long a toy lasts anything longer than 5 min is recordbreaking    moat people who abuse/fight dogs own pits/rotts/etc    memeposting makes u a huge tool anyone can point out a problem why dont u be part of a solution to one by maybe offing yourself

  they are the black people of dogs according to the data the majority of them seem to be violent however there are exceptions to the rule they exist on the end of the normal distribution like the op pic
  background checks  we just making stuff up now
    
  out of 50 states 25 require background checks   you may argue thats not most states youre right its half of them   you however did say this   most of america does not require any background checks or licenses bro  see pic related most of america population wise absolutely does legislation wise its half   in either case youre wrong     run along now faggot but not too fast otherwise your pitbull might snap
  well wrap up the thread you got me pitbulls should be outlawed
  theres a federal law requiring background checks on all sales from licensed dealers
  make provably wrong claims about offtopic thing  get proven wrong   nnice offtopic argument
  no he jus gave away that he lives in new york/ new jersey probably has to renew his breathing license
    this  get out with your private sale bs
    funny because niggers are the race equivalent of pitbulls in crime rate
  you dont need to explain the joke but yes
  lmao
  this but extended to all pets
  crossbreed them out with retrievers that way the resultant dog will still try to maul people just with a very soft gentle mouthing that couldnt crack an egg
smashed
  we all eventually die you cant regulate a natural proccess of selection but you cant diminish it by making the right choices like not driving while drunk or not owning a dominant hunting and attack dog breed if youre an innercity oniongoi or a negroe with cognitive dissonance due to synthetic drugs and rap music also nice reddit spacing faggot go back to r/furfags
  interesting
  funny but sad cause true
you all sound like hysterical middle aged women the sort that are too terrified to venture further then their local church and have 30 year old virgin sons they still pick out clothes for and hold their hands to cross the street
  t jamal  ogga boogs bix nood amiright
  poor little white boy so threatened by the outside world sad
god bless the atf
please look at my dog thanks
  now thats a pibble right there
  you too
  what a wise dog he must have absorbed the souls of many children
  in his past life he bit african slave children
  wrinkles  big ole jowls    this isnt a pit thats some sort of mastiff mix
  nyc  crime infested    where does this meme come from
  shit now the damn pits can use computers
  bix nood intensifies
  yea looks like mastiff bull dog or some shit
  fbi crime stats also im there literally right now and its a shit hole
  lmao
      son im so white im fucking transparent these threads just scream sheltered american kid as if you guys didnt have enough of a reputation for not being able to understand or handle anything to do with the outside world
  u is raysis cuz u never seen a real black person  on the contrary i wasnt racist until i had to live around minorities exposure to them is always the fastest red pill
  dont blame the rest of the world for your shit society also again shows how sheltered you are that youve never had a normal relationship with someone that isnt white and american    this is a specifically american issue here
  dont blame the rest of the world for your shit society   learn to read or quit strawmanning im not blaming the world just the niggers detroit is a prime example of the nigger effect   never had a normal relationship with non white   t degenerate euro race mixer   no surprise there no i dont date non whites and not just on principle theyre gross but ive know plenty of non whites which again is what makes people racist
  why do people think pitbull owners are black minorities tend to hate animals that can attack them and dog owners are overwhelmingly white
nothing based chadbulls wiping out human scum
  because theres 2 kinds of pitt owners the nigger and the white girl with daddy issues who thinks theyre like super cute and stuff and subsequently gets killed
  only 13 of the dog population is responsible for
  the simple fact is that all freedoms cost lives  oh boy sure id like to hear what you have to say about gun control
  pits make up about 13 of dogs yet account for half the attacks  nigs account for 13 of the population yet account for half the crime  nigs favourite pet are pits  dont you see some patterns my dude
